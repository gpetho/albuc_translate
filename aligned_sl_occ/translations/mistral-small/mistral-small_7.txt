"Oh, children, since I have completed this book for you, which is the last in the science of medicine, and its completion is fulfilled within it, and through its expositions and explanations, it is clear to me that I must complete it with this treatise, which is a division of the operation by hand, namely surgery.
"Because the operation by hand has been abandoned in our region and in our time, to the point where its science is greatly diminished, and its traces have disappeared; and nothing remains of it except a few small descriptions in the books of the Ancients, which were altered by most and led astray by those errors and obscurity until their intentions are closed and their power and art are prolonged.
"And it is clear to me that I should revive it with the arrangement of this treatise according to the way of exposition and explanation and abbreviation; and so that it may come with the forms of the cautery tools and other instruments of the work as it is by addition of the explanation, and for its preparation, which is necessary.
"But the reason why a skilled artisan with his hand cannot be found in this our time is that the art of medicine is long and its practitioner must first be trained in the science of anatomy, which includes knowledge of the joints of the members and their shapes, as well as their union and separation; and he should have knowledge of the bones, nerves, and sinews, their number and arrangement; and of the pulsating and non-pulsating veins, and the places where they emerge.
And for that reason, Hippocrates said that a name is nothing but a word, and it is minor in speech, but most important in the art of healing.
But we have already mentioned this at the beginning of this book; for whoever is not knowledgeable in what we have said about anatomy will inevitably fall into error, which will lead to the death of men, as I have seen happen many times, because some are educated in this science but abandon it without knowledge or experience.
For I have seen a foolish and inexperienced doctor cut into an scrofulous abscess on the neck of a woman, and he also cut some arteries of the neck, so that a great deal of blood flowed out until the woman died in his hands.
And I saw another doctor who attempted to remove a stone from a man who had suffered this condition, and the stone was large. When he tried to pull it out, he took with it a piece of the bladder, so that on the third day the man died.
And I myself was called to remove that stone, and I saw that because of the size of the stone and the condition of the patient, I knew for sure that he would die.
And I saw another doctor who received payment of one duc from our land for surgery, and he treated a black castrated man whose thigh was fractured; the ignorant doctor prepared with pillows and cloths tied strongly over the wound, not allowing the wound to breathe.
Then he released him according to his wishes, then bound him again, and left him bandaged for several days and ordered that the bandage be removed; and it happened in this way until the thigh and the foot were suppurated, and he reached destruction.
And I was called to him, and prepared to remove the bandage, and after achieving peace and calm, he admitted to his pain.
But however, the corruption had already set in the limb, so it could not be restrained, and the corruption did not cease to spread throughout the limb until the patient was endangered.
And I saw another doctor who punctured a cancerous abscess, and it became ulcerated after a few days, until the evil within him was magnified.
This is because the black cautery is pure of melancholic humor, so it should not be applied with all iron, but only to the part that has suffered, and let the rest remain free from it.
And for this reason, my sons, it is necessary that the operation with the hand be planned in two ways: one is an operation associated with health, and the other is work with which there is danger in the greatest disposition.
And I have already addressed this in every place of this book where an operation is performed with error and fear; therefore it is necessary for you to guard against this and leave it, so that the pages do not find a way to speak and dishonor you.
Therefore, take up your weapons with diligence and under the protection of God, and your patients with happiness and resoluteness.
And use the best way through the grace of God to obtain health and praiseworthy success, and leave behind terrible diseases that are difficult to heal, and keep your weapons away from what makes you fearful, so that confidence in your faith and in your name does not fail you; for it is more fitting to your glory, both now in this world and later to your sanctity.
Galen has already discussed this in some of his lectures: "Do not treat evil patients, lest you be called evil doctors.
And I have already divided this book into three chapters.
Here begins the division of the book, and first of the first part. The first chapter is ordered about the head and the forms of instruments and the iron points of the cauteries, and what is necessary for the operation.
The division of the second part. The second chapter is about incisions and perforations, and cups (ventouses), and wounds, and the extraction of arrows and similar things; all are arranged and ordered according to the forms of the instruments.
The third chapter is about restoration and dislocation, and the treatment of twists and similar things; this chapter is ordered concerning the head from top to bottom, and the forms of the instruments.
I wish to speak about the qualities of the assistants for this cauterization and their drawbacks, and in which circumstances cautery should be avoided.
Therefore, I say that the discourse on the quality of the assistant for cauterization and their drawbacks is a long and complex discourse, subtle in its knowledge and hidden in secrecy; and many wise men have spoken about it, and they have disagreed among themselves, and for me it suffices to touch upon some of their discourses, lest this become too lengthy. ︎
And so I say that you should apply cautery universally to any and all ailments, whether they have material substance or not, except for two ailments which are immaterial conditions.
For the dry and material condition, it is best to refrain from using cautery; because some say that cautery is beneficial for such a condition, while others argue against it, claiming that cautery is not suitable for an illness caused by heat and dryness, as the nature of fire is hot and dry. Therefore, it is appropriate to treat a hot and dry illness with cold and moist treatment.
And I disagree with those who say the opposite, that cautery is beneficial for all hot and dry illnesses found in human bodies. For when you compare the human body and its humidity to the condition of fire, you will find the human body cold.
And I say by the reasoning above that experience has already revealed this to me several times.
However, it is not necessary to go over what has already been thoroughly examined and practiced in the chapter on cautery by previous experience. One who knows the diversity of human conditions, the nature of illnesses within them, their causes, symptoms, and duration can understand this.
In the other conditions, do not be afraid, especially in cases of moist and cold diseases, for all doctors have agreed on this matter, and there is no disagreement about using cautery in these cases.
And know, children, that the secret of treatment by fire cautery and its goodness have been proven by using medicinal cautery, for fire is simple and its action only affects the member on which it is applied and does not harm the other members connected to it except slightly.
But the action of medicinal cautery reaches those members from which it is distant, and it quickly brings healing to the difficult-to-cure diseased member and quickly heals it.
But the fire, due to its superiority and the goodness of its substance, does only this: it causes superfluous [things] to leave. And we know this by experience and by the long service of studying the art about the truth of the causes; and for this reason I am excused from the length of the speech. And if it were not that it is not read in my book, here I would have hidden a secret with fire, and the quality of its operation in the bodies and its expulsion by which it expels diseases, demonstrated philosophically, which would be sharpened in your minds.
And know, children, that they disagree about the time in which it is suitable to perform cautery, and they consider springtime to be the best time for this.
And I say that cautery is suitable at all times, because the damage caused by accidental timing is overcome by the benefit of what can be achieved with cautery, and especially if the cautery is for painful or necessary pains, strong inflammations, and fistulas, which do not tolerate delay, lest something worse happens.
This does not matter in your opinion, or, children, only the common people and foolish doctors think this way, since with that illness which is healed by cautery there is always a recurrence, and they consider that consequence.
And the cause is not at all as they think because of this, since cautery is only used in places where medicine cannot reach and it dries up the humors which are the cause of the pain.
But nevertheless, cautery surpasses medicine in terms of swiftness and effectiveness of its operation and the great skill of its practitioner.
And it is possible that the illness may return at some point in time, depending on the patient's constitution, the location of the illness, and the practitioner's skill, as well as what has been prepared in the patient's body regarding an accumulation of superfluidities, and what has been received by the patient through his diet and similar causes. However, if the illness for which cautery is administered is a subtle illness with few superfluities and humors, such as cautery for toothache and similar cases, it is possible that the pain may not return in that area. But this is done only in small areas.
And it is commonly said that cautery is the last resort of medicine, and this statement is true, for I do not consider anything else to be effective with medicine or any other cause before cautery.
And the reason is contrary to that; and the intention that cautery is the last resort of medicine is only when the methods of treatment in certain diseases are administered, and those medicines do not succeed, and then at the end of the cause one administers cautery, and it proves effective for that. Therefore, from this we understand that cautery is the last resort of medicine, not according to the intention which I believe the common people and many foolish doctors hold.
And the ancients said that cautery with gold is better than cautery with iron, and they did not say this except for the similarity of gold and the sublimity of its substance.
They said that the site of cautery does not produce a scar, although this is not absolutely true, because I have seen and found that it does so only in certain bodies without others, and cautery with gold is good and better than with iron as they said; however, when you make cautery with fire and with gold, it is not declared to you, for it ignites according to the quantity that you want by the friction of the gold, and because it prepares to receive a blow; and if you place the fire on it, the gold melts from the heat, and some leaves fall into the fire due to the artifice of that.
And for this, cautery with an iron must be done very gently and precisely in order to perform the operation correctly.
And I have already arranged this chapter on cautery according to the chapters, and I have arranged those from the head to the feet, so that I may clearly show the questioner what he wants.
The first chapter.
This cauterization is used for cold and dampness, which are the causes of many diseases, such as headaches, excessive sweating, known as profuse sweating from the head to the temples and behind the ears, dizziness, toothache, sore throat, and generally all illnesses caused by cold, including paralysis, swelling, stroke, and similar conditions in those diseases.
The method of this cauterization is as follows: first, instruct the patient to use a purgative medicine to cleanse the head for three or four nights, according to the strength of the patient, their age, and their habit.
And then instruct them to shave their head with a razor, and then make that person sit between your hands on a low bench, and let them place their hands on their feet.
And now, place the palm of your hand near the bridge of his nose between his eyebrows. But once your hand has reached the middle of his forehead, mark that spot with a stylus, and then ignite the cautery olive, which looks like this:
And then place it on the marked spot, in such a way that it descends, with your hand holding it tightly and turning it slowly.
And then slightly lift your hand and look at the spot, and if you see any part of the bone exposed, even as small as a grain of wheat, then lift your hand. If not, place your hand back with that iron, or another one, if it has become cold, until you see what I have told you.
And then take a little salt and dissolve it on the spot and let it sit for three days.
And then place a soaked cloth on him, and leave it there until the scar of the burn is destroyed. And then treat the spot with Tetrapharmakon ointment until it is healed.
And they also say that as long as the wound remains open, the better it is for the arm, because it is better and more beneficial.
And some of them said that the cord should be cauterized to the bone, and the cautery should be held until a part of the bone's appearance changes.
And then it should be scraped away what is attached to the bone, and then it should be treated.
And others said that with the cautery it should reach to the depth, until it presses strongly on the bone, until the bone gives way, and this is the method of making a small incision. And they believed that from that place the vapors of the head are expelled.
And the wound should be kept open for a long time, and then it should be treated until it is healed.
But in my experience, I have not seen these two types of cautery done at all, except in some men out of fear; and if that is the case, it is better with health as it is, because the head is weakened by the loss of continuity, just as we have testified in other members, and especially when the patient's head is of a weak nature.
And the first type of cautery is safer and better in my opinion; and with that, one avoids and works for health.
Chapter Two
"About the cautery of the head.
"When the whole head suffers from chronic and prolonged pain in the patient, and uses of garlands, combs, head-purges, plasters, bandages, hairnets, girdles, and similar remedies have been attempted, especially if it has already been cauterized with a cautery that is not suitable or does not benefit the patient, then consider whether the patient's head is of strong constitution by nature; and if it is not fragile and finds great coldness, then cauterize that part with another cautery, leaving that one aside for a while. "Then cauterize that [part of the head] with a cautery until the sinew is divided. "After cutting the sinew and exposing the bone to the extent we have described, cauterize that [part] with a cautery at the back of the head in the place called 'vas' – and this is the location where cupping is done. "And be careful in this, and do not expose the bone, for the patient will find a very different pain from the pain of all other head cauteries.
"And I say this because the cautery that is used for the horns of the head and the occiput should be finer than the one used for the middle part of the head; and this is its form.
Capítulo tercero. (Chapter three)
About the cauterization of new migraines.
When pain occurs at the top of the head or when the pain extends to the eyes, evacuate with cleansing medications and administer other treatments as I have mentioned in the discussions on illnesses; if that does not help, then cauterization is performed in two ways: either by cauterizing with a sharp burning medicine or with iron.
However, cauterizing with a burning medicine is done by taking a piece of wool, scraping it and tying off the ends from both sides. Then immediately cut the painful area on the temple with a sharp needle until it is deeply buried under the skin, so that it remains hidden.
Then press on it with a bandage to stop the bleeding and leave it for three hours; then remove it and pull out the wool, and let the wound remain open for two or three days, and then place a cloth soaked in wine vinegar over it until the area heals.
Then continue treating it with ointment until it is healed.
And if you wish, do this with some burning medicines which I have written about in the twelfth treatise on burning medicines.
And for the cauterization with iron according to this method, use fire for the cautery of which this is the form:
and it is called a nailhead, because its tip is shaped like the head of a nail, which has some curvature, and in the middle of it there is a small prominence.
Then place it over the area of pain and hold your hand steady so that the iron is not shaken and rotate the iron little by little with speed.
And if the quantity that is shaken by the speed of the cord is such that most of it is shaken, lift your hand to ensure that the iron below is not shaken so that there is no flow of blood.
Then soak a cloth in salt water and place it over the area, leaving it there for three days; then place a clean cloth with an edge, and then treat with ointment until it is healed.
And if you want to, cauterize with the tip of the knife according to this method, and be careful not to cut an artery in this particular newness.
Chapter Four.
On the cauterization of old migraine.
When you are treating migraines with the water we mentioned in the previous treatment, and as stated in the divisions of illnesses, if the treatment is not effective and sometimes due to the severity of the illness, the first cautery with medicine or fire does not suffice, then it is necessary for you to heat the surgical knife until it is white-hot. This signifies on the painful area with a line as long as your little finger; and pause your hand for one moment and press it until you reach the vein and penetrate into the bone.
However, it is necessary for you to be cautious about the continuation of the jawbone, which is greatly affected by chewing, and that the muscle connected to it is not damaged and the nerve connected to it does not cause pain, and that a spasm does not occur.
And if it concerns the caution and care of blood flow from the artery that is cut, for in its cutting there is danger, and especially to those who do not know what they are doing and are not skilled or experienced; leave the operation at this point.
And I come to remind you of the regulation of blood flow from the vein according to its method, in its place within this book.
And if from this illness the patient does not benefit from this cautery and you see that the patient's body is able to tolerate it, then cauterize them in the middle of the head as we have described, and treat the wound until it is healed.
And if you see, administer the cautery that we mentioned in the chapter on archery with cautery having two blades, and this is a better and more beneficial cauterization.
Chapter 5
On the Cauterization of Earache.
When there is pain in the ear due to cold and it is treated with laxatives and other treatments that I have mentioned earlier, but the pain does not go away, then apply heat to the cautery. This type of cautery is called "punctum," and its form is as follows:
And then pierce near the heat source, and guide it around the entire ear like a wheel that is turning, or around each part of the ear if the pain is in a specific part. Approach with the cautery from behind the ear, little by little, until you feel the spot with your finger.
And if the cautery of those points is done on the entire ear and it heals, then also treat the spots until they are healed.
Chapter 6
On the Cautery of Torture
Torture that is healed and cauterized is not only due to the species that come from phlegm, as we have said in the divisions of diseases.
Avoid cauterization of the species that cause dryness or nerve spasm.
When you treat that species of torture with jars and purgatives and gargles, and your treatment does not succeed, then it is necessary for you to cauterize the patient with three cauteries: one at the root of the ear, the second a little below its temple, and the third at the junction of two lips.
And place your cautery in opposition to the afflicted area, for softening occurs only in the region that appears healthy.
And the way to perform the cautery is to cauterize it with a cautery at the right end of the ear, slightly above the horn of the head, and another on the temple, whose length should be according to the length of the little finger, and hold your hand with the cautery until the amount of half the thread is burned.
And this is the form of the cautery, which is a species of the knife, the shape of which is before you (or the table). But however, it is more delicate than that one a little bit like bladders; and it is necessary that the blade in it lacks some of its excess thickness.
Then care for the area with water that has been processed ahead of time until it is healed.
Chapter VII.
On the Cauterization of Old Apoplexy.
When apoplexy is old and you treat it with the water we have mentioned and the patient does not have a fever, then cauterize them with four cauteries: on all the corners of their head; and with a cautery in the middle of the head, as we have said; and with a cautery in the nape. And the manner of the cautery is made according to what has been said above.
And it has already been cauterized on the mouth of the stomach; and it is even more urgent; and then it should be treated with processed water.
Chapter VIII
On the Cauterization of Forgetfulness caused by a Flame.
It is necessary that large cups and purifying pills be given to the patient at the beginning.
And next, shave the entire head of the patient and place on his temples the plaster made from wax as described in the treatise on plasters.
And repeat this several times, for that is the manner of cauterization. And do so according to the order of that doctor which I have already mentioned.
And so if by these means the patient is cured, good; and if not, then make three cauteries on the lower part of his head, which should descend from the highest part of the head to the lowest part of the neck. And place the thickness of a finger between each cautery, and then cure the cautery with the aforementioned water.
But if the patient has an addition (of a limb or other body part), and is tolerating it well, then make a cautery in the middle of that addition; and if the addition is larger, then make the cautery on both sides of the horns (or corners) of the addition.
Then cure it until it is healed; and let the scabs be olive-colored, as described earlier.
Chapter IX
Of the Cauterization of Paralysis and the Softening of the Entire Body
Then proceed in the cleansing of the head with jars and the aforementioned water; and next, shave the head of the patient, and then cauterize it with cauteries in the middle of the head, and with cauteries on all the corners of the head, and with cauteries on the lower part of it, and with three cauteries on the vertebrae of the neck.
And if it is necessary in the illness of softening of the body due to excess humors and the patient tolerates it and the illness is strong, then burn with four cauteries on the vertebrae of the back, and continuously with a cautery until the fluid runs out from under them, and raise your hand. And care for him until he is healed, and this should be cauterized well.
Chapter 10
On the Cautery of Epilepsy
Do not cauterize an epileptic unless the epilepsy is due to phlegm.
Therefore, it is necessary to purge the brain at the beginning with years and with the other cure that we have said in the division when the illness is great and tolerates the exception of medicines.
And if it is a child who does not tolerate medicines, then administer gargles and chewables that purge, doing this for several days with the improvement of food.
And then shave the head of the patient, and then cauterize him with one cautery in the middle of the head according to the aforementioned manner, and with another cautery on his occiput, and over each corner of the head, cauterize. And if the patient is strong and tolerant, then apply cautery with pointed tools as mentioned before, ensuring that there is a state of relaxation and softness in the body on the vertebrae of the neck and the vertebrae of the back.
And then proceed with the olive-oil cautery as previously described.
However, if the patient is a child, then apply a subtle cautery in this manner.
Chapter XI
On Cauterizing Melancholy
When the causes of melancholy are corrupt humidity and thick phlegm, then apply cautery with the pointed tools we have mentioned, ensuring there is paralysis present.
And if the cause of melancholy is an excess that inclines towards melancholy, and the patient's body is moist, then give them water to drink that purifies their brain as described earlier in the division.
Then shave the patient's head, and make a decently-sized tonure from the hair, and place it in the middle of their head.
And let the patient be seated and held on all sides.
Then apply a liniment; and it is most appropriate to use old sheep's wool for this purpose. And warm that one over a controlled fire, with measured heat, which he will bear when it is applied to him. And place that one in the middle of his head within the circle, and let it enter until he is numbed.
And do this with the patient once a week, along with his other treatment, until he is healed; or if you prefer, cauterize that area making small points according to his size, unless you have the hand with a cautery arranged in this way: this is the type of cautery that moistens the brain evenly.
And then place that area covered in cloth or gauze.
Chapter XII
On the cauterization of water descending into the eye.
When it has been determined that the onset of water in the eye is due to the signs mentioned in the division, then begin and give the patient something to drink that cleanses his head, and keep him away from all humidity.
And have him take baths in warm water for several days.
And then instruct him to shave his head, and cauterize that area with a cautery in the middle of his head; and then cauterize with two cauteries on both temples if the origin of the water is in both eyes, or on one side if it is in one eye.
In this context, "incideys" is likely a form of the verb "to incise," meaning to make an incision or cut. "Am" could be short for "ad" or "apud," which means "at" or "near." "Cauteri" refers to the cautery instrument used for burning or cutting. "Totas las venas e arcerias" translates to "all the veins and arteries." "Dejos la codena" means "below the collarbone," referring to the area of the body below the clavicle. "E sian les cauteris en aquela lonh en la latitut de las templas" suggests that the incisions should be made far away, specifically in the region of the temples.
And beware of blood flow when cauterized; and if you see blood flow from him, stop it with some medicine that is available to you.
And I will come with wisdom concerning the extraction of arrows and the removal of those, and caution against blood flow.
And sometimes it is cauterized in the neck between two bones with two well-made cauteries.
Chapter XIII.
On Cauterizing Old Tears.
When tears from the eyes are old and habitual, and through the veins and arteries that are evident on the surface of the head, it is confirmed to be superfluous coldness, then cauterize with the cautery mentioned at the beginning of water falling in the eyes, and with a cautery in the middle of the head, and two cauteries in the neck between the two temples, and two cauteries in the neck between the two bones. And if you need to add [more treatment], then cauterize the entire side of the eye towards the end of the eyebrow with a small cautery.
Chapter XIV.
On Cauterizing Nasal Bad Odor.
Sure, here's the translation for the given sentence: "And then cauterize that area with a pointed iron, using two cauteries on both eyebrows, just below the hairline.
"And be careful with the archery so as not to burn that area.
"And this is the shape of the pointed iron.
"Chapter XV
"On the application of a hot cautery to the eyelids for softening them.
"When the eyelid of the eye is softened by illness or moisture, then cauterize that eyelid with a lunar-shaped iron. And this is its form:
"And if you wish to cauterize that area on both eyebrows a little, use two cauteries in all parts and make them long from the temples. "And let the length of each cautery be according to the amount of eyebrow.
"And do not press too hard with your hand on the cauteries, but according to the amount that one-third of the eyelid is burned.
"Chapter XVI
"On the application of a hot cautery to the eyelid when the hairs are turned inward and push the eye.
"When the hairs of the eye are turned inward so that they poke the eye, cautery is done on them in two ways: either by burning or with a burning medicine.
If you have a pointed cautery for him with fire, instruct the patient before this that he should shave his hair as those who shave it; until they are prolonged and smoothed; and if you must use that [cautery], then strengthen his fingers with a bandage so that he is not disturbed until the hairs are born.
When they are born and baptized, then place the head of the patient in your lap, and immediately seal their eyelids with a sign, using a sign that resembles the shape of a maple leaf, and let the beginning of the sign be near the eyebrows.
And immediately apply a poultice soaked in egg white or a paste of lentils on the eye.
And quickly ignite the cautery, which looks like this.
And immediately cauterize on the figure that you have marked, little by little, in small patches, until the surface of the skin that looks like a maple leaf is completely burned.
And the sign of the healthiness of your work is that you see the eyelid of the eye already contracted and the hairs around it raised up from the point of the eye.
And so lift your hand and leave it for three days, and immediately apply another poultice with a border until the scar is healed. And immediately treat it with ointment until it is healed.
But if the hairs return for some reason and the eyelid is softened, then do the cautery again in the same way as you did before.
But if the eyelashes are in the eyelid, then cauterize that area until it is raised to its natural position and is healed, and so that the eyelashes do not touch the eye.
But use the cautery with medicine to burn this as you instruct the patient to pluck out the eyelashes until they are long and healed, and then make a patch of cloth in the shape of a myrtle leaf.
And then take some well-known soap and about one egg yolk, or if you don't have that, mix these substances together well, and make it quickly so that it does not become cold; and then spread some of this water on the patch made in this way like a myrtle leaf, and place it over one eye or both; and put under the eye a cloth dipped in egg white, and let the patient's head be in your lap.
Place the said patch on the medicine and press it gently, without removing it until the patient feels the sting of the medicine, because this sting is like fire in them.
And so when they perceive that they have felt the sting, then remove the medicine and leave it with your finger; when the sting ceases, then replace the medicine and wash the eye with water; and then consider if you see the eyelid is raised as it should be, you can remove the bandage made of fire or incision, because then it will be well; and if not, return the medicine to the place where the medicine was not applied and do not remove it until your operation is healed and the eye contracts.
And immediately place your hand on the swollen area until the edema of the fluid is eliminated, and then treat it with a definitive ointment or another until it heals.
And it is necessary for you to perform your operation with vigilant diligence to ensure that no debris from the medicine falls into the eye. If after several days the eyelid becomes soft and there is some cause of discomfort, then apply the medicine again on that softened part of the eyelid, as you did at the beginning, and keep doing this until it heals.
And this is how the myrtle leaf looks like.
And know that men's eyes are varied according to size and smallness, and therefore your treatment should be made accordingly.
And do not hide the path of truth from those who study this art.
Chapter XVII
On the Cauterization of a Fistula that is in the Lacrimal Duct of the Eye.
When you treat a fistula with the method mentioned in the divisions of diseases and your treatment does not work, then it is necessary to cauterize it according to this manner: command the patient to place their head on your shoulder, and have another person hold the patient's head between your hands in such a way that it is not moved or agitated with the patient's head.
And then place a cotton cloth soaked in egg whites or in pigeon droppings over his mouth.
And then ignite the cautery, of which this is the shape:
which should be concave, as is the form of a reed or vulture's feather, with one end used to make the cautery.
And if you wish, it should be penetrating into the other end. And if you want, it can be made like a tentacle.
However, that which is concave is better for the intended purpose.
And then press the fistula if it is open, and draw out of it pus and dry it up. And if it is not open, then open it and extract the pus from it.
And then place the cautery, which should be well-ignited, over it and with that intended hand a little away from the cautery towards the mouth, so that your hand does not burn or disturb the patient, and then place the cautery on the corners of the mouth and cauterize it. 🔥😷
So if at the beginning of your cauterization you reach the bone, that's good; and if not, then repeat the cauterization once or twice, if necessary; and leave it like that for three days, and then place a cotton cloth with border around it and cover it with drying ointment until it is healed. 😷🧪
If 10 days have passed and the patient is not healed, then place on them a sharp, corrosive medicine until the bone is exposed and scraped according to what is suitable in their chapter.
And there is another method of cauterizing a fistula that some earlier people mentioned: first apply to the location of the fistula and open it up, then place in that opening a thin string whose shape matches its own; and put in it an amount equivalent to one ounce of melted lead; and take your hand with the thread with good retention, and do not disturb the patient so that the melted lead does not reach the bottom of that; and it is necessary to place on the bottom of the patient's fistula cotton soaked in egg white or water, because the lead heals the location of the fistula and heals it by a wonderful healing.
And if the fistula is healed with what we have said about cauterization and treatment, it is good; but if not, then it is necessary to administer a tracheotomy through the nose and reduce the fistula to the inside of the nose according to its proper location.
Chapter XVIII.
On Cauterization of the Fissure of the Buttocks.
Frequent cracks occur in the lips, especially in children's lips.
Therefore, when you treat those cracks with the water that we mentioned in the divisions and it does not improve your treatment, then burn them with a small pointed cautery like this:
And let the cavity of it be according to the delicacy of the needle.
Then carefully place this (cautery) in those cracks until it reaches the bottom of the cracks.
And then treat that with plasters until it is healed.
Chapter XIX
On the cauterization of a fistula in the mouth.
When in the root of the uvula or on the palate or in the roots of the teeth an abscess develops and then breaks open, and is drained, and heals improperly, creating a fistula, and you treat it and the treatment does not improve, then you must heat a cautery according to the size that fits into the fistula, and insert the heated end into the hole of the fistula, and with your hand guide it until the hot iron reaches its bottom; and at the end do this once or twice; and then treat it with the water we mentioned for the treatment until it is healed.
This translation could be interpreted as: "And so if the wound is cut and healed, it is good; and if not, then it is necessary to uncover the place and extract the rotten bones according to what will follow in its chapter.
Chapter XX
"About the cautery of teeth and the softening of veins.
"When the veins are softened by moisture and the teeth are decayed, and you treat them with medicines but they do not improve, then place the head of the patient on your lap. Quickly ignite the cautery in the shape that will be described next, so that you can place the little tube over the tooth and quickly insert the hot cautery into it, holding your hand a little under so that the patient feels the heat of the fire at the root of the tooth.
"And then lift your hand, and then apply the cautery several times according to what you want.
"And then the patient rinses his mouth with salt water and holds it for an hour, and then stops. For the decayed tooth is secured and the softened gum is strengthened and the corrupting moisture is dried up.
Here is the translation of "Capitol .xxi." into English:
"About cauterizing tooth pain.
"When tooth pain is caused by cold, or if there is a sore or worm in it and you do not heal it with medicine, then cauterize that area in two ways: either cauterize with the edge of a cow's hoof, or cauterize with fire.
"Cauterize with the edge by taking the edge of a cow's hoof and burning it in the fire until it is hot, then take cotton and wrap it around the end of the tooth, and immediately immerse that in the heated edge, and place it on the painful tooth quickly until it is cauterized.
"And then repeat this process several times until the power of the fire reaches the root of the tooth.
"And if you wish, dip wool or cotton in the aforementioned edge, and place it on the painful tooth, and then place red-hot iron on top of it until the iron reaches the pulp of the tooth.
"However, cauterization with fire requires that you pay attention to the tip of iron or steel, ensuring it is somewhat blunt so that the heat of the fire does not reach the mouth of the patient.
And then ignite the cautery in the shape that it will come, and place it on the tooth and hold your hand until the cautery is heated; do this several times because the pain will be reduced either on that day or the next day.
It is necessary that by pressing that cautery, the patient fills his mouth with good broth and holds it for an hour, and then spits it out; and this is the shape of the cautery.
And cauterize with whatever extreme you wish according to what is possible for you.
And this is the shape of the cannula:
Chapter XXII.
On the Cauterization of Extrusions.
When extrusions are of phlegm and cold humors, and are not responsive to digestion by medicines, and you wish to promote their slight digestion, then ignite the cautery, whose shape is as follows: it has two openings, one for emitting smoke from the other end of the cautery. Place this heated cautery on the swelling once, or twice if necessary, until it reaches the depth of the swelling.
And if the swelling is small, then place the cautery according to the size of the swelling, and let it remain for three days, and place a compress on it soaked in broth until what the fire has burned off is reduced.
And then care for him with ointments, poultices, and cloths until he is healed.
Chapter 23.
On cauterizing a raw throat and constriction of the throat.
When moisture comes over the channel of the lung, and especially when it is with coldness of pleurisy, then the patient should be evacuated at first with laxative medicines, and afterwards you must cauterize him in the root of the throat in the depressed place.
And beware that you do not penetrate with the cautery into the throat nor burn too much of its skin, but only a little.
And then cauterize him with another cautery at the joint of the neck on his last vertebra. And the cautery should be nailed in the same manner as previously mentioned.
Then care for him with the aforementioned water until he is healed.
Chapter 24.
On cauterizing lung disease and cough.
When cough and lung disease are due to cold moisture and the patient does not have fever or consumption, and it is an old illness, then you should cauterize him with two cauteries on the furcula in the depressed places, the lion and the cow; and with another cautery in the middle of the foot between two nipples; and let the cauteries be nailed according to the aforementioned form.
And if you wish, let your cautery point be done with the pointed instrument called "punctum," whose form precedes in the cauterization of ear pain.
And make points into these; and then treat it with the water that has been prescribed until it is healed.
And know that the cautery has three ramps because the cauterization is done with it; in one sitting, you can make three cauteries according to this form.
Chapter 25.
On the cauterization of the little finger, which is also called the "cap del ajutori".
When the little finger is dislocated due to slippery moisture and does not stay in place upon returning, you should reduce its dislocation until it returns to normal. Then, by means of a slight movement, it can be relocated as needed. As we have found, this should be done first; afterwards, the patient should be turned over onto their back or side. Then, lift the bone which is in the inner part of the little finger with your left hand to the upper parts if the joint is dislocated upwards.
And now heat the cautery, which has two points; and this is its form:
And then burn the cord until it penetrates into the other side; and there will be the shape of a burned mark, as if made by four burning irons.
And sometimes it fits according to this count, and because there are eight cautery irons.
Then cover the cautery point with salt paste, and then make the patient rest quietly, and the member should not be moved for any time until it is healed.
And if the dislocation is in the upper parts and this is done later, then burn over the muscle with a hot iron or several pointed irons, because the joint will be strengthened and the moisture will be dried out, and the patient will be cured.
Chapter 26
Of Cauterization of the Stomach
When the stomach is afflicted with cold and excessive moisture to the point that it exits from its confines, and many ulcers have formed within it, and if you continue the methods of care without benefit, then the patient must lie on their back, extend their hands and feet, and then burn in that area with three irons: one iron below the foot for the width of a finger with a pointed iron, and two irons below each side of the spine of the iron, so that it forms a triangular shape; and ensure that those which are not adjusted will cause blistering.
And if the depth of the cautery is equal to two-thirds of the thickness of the tendon.
And let the shape of the cautery be according to this form without addition. And if you wish, cauterize with a large cautery in the middle of the stomach according to this form; and let this be a cautery in the form of a circle according to this form:
And let the stomach be cauterized by pricking at that place which is frightened by this cautery: and it is that you know on the stomach, point according to the quantity that you wish with a probe, and then cauterize that with a cautery in the points; and then treat that with the preceding treatment until it is healed.
Chapter 27.
On the cauterization of cold feet.
When pain occurs in the feet due to coldness or humidity or excessive windiness until its normal consistency is disrupted by excessive evacuation, and the patient is treated with the water we have mentioned and not given food, then it is necessary that the patient be placed on their back, and feel with a probe three cauteries of this form and quantity, placing them under the feet near the hypochondrium, where the supine position of a man is.
And let there be a space between each cautery according to the thickness of the finger, and let the cauteries be according to the length of the body straight.
And do not press your hand too much with the cauteries.
And if the amount of water that is held matches the amount of half the length of a cord, and it is not adjusted; and if the patient is standing on their feet; and if they are not standing, then let them sit down, who has already spread out their thighs, and raised their arms.
And it is possible for you to cauterize these cauteries with a pointed knife, when you have the skill and prudence in the art.
And be careful not to proceed too much with the cauterization, and let the length of the entire cord be held so that it can encompass the whole body and reach into the intestines, for the cord is thin here; and know this.
Chapter .28
Of the Perforation of a Foot Aposteme with a Cautery.
When an abscess or aposteme appears on the foot and you want to know if that aposteme is in the flesh of the foot or in its tunic, then if it is in the flesh of the foot, the patient will experience heaviness and pain without acuteness.
And if it is in the tunic of the lung, with great and sometimes painful sharpness, exhausting even the most experienced physicians' care for him.
Therefore, it is necessary that the patient be placed on his side; and then mark the location of the abscess with a knife; and then heat the cautery which resembles a needle, whose shape has been described on the previous page. And cauterize with that and the cautery until all the pus is burned away, until it reaches the base, until healthy flesh appears.
Then treat this wound like other abscesses until it heals.
And it is not necessary to use this method of cautery except for that which has been taught in the art of medicine and which most physicians know; but this one has been tried on some patients, nevertheless leave that to us, and it is better.
Chapter XXIX
On Cauterizing Plague Sores
The ancient physicians said that cautery of plague sores should be done in this manner: you should take a dry long needle from the roots of aristolochia, which is pointed and found at the end, and it should be as thick as a finger.
Here's a line-by-line translation of the given text:
And it is not necessary that you grasp the cautery with your hand, but rather it should be held in the open part of the chain in action.
And some of the ancients used to say that there are certain men who use a cautery made of iron similar to a ray and ignite it, placing it in the area between the ribs until they reach the abscess with it and expel the pus, as we have said about the foot abscess.
But in this perforation with a cautery, there is fear, because one can die immediately if it happens at the location of an unhealed fistula.
Chapter 30.
On the cauterization of the spleen.
When you treat the spleen ailment with the treatment we have mentioned in the division and your treatment does not help, then cauterize it in three ways, all of which are correct, one of which is that you make three or four cauteries along the length of the spleen according to the figure of the foot's cauteries, the shape of which has been previously discussed.
And there should be a space the width of a finger or slightly more between each cautery, and the manner of cauterization should be the same as we have said for the foot's cauteries.
And do not press your hand with the cautery; and let the patient be face up on their back.
And another way to cauterize is to heat the cautery with two openings, as mentioned in the chapter on dislocation of the muscle, and raise the chain that is at the back, towards the left side of the patient's bed.
And let your elevation with which you raise the chain be according to the length of the body, so that cauteries are made according to the width of the body.
Then promptly insert the two openings, heated well, into that opening where you will pass the chain through from the other side.
And then remove the cautery; and thus four cauteries have been made.
And if you wish, cauterize with a cautery having three openings.
And then you care for the cautery, since it has been left to throw fire for too many days, because it is more convenient than the other previous causes in the treatment.
Chapter 31
On Cauterizing Hydrocephalics
Do not make cauteries in hydrocephalics except specifically in the bladder.
When you treat the dropsical with the methods of treatment that we have mentioned in the division and your treatment does not match up, then it is necessary for them to be cauterized with four cauteries around the navel and one cautery on the stomach, and another cautery on the spleen, and another cautery on the liver, and two cauteries between the vertebrae of the back, and one cautery on the right foot, and another cautery on the stomach. And the depth of the cautery should be appropriate to the thickness of the cord.
And then leave the cautery open so that it may seep for a long time.
And do not evacuate the patient of treatment near the cautery with water that is necessary so that two intentions are added to him, and it will be quickly healed with the help of health.
The shape of the cautery with which the abdomen is cauterized should be pointed according to what was said above, and it should be oval in shape for those who are cauterized on the back as stated previously.
Chapter .xxxii.
On the cautery of the feet and the hips.
When the feet are swollen with dropsy and filled with water, you should cauterize the feet on the back of the foot, specifically in the area between the little finger (auricular) and the ring finger (anular). Raise your hand with the cautery and do not twist it; then raise your hand further without completely withdrawing it, because the dropsy water will surge.
It is the cautery in this manner: And then make two cauteries on each side, and on each side, make a cautery with the point of a scalpel-like cautery. And the cautery should be according to the length of the side: one above the ankle and the other in the middle part of the side; and on each side, two cauteries.
And leave the wound open without dressing for a long time so that any water may surge from it.
And then treat with those causes which we have mentioned.
Chapter XXXIII.
On the cauterization of the abdomen.
When the abdomen is affected by cold and moisture to such an extent that it weakens the powers, which are the digestive and retentive powers located in the stomach and intestines, it is treated with various methods of treatment and regimens. Sometimes the patient may suffer from cauterization due to a disturbance of these powers. In such cases, cauterize them with a large cautery on their stomach, as has been mentioned earlier in the cauterization of the stomach, with a circular cautery and four subtle cauteries around the navel, with a subtle nail-like cautery; and with a cautery on the umbilicus, either one large or two.
Here's my attempt to translate the given sentence:
**Capítulo xxxiv.**
Sobre la cauterización de hemorroides crónicas.
Cuando las hemorroides crónicas son causadas por fríos humores gruesos o humedades corrompidas, y no se curan con el tratamiento descrito anteriormente, entonces cauteriza con tres cauterios en el pus debajo de la espina del hueso sacro, pequeño y triangular; y un cautery encima del ombligo, que cae por dos dedos.
Y si sospechas que el estómago del paciente está enfriado y su comida no digerida, y su cara pálida, entonces cauteriza con un gran cautery sobre el estómago como se describe anteriormente; y un cautery sobre la espalda, y otro cautery sobre el bazo del paciente con un cautery agudo. Deja los cauteries abiertos durante algún tiempo y luego cuida al paciente hasta que se recupere.
**Capítulo xxxv.**
Sobre la cauterización del absceso cerca de su orificio.
Cuando abres un absceso, entonces calienta el cautery que se parece a un rayo. Based on the given translation style and context, here's my attempt to translate the sentence:
And do this once or twice, for if the hemorrhoids are too many, then cauterize each of them as we have mentioned, and afterwards treat them with that which you find suitable from the ointments until they are healed.
And if you cauterize with a large cautery on any part of the body, it is more helpful afterwards.
Chapter .xxxvi
On the cauterization of fistulas that occur naturally in the parts of the body.
When nature does not comply with the work that we have recommended in its place, and the patient is frightened by this, let him be healed with a cautery.
Therefore, when someone has a fistula that occurs naturally afterwards and it is old, it exudes pus and corrupt humors from them. Hence what is more appropriate is to probe it with a fine probe, and then determine the depth of it with the aforementioned probe.
Then heat the cautery that resembles a reed. And then place this heated cautery into this fistula, according to the depth at which you inserted the probe.
And repeat with the cautery on that area until the corrupt flesh is burned, either once or twice or three times, depending on your need.
And beware of the burning of nerves and veins; or if there is a fistula in the bladder or intestines, then beware of all those areas; and do not do this unless the fistula is in a fleshy place where you believe it will not penetrate further.
Then care for the area until it is healed.
And if the area is sealed, and all the matter has been removed from it, and it remains thus for a long time, then know that it is entirely healed.
And if the matter is not removed from it, then know that it is penetrating either into the bone or the flesh is corrupting, or this comes from those causes which will be remembered in their place.
Chapter 37.
Of the Cautery of Hemorrhoids
When there is pain in the hemorrhoids due to cold or large swelling, and because of this the patient's blood is thinning, then you should cauterize that part with a cautery on each hemorrhoid, using a pointed claw from which you take the memory.
And strongly cauterize with the second one a little lower, so that three lined cauteries will come, and thus they will be more useful in assistance.
Based on the given pattern of translation, here's how you might approach translating "Capitol .xxxviii.
"On the Cauterization of the Bladder.
"When debility and softening occur in the bladder due to cold and moisture such that the patient cannot retain urine, then cauterize in the area just below the bladder, where the hairs of the penis begin. Cauterize with a cautery on the right side, and with another on the left.
"And let the length of each cautery be according to the number of fingers of the patient's hand; and cauterize with a cautery in the area just below the back, or with two cauteries if necessary.
"And let the cautery be thin according to the process.
"Chapter XXXIX.
"On the Cauterization of the Uterus.
"When the uterus is affected by cold and moisture, such that conception is impeded and the menses are corrupted, delayed, and cause severe pain upon their arrival, then the area should be cauterized with three cauteries around the navel, as we have said in the cauterization of the bladder; and with a cautery just below the back, or with two cauteries, and let the cauteries be thin.
Capítulo XL
Chapter 40: Cauterization for Dislocation of the Ankle
When moist mucus is poured into the ankle area, causing it to move from its place, a sign of this is that one part extends over the other when compared between them. And the location of the dislocation is found in the swollen spot.
Therefore, you must cauterize the patient over the ankle area with a round, pointed cautery, because you will have sensed it with your probe in the circle of the area as it turns, and for this reason, the area falls in the middle of the circle.
And the cautery should be similar to the one used in stomach cauterization.
If this cautery is not available, then cauterize with three large olive-shaped cauteries.
And the cautery should be done according to the thickness of the entire cord; and then care for it so that it heals properly.
Chapter XLI.
On the Cauterization of the Sciatic Vein
When pain is felt in the ankle area and its cause is cold and moisture, the patient should be treated with the water we have mentioned before, and if that does not help, it means the remedy has lost its potency. In this case, you must rid the patient of thick humors using either foul-smelling pills or artificial pills, and then cauterize them.
And the method of cauterization in this case is according to two methods: cauterization with burning medicines or cauterization with fire.
According to two known methods, one of which is to cauterize the patient on the wider part of their body with three triangular cauteries as shown in this way; and make them go deep. And the space between each cautery should be the size of a finger's thickness, whether the cauteries are small or large.
But sometimes the cauteries should be placed in the middle of the back of the neck, because there are four cauteries there.
And if you wish, you can cauterize with a circle that precedes the form in the cauterization of the displaced neck, and let it be a continuous circle that burns the tip of the entire spine.
And this is the method of cauterization for sciatica when pain is confined to the neck and does not extend into the chest.
But if it extends into the chest, then cauterize with two cauteries on the chest in the place where the patient feels pain; and with one cautery on the shoulder four fingers below the wild part.
And if you use a knife-shaped cautery, let its depth be according to the thickness of the cord.
And if the patient reports that the pain has spread to another part of the body near the feet, then cauterize that area with a cautery in three or four points, or more if necessary.
And if the patient reports feeling pain beneath the thumb towards the wrist, then cauterize that area with a knife-shaped cautery.
And be careful in all cauterization that you do not penetrate so deeply with the cautery as to burn nerves or major blood vessels, for this could cause harm or contraction on the patient.
And I have seen one or two cases where the cautery was applied to the ankle and in the process of cauterization, the flame swelled up until the tumor reached the foot, which was then punctured and entirely corrupted. And immediately afterward, there was a severe attack of diarrhea, and then death.
And if the pain is in two places at once, cauterize each one according to this method.
And wise men have said in the cauterization of water, the method is as follows: make it similar to a circle of iron, whose circumference is half the size of a palm; and let its orifices be according to the thickness of a thumbnail or a little less.
Here's the translation of your provided sentence:
Here's the translation of the given sentence: And so cauterize him with three round cauteries at once.
And then leave him for three days; then bandage him with a cloth and leave the wound open for many days; and then treat him with ointments until he is healed.
Said Al-Zahrawi: O children, we have used this type of cautery little because of the fear of watching it, and because few have been found who take care of it.
But for those who have endured these cauteries, they will find comfort with them.
But the cautery with adherent medicines is that you should make two circles, having a small hole in which they place the iron pin; let the length of the wall be two inches or so in height.
And if the space that is between each of them equals the thickness of the finger; and they are open below and above, and they contain each other in this manner:
Then place the patient lying on their left side over the wound, and press your hand over the wound; then take hot water and pour it between the two circles, and gradually increase its heat, and keep it for the duration of an hour, and the patient will endure the pain and swelling — because that feels like a fire bite — until the pain subsides.
And then lift your hand with the instrument and wash away all the hot water from the wound with cold water.
And then let it be for three days and place a bandage on it until the blackness of the bruise is removed, and let it be like this for some days, and it will run with pus; this is in case of help.
And then treat it with ointments until it is healed.
And if the pain extends into the hip or thigh, make for him a statue that contains water, just as it is done in the wound likewise.
And this is the method of hot water, and I have already written about it in the treatise on the correction of medicines. Recipe for alkali and quicklime, not extinguished, one part of each, mix them and place in a new bowl, from which the bottom is pierced by a small hole, according to the amount that enters into it.
And place under the bottom of the bowl another inverted bowl, and pour over that alkali and live quicklime cold water which covers them by about a finger's width, and after you have pressed these with a clean hand for good compression, let the hole release the sharp water on the part below to the inverted bowl.
And promptly adjust all that water and pour it over another living thing and another renewed alkali because it will have a very strong acidity at that time, which is administered in many medical operations and in the cauterization of other members because it is a fiery operation.
And from some of the medicines with which one is cauterized, such as the tea tree and honey from anacardium, and also soap of this kind that they are mixed.
And Valerius recounts from an ancient man the operation and treatment with which sciatic pain and venous pain are cured, and he greatly recommends it as being very effective, and says that no other treatment is necessary, because it is healed once like this, because when he enters the bath and urinates, he leaves immediately from that.
And it is that green nettle be taken, and if green cannot be found, then fresh figs should be taken; and both should be crushed with a little salt and placed on the pain in the ankle or knee or thigh, and bound.
And it should be left for three hours or however long the patient feels relief from the application.
And then place him in a bath and as soon as his body is reddened, immerse him in the ground, for the pain ceases and he is healed.
And know that it is not necessary to use a cautery with these medications except during the evacuation of the body.
However, Escorides says that when the vein is cauterized with goat's blood, it is beneficial to him; and let the cautery be done in this manner: let wool be taken and soaked in old oil, and place it between the toes of the foot and in the hollow.
And then take dry goat's blood and flambé it with fire until it becomes charcoal; and then place it on the wool and let it burn until it is spread out. And then repeat this process, and do not stop doing so until the sensation of the bite reaches the water and relieves the pain.
And this manner of cautery is called "cautery with cows".
Chapter 42
On the Cauterization for Back Pain
Sometimes pain occurs in the back due to various causes, such as a fall or blow, or excessive purging, and for similar reasons, due to the influx of cold and moist material.
And the cautery is not used except for this specific case, which is caused by the escape of cold matter.
Therefore, it is necessary to evacuate the patient with fused pills and similar substances, which should be made on the back where the pain is located, in three lines according to the size of the patient. After that, place ten cauteries in each line, or more if needed, depending on the patient's tolerance and strength.
And this should be done with a pointed cautery.
And if you wish, cauterize with three or four clover-shaped cauteries in this manner:

On Cauterization at the Beginning of Jaundice
This disease frequently occurs in young children; and the sign of its onset in children is that it affects their structure, causing fever and restlessness.
And you will find swelling at the last vertebra of the spine and on its back, which begins to rise above the other vertebrae.
Therefore, when you see this and wish to prevent it, then cauterize that area with a circular cautery in this manner: That he take the cautery over all parts of the spine equally.
And if you wish, cauterize around the spine with a pointed cautery two or three lines (inches). And let the points be close together (between each other).
And then care for the place so that it is healed with what we have said.
But beware that cautery is not administered on a swelling caused by nerve spasm.
Chapter XLIV
On the cauterization of gout and joint pain.
When joint pain is caused by cold humors that infiltrate each part of the body, and pain occurs in the feet, it is customarily called gout by doctors.
And therefore, when gout caused by cold is cured with treatment and the pain is not removed, then remove (cauterize) the remaining (pain).
And you should cauterize that area around the joint of the foot with many cauteries.
And let it be cauterized with an olive-shaped instrument, which has this form:
And if it is necessary to make points on the surface of the foot, then do so with a pointed cautery. Here's my attempt at translating the given sentence:
And if you need to use cautery tools, then use them, but do not press too hard with the cautery in your hand; rather, only surround the area with the tip of the instrument.
And if the pain extends into the spine and back, then administer the cautery that we mentioned in its respective chapter.
And if the pain is only in the hands, and it is called gout, then puncture in the circles of the wrists as they rotate, puncturing in those two lines.
And if pain remains in the fingers, then puncture in the circles of the wrists on each joint and at the base of the thumb.
And if the pain extends after some days to the shoulders or arms, then cauterize each of them in every part of the joints.
And you do not cleanse the patient with good diet and medication, because if proper care is taken and heat is evacuated by this cautery, it will heal, God willing.
Chapter 45.
On Cauterizing Wounds.
When an incision is made in the abdomen and intestines protrude through the hernia, and this begins to happen, then you must tell the patient to stop eating for that day and use gentle remedies so that the opening of their belly.
"And then follow the patient with your hands on their back, and instruct them to keep their arm inside until the hernia or the intestine is expelled.
"And then return to that with your words and signals, trying the break above the bone of the little finger, signaling the end of which is similar to half a circle at the upper parts of the body.
"And then ignite the cautery whose form is as follows:
"until it becomes red hot and sparks are produced. "Then return the intestine or hernia to its cavity, and place your hand over the area to prevent the intestine from coming out.
"And you have already opened the space between the patient's thighs and placed a cushion under them, and another servant should be on their legs, and another on their chest, holding their hands.
"And then place the cautery on that mark with your hand holding the cautery straight, and press until you feel the bone of the little finger in the middle of the depression; and repeat this action another time if you did not succeed in the first attempt to reach the bone.
And observe carefully the movement of the intestine at the time of your cautery, to ensure that you do not burn the intestine, which could cause death or another serious illness in the patient.
And know that when using the cautery, avoid the bones; doing so will ensure the success of your operation.
And it is important that the cautery for children be delicate according to their size and age.
And carefully clean the area of the cautery for three days with bandages until the scab from the burn is removed.
And then care for him with other ointments until he is healed.
And let the patient lie on their back for forty days, so that the wound and the sore may be sealed. xspace
And it is important to feed the patient according to the duration of their treatment, so that their stomach does not swell and the intestines do not protrude due to the effort of healing. xspace
And when it comes time for him to rise after about forty days, then administer a moderately made poultice, and let him have that for another forty days.
And he should abstain from labor and excessive eating and drinking, and from loud voices, for when he follows this complete regimen of healing, he will be cured.
It seems like the text is discussing medical procedures related to abdominal ruptures or hernias. Let's translate it line by line:
And some have said that the rupture should be cauterized with a triangular cautery according to this form, because it is indicated by a probe.
And a line is placed through the latitude in the back above the rupture, and another line above that; and place your hand with a pointed cautery, but the first cautery is lighter and better.
Chapter XLVI.
On the Cauterization of Hernia.
When pain in some members persists due to bruising or blows and that pain continues for a long time without improving with medical treatment, then it is necessary to cauterize with a pointed cautery.
And let the cautery be for every member according to its size and smallness, and its strength and weakness, and the location of the hernia and pain in it.
Therefore, if it is healed by the first cautery, good; and if not, then repeat the cautery on it; for it is customary for those pains to be connected from one member to another that is close to it, so you should obtain them all with the cautery until the patient is healed.
Chapter XLVII.
This phrase appears to be about the process of cauterization used to treat leprosy. A literal translation would be:
"Some cases of leprosy are treated with a cautery for great benefit, especially if the type of leprosy is caused by the putrefaction of phlegm and melancholy.
"So when you want to cauterize such a patient, consider if the leprosy is universal and has been treated with the water we mentioned in the division. If it doesn't improve, be afraid that the corruption will spread throughout the patient's body and all its parts. Then cauterize the head with five cauteries: one in the middle of the head, another below it, reaching to the hairline; two on the temples; and one at the back, either on the nape or the neck.
"Finally, press with your hand and the cauteries a little deeper until they leave an indentation on the bone, so that the release of thick vapors may be relieved from him; and cauterize the spleen as needed.
"And if the leprosy has already spread across the patient and appears clearly, then you should cauterize with those cauteries that we have mentioned for the head; and cauterize at the tip of the nose, and with two cauteries on each cheekbone, and with two cauteries on both vertebrae of the neck, and with six cauteries on the vertebrae of the back, and with one large one on the vertebrae near the buttocks, and one on the buttock, and with two on each ankle, and with one on each ankle bone, and with two on each kneecap, and with one on each kneecap, and with two on each elbow, and with two on each shoulder blade, and with two on each rib cage; and cauterize all the joints of the fingers and toes, and on each heel of the feet, and on the soles of the hands.
And be careful of the nerves that are on the sole [of the foot], so that you do not burn those.
And sometimes it is cauterized with a cautery on the bone of the knee and with another on the mouth of the stomach, and another on the groin.
And know that the more precisely you apply the cautery, the more beneficial and effective it is; and know that the patient does not feel pain from the cautery itself, as others do, because his body is already numb.
And it is necessary that the cauteries be large or small according to the members and the joints, as has been said about the kinds of tools.
And then care for the cautery with flour mixed with honey and with other remedies until it is healed.
Chapter 48.
On the Cauterization of Stupor.
When some member is paralyzed or numb and has been treated with medicines, oils, and plasters, and is not healed, then you should cauterize that paralyzed member with cauteries according to the size of the member, whether large or small.
And let your cautery enter a little into the tip of the spine. And then you should care for him with an ointment until he is healed.
And sometimes the swelling is cauterized in certain places where there are many nerves that control that member, and when the swelling is removed, it alleviates the pain.
But one should not venture into this unless one is knowledgeable in the anatomy of the members and the pathways of the nerves throughout the body.
Chapter XLIX
On the Cauterization of Warts that are Formed.
When warts are old and do not respond to any of the medicinal ointments, then you should cauterize it with a pointed cautery for a short while, according to the size of the wart's head, until its whiteness and color disappear and its color changes.
And then you should care for it with a mixture of barley flour and lentils with rose oil and with leaves of mullein, and with pigeon blood or swallow blood, each should be one part and all should be mixed together, and then a cloth should be dipped in it and placed on the area until it is healed.
Chapter L
"On the Cauterization of Crabs.
When cancer begins and you wish to stop it, then cauterize it with a circular cautery around its circumference as if it were surrounded.
And the wise have said that it should be cauterized with the last cautery in the middle of the location; but I have not seen this done, because I fear that an ulcer may form, and I have seen this happen sometimes.
And it is more appropriate to cauterize around the circumference with a circle as we have said, or with many cauteries.
Chapter 2.
"On the Cauterization of Ailments.
When some ailment is delayed in healing, and this is due to the excess of moisture causing it, or due to the patient's condition, whether old and decrepit, with little blood, or because of the time, and you wish to hasten the healing of the ailment; then cauterize around it with many small pointed cauteries; and then leave it alone, for it will hasten in healing.
But if you wish to pierce it with a cautery, then heat the cautery whose shape corresponds to it; and place that in the middle of the ailment until the tip penetrates.
And if you use cautery on that area which is lower down, it will alleviate the arm's pain; and then cure the inside so that it may heal.
Chapter 52.
About the use of caustic substances for cautery.
Corrosive is a corruption that walks through the limb, which corrodes it just as fire consumes dry wood.
Therefore, if you see that corrosive substance in a place where it is suitable to use fire for cautery, then you should apply the cautery needles sparingly and large as appropriate in the area where the corrosion is taking place.
And then you should cauterize it entirely from all sides until you have completely eradicated all the corruption and there is no trace left of it.
And then leave it for three days, and place over the cauterized areas a poultice made of oil mixed with herbs until all the scabs are completely removed and all the corruption is gone.
And then treat it with flesh-regenerating ointment.
However, if after three days you see that the flesh has healed healthily and there is no sign of corruption, that is good; but if not, then you should repeat the cautery in the places where the corruption persists.
And it is sometimes treated with sharp medicine, because that is similar to cautery. But nevertheless, cautery with fire is a more effective treatment.
And I have already stated the treatment for it with sharp medicine in the division section, so take that when you need to start treatment.
Chapter .53
On the cauterization of scars and similar conditions.
Many times it is seen that the parts below the sick foot are called scars, and they are large and deep, which penetrate the foot; and those are cauterized in two ways: either with fire or with hot water.
But the cautery with fire is done by heating the pointed cautery similar to an eagle's beak, which should be made of iron according to the size that contains the scar in its entirety, and it should be of fine edges.
Then place that heated [cautery] on the scar and then turn your hand with the cautery around the circumference of the scar until the cautery reaches the depth of the scar. And leave it like that for three days until it begins to ooze pus. And then apply a poultice to the affected area with wild mallows crushed with salt, and leave the poultice on it for one night, because that will expel the cause of the pain.
And then treat the area with a generous amount of ointment until it is healed.
And if it does not heal and many little things occur on the surface of the body, especially in the hands and feet, then you must administer cautery with water. Take a small needle made of iron or steel or feather of a vulture, place it over the nail; then pour into the needle a small amount of hot water, and press with your hand, and turn the needle with the pressure of your hand in all directions, and press the edge of the needle into the root of the nail, and find that the hot water will reach the core of the root of the nail; let the patient wait for an hour for the burn of the hot water, and then remove it, because the nail with its roots will be expelled.
And do likewise with all the others until you have treated each and every one of them on the body.
"And then care for those boils whose causes are removed with ointments that the flesh generates.
This seems to be a chapter or section header, likely "Chapter 53" in modern English. The full sentence might read: "Chapter 53 begins here," or "This is Chapter 53.
"On the Cautery of Tremors.
"When someone has a tremor due to cold in the nerves or because of a fever caused by cold, or for any similar reason, then you should cauterize them with four cauteries or five on the backbones of their spine, one between each vertebra; and with cautery on their feet, and on their stomach, using olive-sized cauteries.
"And the tremor will subside, hastening the health of the cold illness.
"Chapter 55.
"On Cautery for Sudden Ailments of the Body
"When there are sudden pustules and abscesses on the body that are made from thick corrupted materials, then at the beginning when they appear, it is necessary to cauterize over the head of each abscess with a subtle cautery with a mirtle wand, whose tip is extended with fire; or with a long herestology razor; or with a lenticular cautery.
And sometimes it is cauterized with ammonium at the beginning of its expulsion according to this method; and if they are not believed, and the excess is broken by those actions, then they heal from that.
But nevertheless, it is important that this be done in conjunction with an evacuation using bloodletting.
Chapter 56.
On Cauterization of the Flow of Blood Caused by an Archer's Cut.
Often the flow of blood caused by an arrow cut should be stopped at the wound itself or at the beginning of a collection of pus or cauterization of the limb, and similarly in other cases, for it is difficult to stop that otherwise.
So when this happens to someone, you must immediately clamp the wound with your hand at the opening of the arrow cut, and place a finger on it, pressing firmly until the bleeding stops under your finger, and it does not come out.
And then place the olive-shaped cauteries, both small and large, in the fire by the dozens, and blow on them until they are very hot.
And then take one of them, either small or large, according to the place and the wound in which the artery is broken, and quickly apply it to that vein after you have removed your finger, holding the cautery until the blood is sealed and restricted.
And if the blood is expelled from the orifice of the artery when you remove the thread and extract the cautery, then take another cautery quickly from those that are prepared in the fire, and do not stop doing this until the bleeding is controlled.
And be careful not to burn the nerves here, lest it bring upon the patient another evil.
And know that when blood flows from an artery, it is not possible to stop the bleeding except by one of four methods: either with a cautery as we have said, or with extraction if it has not been extracted already, for when it is extracted its extremities are best burned and the blood is stopped; or let it be bound with pitch or ligature by strong restriction, or place upon it medicines whose virtue is to stop bleeding; and they should be applied firmly with a pad under moderate compression.
But he who administers a decent restriction with ligature and strong bandage or by the position of causes that burn and are similar, should do so only late.
But if this is necessary for someone and neither the physician nor medicine is present, then open with a thread tied over the orifice of that vein as we have said, and understand that it must be done with great compression until the blood is stopped from the main source of the wound, and the thread on the artery should not be removed; and over the artery let it be sprinkled with very cold water until the blood is frozen and thickened; and beware that there will be a need for cautery or medicine.
Of incisions and perforations, and of fistulas, and of phlebotomy, and of wounds and their likenesses.
We have said in the first chapter all the sicknesses for which it is appropriate to use cautery with fire and corrosive medicine, and the occasions and causes of them, and the instruments necessary for this purpose; and I have ordered the chapters from the top of the head down to the feet.
And I will proceed in this chapter in the same manner, so that it may be helpful to those who seek it, when they ask about it.
And before I begin this, son, you should know that in this chapter is included everything that is in the first chapter on cautery.
And because it is necessary to have great caution in this, for the operation which is performed in this chapter is very often accompanied by bloodletting, through which life flows, you must be careful with the exposure of the vein or incision over an abscess, or opening of a fistula, or cleansing of a wound, or extraction of an arrow or cutting into a stone and their likenesses. And among all those, fear and trembling are accompanied by death in most of them.
And I warn you that this should not happen to you, as some people have encountered various forms of madness. And of them there are some who go mad with their illness and the death that comes to them is easy, and this because of the severity of what they find in their illness, and because of the length of their illness, and with the illness there is fear which signifies death.
And among those, there are some who give you their possessions and property, expecting health from you, but their illness is harmful.
Therefore, you should not consent to treat those who come to you with this condition; your caution should be greater than your greed; do not presume any cause for it unless you have certain knowledge that justifies it, and only if a praiseworthy outcome results.
And use prognosis and diagnosis in the treatment of all your patients, for in this lies your help in acquiring fame and good reputation, praise and glory.
Here's my attempt at translating this line:
And I have ordered this chapter to be distinguished by chapters according to what was previously mentioned in the chapter on cautery, regarding the care of the head to the feet, so that it may be relieved for you, which you request and for which you have need.
Chapter one.
Of the treatment of water which is contained in the head of infants.
Know that this illness very often befalls infants due to childbirth and when the nurse tightly binds the infant's head without mercy.
And sometimes it happens for unknown reasons which are not understood.
But I have never seen this illness except in infants; and all those whom I have seen die, and thus it seems to me that it is an abandoned work in them.
And I have seen that an infant whose head was full of water had his head always thus enlarged until he could not place himself on top of himself because of the size of his head, and moreover, the moisture made it increase until it killed him by fire.
And this moisture is either added between the membrane and the bone, or it is added below the bone on the brain.
Because the operation in that case, if the moisture is between the membrane and the bone and the abscess is small, then it is necessary for you to make an incision in the middle of the head with a slit in the latitude, and let the length of the slit be two nights until the moisture runs out, and this is the shape of the spatula.
And therefore, if the moisture has increased and the abscess is larger, then there are two slits in this manner:
And if the moisture is beneath the bone, the sign of this is that you see the sutures of the head open on all sides and the water is squeezed out when you press it with your hand from within and there is nothing hidden from you. It is necessary for you to make three incisions in the middle of the head in this manner:
Then draw out all the moisture through the incision; and then strengthen the slits with cloths and poultices; and then cover it from above with wine and oil for five days, and then remove the bandage and treat the wound with plasters and ointments, and bind the head evenly; and feed the patient with dry food of little moisture until the limb is comforted and healed.
Based on the given text and your initial translation, here's my attempt to translate this line:
And observe that you do not cut the artery and cause blood to flow, which can lead to the patient's death due to loss of blood with evacuation of moisture.
**Chapter Three**
When there is any catarrh or rheum in the eyes or feet and it has become chronic, and you do not get better with medicine, then the final cure for this is to cut those two arteries.
And therefore it is necessary that when you want to cut those [arteries], the patient should raise their head and then rub the area with a rough cloth so that the arteries are revealed. Then strengthen the patient's neck with some cloth; and consider where the vein pulses; and press on the places corresponding to those near the ears, and they will hide in some men.
Then sign the artery with a probe and then cut each one with the scalpel divided into sharp parts for cutting, reaching to the bone, and it should be like this due to the size of the head.
If you wish, insert the spatula beneath the artery and break it at the points where it is divided on top.
And let the length of the incision be two thumbs wide, for when some vein is cut, blood exits with a pulsating flow, which jumps out frequently.
But if the artery is not visible on the skin, then you should measure from the ear the amount of space equivalent to three thumbs, and then mark it with a probe, and pierce into the bone.
And the amount of blood to be taken is equal to one-sixth of a pint, and it should not be taken in large or small quantities, and all this depends on the strength of the patient and the fullness of his vein.
Then consider the wound, and thus if there remains on the bone any cause of splintering, then cut it open so that it does not turn into a cold abscess.
Then strengthen the wound with cotton and linen bandages, and then treat it with ointments until it is healed.
Chapter III.
On the Extraction of Arteries Located in the Temples.
When someone experiences an ancient or acute migraine due to humid and acidic qualities in the temples or has a persistent and similar headache and it is not cured by common medical treatments, then we have recourse in these illnesses to extraction of arteries in the temples or cauterization of them as we have shown.
And the manner of the operation and extraction is that the patient shaves the hair on their temples; then find the visible artery in the temple, as it has been shown to you by its pulse, which is hidden in most people due to the strength of the cold.
And if it is hidden from you, then have the patient's neck stretched with some cloth; and then rub the area with a rough cloth or apply hot water until the artery becomes clearly visible to you. And then take the instrument of which this is the form: Then use the instrument to carefully separate the skin until you reach the artery; and then insert a thread into it and pull it out in small segments until you have extracted the entire artery from the skin, freeing it from all surrounding tissue.
Here's a line-by-line translation of the given text:
And then evacuate about one to three cups of blood.
And if the wound is large, then it is necessary for you to bind it in two places with a double-stranded thread of flax or with long cords, and do not allow it to become infected before the healing of the wound, and let there be a flow of blood.
Then cut away the excess that is between two ligaments; do this at that time, or very soon after.
And if you wish, cauterize it with a cautery to the bone with a surgical knife until its edges are cut away, and it will stay in place instead of that same procedure.
And this is a better procedure if the patient has a fever or is of hot complexion; because cauterization is one of those things that help to end humidity, and therefore it is better in summer.
And it is necessary to quickly clean the wounds and cover them with old cloths, and let powder be applied decently, and then let it be treated with dry medicines that make flesh grow and with compresses until it is healed.
And if during your work another time the wound bleeds, then you should hasten to stop that blood, either with a cautery or by filling the place with cotton, and strengthen your hand until the bleeding stops. And if none of those causes are present, then place your finger over the wound until the blood is coagulated, and rinse the wound with very cold water until the sharpness subsides, and let it be strengthened as needed.
And the easiest way to extract an arrow is by cauterizing the vein with this pointed instrument that has two blades. First, you must mark both spots with a needle, and then apply intense heat until it reaches the bone and cuts the vein in two places, so that what is between the ends is extended, because they are not entirely consolided by this cautery.
And this is the shape of the cautery:
And let the sharpness of the two blades be equal. However, if the sharpness of the two blades is less, it is better, because if they are as sharp as two blades, it approaches each wound and does not cut the flesh quickly.
Therefore, since in those there is some thickness, the heat of the fire is held back in them and the flesh is cut slightly.
And this method is better for all works and easier.
"And let the space between two ribs be as thick as the thumb.
"Fourth chapter.
"On the care of the body for acute and burning tears of the eyes.
"When the tears are acidic and it is the body of those veins that are on the top of the head outside, and there is no reason for medicine's care in this, and sometimes the face of the patient has reddened and they feel a crawling sensation on their forehead as if it were ants walking, and the eyes of such a person are exhausted, so wet that even their eyelashes are dissolved, and the eyelids are cut by the sharpness of the tears, the ancient doctors in the care of this used this operation, and they named this care with a sponge.
"And you order the patient to shave the hairs that are on their forehead, and then make three equally spaced incisions on the forehead according to its length. "And if the length of the incision is two thumbs: let one incision be equally distant from the length of the nose in the middle of the forehead, and the second according to the small movement of the eyelids that are lacrimal, and the third on the other side.
And beware of the beginning of the veins that are in two places, and extend your hand from the continuation of both jaws. And if the space of each opening is equal to three times the size stated.
And if you have a sponge or dry cloths with which to absorb the blood.
Then insert a probe with two sharp ends, of which this is the form of the incision on him: which starts from the temples and goes to the second opening. With that, remove all the membrane that is between the two openings, and cut what is above the bone, and then do this from the middle opening to the second opening. Then insert this probe and enter again into the first opening another time with another instrument which is called a scalpel, sharp on one side and not sharp on the other.
And place the sharp side of it against the flesh attached to the membrane, and the dull side against the bone, and insert it until it reaches the middle fissure, and cut with it all the vessels that descend from the head to the heels.
"But if the incision is extended to the point of appearing on the buttock, then proceed to do so into the middle cleft until it reaches the other cleft.
"And if blood is discharged in quantity, press on the places of the blood clots to stop the bleeding.
"And then place on each cleft a piece of old cloth, and cover those pieces with powder made from wine, oil, and vinegar, ensuring that it does not turn into an infected abscess.
"And on the third day, remove the bandages and administer a large infusion of hot water or tea, and then treat it with an ointment made from basil oil and rosemary oil until the wounds are healed.
"Chapter V.
"On the treatment of scratches by cautery and the ulcers that descend from within the skull.
"When someone has sharp and continuous cautery burns, and the patient's ulcers are small and thin, and their vision is weakened, and the eyelids are ulcerated and hairless, and there is severe pain in the front of the head with consequent protrusion, know by these signs that the materials and cautery come only from tiny veins originating within.
And the best cure for this is as follows: instruct the patient to shave their forehead, and then make an incision in it at the midpoint of the forehead, a small one based on size (and begin with the left temple incision going towards the right temple; let the incision go into the bone; and keep your hand away from the temples' tendons which are quite sensitive to mastication), until the bone is exposed.
Drain all the blood with a sponge or dry cloth, and then fill between the two lips of the incision with old cotton or linen cloths. And then cover it tightly with powder mixed with wine and oil, so that it does not become an infected abscess.
And when you remove that and see that the abscess has already diminished, then it is necessary to scrape the bone until new flesh begins to grow on it, and then cure it with a drying regimen which will cause the flesh to grow, just as if you take two parts of wheat flour and four parts of colophony and mix them together, and from them make a poultice and apply it to these wounds for the growth of new flesh.
Chapter 6
Of the care for those who suffer from earaches.
Every cause that afflicts the ears is one of four kinds: either it is a mineral substance or something similar to a stone, such as iron or glass; or it is plant-based, such as barley or beans; or it is a fluid substance, such as water and vinegar or their likenesses; or some animal.
Therefore, when a stone or another cause similar to the ones mentioned above enters the ear and does not fit or grow in it, place the ear in the sun. If you see the stone, then apply some oil of violets or sesame oil onto it. Then administer its extraction, make the patient sneeze by holding their nose until they sneeze. Then place some weights of cloth or wool around the circumference of the ear and stretch the ear in those parts above, because many times it is dislodged with these means.
And if it is not dislodged, then administer its extraction with the tool called "subtle ear scoop," of which this is the form:
And if it is forgotten with a gesture, good; and if not, then administer the extraction of it with one-eighth of an ounce of subtle doubling.
And if it is not forgotten in that way, then make a tube of iron and insert the tip of the tube into the opening of the ear canal and close around the tube with wax and softened oil so that it is not open except for the tube. Then extract it with your own strength using strong suction, as we have seen many times before in this matter.
But if it is not forgotten in this manner, then take a little alum from alkali or old vinegar with which birds are caught, and place a small amount of it on the tip of the reed, and then wrap it decently around that cotton. Then insert that into the ear canal gently, and then dry the ear of moisture.
And therefore if it is not forgotten with all the causes that we have mentioned, then you should cut it before it becomes a pustule or spasm.
And the way to cut it is that you should first bleed the patient from the saphenous vein and draw blood according to their constitution, then make an incision between your fingers and turn the ear back into its original position, and then make a small opening in the edge of the ear near the place where it is most swollen. Sure, let's translate this sentence step-by-step into English:
And if the cause of the pain is in the ear and it's due to one of the fats that grows and swells, then administer the treatment and extraction; but if it doesn't obey you upon examination, then take a delicate spatula according to this form. And with that, administer the incision of that fat which is lodged in the ear.
And do not perform this when you think that it has already been softened by the heat of the ear, and place that in a small bag, and then extract from it with tweezers or a delicate hook, or with an incision as we have said, because the extraction is made easier.
But if water has entered the ear, it is necessary that the patient use sneezing at the beginning, and fill his ear with some old cloth, and pour over that ear in which the water is, and if by this it is expelled, good; and if not, then take three stones according to the length of the finger, and heat them a little in the fire, and let the patient insert one of those into the opening of his ear and jump on one foot of that side and strike with another stone on the stone which is inside the ear. Donc no cesse aquo am peyra entro que tota l’aygua sia foro-getada.
Donc no cesse aquo am peyra entro que tota l’aygua sia foro-getada. And now you should have water drawn in such a way that you take some paper or cloth, and put one end of it into the ear and stretch the other end with fire until it is burned to the core.
Then put in another cloth and do this as many times as necessary until all the water is drawn out, and squeeze it with a probe just as mentioned above for the extracting stone.
But in the extraction of a living creature that enters into that ear, if it is a small thing similar to a flea, cure it as we have said in the division; but if it is a large thing which causes pain in the depths of the ear, then administer its extraction with tweezers and scissors, and its cause is lighter than all other causes that occur in the ear.
However, in the extraction of a worm born in the ear, when you treat it with water as mentioned in the division and in the treatise on distillations and your treatment does not work, then it is necessary that you observe the ear in the sunlight.
Therefore, if any cause of the worms appears here, then extract it with tweezers or fine scissors; but if no cause appears, then take a probe that is narrow at the tip and wider above, such is its shape. And insert the slender tip into the ear according to the amount that the patient can withstand; and then suck out strongly with it, and do this many times until all the worms are expelled.
But if the patient does not cooperate with you in this treatment, then you should fill and seal the circumference of the tube with wax as we have said; then administer distilled remedies that the ancients have already proven effective for treating worms, and you will find these in the treatise on distillations. ﻿
And let your pouring instrument be that with which you pour the medicinal oils into the ear using this tool, which has the following form: And make it of silver or iron, quite narrow, with a small hole in it, and flat on top.
And thus it should be designed so that it fits snugly in the concavity of the tube containing the oils when necessary. And if you wish, take a reed and wrap its end neatly with cotton, then pour oil or the juice of some herb, or any of these medicinal liquids into the concavity of the tool — which is in the ear —, then insert the reed with the cotton into it, and press gently with your hand until the oil is expelled into the concavity of the tool and the patient feels the oil inside.
And what has been inserted into the ear should already be lightly scraped with fire. And ensure that the remedy you distill into the ear is not too cold, because ear remedies do not tolerate this.
Chapter VII.
On the treatment of ear wax buildup.
Sometimes, infants are born with unruptured membranes in their ears, and this can also happen to some men. This condition is caused by a blockage or growth within the ear canal; sometimes this blockage is located at the entrance of the ear canal, which cannot be seen, and other times it is located in the outer parts of the ear.
And that which occurs at the entrance, where one cannot see it, is in the most difficult conditions to heal.
And in that which can be seen, it is necessary for you to place the ear of the patient towards the sun and look into it. And then if you see an apparent blockage, open it with a fine spatula like this one:
The tip of which should be narrow in width, one side being sharp and the other not; and the spatula should be two finger lengths long to avoid harming the ear.
And so if the swelling is due to flesh born in the ear or in its meat, then take that with subtle scissors and incise it with great ease until all the flesh is removed.
And if the swelling is in the bone of the ear, then take a subtle knife and warm it slightly with fire, and then place that in the meat of the ear.
And so if you feel a swelling with water that the patient finds easily due to its heaviness, force the pressure of it easily; and be careful not to injure the nerves of the ear.
And then place in the ear linen according to the width of the hole which you have wrapped in Egyptian ointment; and do this for several days until you are sure of the healing of the wound, or take some plant and soak it in vinegar and sprinkle it on three times a day, and use it; and if you see that the ear is already abscessed, then you must remove the plant and replace it with another plant which you will wrap in a plaster made from rose oil until the abscess has been cauterized; and then treat it until it heals.
If bleeding occurs, then submerge a sponge or cloth in cold water and place it on the wound to slow the flow of blood, which is mentioned in the treatise on distillation.
Capitulo VIII (Chapter VIII)
About the care of styes that appear on the eyelids.
Styes that sometimes appear on the eyelids are moist at times and dry at other times.
Therefore, you should have those with tweezers or a needle, and carefully incise them with the tip of the tweezers or needle, and then place a poultice on the spots to dry them out.
But if there is pain with blood flow, then you should cauterize them with a fine-tipped needle or cautery instrument.
And the best way to cauterize is right after the incisions, and they often return if any of their roots remain; but when they are cauterized with fire, those roots are burned and do not return.
Chapter IX
Treatment for growths on the eyelids of the eyes.
Often in the eyelids of the eyes, some cause appears which is similar to a growth in its strength and hardness, and for this reason it is called a growth.
"And it is an accumulation of thick fluid in the eyelids below and above.
"Therefore, the operation on them is that you should consider if the swelling in them is due to what comes out of the eyelids and is increasing everywhere; and the cause of this is light.
"Therefore, make an incision along its length, and then remove it from all parts with ease until it empties out, and then suspend it with hooks and cut it off.
"And if the swelling is large, then you adjust it with stitches; and care for it until it heals.
"And if it is small, you will not encounter any harm from it, because the salve of it will restore and heal it.
"And if the swelling is declining into the inner parts of the eyelid, you must take the inside surface. Then empty the eyelid and suspend the swelling with hooks, or whatever you need for the incision, and press it from all sides. And if the eyelid is lengthened by the incision, this will not cause any harm.
And at the beginning, wash the wound with salt water; and clean the area with water that contains flesh until it is healed.
Chapter 10
About the care of the eyelid above the wound.
A chalazion is a type of growth that forms in the tissues of the upper eyelid, and it mainly affects children. It worsens their vision and causes them to blink excessively; they cannot look at the light of the sun because tears flow into their eyes.
And for this reason you see these children squinting all the time, and when they sleep their eyelids are wet with tears, which have already covered the inflammation, and an impending appearance of a pustule is seen in the eye; and when you press on that area with your fingers, you feel a pustule inside it.
And there is another way of operation, in which the patient places their head on your seat, and then you place a cloth over them and make a circle around it according to the quantity that contains all the pus from all sides, and then you place that circle over the eyelid and press with your fingers all around so that the pustule is concentrated in the middle of the circle. And then make an incision in the middle of that wet area with a scalpel along its length, and the incision should not be larger than the one made in bloodletting.
"But in the patient, it is necessary that you cut the tendon completely until you reach the ankle, because in the most severe cases, pus drains through a rupture according to the form of white leprosy.
"Therefore, extract it with cloths that you have wrapped between your fingers, and turn between the right hand and the left until it is drained.
"And be careful not to insert anything into the rupture, so that with the spatula you do not reach the bone and displace it.
"But if the ankle does not appear at the beginning of the rupture, then insert a small tube into the rupture to facilitate its appearance; and then extract it as we have said; and then soak cloths in water and vinegar and place them over the area and press firmly with bandages.
"And also apply salt compresses and place them in the cavity of the rupture, so that this residual moisture is absorbed.
"And then continue to care for it until it heals.
"But if an abscess forms in that place, then treat it with soothing poultices until it heals.
Chapter 11
Of ways of touching or feeling the eye.
When pustules are formed under the natural eyelashes and become old, they often adhere to the eye and cause various ailments such as constant tears, softening of the eyelids, and a veil that can lead to eye damage, known as touching or feeling the eye. The cure is done in four ways: either with cautery using fire; or with a sharp medicine, as described earlier in the chapter on cautery; or by touching through incision and suture; or with needles, as I will describe.
Therefore, you should place the patient's head in your lap. Next, turn up the eyelid of the eye with your left hand. If it is raised, that's good; if not, insert a needle into the pustule under the eyelid and make the needle penetrate through the fiel above. Do this near the edge of the eyelid where the hairs are born, near the hairs, and pull the thread towards the outside with the eyelid, and turn that [the eyelid] with the rayon.
And then incise in the inner part of the eyelid below the lashes with the spatula of the larger lacrimal duct into the smaller lacrimal duct; and then extract the pus and place small cotton or cloth pellets under the eyelid, and then seal over the eyelid with a bandage, and let it be like the shape of a myrtle leaf.
But however, it is necessary that the shape be according to the amount of swelling of the eyelid, because this varies among people. There are some who need a large quantity to be incised from the eyelid, according to the amount by which the eyelid is softened.
And then incise with the spatula along both lines that you have marked, beginning from the larger lacrimal duct into the smaller one. And if your incision is close to the natural hairs as in the thickness of a reed.
And then place the knife in one of the two corners of the codena, and then excoriate that entire area, and then join with stitches both lips with fine wool yarn or thread, and cleanse the blood, and make adhere what exceeds of the threads onto two eyebrows with some adhesive substances, if you wish to do so, otherwise do not worry about it.
And soon release the stitching of the thread within three or four days, and then treat it.
And if you prefer, leave the wound without stitching and treat it with a substance that dries and tightens, because the eyelid is lifted due to the healing of the wound and its growth; but stitching is better. And thus said the ancient doctors about healing.
But nevertheless, be careful with the patient, and it is a good procedure if there is no fear in doing so.
And there is another way of treating it, which is to place over the eyelid a figure like a myrtle leaf, and then lift the eyelid with three stitches that are separate and joined in this manner:
But if this is not possible, hold the stitches, and this is not successful, then take a needle with thread on it and insert that in the middle of the figure, and pass the other thread near the larger lacrimal duct, and the thread near the smaller lacrimal duct, and adjust between these threads with equality. Then with these elevate your hand with an equal lift, raise all the skin over which the figure is placed just as we have mentioned.
And then adjust the two lips of the wound with stitches, and cure it from within so that it may heal.
But if an abscess occurs, you must open or incise it, and close that abscess with wax and something similar to it, and with ointments.
And sometimes it is necessary for the eyelid that its hairs be turned, then you should use on it what we said about incision; but a stitch in each one is more skillful.
To straighten with reeds is done in this way: And it is that you turn the eyelid and cut the shape that is inside, as I have described; and then by art make two reeds or two thin splints whose length is according to the length of the eyelid and their width is less than the width of the spatula. And you have already cut at the ends of each partition where you have the threads.
Then add each one with delicacy on top of the excess from the eyelid, and tighten the reeds of each partition with great force, and leave it for several days, because the cord due to the tightness will die and will be rejected and will fall off until by itself it falls.
If it is too late, then break the spell with incantations, and immediately cure the wound until it is healed.
Therefore, once it has hardened, the eyelid is lifted, and the hairs do not sting.
And this is the way to make two reeds according to this method: and there shall be the quantity of length and width, neither more nor less.
Chapter .12.
Concerning the raising of stinging hairs on the eyelid with a needle when the hair is hard.
When the hairs are unnatural, hard, rough and stinging in the eyelids, then the operation is to take a fine needle and place it on that thread of fine silk or flax, and carefully adjust its ends so that each one is very thin. And let the length of the threads be about the size of a palm.
Then you compose another fine thread underneath it in a short time, and knot the ends of that one if you wish.
Then place the patient's head on your lap, and let it be towards the sun so that your work may be seen clearly, for it is a subtle and delicate operation.
And then promptly insert the needle into the root of the hair that requires it, and make it penetrate quickly through the eyelid until you extract it above the natural line of the hair.
And then pull the hair inside out and insert it into the alixati (a type of needle or probe), and let there be one, two, or three hairs, but not more than that.
And then withdraw your hand with it until the hair is drawn out through the eyelid along with the alixolati (needle) in its natural line.
But if the alixolati is pulled out and the hair is not drawn out, you will pull the alixolati back towards yourself with the thread that you have prepared with it, until the alixolati comes out from the upper hole.
And check it with the vision of the eye, for when you pull out the alixolati and the thread, and close each (eye) and seal them shut, leave the seals on for two or three days until the hair adheres to its place and good flesh grows over it.
And if the hair is too short, then you take a long hair from the natural ones, and raise it with that (short hair), or let it be until it has lengthened a little more, and then you raise it.
**Chapter XIII.**
Of the treatment of chalazion, which appears on the eyelid.
When it appears in the eye as chalazion and is a contraction of the eyelid, either on one side or the other, due to poor healing from an injury or cut or burn, and it is called leporina, this chalazion or leporina can be natural or accidental, caused by poor healing from injuries or cuts or burns, or resembling a similar condition in others.
The method of the operation on it is to cut through that hardened area and separate its lips, and place between them a piece of linen cloth, and tie them together until they are healed.
And it is not necessary to use treatment on it from drying or constricting causes, because if you do this, the chalazion returns worse than ever before.
Use treatments that soften, such as fenugreek, and soak it in water with althea and flax seeds, or an ointment of diachylon, which should be melted with some of the oils, and soak the cloth in this, and treat it with that.
And the treasure of your care is that you pierce with all skill that which is not solid according to the form that was at the beginning.
And this operation which we have mentioned is none other than a correction of the ehalixacrati, which restores the form of the place as it was before.
Chapter XIV
About the care of ehacrati, which is done in the lower eyelid.
This ehacrati which is done in the lower eyelid, which is truly called ehacrati, is either of a certain nature or accidental.
But accidental ehacrati is caused by injury, wound, cautery, or similar things.
And the way to perform this operation is as follows: Take a needle with double thread and insert it into the flesh, then make the thread pass from the left tear duct to the right tear duct until the thread reaches both ends of the flesh.
Then gently stretch the skin apart with the needle and sew it together, using a broad spatula to spread the area. And thus, if the shape of the eyelid returns to its proper form, good; but if not, take the ray and place it on the cleft figure, and with that turn the eyelid, making two slits in the side of the lower eyelid.
Here's a line-by-line translation of the provided sentence:
Here is the translation for "E aquesta figura es letra greca: la landa." into English:
And then remove that flesh by the amount equal to the length of the sharp object below it, which is the eyelid.
And then adjust the separated parts and suture them with wool thread; and then treat them with the softening medications and compresses we have mentioned until they are healed.
And if the eyelid needs to be opened by an incision or suture or cautery, then you should make a flat incision on the skin of the eyelid as previously described. And then separate between the two lips with the compress as we have said.
In summary of the treatment for eyelid issues when they are above or below, let the operation proceed on it according to how it has been prepared in the form of the eyelid, and that is in the form of various small changes.
And skilled craftsmen always prepare ingenuity in every possible way for him until he restores the figure to its natural form, or as close as possible to it, and that patient according to what is suitable for him regarding the operation and the instruments in the greatest dispositions.
Chapter 15
Of the adhesion of the eyelid to the conjunctiva or to the cornea.
When this hardening occurs in many men so that the eyelid is solidified and blocked from easy movement and its natural functions, then you should insert the end of a ray beneath the eyelid, raise it with that, or extend it with wax.
Then you should cut the adhesion with a subtle spatula, which should not be sharp but rather blunt at the tip so as not to disturb the patient during the operation, and leave the spatula in place so that it does not scratch the eye with its sharpness.
And let your incision continue to gently separate that adhesion until the eyelid is returned to its natural shape and all the adhesion is healed.
And then you should put salt water in the eye with which you will wash it; or drip in it a solution of hyacinth dissolved in water.
And then separate the eyelid from the eye with oil of lilies, and place wool soaked in egg white on the eye, and on the third day use healing compresses until it is healed.
Chapter XVI
Of the incision of the nail and of the flesh of the tear ducts.
"Know that a nail is of two kinds, either it is nervous and resembles thin, hard ice, or it is non-nervous and resembles white, congealed humidity. When this touches iron, it is necessary to take hold of the nail with tongs, cut it, and not put the tongs in it.
"And both species originate from the large tear duct, which gradually covers the vision and prohibits light and eye movement.
"However, the manner of operating in the incision is that the patient places their head on your knee, then opens their eyes, and with your hand lifts the eyelid. Then collect the nail with tongs of slight doubling and extend it to the outer parts. "And then take a needle and insert a horsehair or ox hair, or something similar, or strong thread, or double the tip of the needle little by little and place it in the middle of the nail. Penetrate with the needle and tie the nail with thread; extend it to the outer parts, and peel off the skin of the nail with the hair, which is the pupil. And thus you follow him with your hand through his behind.
And then you incise the remaining part of the tear duct into its natural path with a fine spatula or small scissors, and clean the skin of the natural tear duct to prevent continuous tearing after the operation.
And sometimes the nail with the sole of the finger extended or with thread, as we said, and then it should be carefully cleaned with a thin spatula like this one.
And be careful not to touch the corneal tissue with the spatula and cause a tear, or puncture the pupil.
Then place a little of crushed salt or sieved ashes in the eye after the incision, and leave it there until the next day; then wash it with appropriate water until it is healed.
And if the nail is not infected and you cannot insert the needle, or it is not firmly attached to the finger, then this type of nail can be treated with medicines and will heal as I have described in the section on treating them.
And if you want to incise it, then open the eye of the patient and take a thin spatula of appropriate sharpness like this: This phrase appears to be incomplete or out of context without further information. However, based on the pattern observed in the previous translations, "am" could be interpreted as a variant spelling of "a," which means "to." "Subtilitat" seems similar to words related to subtlety or finesse in romance languages. Based on the pattern and similarity to Latin and Romance languages, here's my attempt at translating the given sentence:
And then continue the operation on that until everything is removed from him, except for the contrary abscess which is in the eye, because if you leave that, and first cure the beginning of the abscess until it heals.
And then continue your operation on that with reason until it is healed.
The prominence of the tear-producing gland, if it is noticed in the eye due to great damage, should be suspended with a hook; and you should make an incision on that part, but do not complete the incision so that tears do not flow out.
And then apply a poultice of rose and fennel to the tear duct until it heals.
Chapter XVII.  This indicates that the text is divided into sections or chapters, with this being the seventeenth chapter.
Of the incision of the tear duct and of what is born from the joined flesh in the eye.
Sometimes in the eyes of some people, red flesh is born, and it grows until it covers the pupil, or it approaches or presses on the eyelids and strongly compresses the eyelids to the outer parts, resembling a row of balusters.
But the operation on it is that the patient places his head on your knees; and then open the eyelids of that one and collect all that flesh with suitable hooks for this purpose, and take that with forceps or tweezers; and then incise the flesh at the beginning until everything is finished with the scissors, and be careful not to damage the eye during your operation.
Based on the context and similarities to Latin, Italian, Spanish, and French, here's my line-by-line translation of the given text:
Here's the line-by-line translation of the given sentence:
And if there remains any cause of inflammation and the wound is cauterized with boiling blood, and you fear an abscess, then leave the wound open and treat that abscess with something that draws out the abscess. Then proceed to operate on it until it is healed. Similarly, do this for the flesh that is affected in the same way around this area.
But you must ensure that all care of the open wound is done either naturally or through an accidental means, using iron, and do not put your hand in any of these operations until you see that the member can tolerate that operation.
Chapter XVIII.
On the Collection of Pus from the Wound.
The pus is like dark veins that are clotted over the wound and prevent the treatment from working, and they can keep the wound open for many days.
Therefore, it is necessary at the beginning that you consider whether the wound in which there is pus is strong and in it there is no other illness besides pus, then you should collect that pus.
And you should command the patient to place his head on your lap, and then suspend those veins with an ounce or two according to your judgment; and let that ounce be of double thickness according to this form:
It seems that you've provided an incomplete sentence for translation. Could you please provide the full sentence or more context so I can give you an accurate English translation?
Certainly! Here’s the translation of the provided sentence:
Certainly! Let's translate the given text line by line:
And when you have completed [the task], then you distill in the head chiefly vinegar or rosemary, so that with its sharpness it can corrode what has been removed from the liver.
But if it is not possible for you to gather everything at that moment, then you should apply a plaster with what alleviates the pain of the patient and leave them alone for some days until the pain subsides and the abscess heals carefully.
And then you should repeat the process on the patient following the same manner until they are cured.
And this is the shape of the forceps:
Chapter XIX
On reducing prolapsed nose cartilage.
When you are treating a prolapsed nose with cautery or sharp medicine according to what has been previously described and it does not heal, do not cut into it but make incisions over the abscess until it matures, and extract all the moisture that is in it and the pus until the bone is exposed.
And once the bone is exposed and you see corruption or blackness on it, then scrape it with an instrument of this shape:
And it is named "rasp" with a sharp tip, made of iron, and the tip should be round like a file or rasping tool with fine punctures (as shown in the following figure).
And place that over the decayed part of the bone, then rotate it gently between your fingers, and press your hand gradually until you feel that the corruption has been removed.
And this should be done several times, then restore the area with drying and astringent substances.
Therefore, if the area has healed and healthy flesh has formed, and the body is free from corruption and remains so for forty days without recurrence or swelling or any mishap, then you know that it is healed.
And if not, then it is not wise to do anything other than reduce the fracture to the shape of the nose, and do so in this manner: first you should expose the bone using either an iron [tool] or sharp medicine, and when the bone has been exposed, then take a file of this shape:
Its end should be triangular, and its handle should first be narrowed towards the tip like this.
Then place it on the bone, and let it be near the lacrimal bone; and extend your hand a little towards the nostril, and then turn your hand with the file until it penetrates all of the bone, and this will cause the patient to feel relief as air begins to escape from their nose.
Therefore, at this point, restore the area with astringent medicines and dry it out as well.
Therefore, when the flesh and the area have hardened, at that point the material which was flowing to the external parts returns to the nose, thus it is easier on the patient.
Chapter 20
On the reduction of the prominence of the nose.
When the nose protrudes in its entirety and no harm or diminishment occurs in the vision, then you should let the patient rest, and follow them, and place ventouses on the neck without scarification and with good suction; and then apply a liniment on the nose that is made of alkanet, aloe, henna, and sarcocolla, and then strengthen the poultice on the nose with many powders.
And the manner of the powders is that you take many cloths of linen, and each cloth be folded in four layers; and make many of these.
Then place those one on top of the other according to the amount that the nose needs. Then strengthen on top of those with a hard cloth with strong pressure; and repeat the ventouses with suction without scarification; and then remove the ventoses and let the nose remain narrow day and night.
But if during that time the ligament has softened, then it is necessary for it to be very tight.
And then remove the bandage both day and night as we have said.
And if you see that the wound has already been reduced, that is good; but if not, then repeat the application of the plaster with powders and tightness and the cupping until it is healed.
Chapter 21.
On the incision of the thin membrane of the uvea.
When there is an outward projection of the uveal membrane through the eyelids like a grain of sand, and this disfigurement causes concern, if you want to incise it, then perform the operation in this manner: insert one needle into the uvea from below towards above, and introduce another needle at the lacrimal duct which should be double the length of the first needle. Make the second needle penetrate and leave the first needle in place according to its position; then incise the place where the two needles meet and lift the part of the uvea around the needles, and strengthen it greatly.
Sure, let's break down this medieval text and translate it into English step by step:
And then treat the eye with water that soothes it until the wound is healed.
And sometimes add to the entire area around the eye with a circular piece of cloth, making it protrude prominently. Then, puncture it subtly with a spatula that reaches the bottom of the eye, allowing the humidity to drain from the albuginea, and then lower the eyelid and insert it immediately.
And then strengthen until it is healed.
Chapter 22
Of the care of alconati (a Latinized form of "alcanata," an ointment or unguent).
This illness, which is called alconati, is nothing but an ointment that resembles descending water and it is not that.
However, the way to treat it is to make the patient sit on a prepared and straight seat, then take their head in your hands from both sides, and moisten that area where you see the ointment reaching the lower parts, so that it dries up and does not descend, and the light is obstructed, and the patient sees the causes as they are seen.
And if it does not descend downwards, know that it is water.
Here's a line-by-line translation of the given text:
When it is forgotten, then you distill in the nose hot water in which you have mixed honey or water in which you have already boiled fenugreek and honey.
And [the patient] should be treated with other remedies until they are healed.
Chapter 22.
About the treatment of water coming from the nose.
We have already mentioned the types of water in the division and which ones are suitable for perforation with an instrument, according to health.
Then it is necessary that you make the patient sit between your hands on a chair and tie his nose tightly with a thread.
Then place your left hand near the eyelid of his nose, if the nose with water is the left one; or with your right hand, if it is the right one.
And then with your right hand take a cotton swab, if the nose is the left one; or with your left hand, if it is the right one.
Then place the tip of the cotton swab near the rim by the thickness of a grain in the corner of the nose on the side of the smaller tear duct, and then remove the cotton swab with skill and roll your hand with it.
And then penetrate into the abdomen through the navel, and you will feel that the liver has already been reached due to its size.
And ensure that the distance from the liver to the spleen is equal to the length of the space between the pupil and the edge of the black area, which is the navel; for you will see with this pupil through the clarity of the corneal membrane.
Then press the liver into the place where the water is located, and then draw it down once more, and if the water descends quickly, then see the patient on what side his eyesight returns first, and the liver in its own navel.
Then wait a little while; if the water has descended, then you should pause that other time before the liver is displaced.
And when it is dry and does not descend, then you should extract the liver easily, and roll it a little at a time with your hand, and then dissolve a little salt in water and wash the navel inside; and then place outside the navel a bandage or a sponge soaked in rose oil and egg white, and lick the navel with water.
"But we and those of our time apply a compress of egg whites to it.
"But if your servant does not obey the command to drink water due to its bitterness—for it is bitter for some people—then you should take the ointment called 'alberid,' of which this is the recipe:
"And therefore, puncture that joint with it, and do not extend your hand into the wound, but only make a subtle opening for the command.
"And then insert the command as we have said.
"And you must prepare the patient's sleeping chamber in a quiet and dark manner, upon which they will sleep on their back, and all movements are forbidden.
"And place on the patient's body something that will balance their nature, and do not turn their head to either side at all.
"And let the treatment be continued according to its effect for up to three days.
"Then undo it in that dark room and ask for his opinion, and have him see some things, and then resume the treatment on the seventh day.
"And this should not be done during the hour of the moon or shortly before the full moon. Based on the provided pattern and context, here's a possible translation of the given sentence:
If an abscess bursts, it is necessary to release the pus before seven days and treat it with water that promotes the draining of the abscess.
Then you should cover the patient's eyes and place a cloth over their face to help regulate their vision for some days, as long as they are in the darkest room.
Then gradually remove them from that darkened room and let them return to their usual activities.
And know that a student of surgery is not exempt from vision sometimes, and then you must be skillful in performing the operation.
And now it has come to our attention that some of those who practice the art, and one of them said that he made fire in the air using a magnet with which he drew water. ︎ E aprop tengua caut en tas manos de fer am punta de alchataa , e apoz pone la punta en le loc del foc, e aprop tira denan lo igni, e aprop reposa sobre el loc on es feyt.
But I have not seen anyone in our land who has accomplished this, nor is it written about in any of the books of the ancients; and it is possible that this is new.
And these are the shapes of magnets, which should be known by those who do not know them:
And they should be made of iron or steel, and their tips should have this subtlety: they should be triangular in shape, with the pointed end being the primary form.
Capítulo 24. (Capítulo means chapter)
About the treatment of flesh torn in the nose.
When in the nose there are born diverse fleshy growths from which comes an irritant like the sting of a scorpion or a polyps, and this illness is called polyps because it resembles that fish. And if the flesh is cancerous, yellowish, of dark color; and if it is a red color (leon means lion or reddish), then it is not of dark color.
Therefore, in those that are in these reddish fleshy growths, if they are not ulcerous or cancerous, it is necessary to make the patient sit between your hands and place him in the sun, and open his nostrils, and prick your thumb in those fleshes. Then immediately draw it out to the parts outside, and then cut what you have contained with that sharp subtle spatula from one part until you know all the flesh is drawn; if anything remains from which the separation is possible, then scrape it with one of the thin instruments with ease until nothing remains. Based on the pattern of the given translation and the similarity to medieval Latin-based languages, here's a line-by-line translation attempt:
And then pour into the nose near the opening vinegar and water or wine. But if the nose is open and from it moisture enters the palate, then know that it is already healed.
But if the moisture does not penetrate as it should, then you should know that within him flesh is necrotizing on the upper bones of the nose, which have not been reached by the opening.
Therefore, at that time it is necessary to introduce fat into him, which has some thickness, and put the fat in pieces, and place between each piece the amount of the said finger or hand, and lift up the patient and insert one end of the fat into the nose with a ray or with another instrument that is possible for him.
And after doing this, let him blow his nose until it reaches the passages of the nostrils, and let it come out on its own, for many times something similar to this action is done by children in school, and it is a light cause for those who want to do it.
Then place the two ends of the fat, one end that comes out of the nose and the other that remains in the nose, and then administer a flesh stitch with the pieces that are in the fat, and do this until you know that the flesh is already with the pieces of the fat.
And then extract the bile, and place in the nose near the blood vessel a reed, and do this for three days or more until the ointment dissolves all that is soft of the flesh.
And then at the end of the procedure, place in the nose a lead tube for several days until it is healed.
But if you decide to use drying treatment, use this one.
And this is the design of the instrument for capipurge, with which oils and medicines are instilled in the nose:
And make it of silver or iron, which should be similar to a small open bowl, like a little cup, and the opening similarly.
And if you wish, make a closed tube like a reed, and the nozzle of the capipurge instrument should be flat and open; at its end there should be a handle, with which you hold it when pouring in oil or water that you want from the juices and absorbent substances.
"Capitol .xxv." appears to be a chapter or section heading in Roman numerals. It translates to "Chapter 25" or "Section 25".
"De theyls natz en las extramitatz del nas." translates to:
It seems like you're working with a text in Occitan, a Romance language closely related to French and Catalan. Here's my line-by-line translation of the given sentence:
And for that reason, you should insert it at the beginning of the patient's appearance, and record everything. Then place either a cautery or a burning medicine on the spot where the affected area is located.
But if the insertion is delayed until it becomes prominent, then consider whether it has hardened, become firm, turned dark, and is less sensitive. In that case, do not touch it with iron because it is a malignant abscess; for many times it happens that one who inserts this abscess will suffer great harm from the patient on whom it was inserted.
And if the abscess is soft to the touch and not dark in color, and it's possible to insert at any time, then evacuate the patient and insert it without fear, and treat the area with something that dries and constricts until it is healed.
Chapter 26.
About the stitching of the nose, lips, and ear when their continuity has been disrupted by a wound or similar injury.
Know that when there is a loss of continuity in one of these parts, you will not perform this operation on most people.
Therefore, when there is a reason to do so for any of these causes, consider if it is a fresh wound with its own blood, and then you should join the two lips of the wound with stitches, and then treat it until it is healed.
And if the lips of the incision have already been separated and each one is made healthy, then you should cut each part of its cord until blood comes out. And then sew the two lips together and strengthen them; sprinkle dragon's blood powder on them, and place on the powder a thin compress of emplastrum diaphragma, or some other consolidating plaster, and leave it for two days or three, then remove it and replace the plaster and leave it until the stitches dissolve by themselves, and then treat with ointment until it is healed.
However, the method of stitching is that you join the incision either with needles as we have described in the stitching of the belly, or join the incision with thread as you are aware.
Chapter 27.
On the removal of those causes that come in the two lips in the inner parts.
Many times it happens to many men in the inner parts of their lips certain hard swellings resembling goose fat, and some are smaller and others are larger.
Based on the given translation style and the context of a medieval medical treatise, here's my attempt at translating the sentence:
It seems like you are trying to translate or guess the meaning of medieval medical text written in an old language similar to Latin, Italian, Spanish, and French. The text starts with "Capitol .xxviii." which likely means "Chapter 28.
Of the incision of tight flesh on the gums.
When you see tight flesh or swelling on the gum, which the ancients called albulus, then you should suspend it with a hook that you have with the scissors and incise it to its root, and let the pus or blood flow out.
Then immediately place over the wound dry linen or other styptic or drying powders.
And if that flesh returns, then incise it again and cauterize it, for after the cautery it will not return.
Chapter 29.
Of the cause of a tooth with iron.
When on the surface of the separated teeth and front teeth, among the gums, there are rough, hard scabs, some of which are blackened and become yellow or green, until the gum becomes corrupt in this way, the teeth become loose.
Therefore, you should make the patient sit between your hands and place their head on your knees. Then clean the teeth on which those scabs appear with something like sand until nothing remains of them, so that the blackness, yellowness, and other [colors] are removed until they are cleansed.
Therefore, if what is in that area has been removed at the beginning of the treatment, it is good; and if not, then you repeat the treatment on those areas for another day, and on the second day, and on the third day, until it reaches the final stage in which you want it.
And know that teeth have need of many tools of diverse forms and shapes, depending on what your operation requires. And because the tool with which the tooth is cut from inside is different from the tool with which it is cut between the teeth according to other shapes, you should prepare these forms of tools, which you will see shortly:
Chapter .xxx
Of tooth extraction.
Be careful that you cure the tooth of its pain with all diligence and delay in all extraction of it, for there is no reason that justifies the removal of it when it is extracted, because it is a sublime substance until it is an excuse in its extraction.
However, when the patient is forced to have that tooth extracted, you must be firmly certain which is the painful tooth, for many times the pain deceives the patient and he thinks it is in a healthy tooth, and you extract that one and then the pain does not cease until the diseased and painful tooth is extracted, because we have already seen this happen due to the actions of barbers.
Here's the translation of your sentence:
And then place in him strong tongs for good speech or powerful traction, and place the patient's head between your thighs so that you hold it well and it does not move, and then draw out the tooth straightaway without breaking it, lest you cause the patient greater pain.
And so if it is not forgotten, then take one of those instruments and place it under the patient in such a way that it is easily removed from them, just as was done at the beginning.
But if the tooth is crooked or decayed, then it is necessary that you fill that cavity with cloth and strengthen it with a thin ribbon so that it is not fractured during your constriction upon it with tongs.
And it is necessary that you work carefully with scarification all around the gingiva and be careful not to break or leave a part of it behind, and return to the patient lest they suffer more than their initial pain.
And beware that you do not do what some ignorant barbers do in their arrogance and lack of care in extracting teeth, without administering what we have recommended; for many times they cause great pain in the afflicted, which is more difficult to treat, and all or some of those reasons are due to the fact that you may extract it with pieces of bone from the jaw, as many times we have witnessed.
And immediately after the extraction of it (the tooth), his mouth should be washed with wine or vinegar mixed with salt.
And if there is bleeding through this [process], as in many cases may occur, then take some amount of sage and sprinkle it over the wound. If that does not help, cauterize it.
The shape of the forceps and tongs with which the tooth is initially seized should be long-tipped, with a short handle and thick, so that they are not bent when working with them.
And thus the handles should be thick enough that they are not bent when using them, but the tips should be short.
And they (the forceps and tongs) should be made of Indian iron, with straight tips. At the ends of these, there should be teeth that fit into each other tightly, and sometimes the tips of these should be in the shape of a stork's beak, which is blunt, and they are very constrictive.
Chapter 31
On the extraction of teeth and the removal of bones from locked jaws.
When you need to remove a broken tooth, there is some cause that prevents it. In this case, you should place a cotton pad with border over the area for one or two days until the area becomes softened; and then insert tweezers or pliers, the extremities of which resemble the beak of a bird called a stork or a glove, in the shape of forceps.
The extremities of them should be made thin like a file or a chisel.
And if the tooth does not yield to extraction with these forceps or pliers, then you should cut through the gum and remove all the flesh and insert the instrument called "atali," which is a small lever whose shape is as follows:
And let it have a short handle, a little thick, and not be blunt so that it does not break.
Therefore, if in this way the gum is perforated, it is good; and if not, help yourself with these other instruments whose forms are as follows: the form of the first instrument is a triangular extremity in which there is some thickness.
The form of the second instrument is that it should have a triangular and more subtle extremity.
And you have already been assisted with this instrument, which has two parts, and this is its shape. And with other instruments which I will describe later for tooth scraping; because it is also done with this instrument which resembles a large thimble, and this is its shape:
Its triangular tip should be twisted or shortened to some degree of thickness and not be blunt, so that it does not become dulled.
And know that the tools for removing teeth are similar and likewise with other tools.
But the skilled and subtle artisan in this craft finds for himself, according to what the operation and various illnesses require; because there are illnesses that the ancients did not mention or assign a specific tool, due to the different shapes of diverse species.
But if the bone of the jaw or other bones in the mouth is splintered or broken, then it should be carefully cut on that spot with the appropriate instrument and forceps which we mentioned for the extraction of tooth roots. Assist yourself with this tool whose shape is as follows:
And it should be slightly thickened gradually, and it should be inserted or held in the mouth so that it does not leak or escape until the bone is completely removed; and then restore the area with appropriate medicine.
Here's a line-by-line translation of the given text:
**Translation:** Chapter .32
**Translation:** About the care of protruding teeth over others.
**Translation:** When teeth are protruding and do not follow their natural shape, it is unfortunate, especially in women, and even more so in elderly venerable ones; therefore, you should consider: if the tooth is close to another tooth, and removal or straightening is not possible, then extract that tooth. But if it is attached to another tooth, then you should cut it with this instrument which has the following form; and it is like a pig's snout, and it should be made of Indian steel with a very sharp point.
**Translation:** And let your cut be with the instrument that you would use to cut it over several days due to the hardness of the tooth, and so that another tooth is not damaged.
**Translation:** And if it is an exposed protruding tooth, then file that with a file of Indian iron like this one:
**Translation:** And let all of it be made of Indian iron, and the edge should be sharp; and let it have many small points like a file with which needles are made. With this, the tooth should be filed little by little over several days gently, so that no other tooth is damaged or decayed. And then clean it at the end, and shave it with sharp razors.
And if it is a tooth from which a piece has broken off and it touches the tongue, then you should scrape that part inside so that the roughness of that fragment is removed and smoothed, and it is filled so that the tongue does not get cut and the speech is not corrupted.
Chapter .33
On restoring bad teeth with gold or silver fillings.
When an accident occurs to the front teeth by way of concussion or displacement through blows or falls, and the patient cannot chew anything, and you have treated it with astringent medicines, and your treatment has not been effective, then because it is not proper for them to be strengthened with silver fillings (since silver turns black and quickly loses its luster after several days), but gold never changes.
And let the filling be in such fineness and thickness according to the amount that can fit between the teeth; and the method of preparation is that you take the filling and take twice its amount between two healthy teeth, and then increase with two twists of the wire between two damaged teeth, or if one or more, until it reaches the healthy tooth on the other side. And then you should gently and skillfully insert your hand into the incision where you started, ensuring that it is not too forceful.
And with the thread by which you strengthen the ligaments, you must tie the roots of the teeth so that they do not decay.
And then you should cut the extra ends of the thread with forceps or scissors, and insert those into each location carefully, and turn them and hide them between the healthy tooth and the decayed tooth, so that they do not harm the tongue. And then leave it thus tightened as Rome does.
However, if it becomes loose or broken, strengthen that or those with another thread in the same manner at all times.
And this is the form of the teeth and the figure of the extraction of two healthy teeth and two decayed teeth, as you see these tied together.
And when it is done that the tooth or teeth return to their place, then close each one in its location, and they should grow again as we have described, and they will heal.
And only do this if you are a skilled craftsman and wise.
And sometimes it is suitable to use a cow bone for this purpose, and one is made from it in the shape of a tooth, and it is placed in the location where the tooth has fallen out, and it is strengthened as we have said, and it remains and serves with that for a long time.
Chapter XXXIV.
Of the swelling that occurs on the tongue and impedes speech.
This swelling that occurs below the tongue sometimes is natural with which one is born, or it can be accidental and happens due to a blow that has already healed.
The procedure is to open the mouth of the patient, with their head tilted back; and lift up their tongue, and then carefully cut that nervous swelling according to its size until the tongue is released from its constriction.
But if there is any hardness or knot in it, and this is due to the consolidation of a blow, then you should pour oil and cut through it until you have cut the swelling and the knot has been resolved.
And be careful that there is not a fracture in the flesh, and that you do not cut too deeply so that blood flows out.
Then wash the traces of the incision with vinegar or warm water; and then place a cloth under the tongue, this is the method by which you keep the patient from speaking at night to prevent it from becoming consolidated again.
If a bleeding occurs, place crushed vitriol on the area; but if the blood flows, then cauterize the area with an ancient cautery that is suitable for this purpose. Then treat with other remedies until the patient is healed.
Chapter .xxxv.
About removing a cyst from the tongue.
Sometimes, a cyst similar to a small lump appears under the tongue, preventing it from functioning naturally; and if it grows too much, it fills the mouth.
The procedure for this is to open the patient's mouth sitting in front of a light and examine the cyst.
And if you see it is dark or black in color, hard, and the patient feels no pain, then do not touch it because it is cancerous.
And if it tends toward whiteness, indicating moisture, then insert a knife into it and cut it open with a fine spatula, cutting through all parts; and if blood comes out during your operation, then place crushed zegi (a type of vitriol) on top until the bleeding stops.
Then return to your task until you have completely removed it, washing the area with vinegar and salt; and treat it with other appropriate remedies until it is healed.
It seems you are asking for assistance with translating Medieval text from a language that is akin to Latin, Italian, Spanish, and French into English. Here's how we can approach this task step-by-step. Please provide the Medieval text you wish to translate, and I will do my best to help you decipher it line by line.
Let's break down the text into manageable parts and provide an English translation for each segment:
When a boil appears on the throat, they are glands that resemble cotton, which happen outside and are called two ears. If you cure them with the water we mentioned in the section and it is not healed, then consider if the abscess is hard, dark in color, and has little feeling; do not touch that one with iron.
And if it is red in color and the root is large, then do not touch that one with iron because of the flow of blood; rather, let it be until it matures, and then either you will pierce it, or it will burst on its own.
And if it is white in color, round, and its root is thin, then that is the one that needs to be incised.
And the operation on it is that you should consider before your operation whether the abscess has already been repressed by complete rest or if it has decreased with some decrease; and then make the patient sit facing the sun, and his head should be in your left hand, and open his mouth, and a servant taking between his hands presses the tongue downwards with a very noble instrument of which this is the form:
And let it be made of silver or iron, and let it be thin like a knife.
Therefore, when you press on the tongue with that [instrument] and the abscess is revealed to you, then place your instrument over it, take a lancet, insert it into the opening, and draw out the pus as much as you can. Another thing that sometimes causes removal of the tunics, then incise it with an instrument of this shape:
Another thing that sometimes causes removal of the tunics, then incise it with an instrument of this shape: and it is like a pair of forceps, but the tips are curved so that the opening of one is at the end of the other, very sharp, which should be made of iron.
But if this instrument is not available to you, then incise it with a spatula of this shape: and let it be sharp on one side, but not sharp on the other.
And after you have incised one hole, incise the other in the same manner of incision, and then the patient will heal from cold water.
But if there is bleeding, heal with water from the decoction of pomegranate peels or myrtle leaves, similar to those causes that are astringent, until the flow of blood is stopped, and then treat it until it heals.
This sentence is discussing some medical issues related to the ear. Let's break it down:
And I had already treated a woman with an abscess that had formed in her throat, which abscess tended to be dark in color and caused little pain; it had already closed off her throat, and the woman was breathing with difficulty, and I had forbidden her from eating or drinking water, and she would have died within one day or two if left untreated.
And the abscess had grown so large that it produced two openings through which pus was discharged.
Therefore, I cut a fistula and inserted it into one of the openings, then pulled out a large portion of pus. Then I incised that opening to comprehend the other opening, and I closed the mouth with a bandage, compressing the tongue, and then I inserted the fistula into the abscess.
And then I incised a large portion of it, and from it flowed only a little blood. Therefore, the throat of that woman was completely healed, and she began to drink water right away, and then started to eat food. Because I did not stop incising that abscess many times over a long period, new abscesses formed in its place, which were incised until they too were prolonged.
Based on the provided context and similarities to medieval medical texts, here's a line-by-line translation attempt:
"Chapter XXXVII.
"On the incision of the navel when it is swollen.
"When there is catarrh in the navel, and it is swollen and long, then it is named perpendicular; and if it is at the exit, thick and round, then it is called a boil.
"But when it is treated with the water we mentioned earlier, and your treatment does not work, and sometimes even if the abscess has already been removed and is subtle, then you should incise that which is added round; and if it is to that length, and is bloody, of dark color or black, and is not in good condition, then you should attempt to incise it, because in this there is danger for the patient.
"And when you see that according to the manner I have mentioned concerning its whiteness and length, make the patient sit up and press their tongue with an instrument of the appropriate shape, and then place the knife at the navel, pull it downwards, and incise it with one of the two instruments mentioned in the incision of the two lips.
"And it is necessary that you do not incise it unless it is adjusted to its natural limit without addition, because if you incise more than this, you will damage the patient's speech.
And at the incision, use what we have recommended for the treatment of two mellas, and cure it until it is healed.
If the patient is frightened by the incision, it is necessary to use cunning in his cauterization without fear. The method of cauterization for him is only with sharp water, and you should place the patient's head on your lap, then press his tongue with the instrument we mentioned, and then take the water we mentioned in the chapter on cauterization, and make a live coal with it, and apply it not too thick or too thin, and fill the cavity of the instrument whose shape is this:
Let the end of it be concave where the medicine is placed, like the cavity of a spoon, and place the instrument with the medicine on the lip [of the patient], and the patient should move his head so that saliva or mucus from his mouth flows into the intrinsic medicine, so that no drop falls onto his throat and that it descends.
Then take the medicine in your hand and squeeze it onto the uvula for about half an hour until you see it become blackened and subdued by the bitterness of the medicine.
Sure, let's break down the sentence and translate it line by line:
Here's a line-by-line translation of the given text:
And this type of treatment is safer than incision and less dreadful.
Sometimes the uvula is treated with water that is more subtle than cautery or incision, because it is cured by sublimation in this manner: take calamentum, hyssop, origanum, rue, dried Arabic gum, chamomile, and other similar herbs, mix them all together, or some of them, with vinegar, let them boil; and the vessel should be well sealed with wax, and there should be a hole in the middle of the vessel, over which place an instrument shaped like this; it should be made of silver or iron.
And the end of the instrument should be inserted into the patient's mouth until the steam reaches the uvula, and it is greatly darkened.
And repeat this process several times until it is dry, and be careful not to perform this treatment at the onset of an abscess, as it will increase the abscess, which should not happen unless the abscess has been lanced by a cautery.
But if this instrument is not available to you, then take a reed and attach a hen's egg to its end, so that the patient's mouth is covered, because the shell of the egg prevents the steam from burning the mouth.
And this treatment is good for health.
Chapter 38.
On the removal of thorns and water that adheres in the throat and other causes.
Many times, things stick in the throat or a thorn from a fish or some other cause.
Then it is necessary that you remove the water that appears from these things, which can be seen when you press the tongue with an instrument in front of it, so that what is in the throat will be revealed to you.
And what is hidden from you in the throat, it is necessary that you make the patient vomit before the food has been digested in the stomach, because if the cause attached to the throat is expelled by vomiting; or the patient swallows a piece of napkin or a root of lettuce or a mouthful of dry bread; or takes a piece of dried sea sponge and binds it strongly with honey, and then the patient swallows that, because when it reaches the place where the thorns are, they are removed. Or take an eel and bind it with honey, and place it inside the mouth, and by sucking it will be extracted; or take a leek and insert it into the mouth, and by sucking it out you will remove it.
However, if you are not aware of those causes that we have mentioned, then use an instrument of lead according to this form:
And it should be thicker than a finger, and at its end there should be a concavity which you can easily insert into the throat.
And have the patient lift their head up, and be careful not to touch the bone of the throat, so that it does not hurt the body and so that the doctor with his hand can peel away the bone or the spine.
But however, that which the sick person introduces is better, because of his knowledge of the place of the attached cause, and he peels downwards and pulls his hand with the instrument upwards, all this according to the quantity that is prepared within until it is forgotten.
Chapter XXXIX
On the Extraction of a Leech Attached to the Throat
When the leech is treated with the water that we mentioned in the division of care with medicines and not with cautery, consider then in the patient's throat, because you have pressed the tongue with the instrument that we told you about.
Therefore, if you see the leech, extract it gently with a small spoon or with fine tweezers.
And if it is not possible for you to extract the object with your hand, then take a concave cannula and insert it into the patient's throat. Next, place an ignited iron in the concavity of the cannula and repeat this process until the leech dies and falls out of the throat. Afterward, ensure that the patient abstains from water for the entire day.
And then take a bladder full of cold water and open the patient's mouth into it, washing the mouth with it; do not swallow any of it, but spit out the water one hour later with your hand, because the leech will die as soon as it feels the cold water.
But if the leech is not expelled with the water that we have recommended, then fumigate the patient with camphor or asafoetida using the instrument that we have mentioned for the fumigation of the uvula.
Do this until it falls out.
And there is another way of operating with this fumigation: that you take an earthenware vessel in which there are burning coals, and the vessel is covered with a lid, in the middle of which there is a hole; and the end of the instrument is placed in that hole; then apply the fumigation; and place the patient's mouth on the tip of the cannula, and close his mouth so that the fumigation is not wasted until you know that the fumigation has reached the leech, because the leech will immediately fall out.
And if not, then you must repeat the fumigation many times, and make the patient abstain from drinking, and have them eat salty foods and almonds, and do not let them drink water. It is necessary that this treatment be followed diligently.
And this is the form of the instrument with which bloodletting is performed on the gullet when it is visible; and it resembles forceps as you see, except that in it there is a certain curve. which is placed on the gullet, and its extremity resembles the beak of a stork, which is wide, in which there are roughnesses made by a file, so that when we press any part, it does not slip away.
Chapter 40
In which is the summary of the discussion on abscesses and their incision.
Abscesses are many types, of many kinds, as will be remembered for each one in this book.
And they differ in their piercing and incision in two ways: the first is due to the type of abscess itself, and the second is because of what we learn from the humors.
Sure, let's translate this line by line:
And of some boils, there are those which should not be pierced until their proper ripening or healing.
And other boils which should be pierced when they are raw and not yet ripened according to their nature, such as those that form near joints. For a boil that is near a joint has its existence prolonged until it can spread to the surrounding area, and the ligaments or nerves of that joint are easily corrupted, which causes contraction of that member; or it is near a main member, and if you delay piercing it until it is ripe, it may cause putrefaction in the main member; or it is near the anus, so pierce it even if not yet ripened; but do not pierce it raw from incomplete digestion, except for those near the anus, to prevent its pus from spreading and extending into the inner parts of the anus, creating a fistula, or causing a condition that does not heal at the site. But you should know the time for piercing a boil, and this is when it has ripened.
And know that it is ripened when there is the cessation of pain and fever, as well as the reduction of heat and pulse, and the sharpening of the boil's head, and other signs.
And because it is necessary that you know how to make a puncture in the place most below the abscess, and from there comes the cure of the swelling.
And let the puncture always be made along the length of the flesh or the body, if the abscesses are in the parts of the hands or feet, and in the places of the wrists, the cords of the nerves, the arteries; and finally, in all places similar to these where there is no reflection; because in those that are reflected, use puncture according to that member.
But when the abscess is in a fleshy place, it is better to leave the puncture of it until its digestion is confirmed according to the rules we have mentioned; because if you puncture it before that, the body of the pus and much dirt will be prolonged, and the lips of it will become hardened and the depth will be increased.
But some abscesses must be punctured according to the thickness of the flesh or the body, as necessary, or according to what that member requires.
And it is necessary to administer a small puncture, and in large abscesses a large and wide puncture or many incisions according to the diversity of the size of the abscesses.
And others are of the apostemas in which it is necessary that the head be concave and cut when it is made thus like bread and done in a time when it has already set, as with those that happen in cases of double vision and boils.
And of those that are cut with a section having three angles; and of these is one which is cut as the figure of a myrtle leaf, like the apostemas of the angles.
And of these are those in which a round section and a crescent-shaped section are administered, similar to the previous ones.
But that one to which there is no head like these superficial apostemas, it is necessary that you pierce it with a superficial or flat perforation alone.  />
And it is necessary that when the aposteme is large and has collected much pus, you pierce it and do not hesitate to extract all the pus at once; having extracted a part of it, and then close the apostema until the next day, and then extract a larger portion, and then do this many times according to the degree until it is completely removed.
Especially if the patient is of weak constitution, or a pregnant woman, or a small child, or an elderly person in decay, because the vital spirit many times is resolved with the exiting of the pus, and quickly and easily the patient dies, and you have opened them.
This text appears to be discussing a medical procedure involving the treatment of boils or abscesses. Here's a line-by-line translation:
And if in the abscess, a part of the cord or that has been concave around it is cut off, then you should fill it with clean cloth or linen thread, as when you have a wound or cut, without moisture; and strengthen that for three days; and then process and treat it with the appropriate ointments until it heals.
But if bleeding occurs during your operation, then administer cold water and vinegar in which you have soaked a linen cloth, and place that over the site of the bleeding very often.
But if the bleeding persists, then you should administer treatment and care with powders that have been recommended in many places in this book of ours and in other works.
But if it is wintertime and the area of the abscess is a place with many nerves, then you should soak cotton in vinegar and warm oil and place them on the area.
And if it is summer and the area is fleshy, then you should place cotton soaked in water and oil or vinegar and oil on it, and let everything be cold for three days, as we have said. Then you should open the abscess, cleanse it, and administer to its care what is appropriate for it until it heals.
And this is what is necessary for the understanding of the cure of abscesses universally, but according to the way of distinction, I have already said everything about each abscess and how it should be cured specifically by chapters.
Chapter 41.
About the incision of abscesses that occur in the nape of the neck.
In the nape of the neck, small abscesses occur, and they are of various types of nodes that contain membranes in their composition; and the types are numerous.
And among them are glands, and there are those which contain a moisture resembling fat. And there are those that contain a moisture resembling dust, and similar to them are the ones which are hard like stones.
And in the incision and extraction of all these, there is no fear, since the extraction of them does not cause discharge of blood.
And the operation in incision of these is that you should probe them with an instrument of this form, which is called a trepan, so that you know what it contains.
Because if what is inside is moisture, then cut it with an incision according to its length, with a superficial incision in this way:
Here's the translation of the given sentence:
And immediately submerge the area in Egyptian ointment if available, and if not, in water with salt; fill it with that and let it remain until the next day, because with water you can dissolve everything that is rough on that layer.
And immediately apply Egyptian ointment to that area gently and repeatedly as needed until you are sure there is no roughness on that layer; then treat the wound with ointment until it is healed.
And if the abscess contains fatty knots, then you should cut it in this manner: with an incision shaped like a cross, and cut between the two lips of the incision and scrape it from all sides, and exert your skill in extracting the membrane that contains it.
But if your archery causes difficulty, then do what I have told you previously.
Similarly, perform the incision and treatment on a hardened abscess as we have told you; an incision on a hardened abscess is easier because it has little blood and moisture.
And sometimes there are abscesses of this kind which are in the head of some men with whom there is no moisture; this happens because I once incised an abscess in the head of an old woman and found the abscess like dry, hard, white stone, which could not be pierced, and if someone were struck by it, they would suffer. ‌
In the other types of boils that appear on the head, this chapter does not apply, such as the boils that come to the heads of children and are caused by the reasons of the ears, but the section of these should all be a superficial section.
And place the perforation of those at their lowest part so that the body is relieved of pus in its lower parts.
Then cure them with water suitable for this type of treatment.
Chapter 42
On the incision of scrofula that occurs in the neck.
Often these boils appear in the neck and armpits and groins; sometimes they occur in other parts of the body.
And those that occur in the neck, and many of which are generated between them, and all scrofula of these is within its own proper tunic, just as we have mentioned with the nodes and boils of the head.
And the types of these scrofula are many, for some of them are stony, and some contain moisture, and some are malignant and do not obey treatment.
Here's the translation of the given text:
And it is of utmost importance that the vein or nerve not be cut.
And let the scalpel not be too sharp, so that it does not harm your hand with a cut, or disturb the patient, and cut only what is necessary to be cut; for if you were to cut a vein or artery and thus prohibit yourself from continuing your operation, then apply to the wound powdered vitriol or other powders which stop bleeding, tighten the wound, leave it alone until the sharpness of the abscess subsides, soften the wound, and allow it to begin to fester. When the blood is released.
Therefore, return to your operation until you have completed it.
And then ask with your finger if there is any other cause of the other small pustules, so cut and clean those as well.
And if there is a large vein at the base of the pustule, it is best not to cut that pustule from its base. Instead, it is better to bind it tightly with a strong cloth and leave it until it falls off by itself without harm.
And then fill the wound with old cotton that you have already soaked in Egyptian ointment, and then dress it.
And if you cut away that entire scrofula, then it is necessary for you to join the two lips of the wound and suture it immediately so that no superfluous part remains.
But if you see that there is still some superfluous part due to the size of the scrofula, it is necessary for you to understand how to cut away the root of it, and then apply astringent and administer suture as mentioned.
And for those scrofulas that contain moisture, perforate them with a superficial puncture where you see the place of ripening, and make an opening so that the pus can come out from below, as we have said.
And then administer the puncture with ointment and similar substances to those mentioned earlier, so that it dissolves what remains of the corruption. And then when you see the wound is already cleansed, apply a generative flesh ointment to it until it is healed.
Chapter XLIII
About the incision of the pus sac that occurs in the throat.
The ancients said this incision should be made on the pus sac, and we have not seen anyone in our land who has done it.
And this is the interpretation of their words.
But in men with gonorrhea, it is necessary to avoid the removal of the epileptus, because doing this does not help, as all the veins and major vessels of the patient are here.
But in those who have abscesses caught in the mouth or throat or two ears, when the disease is not in the vein, it is necessary to use the section of epileptus to prevent the loss which is done by piercing.
Therefore, when we want to do this, we must cut the epileptus below three circles of the circles of the epileptus, or four with small section through the thickness in that which is between two circles for quantity. The section should be in cartilage, not in the flesh, and this place is suitable for cutting because it is lacking in flesh and its blood vessels are close together.
And if the physician is fearful, he should then extend the channel of the throat with an inch, and then split the channel until it reaches the vein. But he should avoid the blood vessels if any of them appear.
Then cut the lips according to what we have recommended; and it is indicated for the section of the vein by means of the fire which is of that exit, with that which is of it broken and by the suppuration of the voice.
"And leave the wound open for some time.
"So when the hour has passed in which the puncture is feared, add two lips of the scar to each other, and close it alone without the bandage.
"And then administer medicines that make the flesh grow until it is healed.
"And Albucasis says that the sum of what we have discussed is that you should see that some of these boils already contain the poison of the patient, and the patient has come to the point of death, and his spirit is dry, and some go to cut the epiglottis so that the patient breathes over the wound for some breaths, and he may be saved from death.
"And by this, he ordered to leave the wound open until the evil of the illness is consumed; and its evil lasts for three days; and then he ordered to close the wound, and care for it until it is healed.
"And what I have seen myself is that a servant took a knife and stabbed herself in the throat, and with it cut off a part of the tube of the lung, and I was called to care for her, and found her breath like that of the dead, and discovered the wound and found the blood that came from the wound was little.
Sure, let's break down the given text and provide a translation:
It seems like there's a mistake in the text you provided. The last sentence doesn't seem to fit with the context of the previous sentences, as it suddenly changes topic from medical treatment to a conversation with a servant. However, I can try to translate the sentence as it is:
And now I say that in the cutting of the vein there is no fear.
### Chapter 44
### Concerning the Incision Over an Aposteme Which Occurs on the Groin Externally, and is Called a Hernia of the Groin
### This aposteme, named groin hernia, is a large abscess according to the body's constitution and is very common in women.
### It occurs in two ways, for it can be either natural or accidental.
### And the natural one is not easy to cure.
### And the accidental one occurs in two ways: one is similar to large knots, and the other way is similar to an abscess that is formed by the constriction of an artery, and therein lies the danger. ### And it does not matter if one assumes it is iron, except in cases where it is small. ### And you should approach that and examine it with the said method, and if you find it similar to large knots, and it is not connected to any of the veins, then you should incise it just like knots, and extract it with water that contains laurel leaves and mallow; but if not, then its entire being must be investigated thoroughly, and subsequently cure the place with the necessary water until it heals.
It looks like you're asking for help translating text from a medieval medical treatise. Given the nature of your request, I can provide guidance and translation assistance based on the context provided. However, I cannot generate specific translations without seeing the actual sentences you want to translate. If you provide more sentences or lines from the text, I'll be happy to assist you in translating them into English.
"De seccio de las especias de nodos.
"From the knots come various species, and I have already mentioned all of their species in the division.
"And it is fitting that I also recount the difference between a knot and an exit wound, if there should be any doubt.
"So I say that with an exit wound there is heat and fever and severe pain until the overflow of excess is settled; and when the decay is complete, then the fever, pain, and heat cease.
"But with a knot there is no heat, no fever, nor pain, and I tell you that such an injury is peculiar to the bowel.
"And it is according to the color of the body, and its beginning is like a boil, and it is made as such, whether large or small, and there are two species of them: either they are fatty and contain moisture, and the colors of the moisture are many, as I said in the division.
"Therefore, when you come to the cure of a knot, you should examine it and inquire about its beginning with an instrument called a probe, as will be explained in the following chapter.
"And this is the manner of inquiry for all abscesses and knots: you should take this instrument and insert it into the moistest part of the abscess, and you will move it little by little until you know that the instrument has already penetrated the track.
Here's my attempt at translating the given sentence:
And if running moisture of any color has been forgotten, then you should incise it with a superficial cut as I have said in other treatments.
If from the trace of the injury there is no moisture, then know that it is fat (or greasy).
And make over it a dry cut in the shape of a cross like this: As you have been taught, and suspend that with a hook, and carefully peel off the skin from all sides, and if possible, keep the hair or bag over it, and draw out that badness with a thread.
But if it breaks during the operation, it is not possible to draw out that evil, and very often this happens, and then you must extract it piece by piece until none of it remains.
Because if any part of it remains, either a little or a lot, the thread will return as I have said before.
And if you see that a small part of it remains, then fill the wound with some sharp and strong corrosive powders, strengthen the wound, place over it what is called a cautery, and treat that with another treatment until it is healed.
And if the thread is large, then you should suture the two lips of it and treat it with what makes flesh.
If the vein is pulsating in contrast, or non-pulsating, then you should cut and fill the affected area with vitriol and let it sit for two days or three until the wound softens and the boiling of the blood subsides; then return to incise what remains of the node.
It appears that this line is referencing a specific section or chapter in the text, with "Capitol" likely being used here to indicate a major division or heading within the treatise. "xlvi" suggests this is the 46th such section.
"Of the shapes of the instruments necessary for incision and perforation.
"Of these shapes of the instruments, there are three kinds: one is large, another is medium, and another is small.
The shape of the large instrument is as follows:
"The shape of the small instrument is as follows:
"They should be made of iron, with pointed ends that fit well into the openings.
"And these are the shapes of the experienced [instruments], and they are named albard, and one of them is called burin.
"And there are three types, because some are large, others medium, and still others small.
"The shape of the large instrument is as follows:
"The shape of the medium-sized instrument is as follows:
"The shape of the small instrument is as follows:
"It is suitable for those openings and exits, such as fistulas and abscesses, to enter within them by means of bones or other causes.
And with this done, make round, large holes, like those made by large needles with which saddles are sewn, and they should be made of brass or iron or silver. The best ones are when they are made of brass.
And they are made with the experience of black feathers, which accord that through those openings the fistulas in their cavity should be opened, and reflected with their lightness along with these reflections.
And of three kinds, because some are long, and others medium, and others short, according to the width of the fistula and its narrowness.
Shape of a large lead weight:
Shape of a medium-sized lead weight:  (No need to translate "de plom" again, as it's already clear that the weights are made of lead)
Shape of a small lead weight:
The shapes of the hooks are of many kinds, for some are simple, with only one curve, and they come in three sizes: large, small, and medium.
And there are also curved hooks, and they come in three sizes.
And of those, there are hooks with two curves, and they come in three sizes.
And there are three types of curvatures among them, and they are of three kinds.
All these are necessary in their place.
Shape of a small simple cyst, shape of it.
A large cyst has two types of curvatures: The medium-sized cyst also has two curvatures: The small cyst also has two curvatures.
A large cyst has three curvatures:
The medium-sized cyst also has three curvatures:
And these are the shapes of the scalpels with which the nodes and abscesses are cut and scraped off, and they are of three kinds: large, medium, and small.
Shape of a large scalpel:
Shape of the medium-sized scalpel.
Shape of a small scalpel.
Based on the given text and pattern, here's a line-by-line translation:
And these are the forms of almagidas, and there are three types: large, medium, and small, as you will see.
They are made of copper and resemble a beam with which an alcove is made.
And on the hidden extremity it is pierced with a stiletto and in that run the separated parts inside and out, as you wish, as you see.
The forms of stilettos, which are hidden among the aforementioned devices for the puncturing of tumors and are not perceived by patients, there are three types: large, medium, and small. And these are the forms of those [stilettos]:
The forms of cupping glasses with which the flow of blood is cut off, and there are three types; large, medium, and small; their forms:
They are made of thin copper, round with some length, and they are subtle.
And you must have these three types of cupping glasses - large, medium, and small - so that through those you can cut off the flow of blood quickly in necessity, and then it is not primarily medicine.
Here's the translation of the given sentence:
And sometimes those tools are made of other small instruments resembling scissors for physicians, according to this shape; through which blood is cut when phlebotomy is performed, or there is an incision of a vein or artery.
And sometimes they are made round according to this shape:
Chapter .47
Of the care for men's breasts which resemble those of women.
Sometimes the breasts of certain men become swollen when they begin to sleep, and then their breasts are also swollen and resemble those of women, and are often pendulous and flaccid.
And for those who have this, it is necessary to make an incision with a lunar section in this shape, from the line of B to the line of G, and then remove all the thickness, and fill the wound with medicine made from incarnation, and then sew up both lips of the wound with stitches, and care for him until he is cured.
But if the breast falls to the sides and is softened by its size as it should be in women, then it should be cut into two halves above each side with two lunar-shaped incisions, each of which should be contained within the other at the end of each one, so that the larger line contains the smaller one according to this shape from the line of B to the line of G. And then remove the skin that is between the two lips of the wound, and remove the fat, and administer what we have said about suturing and powders as necessary in the treatment until it is cured.
And if you do not complete the incision that needs to be made due to the distress of the patient and the flow of blood, then you must fill the wound with cotton soaked in corrosive ointment and leave it there until it has dissolved the fat, and then treat what remains so that it may heal.
Chapter 48.
About the perforation of abscesses that occur under the nipple.
These abscesses that occur under the nipple are of the species of scrofula, hard, and contain a pus that is black.
And of these, some contain moisture; and those that contain moisture should be incised with a lunar section according to this figure: from the line of G to the line of B. And when all that is in the abscess has been evacuated from the wound, then fill it with old cotton and leave it until the next day.
And then remove the cotton and treat it with appropriate ointment until it is healed.
And if the abscess is of the species of glands and scrofula, then you should incise it in the same way as we have said in the section on scrofula as well.
If the wound has spread so much that it causes putrefaction, then administer to them a cautery as previously described.
Chapter 49
On the incision of abscesses that occur due to an arrow or a vein.
When the arrow has broken and the attached cord is firmly set, then many abscesses occur. And the signs by which it is known that inflammation and abscess are due to an artery or a vein: for when an abscess is due to an arrow, it is long drawn out in the front of the body; and when you strike the abscess with these mentioned things, you feel in him what is called stridor.
And that which is due to a vein is round in the middle of the body.
And incision on this abscess is a mistake, especially in that which is below the armpits, in the groin, in the neck, and in many places of the body; and it is very large, therefore its treatment with iron should be avoided, and that which is in the extremities or in the head should be avoided.
But on that which is from them by inflammation of the orifice of the arrow, make an incision in the attached cord lengthwise; and immediately afterward, widen the incision with a hook near the arrow, and separate the tunic until it is exposed.
Based on the provided context and similarity to Latin and Romance languages, here's my attempt at translating the given sentence:
And then puncture the area between the two ligaments with a spatula until all the blood in it is released and the abscess is drained.
And then administer treatment in the form of powder until the ligaments fall off; and then treat that area with appropriate ointments, continuing this treatment until it is healed.
And if the abscess is caused by a severed vein, then it is necessary for you to hold water as close as possible to the abscess with your hand, and then insert the needle into the place where you have held your hand, and cause that [needle] to penetrate; and let there be a double thread in it until you extract it from the other side, and then tie off the abscess with a good ligature as I have told you regarding the grape ligature, with two parts and two ends of the thread.
But if you fear that the thread may be pulled out, then insert the thread with that needle through the entire abscess following the initial incision of the needle, and strengthen your threads in four places.
Then drain the abscess in its middle part until all of its contents have been evacuated; at that point you will incise the excess skin and let whatever is connected to it remain.
Based on the context and the similarity to Latin, Italian, Spanish, and French, here's my best guess for the translation:
"Chapter 1 about abscesses that occur due to twisted nerves.
Here is a translation of the given sentence:
And it is made on the patient's back in the places of the buttocks or the heel, or in any place where the joints are swollen.
And it is a serious abscess, and it resembles the color of the rest of the body, and it is located on the back without inflammation. When it is narrow with intensity, the patient feels like they are in a state of shock.
And it is not an abscess added in the front of the body, and therefore it is left alone, and it swells in all directions and does not go to the parts in front or behind.
Therefore, of those that are in the joints, it is not appropriate to be closed with iron, because it will quickly cause contracture.
But those that are on the head or forehead should be left alone with a bandage. But if it is a small abscess, then take that one with scissors and cut it off by reason.
And if it is large, then you suspend that one with a hook, and remove the pus, and then lift that off; and close the wound with stitches, and care for it until it is healed.
Chapter II
Of the incision of an abscess which occurs in the person who has one in the abdomen.
This is a complex sentence that describes some sort of medical condition or phenomenon in the body. Let's break it down line by line:
"And I have already seen one, and in their belly were two threads which looked like mushrooms, and there was no difference between those whites, for a small reason.
"And already the lips of those were turned inside out and split, and moisture flowed from them constantly.
"So I inserted those and found in one eighteen worms, and in the other six worms.
"And the operation for their insertion is that you consider if the patient is moist, and the color of the wound is white, moist, and subtle; then you insert them with a wide spatula, and there should be cauteries in your presence in the fire, because many times the moisture of it must be expelled from him; and if you see blood, cauterize that.
"And if the patient is weak and fearful, be careful with inserting iron; instead take freshly made lead fillet and strengthen the wound with that in the manner we have mentioned; and let it sit for two days.
"And then tighten the lead thread in the constriction of the wound; therefore, do not cease to strengthen the lead greatly in the thread, until it is cut and falls out by itself without effort.
"But if it is of large size, then at its appearance there is cause for fear and dread, especially if it is in the abdomen.
"But it is possible that you cut off most of it, and then cauterize it so that it does not return.
"And then care for the patient until the wound is healed.
"And be careful not to cut one that is dark in color, with little feeling, and growing slowly, for it could be cancerous.
"And I come to mind about the crab in this manner.
"Chapter 52
"On the treatment of an inflamed navel.
"An inflamed navel can be caused by several reasons; either by fissures of the intestine which is on the belly, and from it comes out the tissue or bowel as in other ruptures; or by blood that flows from a vein or artery as mentioned before, or by trapped wind within it.
"But if it is due to a fissure of the intestine and the protrusion of the tissue, then the color of the swelling will resemble that of the body; and it is painless, and appears in various places. And if it is due to the protrusion of the intestine, then place the person in the position we have previously described, with even more intense diversity. As you press on that area, as mentioned, it will be hidden, and then return; and it is quite easy for them to stay in that position, and it is greatly enhanced by a very hot bath and strenuous work.
But if it is due to humidity, then it is like a lion and does not hide when pressed with your hand, nor is it constricted or reduced.
And if it is due to blood, then you will see the abscess appear with blackish discoloration.
But if it is due to rotten flesh, then the abscess will be heavy, large, and hard, and will feel like a lump according to its size.
But if it is due to gas, then touching it will feel firm.
And the treatment in this case is to consider whether the umbilical prominence is due to an injury to an artery or vein, or to gas; then it is necessary for you to be prohibited from treating it, because there is fear and danger as has been taught to you in the chapter where I spoke about abscesses caused by injury to an artery or vein.
Here's the translation of the provided text:
And then carefully spread the middle of the aposteme on the cloth and insert your finger into that indentation; and if you have found and secured it with the cloth, then extract the hernia and push it back to its original place inside the abdomen.
And if you have found the cloth, then grasp it with tweezers; and cut off its excess parts.
However, if it is contrary to your bowels or veins, then go around that area, and return to your operation; take two needles and thread them with two strong threads, insert the needles in the circle you have made around the aposteme in the manner of a cross, making them penetrate; then strengthen the aposteme in four parts over the needles.
And if you wish, remove the needles and leave the place open so that the stretched flesh may close on its own; or cut it when it is healed and has closed, and then cure it with water from appropriate ointments until it is healed.
And if the protuberance of the navel is only flesh or due to moisture, then it is necessary for you to open the aposteme as we have said and extract the blood or moisture that you find in it, and then cure it with water that consolidates the place.
It looks like you've provided the title of a chapter or section (Capitol .liii.) rather than a complete sentence for translation. Could you please provide a full sentence from the text that I can help you translate?
From the treatment of cancer.
We have already said in the division about the species of cancer and how it is treated with medicines, and that a cure with iron should be avoided to prevent it from becoming ulcerated; we have also spoken about cancer occurring in the womb and the caution required for its treatment.
And the ancients said that sometimes cancer is in a place where it is possible to eradicate it, such as in the breast, which is located in the mammary glands or in the hips and resembles the limbs, and should be removed entirely, especially when it begins small.
But when it is old and large, one should not approach it, because I have not seen anyone heal from that, nor do I know of another who has been successful in doing so.
And the operation on it is when it is removed as we have said, that you should precede and let the patient fast and purge with black bile several times, and then bleed them if there is a clear swelling found.
Then prepare the patient with the preparation in which the operation is located, and then proscribe for him the foods that are beneficial for this; and then empty from every part with a good enema until there is no cause left of its roots. And let the blood run, and do not cut it off hastily, and press on the areas, and cleanse the thick blood with your hand or with an instrument suitable for you among the instruments.
But if there is an issue with thick blood from a vein or artery, then cauterize it until the bleeding stops, and then treat it with another treatment until it heals.
Chapter .4
About the care of those suffering from dropsy.
We have already mentioned in the division, the types of dropsy caused by water and the signs of each type, and the treatment with medicines.
And that which is cured with iron is only the type of edema alone, and it is not appropriate to use iron for the type of tympanites or for the type of ascites, because this is fatal.
And when you have treated this type of dropsy tympanites with medicines and your treatment does not work, then consider that if the patient has already been weakened, or if they also have another type of dropsy such as cough or abdominal pain and similar, then be careful not to treat them with iron, because there is danger in this.
Certainly! Here's the translation of your provided sentence:
It appears that the text is written in an older form of Spanish or Catalan. Here's a line-by-line translation into English:
"And then consider if the generation of dropsy is from the intestines, because at that time you should make an incision with the knife away from the navel for about three times the thickness of the fingers, on the right side of the patient above the pubic bone.
"But if the generation of dropsy is due to a liver disorder, then your incision should be on the left side of the navel for three fingers' width.
"And if the generation [of dropsy] is due to the spleen, then your incision should be on the left side.
"And it is not necessary for your incision to be on the side where the patient wants it, so that the superfluities do not run to that weak place.
"And then pierce the intestine with the instrument and insert it into that incision, and lift your hand with the spatula between the intestine and the abdominal wall, and you will excise it; and if its quantity is of a fingernail or less.
"And then pierce the abdominal wall until the spatula reaches the empty place, which is where the water [or fluid] is located. "And then extract that and insert an instrument of this form: And it resembles a delicate silver tube; it is made of silver or iron or bronze. At its lowest part there is a small hole, and on its sides are three holes: two on one side and one on the other. The end of it is cut in the manner of a pen, as you can see.
And at the upper end of it there is a ring, so that when the instrument reaches the water, they immediately place it on the instrument, which instantly evacuates the water in a moderate quantity. Because if you evacuate more than is necessary at the time, the patient will die soon due to the loss of their vital spirit, or they may suffer from shock, which is close to death.
But evacuate according to the patient's strength, and according to what their pulse and complexion indicate to you.
And after removing the instrument, retain the water that has been extracted, because as soon as it is retained by the chain that holds the hole at the top of the instrument, which I have described to you and recommended that you pierce in this manner.
And then repeat the procedure on the following day if you see that the patient is tolerating it, and extract a small amount of water each time, and do this for several days with caution, and beware of mistakes so that no water remains except a little.
Here's a line-by-line translation of the given text:
And cauterize on the stomach, and the spleen near the exit of the water, as I have recounted in what has preceded this.
Chapter 55
Of the care for children born with non-perforated urinary tract locations.
Sometimes one of the children is born from the mother's womb with an imperforated (or very narrow, or not in its proper place) urinary tract.
Therefore, it is necessary to make a small incision in the infant as soon as he is born with a very fine needle in this manner:
And then place a thin lead wire in the hole and tie it off, and leave it there for three days or four.
And when the infant wants to urinate, remove the wire and let him urinate; then replace the wire.
And if you do not place the lead, it is possible that the urine flowing over this spot will not escape through the opening.
But that one whose hole is narrow should be treated with a lead wire, as we have said, for several days until it widens. ️
But those in whom the hole is not in its proper place are said to have this condition, which occurs because, of these, the one born with the hole at the end of the penis cannot urinate inside the foreskin until he raises his penis with his hand on top; and it is not a hereditary condition, because the semen cannot reach the mother naturally, and it is a very serious illness.
Here's a line-by-line translation of the given text:
And be careful in your operation to control the bleeding, for many times this happens; and place something on the wound to stop the bleeding, and treat the wound until it is healed.
Chapter 56.
Of the disease which occurs in the foreskin of the head of the penis, and of corruption, blackening, and adhesion of the foreskin to the head of the penis.
Many times this disease occurs in the penis and is known as phimosis.
And of these, one is malignant and the other is not malignant.
Non-malignant, it is necessary that you suspend with a fine thread and cut it until it heals completely; then place a cotton pad soaked in Egyptian ointment on it; and then treat it with diafinicon ointment until it is healed.
And if the disease is malignant and black in color, then it is necessary that you apply cautery near its edge and root.
However, if the disease is in the foreskin of the uncircumcised penis, and one part of the disease is inside the foreskin and the other part is outside, then it is necessary that you remove the disease that is inside at first until it is consolidated; and then treat the one that is outside, because when you treat both the foreskin and the prepuce together, it is not certain that it will not be cut.
Sure, let's translate this into English:
And care for him with another treatment until he is healthy.
But if there is a flow of blood, then administer a lunar cautery in this manner:
for a healing cautery is useful in two situations at once, that is with blood flow and with the wound when it is corrupted.
And if the head of the penis is corroded and destroyed all at once, then you must insert a lead pipe into the meat of the foreskin so that the patient urinates through it.
In the adhesion of the foreskin with the head of the penis (and this adhesion does not occur except in one whose foreskin is healthy, and upon whom circumcision is not required; and when adhesion occurs due to a wound or an abscess) it is necessary that you scrape with a blunt spatula until the bond is dissolved and the head of the penis is released from all sides.
And if it is difficult to scrape these exactly, then you must scrape some of the skin from the head of the penis and the foreskin with a spatula, and this is because the foreskin, when it is thin, is easily perforated by its thinness.
And then separate the foreskin from the head of the penis with a very thin needle that has already been moistened in cold water to prevent it from sticking again.
And then treat it with a strong styptic until it is healed.
Chapter 57.
Of the cleaning of children and of the care for those who have undergone circumcision.
Circumcision is not like the treatment of other diseases: however, since it depends on our action and will, and mainly concerns infants, it is necessary to choose the best method and easiest way for them to regain their health.
Therefore, I say that the ancients did not call it circumcision in any of their books because they did not use it in their laws. The only reason we have acquired this practice through experimentation is that I have found the majority of skilled practitioners and barbers using a razor and tweezers for both circumcision and cleaning, and they use bandages with thread and closure with the nail.
And I have tried all these methods and found none better for cleaning with scissors, and bandaging with thread as in closure with the nail, because many times the glans escapes above, because the foreskin has two layers, and the lower layer remains, and it is very easy to slip again and cause pain. And with the cleansing that is done using alphecatis, which are digital and used by shoemakers, it is not ensured that the incision of the end of the male member will be closed properly, because it can easily enter into its hole.
But in an operation with a nail, avoid iron and do not let it corrupt your operation. And the child's umbilical cord is short by nature, and many times it has been seen in this way that there is no need for cleansing, and I have seen this myself.
But the cleansing that is done with scissors and bandages with thread, the good result of this experiment was discovered by me, because the scissors have a proportionate incision, for which reason the sharpness that is above is also like the sharpness below; and thus as you press your hand so proportionately between the two sharp edges, and cut in accordance with a comparison at one time; and it is made compression of the thread with a figure containing the umbilical cord from all sides, with which there is no error at all.
And the way of the first operation is that you make the child lie down as much as possible if it is one of those that understands a little, do not do anything else except tie the thread in its navel alone, and leave it until the next day.
And then make him happy in every way possible that he may receive his understanding. And then have the person stay between your hands, prepared and not frightened; and hide the scissors in your hand or behind your foot, so that the child does not see those or any of the other instruments.
And then insert your hand into the child's penis and blow air into it, pulling out any accumulated dirt or impurities from within.
The form of the forceps for modification is as follows:
The nails of the forceps should not be sharp; instead, one set of nails should be blunt and the other set should be sharp, so that the nail of the claw is not protruding, and the length of both sets of nails should be equal to the length of two handles.
However, the mistake in modification is that you should not completely or partially remove the inner chain; instead, you should insert it back into its proper place.
Therefore, you should extend that (the inner chain) at the time of your choice with your nail before the opening of the place and insert it according to equality.
And if you cannot hold it with your nail, then extract it with a hook and insert it.
But if three days have passed and the swelling remains below the inflamed area, then leave it until the inflammation subsides, carefully excise it, and insert it as you have prepared.
And be careful with the head of the rod, for that will not be good for it.
Therefore, treat (the area) with a powder that solidifies the wound, as we have recommended in the section on powders.
And if he has been cut too deeply from behind, and if you follow the guidelines above, it will not harm him.
But care for him as we have said until he is healed.
Chapter .58.
Of the treatment of retained urine in the bladder.
Retention of urine in the bladder is caused by obstruction due to a stone or clotted blood, or by sand or flesh, and similar things as we have said about the methods of treatment in the division.
And if it is not dissolved with what we have said and the cause is severe on the patient, then it is necessary to administer extraction from him with an instrument called a siringua, which looks like this: It should be of silver and hollow like a goose quill, as thin as a crow's feather, about a palm and a half long, and with a fine hole at the tip.
And the method of extracting urine through this is that you take the doubled thread and tie it to the patient's extremity with good firmness; and insert the ends of the thread into the part below the penis, and cut off any excess from the thread with scissors, but insert it firmly into the cannula. And then extend the penis with a border and an egg white mixture.
And have the patient sit on the chair, and puncture his bladder and penis with a mixture of oil and water.
And then insert the penis with ease until it reaches the root of the glans; and then bend the penis upward toward the navel; and then push the penis into that; and then push it in until it reaches the bladder, and this will make the patient urinate freely, and if this is not done in this order, but goes to the wrong opening.
And then gradually extend the thread with the wool, because the urine will wet the wool.
Then extract that [thread] and use it for the cure of urine retention. Use a penis-shaped instrument, do not stop doing this until the bladder is emptied and the patient finds relief.
I don't see any text after "Capitol .lix." Please provide the next line or paragraph for translation.
About the method of enema with a bladder and similar instruments, which must be suitable for this purpose.
When there is an ulcer or abscess in the bladder, or congealed blood, or it is constricted by pustules, and you wish to distill waters and medicines into it, then use an instrument called a clampcedra, and this is its form:
until its tip is blunt, so that it can be closed. And on it there are three holes: two on one side, as you see.
At the beginning there is a concave space, in which what is inserted is contained, and it should be sized according to the amount that is filled into it, without addition, until when some cause pulls out the humors from it, it is pulled out, and when it is expelled, water is poured into it, and when it is expelled for a long time, according to what the clampcedra does with which naphtha is injected in naval battles.
Therefore, when you wish to inject humors into the bladder, insert the tip of the clampcedra into the humors and pull with it the water that is inserted into the holes above, because the humors are pulled into the concavity of the clampcedra.
And then insert the extremity of the clapper into the penis as we have recommended in the surgery; and then expel the moisture with water that you are using, because that moisture will reach the bladder immediately, and the patient will feel that.
The shape of the subtle catheter with which the bladder is catheterized, and this is its shape:
And it should be made of silver or tin, whose tip should resemble a small feather, and after that, insert the tube inside gently.
And then take a goose bladder, and place in it the moisture that you want to introduce into the bladder, and then tie it between two with a strong double thread, and heat that moisture over the fire.
And then insert the extremity of the catheter into the penis.
And then press your hand against the bladder with the moisture until the patient feels that the moisture has reached the bladder.
But if you do not have a bladder, then take a piece of parchment and make a circle out of it; and perforate it all around its circumference; and then insert strong thread into those holes, so that they are turned over; and then add the circle as is customary, because you place in it the water that you want from the moistures, oils and waters.
And then you bind him to the instrument and do it similarly as you have done with the bladder, and press with your hand until the moisture reaches the bladder.
**Capítulo LX** (Chapter 60)
**About the Extraction of Stones.**
We have already discussed in the division the species of stones and their treatment with medications, as well as the difference between stones generated in the kidneys and those generated in the bladder, and the signs of these.
And we have discussed the stone in which operation with the hand and incision is performed.
And the stone generated in the bladder itself is that which is placed in the bladder.
And I will now describe it with a clear and concise explanation.
Therefore, I say that the stone generated in the bladder mostly occurs in children; and one of its signs is that the urine exiting from the bladder resembles water in its subtlety, and it appears with sand in it; and the patient often scratches his penis, and there are frequent painful movements, and it usually develops quickly; and with this, you will see the buttocks in frequent movements.  (Note: "yeys" is a misspelling of "veys")
And healing is easier for children up to the age of fourteen, and it is difficult to cure in the elderly. But in young people, it is more likely because they are among them.
And of that for which the stone is larger and the cure is easier; if it is small, it is contrary to that.
Therefore, when we come to the cure of this, it is necessary at the beginning that the patient be cleansed with a clyster which will extract all the crack that is in his intestines; for that crack sometimes prevents the expulsion of the stone due to its search for it.
And then the patient should be taken by the feet and placed upside down in order that the stone may descend into the mouth of the bladder or that it may jump out of its place sometimes.
Then make that cut between your hands ready, and let his hands be under his things, so that the bladder may be entirely made to decline towards the lower parts.
And then seek out all of it and bring all of it out.
Therefore, if you feel the stone in the space, then cut immediately with a scalpel over it.
Here's the translation for the given sentence: And you should apply the stone until it is under your tongue. And turn that little by little into the neck of the bladder.
Then press on that with your tongue and expel it outside the body through the incision site.
And command the assistant to press on the bladder with their hand; and command another assistant to extend the patient's knees upwards with their right hand, and with their other hand lift up the sheet that is under the patient's knees, in the area where the incision is made.
Then insert a spatula like this one, which has this shape: And cut into it what is between the anus and the thighs, not in the middle, but more towards the left side of the hip; and let the incision be on that stone and your finger be in the anus, and let the incision be transverse, so that the external incision is wide and internal narrow according to how much of the stone can be removed from him, and no more, for if you press too hard with your finger that is in the anus, the stone will come out effortlessly.
And know that there is a stone with angles and edges, for which reason the excretion of it becomes difficult because of this.
And that substance is like a grain of sand, and it is round, and its excretion is easy.
Therefore, if it is the one with angles and edges, insert it into the crack.
And if it is not so angularly shaped, then you should contrive over it, or strengthen over it with a suitable device, whose end should be like a file with which you strengthen over the stone, and do not let any of it out; or insert a fine instrument with a curved tip underneath.
But if you cannot do this, then widen the hole a little, and if you see blood flow, cut it off strongly with powdered vitriol.
But if the stone is more than one, then at first you put your hand on the bladder’s opening, and then cut over it; and then push a little near this; and do the same if there are more than two stones.
And if the stone is very large, it is unwise to cut it with a large incision, because two things may happen to the patient: either they will die or they will develop continuous dripping of urine, because the place is not completely healed.
Sure, I can help with that. Here's the translation:
Therefore, once you have completed your operation, then fill the wound with aloe gel and dragon's blood, and close it securely. Place a cloth soaked in oil and wine, or in rosemary oil and cold water, on the affected area to help reduce inflammation.
Then lay the patient on their back, and do not remove the bandage until the third day has passed.
And when you have removed it, wash the area with water and plenty of oil, and then treat it with finch oil and diachylon ointment until it heals.
However, if the wound develops a painful, burning abscess, and it appears as though blood is frozen in the bladder and urine cannot be passed (this is known by the passage of blood with urine), then insert your finger into the wound and extract that blood, because if it remains it will cause the bladder to rot and lead to putrefaction.
Then wash the wound with vinegar, water, and salt, and apply all kinds of spices, using whatever is most suitable for the patient's treatment until they are healed.
And it is necessary during all hours of treatment that you lift both cushions and adjust the medications placed on the area.
And if the stone is small and it is in the bladder, and it has been placed inside, and excretion of urine is prohibited, then cure that with water as I have recommended before, so that you do not reach dryness; because excessive use of this treatment is accused of causing dryness. And I have tested this, which is that you take a ferr alfelut perforator, and its form is like this:
with a triangular tip, sharp, inserted into a handle.
Then take thread, and tie the bladder below the stone so that it does not return to the bladder.
Then insert the iron into the bladder, piercing with ease until the perforator reaches that stone. And rotate the perforator with your hand around that stone little by little, and pierce its hole until you make it penetrate from the other side; because the urine is immediately released.
Then press your hand over where the stone has exited from the outside of the bladder, because that is sealed and drained with urine, and the patient is healed.
If this treatment is not within your ability for any reason that prevents you from doing so, then take a rope beneath the stone and another rope on top of the stone. And then place it on the stone in that forked area between two ligaments. And then extract it from there. And then unbind the ligament and cleanse the coagulated blood that is formed in the wound.
And it is not necessary to tie the rope under the stone, but only to prevent it from returning to the bladder, and the other rope on top, because when the rope is untied near the edge of the stone, the chain returns to its place and covers the wound.
And for this reason it is necessary for you, when you take the rope from above, to lift the chain to the upper parts, or you must return with your compliment, and cover the wound in this way as we have said.
Chapter 61
On the Extraction of Stones from Women
Stones in women are rarely formed
However, if a stone is seen in any of them, then the treatment of it is difficult and is forbidden by too many reasons.
"One of the reasons is that the woman is very young and a virgin.
"The second reason is that you do not find a woman who is knowledgeable enough to recognize herself when she is chaste, or one of the women who have husbands.
"The third reason is that you do not find a woman skilled enough in this art, especially the operation with the hand.
"The fourth reason is that the location of the incision on the stone in women is distant from the location of the stone, requiring an advanced incision, which is feared.
"But if necessity requires you to do this, then it is necessary that you take a midwife who is very skilled, and she is rarely found.
"But if you are deprived of her, then seek a physician who is skilled and subtle, or present a mature woman well experienced in the ways of women, or a woman who has some knowledge of this art.
"Therefore, have her present, and command her to do everything you ask of her, from the initial investigation about the stone; the reason for this is that she should check if the woman is a virgin, in which case she should put her finger into the woman's vagina and search for the stone." ➤
If it is found, cut it off next to its tip, and then command him to sit on it.
But if she is not a virgin, then command the midwife to insert her finger into the woman's vagina and press on the stone, while placing her left hand on the bladder and squeezing it strongly.
So if it is found, it must be gradually pulled from the orifice of the bladder to the groin with all its might until it reaches the height of the hip.
And then sit on that projection at the top of the vagina until it reaches the height of the hip, wherever it may be to him, and place the stone in that location, and let his finger not be removed from the stone while cutting below it.
And the incision should be small at first; and then insert the reed into that incision, and if it feels the stone, then adjust the incision according to the amount by which it knows the stone will come out of there.
And know that the species of stones are many: for there are small and large ones, smooth and rough, long and round, and those with edges.
Therefore, you should know which spices are from him based on what you indicate about what you want.
If you see blood flow, apply crushed vitriol to the area and let it sit for an hour until the blood is stopped, then return to your operation until the stone is removed.
And make sure to prepare with you the instruments that are mentioned in the extraction of stones from men, so that you may be assisted by them during your operation.
If you see blood flow and know that the bleeding is from the artery that has been cut, then place powder on the area and tighten it with clamps and stricture down, and do not irritate it; leave the stone and do not remove it, because the patient will quickly die. Then immediately treat the wound.
Therefore, once the bleeding has subsided after several days and the area heals, then you can return to your operation until the stone is removed.
Chapter 62
On incision for inguinal hernia.
An aqueous hernia is nothing more than an accumulation of moisture in the white scrotum that remains below the spermatic cord containing the testicle, and it is called a scrotum.
And sometimes it is in the proper tissue that nature has prepared for the baby, from its exit until another child arrives; and it is the chain of generation between the white cloth we mentioned, and this is not early but late.
And the generation of this hernia is due to weakness which occurs in children, because to them this material is infused, and sometimes it happens due to blows on the children.
And this humidity has many colors, because its color can be tending toward yellow or red, or pink, or black and dirty, or watery white, and the latter is the most common.
And the signs by which one knows that this accumulation of water is occurring are these: because if it is in the white cloth we mentioned, then the abscess is roundish and somewhat elongated like a figure of an egg, and the genitalia appear, because the humidity surrounds it on all sides.
And if the humidity is in the proper tissue, then the abscess is round like the shape of an egg and therefore it is believed to be another child.
And if the humidity is between the chain of the genitals and the white cloth, then it falls between the two.
And when you want to know the color of the humidity, then you test the color of the humidity in the abscess with a glass vial that is clear; and according to what appears in the residue of the glass, judge what is inside it.
Therefore, when we come to the treatment of him with iron, it is necessary that we command the patient to be bloodletted if this is possible for you, and then empty his body of blood.
Then he should be laid on his back on a somewhat high pillow, and soft cloths should be placed under him.
And then sit on the left side of him, and command the servant to follow on his right side, which extends its leg to one of the two sides at the groin of the thighs and at the opening of the navel.
And then take a wide spatula and cut the groin of the thighs from the middle place for the length up to near the penis.
And let the section be made straight and equally distant from the line that follows the pubic hair of the thighs, until it reaches the white bladder.
And cut that, and observe, and guard yourself by this, that you do not cut it; and your incision with which you cut must be made so that it is suspended with the most subtle and careful examination of the cut according to the amount possible for you.
"And then puncture the bladder full of water with a wide hole, and extract all the water.
"And then separate between two lips of the section with a hook, and extract the bladder in parts above; and do not touch the cord, the testicles comprehending, and cut the bladder in that manner as is possible for you. "And cut that [bladder] with its entirety or in pieces, especially the thin part of it, for if you do not carefully examine the incision of it, it is not certain that the water will not return.
"But if the egg proceeds from that outside of its cord during your operation, then when you have completed the section of the bladder, return it inside, and then adjust the two lips of the cord of the testicles with a suture, and then heal that as well as the other wounds, until it is healed.
"And if you find the egg corrupted by another illness, then it is necessary that you tie off the vessels which are above the suspension, and extract the egg, and then heal that with the water we have mentioned.
But if the water is divided into two equal parts, then you know that there are two hernias; therefore, incise that part in the same way as you did with the other one; and if it seems to you that it is a single operation, then you do it.
Then you clean the blood and insert between the sections wool soaked in oil or olive oil; and place another piece of wool outside, which you have soaked in wine and oil, and spread it over two cushions and the lower part of the belly. Place cloths and poultices on top and bind them securely with a bandage according to this method:
And then take two pieces of cloth and dampen them with wool soaked in this manner; make the ends with which you press with cotton or dampened wool, and attach them securely to the crotch of the undergarments, one end taking from the buttocks to the back, and the second taking from the groin area. The two ends should be placed on two cushions below and two other ends on two pillows, and all the binding should be secured in the crotch of the undergarments.
And sometimes this hernia is artificially treated with a cautery instead of a knife cut; and it is that you take a fine surgical cautery and inscribe with it the cord of the testicles, and it should be ignited according to what we have recommended until the white bladder containing the water is exposed. Then you take a cautery of this form: ...and it resembles the Greek letter.
Then you perforate that bladder with it, and keep it ignited until all the moisture is expelled.
Then you extend the bladder with hooks, and scrape it with hooks, and scrape it with a fine ignited cautery; and cut that as much as possible until you eradicate everything; and be careful that the fire does not touch the egg.
Know that this operation is safer and less likely to cause bleeding, and better than an operation with a knife cut.
However, if you encounter an abscess during the knife cut or during the cautery, or if there is bleeding, then it is necessary that you treat whatever difficulty arises for you with the cure that is appropriate to it, as will be said.
Here's a line-by-line translation of the given text:
Now it's time to lift the patient onto some raised surface. Then, pierce the abscess in its lowest part with a lance, and hold the puncture according to the length of the body.
And let the opening be wide enough for all the water to flow out.
Then place a cloth over the area and tie it tightly, so that the remaining water can drain. And then care for it until the wound is healed.
But if there is resistance to the expulsion of water at that time when you puncture it: and this happens only because the white layer in the orifice of the wound causes resistance and prevents the exit of water, then you must insert into the wound a pen or instrument with which water is extracted from bladders; the shape of which is previously described. Or adjust to the opening of the wound a small tube.
And know that the water will return, and it is expected to do so within a year or less; and when it does, then it should be punctured in the same manner, because the patient will thus spend their days in this way.

**Sobre la incisión en hernias carnosas y su tratamiento.**
**Sabes que en la incisión de esta hernia hay un riesgo significativo de pérdida y daño en los tejidos más importantes; por lo tanto, a mí me parece mejor la extracción de ella para salvar al paciente.**
**Y yo recuerdo la operación y los procedimientos para tratar los abscesos.**
**Así que digo que los abscesos se forman en los cuerpos cuyos tejidos son blandos y esto sucede por varias razones: ya sea por una aguda inflamación, que se infiltra en los tejidos, o por un golpe.** ️
**Y el color del absceso corresponde al color del cuerpo afectado, y no se siente mucho dolor, pero es un absceso grave.**
**Y el absceso de tipo lápiz es oscuro y no se siente mucho dolor en él.**
**Y algunas veces se forma debido a un nódulo en los vasos sanguíneos y por la inflamación de estos, de modo que ya se recuerda su presencia, o por la inflamación de las venas.**

Based on the context and the similarities with Latin, Italian, Spanish, and French, here's a line-by-line translation of the provided sentence:
Therefore, if the egg has already become solid with those meat additions, then you should extract the egg and insert that (new mixture).
If there is an adhesion due to some cause of the intestine or between what is between the bowels, then you should free all that adhesion and insert it through a round incision.
However, if there is a native flesh growth at the site of the adhesion that is behind, then you should insert everything that comes from it and extract the egg as we have said.
Therefore, once your operation is complete, then fill the wound with wool soaked in oil and wine; and then care for it with another treatment until it is healed.
Chapter .64
About the treatment of a hernia that affects the bladder.
A bladder hernia is an abscess wrapped in a membrane similar to the scrotum, with softening of the testicles, and makes it difficult for the patient to move or walk.
And in the treatment of this illness there is fear because of what it is preceded by.
However, we must say that the operation on it should be done according to what the first (doctors) did.
And I say that it is necessary to place the patient on an elevated seat; and then separate the testicles from the scrotum; and then take hold of the penis with your said fingers and with the thumbs that are known at the base of the penis; and let another minister assist you, and stretch these (testicles) with great force.
And then make an incision with a sharp scalpel transversely to the right of the vessels until they are exposed.
And then remove all parts in the same way that we have described in the removal of arrows which are in the temples.
And then place in those a double-threaded needle, and tie it first at the top of the places where the veins are cut, and tie it again at their base. And then make a straight incision in the middle of those according to the length of the body, and extract whatever is accumulated from the foul and corrupted humors.
And then treat the wound with the same care used for other wounds in which you wish to encourage healing so that the veins may close, because one of two things will happen: either it will be healed or it will not be healed by this.
Here's a line-by-line translation of the given text:
Chapter 65
"On the treatment of intestinal hernia.
"The occurrence of this hernia is due to a section that opens in the cipher extended over the belly from some of the angles of the wonders of the belly, so that descending the intestines from that rupture reach some of the intestines.
"And this rupture is either of the cipher or its exit, and these two species occur for many reasons: a blow, a jump, a shout, an elevation due to some serious cause, or similar.
"The sign of this, when it is due to extension of the cipher, is that it occurs little by little over a long time and does not occur suddenly, and there is an abscess inside the belly because the cipher presses the intestine.
"And the sign of it is when it is due to section of the cipher, for at first it causes intense sudden pain; and there is a different abscess appearing under the navel, which is due to the protrusion of the intestine, and its body in the parts outside the cipher.
"And sometimes the tunic is forgotten with the intestine, and this type of intestinal hernia is called 'sacculated'.
And sometimes it is caused by flatulence, and sometimes the intestine has a tear in it, which is retained here, and this is very detrimental to the patient, and sometimes it causes severe pain, especially when pressed.
And in the treatment of this kind of disease with iron, there is danger, so it should be avoided.
And the method of operating on this is that you command the patient to return the intestine with their hand to the inner parts of its cavity if it obeys the return, and then place them on their side between your hands, and lift their legs up.
And then stop the spermatic cord which is the cord of the testicles on top, and cut the spermatic cord all along its length; and then place in two lips of the section two needles as needed to open the section with them.
And if, according to your ability, the opening from which the egg comes out can be enlarged.
And then carefully remove that piece of skin which is left after the spermatic cord, until the hard white skin of each part is exposed.
Based on the provided context and similarities to Latin, Italian, Spanish, and French, here's a line-by-line translation of the given text:
Here's the translation of the given sentence:
Based on the context of the previous lines, it seems that this passage is discussing a medical procedure related to intestinal issues or hernias. Here's a line-by-line translation attempt: "But if you find any swelling in him, then expose it to the belly and leave it there.
"Then make an incision in the area below the testicles, through which blood and pus will flow as we have described.
And immediately administer wool soaked in oil and place it on the wound; and administer the bandage that we have recommended (and sometimes a white cloth is cauterized, which we mentioned earlier for fear of excessive bleeding, because this often happens). Then leave the bandage until it falls off by itself.
But if the bleeding is delayed, then dip a cloth in hot water and place it on the area until it falls off, as we said before.
And then treat the wound with the other usual treatment for wounds until it is healed.
Chapter 66
Of Windy Hernia
In this case of windy hernia, it has not been seen that anyone has been bold enough to treat it with iron.
And the first ones said that it should be treated in the same way as we have recommended for hernias with air; which is that you tie the vessels near the incision gently on it; and then dry in the middle of the area around the abscess with water that opens that, until the vessels fall off.
And treat the wound as we said until it is healed.
Chapter 67
About the dislocation that occurs in the joints.
Sometimes there is a fracture in the joints as we have said, and it protrudes from the place.
And [the physician] should not give any cause to the intestines for the intestines; and if he does, that is little; and it returns in all hours.
But if the time is prolonged with that, there is an appropriate fissure in the hip until it descends into the hip; and this happens because of the extension of the hip which is in the joints as we have said, which cause is that the hip is extended, and then it becomes soft and the place is swollen and protruding.
And its cure is with a cautery as has been previously stated in this account.
And sometimes it is cured with iron in this manner: and that is [for] the patient to lie on his back between your hands, and then dry the place of the fracture of the protruding swellings with a section according to the length following the quantity of three fingers.
And then strengthen the white hip which is under the skin until it is exposed.
Here's a line-by-line translation of your provided text:
And then you should lift the two prominent places at the end of the thigh bone and secure them with stitches, one with the other.
And then remove the end of the thigh bone and do not cut off all of the hip, nor extend the hollow, nor any other cause as I will teach you in the treatment of intestinal hernia.
And then treat it with the treatment of wounds, and when you have cut the threads, clean that area and restore the wound until it is healed; because the hip is constricted and the prominence of the rupture is not adjusted.
A cautery is better in this place, for it is closer to healing.
Chapter 68
On the softening of the cord of the testicles.
Many times the cord of the testicles in some men is softened because the flesh between that is softened, and it is feared for him.
Therefore, it is necessary for the one who treats this condition to make the patient lie according to his back, and cut off all of the softened cord above the natural cord; and then join together two lips with stitches.
And if you wish, in the beginning, soften the excess of the cord with three or four boilings and secure it firmly with stitches.
Then incise between the stitches; then treat with other treatments until it is healed and the threads fall off.
Chapter 69.
Of Castration
You should know that castration is forbidden in our law; however, it has been reported to me that I remember it in this book; and the remembrance of it is not necessary except for two reasons: one is so that it may be known by the physician when he is asked about it, that he may know the treatment of the man on whom it happens. The other reason is that we often have need of castration of other animals for our livelihood, such as horses, oxen, pigs and similar animals.
Therefore, I say that castration is performed in two ways: either by torsion or by incision and cutting.
But in the case of castration by torsion, the way to perform the operation is to make the animal sit in hot water until its testicles are softened and lengthened and hang down. And then take those with your hand into yourself until they are resolved and do not appear under the touch.
But in case of castration done by cutting and sectioning, it is necessary that you hold the animal and press its spermatic cord with your left hand.
And then tie the suspensory ligament, and make an incision on each testicle with one cut until both testicles are processed.
Then cut those bladders that you have each peeled off. And do not leave any of these on the intestines for any reason, except the thin membrane that is above the bladder.
And this method of castration is better when done by squeezing, because squeezing strongly leaves nothing of the testicles so that the animal does not desire coitus.
Then tend to the wound until it is healed.
Chapter 70
On the treatment of hermaphrodism.
Hermaphroditism in men occurs in two ways: one is when it appears that the space between the spermatic cord of the testicles is like a woman's vulva, which has hair.
"And sometimes from that place there is a release of urine which is in the scrotum.
"However, in women there is a kind: and it is that the vulva of the woman on the penis is similar to two testicles of a man, a little smaller at the opening like the foreskin of a man and two testicles.
"And the treatment consists of three kinds: two for men and one for women. "And it is necessary that you insert those fleshy parts until the swelling subsides, and then treat them with the remedies for other ailments.
"And in the second type of men where there is urine in the scrotum, there is no cure or treatment for it.
"Chapter 21
"On swelling and prominent flesh due to causes of women.
"Prominent flesh due to natural causes should be compressed until it resolves, and care should be taken; sometimes in some women it becomes so prominent that it spreads like in men and continues during intercourse.
"Therefore, you should hold the swelling with your hand or a cloth and insert it.
And do not hesitate at the end (of the procedure), especially on the vein of the face, so that there is no flow of blood.
Then care for it with treatments for wounds until it is healed.
But flesh that is born is flesh that is born within the horrible matrix of the mother until it fills it, and it leaves the parts outside according to its appearance (and for this reason some call it "tail-like illness"); therefore we must cut as we would cut a leech, and care for it until it is healed.
Chapter 72.
On the treatment of arthritis.
Arthritis is when the vagina of a woman is not pierced, or it is too narrow. And it is either natural or accidental.
Accidental is due to previous illness, and this can be caused by poorly matched flesh or subtle or thick sperm.
And it occurs either in the womb of the mother, or in her hips, or in her upper abdomen, or in her lower abdomen, and it prevents sexual intercourse, pregnancy, and childbirth, and greatly hinders menstruation.
And the recognition of that is done by observing the mother, if the opening is apparent, then it is certain; but if not, then you should search for it with your words or with a ray.
But if the opening is subtle and close to the two lips, then you cut and break it open.
And place them over the two lips of the vulva, and then place your index fingers on both sides at the same time.
And let the woman be on her back, with her legs spread, and then separate the two lips with force until that subtle opening is broken and the orifice is open.
And then take wool and dip it in oil and place it on the spot, and have a man watch over it during the day to prevent the cut from healing.
But if the opening is large and thick, then you should cut it with a scalpel or with a myrtle leaf.
But if the opening is fleshy, then suspend it with a hook, and cut it.
And you should have with you the medicines that stop bleeding without biting, such as agave, dragon's blood, and mugwort, mixed with egg white.
And then administer a wide lead canula so that the wound does not close too quickly.
And keep it there for several days, and administer some dry lint to it.
And then it should be treated with the other method of consolidation until it is healed.
And sometimes this happens during childbirth to other tissues, and then you should proceed in the same manner. But if this is due to cancerous abscesses, do not perform any surgical procedure on the cancerous abscess that is present in the womb.
Chapter 73.
On the care of hemorrhoids, and tail, and red boils which occur in the vulva of women.
Hemorrhoids are considered to be caused by openings of many veins, from which blood flows continuously; and old hemorrhoids become thorns.
And I have already said in the division the species of these and their signs, and now I will say which ones receive treatment and which ones do not receive treatment.
Therefore, I say that hemorrhoids and thorns, when they are in the depth of the womb and do not appear to the senses, then no surgical procedure should be performed on them.
Here's a line-by-line translation of the given text:
And it is necessary that you place the woman in a cold bath and immediately extend her with scissors or with a rough cloth, and incise those [areas] with the razor.
Then immediately sprinkle on those [areas] the flow of blood from one of the powder jars without piercing, as is done with hemostatic powders, such as oak galls and similar ones.
Then immediately wrap the feet in linen for an hour, and then place her in cold water.
And if the bleeding persists, then make that one sit in a decoction of sumac and pomegranate peels and rose petals and similar things.
Then immediately take barley flour and mix it with honey, vinegar, and water to make a poultice on the back of him/her.
And if the blood is drawn out, that's good; and if not, apply two cupping glasses, and to the nipples without scarification.
Then immediately take wool and soak it in coriander juice or rosemary juice or thyme juice with vinegar and apply it to the area; then treat the area with ointments until it is healed.
"And heal that one so that he is made well.
"Chapter .74.
"A rupture of the intestines occurred in the mother.
"Many types of swellings occurred in the mother, such as crab (cancer), lupine (lapindent), ulcerous, abscessed (adhubelat), herpetic, fistulous (fistulas emorroyas), gouty (raguarrias), tetter (thyl) and other swellings. "And I have already described these illnesses, their types and their signs, and their cures in the corresponding section.
"And I want to say in this treatise on the abscess that appears in the mother when it is one of the healable abscesses, and if you want to know how the operation of it is done with iron.
"Therefore, you should consider if the pain of the abscess at its onset is sharp with throbbing, fever and redness, and if it hurts upon touching it, then do not cut it open with perforation, and heal it with remedies that promote maturation until the acute symptoms subside.
"And then you should place the woman on a board that has two handles; and let her lean back on her heels and adjust her feet to be lower than her belly, and let her legs be spread apart, and place her arms below her knees, and bind each one with a suitable bandage.
And then the midwife should follow from behind and to the right of the mother, holding the instrument with which she has opened the maternal orifice; its form will be described later in this text.
And it is important that when you administer this instrument, you insert the tip into the vagina of the woman, and ensure that only the tip of the instrument enters the mother, guiding the patient gently. However, if the instrument is larger than the tip of the vagina, then you should place cloths over the vaginal opening to prevent any part of the instrument from entering the vagina.
And it is necessary that you place the handle of the instrument towards your right, and the person administering the instrument should hold it and turn the handle until the maternal orifice is opened.
And when the child appears, and it is touched with the hand and is clean and wet, then you should dry that part of its head with a Latin sponge.
And when the mucus is expelled, then you should place a cloth soaked in rose oil or green oil, containing some hemostatic herbs, on the wound; and place a pressure pad at the vaginal opening.
And place outside, at the mother's (or midwife's) feet, a clean wool cloth soaked in water in which malva flowers have been boiled.
And it should be treated for about two days with an ointment that you need to apply until it is healed.
And sometimes the mother and the wound are washed together with water and honey until they are healed; then with water in which a root of lily or aristolochia longa has been boiled; and then return to the ointment.
And if the wound is inside the mother's womb, then you should be forbidden from treating it with iron; instead, treat them with water as we have said in the division.
Chapter 75.
To teach midwives how to treat pregnant women when they are sick with a swollen belly, which is not natural.
It is necessary that the midwife knows the signs of natural childbirth at the beginning. This means that when you see the woman push with her thighs and desire to smell the air, and she becomes relieved because of what is happening during labor, and hastens the expulsion of the fetus, then know that this birth is according to the natural figure, and it is the delivery of the child head first, and the second part either hanging or dangling from the navel.
When you see these signs, it is necessary to press the abdomen of the patient so that the baby descends gently; when they descend onto their head, give them a secondary birth, and cleanse those excesses with good cleansing.
But the one who comes out in this manner is not natural and not praiseworthy, because when the baby exits with its feet first and its body before its head, or one hand by the foot, or the head and one hand come out together, or the head comes out before the body, it can easily be turned onto its neck, and the appearance of this is not praiseworthy.
It is therefore necessary for the midwife to be wise and discerning in all these matters, and to guard against error and deception.
And I am showing you every figure of these, and what kind of birth is in them, so that it may be indicated by this and have been noted accordingly.
When the baby comes out headfirst by natural effort, and this is violent toward the woman and difficult for her, and sometimes her strength is already weakened, then perform this operation: let the women hold him, and evaporate his head with fenugreek boiled in water and with warm oils.
And then insert the midwife between her thighs with a small spatula and open it with that second one, or scratch it with her nail until the moisture inside it comes out. And press on the woman's belly until she delivers the child.
But if it does not come out, then the woman should be anointed with small bird droppings and fenugreek seeds mixed together.
And then command her to be pressed and make her sneeze with condiments; and hold her mouth and nose shut for an hour, because the child will soon come out. 😊
And if both hands of the baby have already come out at first, then you should gently push them back in little by little. But if it does not obey the treatment, then place the woman on her knees and raise her feet up, and then suddenly drop the knees to the ground; and have someone hold the woman so she does not fall because of the sudden movement.
And if the hands are not turned back inside and the baby dies, then cut them off and pull out the rest of the baby or tie its body to its hand with cloth and pull it out that way, because it will soon come out.
When the fetus comes out feet first, it is necessary to pull its legs upwards and then turn the small fetus, and then push it back in, and then take one of its legs and stretch them little by little.
But since it has come out into the thighs, then you command the woman to push, and make her cough with conditions, because she will give birth if God wills it.
And if she does not give birth with what we have recommended, then you gradually return the small fetus until you place it according to its natural shape, because in this way it will be born with easier delivery.
And if it is still not delivered with all that we have recommended, then take marshmallow and dissolved gum, and pound it well in the mortar, and then anoint the woman's vulva with water, as low as her belly. And then make her sit in lukewarm water until she achieves the hips.
And when you see that the parts coming out of her are softened, then do fumigation with myrtle and place it underneath her. And when you have smoked them with sub-fumigation for an hour, then make them sit on a chair, and immediately make them sneeze and expel the smoke from their mouths, and remove it from them, and apply gentle pressure to the lowest part of their abdomen, because this will cause the stool to exit quickly.
Based on the context provided and the similarity to Latin, Italian, Spanish, and French, I will attempt to translate the sentence line by line. Certainly! Let's break down the sentence and translate it line by line:
If he cannot walk, then place him on the bed, and shake his limbs vigorously with a violent shaking, and immediately administer liaments which I have recommended for mucilages.
If labor has begun, then place her on the birthing stool, and study the delivery of the hand, and guide the baby according to natural shape, and make the woman sneeze and command her to push until she is delivered.
The baby is delivered on the back of his hand, with his hands expanded and his face towards his mother's back. Let the midwife take the baby’s hand and then slowly turn him until he is face down.
And when he is born and guided, then place on his head what we have recommended of oil and mucilage.
Then command her to expel little by little, and when you have done this, then make her sit on a birthing stool and command her to lean over the right side, and then command her to push; and make her sneeze with force. The prepared fetus exits on the side.
When they suffer from fear of the mother according to this manner, consider, and then you should cut the foreskin with your fingernail until it is drained of moisture.
And if the fetus is suspended above the face and neck of the mother, then you should cut the umbilical cord to prevent it from being retained and causing death.
And then you should carefully deliver the fetus by parts until you place it in the appropriate position, and instruct the woman to press gently on her abdomen, and the fetus will be expelled with ease, if God wills it.
The birth of twins or multiple fetuses. Know that twins are born from multiple conceptions, and sometimes three or four are born at once, but this is rare and extraordinary; yet there are certain causes in nature that bring this about, and not by chance.
And note that if they are multiplied, each one has a foreskin and is separated by the navel cord of each of them; sometimes they are expelled as if it were a single fetus with an easy natural birth, and sometimes they come out in an incredible manner, as we have mentioned.
And if there are difficulties with their childbirth and it leads to what we have said about unnatural figures, then cure those as we have recounted.
And if the midwife is skillful and acts with ease and delicacy, and with slowness, and is ingenious according to every figure as it has been prepared by ingenuity leading to health.
Remembrance of that which is formed in the womb from embryos and is aborted.
Sometimes a mother carries one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, even ten or more formed fetuses, and it has been verified that a woman has aborted six, and another ten, all fully formed. The cause of this was done by the measurement of the glorious wise.
And all this should be known by the midwife, for she may quickly perceive the similarity of these things and thus apply herself accordingly.
Chapter 76.
Of the extraction of the fetus when it is dead.
When you cure the dead fetus with what we have said in the division of the medicine and it is not yet expelled, and you must necessarily use an operation by hand, then it is necessary that you consider if the woman is of sound constitution and is not with any of the accidents through which there may be danger for her.
Here's a line-by-line translation of the given sentence:
Here's a line-by-line translation of the given sentence:
And then you should moisten the patient's mouth with a mixture of olive oil, honey, and fenugreek seeds.
And then anoint the midwife's hands with those oils and mixtures, and then gently insert her hand into the patient, and then carefully search with her hand for the location where the nails are lodged in the foot.
And in these cases: then consider if the patient's body is prepared for the procedure. Then place the nails in their heels, neck, mouth, palate, under the beard, sternum, or near the ribs and hip areas.
But if the nails are descending into their feet, then place them in the soles of the feet or in the middle of the ribcage.
And it is necessary that you hold the nails with your right hand and place the curvature of the nail in the space between the thumb and index finger of your left hand. Then gently insert your hand until the nail reaches the desired location.
And then place and fix another nail or the third one if necessary, so that it is equally drawn and not extended along its straight path alone.
Here's a line-by-line translation of the given sentence:
And it is necessary for the person that there be something soft between them; and if any part of them is retracted, then it is necessary for the midwife to anoint some of her fingers with oil and insert them gently and turn with those parts that are retracted.
Therefore, if the baby's head is forgotten (i.e., not delivered), then move your fingers to a place that is more open; and do this until the entire baby is delivered.
However, if one hand is pushed forward and it is not possible to reduce it due to the constriction of the baby, then a cloth should be wrapped around that hand; and then carefully extract it until all of it is delivered, and then cut it off at the wrist or elbow.
And do the same for the other hand and both feet.
However, if the baby's head is large, or there is difficulty in delivery due to its size, or there is water in the head, then it is necessary to insert between the fingers a thin spatula and split the skull and extract the water, or discover that with an instrument called "alundat", the shape of which will be found with the shapes of other instruments in the chapter following this.
And similarly do this if the injury is of great severity by nature: and then it is necessary to incise that with an almagret, or that it takes that with alundas as we have said; and then extract the bones with forceps.
And if the head is swollen and constricted, you must slit open the throat until the moisture that is in the feet has been released.
But if it is not complicated and does not respond to swelling, then you should incise the head as soon as possible, according to what seems best to you.
And if the sides of the abdomen are swollen or in dropsy, then you should puncture it until the moisture that is within it flows out.
But if the injury is on its feet, then its attraction is light and its direction towards the mother's mouth is also light.
But if the abdomen and feet are constricted, then you should extract it with a cloth that you have wrapped around your hand, and slit open the abdomen and feet until the fluid within them flows out.
But if the other members are missing and the head returns, then the midwife should insert her left hand; but if the mother's mouth is open, then she should insert her hand into the lower part of the uterus, and with that she should search for the head, and pull it towards herself with the aforementioned until it reaches the mother's mouth, and then she should insert one or two fingers into it, and pull it with those.
And if the mother's mouth is constricted by an abscess that occurs in her, then it is not appropriate to prick it with a lancet. Instead, it is necessary at that time to administer infusions of moist, fatty substances. And apply plasters; and have the patient drink waters that soften and moisten.
And if the abscess is on the side of the head, then if possible, it should be lanced; and the same treatment as mentioned for a living abscess should be administered.
And if this is not possible, then it should be incised in pieces, and the contents should be extracted.
And one must ensure that no cause remains inside the abscess.
And once you have completed all your operations, then administer the treatment that we have mentioned for treating abscesses that occur in the mother.
And if bleeding occurs, then give stiptic waters and administer the other treatment.
And I have seen a woman whose womb contained a dead fetus, and upon this there was another fetus adhering, and this other fetus was also dead. A long time has passed since the mother developed an abscess in her navel; it swelled until it burst open, and she began to push out arms.
And I was called to care for him and treated him for a long time, but the wound did not heal.
And then I placed on him some strong-acting plasters for various reasons, and an bone came out of him, and after a few days, another bone came out; and I was very amazed, as there are no bones in the belly.
And then I thought that they were the bones of a dead fetus.
Therefore I examined the wound and extracted many bones from it, the woman being in her sixth month of pregnancy, and she lived in such a manner for a long time, until a small arm came out of her.
And I did not consider this to be strange, but rather because in this there is science and help for the physician who performs manual treatment for healing.
Of the shapes of the instruments that are necessary to extract the fetus.
The shape of the hook with which the mother is opened:
This is the shape of the strengthener in which the lips are cut, with two hooks at each end of its two feet. However, this hook should be more subtle and narrower, and it should be made either of ebony or boxwood.
And let the width of each post be two fingers and the margin of each also two fingers, and the length of each is one palm and a half; and in the middle of two posts there are two adjustments of this same post which are already fixed, whose length is more than half a palm, and the width of each is two fingers or a little more.
And these two additions are inserted into the mouth of the mother so that it is open with them when you turn the two aforementioned screws.
Another form similar to that, but more subtle and lighter:
It is made of ebony or boxwood according to the likeness of forceps. However, at its end there are two additions like these, and the length of those additions is about one palm, and the width of each is two fingers.
And when you want to open the mother with these, then you make the woman lie on her back with her feet hanging off, opening what is between her thighs. And then you open your hand with the instrument in the same way as you do with forceps, according to the amount you want of the opening of the mouth of the mother until the midwife does what she wants.
"The form of dizziness which the ancients called:
The form of vertigo by which the object is propelled.
"The form of dizziness with which the head feels heavy.
"And it resembles a pair of tongs with teeth at the extremities, like this, and sometimes it is made long like this pair of tongs according to this form, like this, with teeth like those that cut and press down. "A less common form of dizziness:
"The form of a hook with a spine:
"The form of a double-hooked spine:
"The form of a knife with two edges, with which the head is cut off.
"The form of two broad knives:
"All these instruments are exercised, and the more the species of them are multiplied and prepared by the artisans, the easier it is for their operation and the more beneficial they are to men due to their quantity.
"And do not neglect to prepare these instruments wherever you may be, for the need of them is inexcusable.
Based on the context provided and the similarity to medieval medical treatises in Romance languages, "De extraccio de la segondina" likely means:
When the placenta is retained after delivery, you should instruct the patient to hold her breath, and then make her sneeze forcefully, and place your hand firmly over her mouth and nose. If the placenta is expelled by this method, it is good.
And if not, then you take a sponge and pierce it with a hole, and place in that herbs that burn the mouth of the mother, such as calamus, rue, anise, camomile, Arabic scordium, cassia wood, and santolina. All these herbs or some of them should be soaked in water in the sponge, and place that over the fire.
And then insert a reed into the mother's mouth and hold it there until the vapor reaches the cavity of the mother.
And then make her sneeze as we said before, and the placenta will be expelled quickly.
But if this treatment is still not effective and the placenta has not been expelled, then you should instruct the midwife to submerge her left hand in sesame oil or a mixture of althea, and then insert it into the vagina and search for the placenta with her hand. Once she has found it, she should grasp it firmly but gently, and if it is adherent to the uterus, she should insert her hand as we have recommended, and when she finds the placenta, she should extract it little by little, straight out, so that the mother does not suffer from violent contractions. Before it is necessary that the right and left ribs be moved with ease.
And if the mother's mouth is constricted, we have already recommended the treatment with snuffing and with a medicine made from olive oil and herbs.
But if it has not been forgotten with all the causes that we have recommended, then be careful not to act on it in repetition of extraction, but rather place what comes out of him into the mother's mouth, and then cauterize that with ointment and tetrafarmacon; for this will make it putrefy and will dissolve and be forgotten after a few days.  (Note: "tetrafarmacon" is likely a medical term that does not have a direct English translation, so I left it in the original language.)
But when it becomes putrid, it is a very bad thing for the head and stomach, and this harms the patient; therefore, appropriate fumigations and remedies should be administered at that time.
But some of the ancients have already tried a fumigation made from dried figs and narcissus.
Here is a possible translation of your provided sentence into English, maintaining a similar style to the example you gave:
"It should be made of glass or iron.
"And the thin end should be placed in the cone and the wide end over the fire, and the incense should be placed on the coals of the fire.
"And keep doing this until that incense is completely burned away and then repeat with another one.
"About the treatment of an infant's unruptured anal fistula.
"Many infants are born with their anuses not yet open, which is called a thin and narrow passage. "Then the midwife should open this passage with her finger; if not, she should open it with a sharp spoon, and make sure not to touch the sphincter.
"And then place wool soaked in oil and wine on it, and treat it with an ointment until it is healed.
"But if you fear that it may become narrow again, then place a catheter in the opening for many days, and remove it when the child wants to defecate.
"And if narrowing of the anus occurs due to the healing of a wound or abscess, then that healing must be cut open, and then it should be treated with the water we have mentioned for treating wounds and lead.
It seems like you're trying to translate a medieval medical text. Here's my attempt at translating the given line:
This is a challenging text due to the archaic language and potential regional dialects, but I'll give it my best attempt at translation:
"And it is a fistula or hemorrhoids.
"And when that swelling is old and exudes white, watery humidity or subtle pus, sometimes some of these fistulas penetrate.
"And those penetrations are known by what comes out of them in the form of discharge and flatulence; and sometimes the patient uses these openings for discharge, and it is easy for worms to come out of them.
"And sometimes some of these fistulas penetrate into the bladder and into the opening of the penis; and sometimes they penetrate into the joint of the thigh and into the groin.
"And this is how a penetrating fistula in the rectum that does not penetrate is recognized: you insert your finger into the anus, and when it is not too painful, introduce a thin probe of iron or lead into the fistula.
"But if there is pain in that area, then introduce a thin probe of lead or horsehair into it until you feel the probe or hair with your finger.
"And if you do not feel that at all and there is no discharge of any kind, neither worms nor flatulence, as we have said, then know that it is non-penetrating, and then proceed to the treatment.
Based on the provided text and similarity to Latin, Italian, Spanish, and French, I'll translate the sentence line by line:
Based on the context and similarity to other Romance languages, here's a line-by-line translation of the given text:
And in all those fistulas that penetrate, there is no complete cure, and the cure for them is labor and futility of foolish doctors upon which they insist.
But in the one that does not penetrate and is not ancient, healing with iron is hoped for, as I will tell you, and this which I have already proven.
And have the patient lie between your hands upon their back and lift their legs up into your arms, the cushions should be inclined towards their belly, and then gently introduce a probe of lead or iron if it is in the fistula opening, until you know the place where the probe passes through.
And if that part of the patient is around the anus, then it is necessary for you to insert your finger therein at that place.
And if you feel the probe in your finger already penetrating by itself, or if you feel between your finger and that part some flesh or skin, then you know certainly that it is penetrating; and therefore do not work on it, for there is no cure in it, as we have said.
But nevertheless, some say that it heals in some men late.
And the treatment by which healing is hoped for in him is that you heat up a fine cautery according to the width of the fistula, as has been said before, and introduce that heated instrument into the fistula until it reaches around the anus; and then repeat this two or three times until you know that all those fleshy parts of the fistula are tightened and resemble a quill of a bird's feather.
And then care for that [patient] with bandages wrapped in linen until all those attached tissues are healed, and then care for them with medicines to heal and strengthen the flesh, and if it is healed, it is good; and if not, then it cannot be cured at any time by another treatment.
If the thread enters [the body] and does not penetrate into your finger which is in the anus, and between that and the thread there is a slight thickness of flesh or skin, and sometimes the fistula appears on the surface of the coccyx, then dry the coccyx from the beginning of the fistula, and you will see if it dries with the thread, and let it be in the fistula until the desiccation reaches the place where the end of the thread comes out, and through the thread it is liberated and cut off.
And then clean those fistulated tissues which resemble the quill of a feather, and let none of them remain for any reason.
But if there is a flow of blood when you operate on those tissues, then it is good to cauterize with fire or a sharp instrument, because cauterizing with fire has two good effects: it adheres the tissues together and dries up the moisture.
And immediately care for that with cloths wrapped in wool or in clean fabric until the place gets warm, and then treat the wound with ointments made from hardened meat, which stimulate growth and healing.
And so are the medicines that have astringent and drying properties; when restored, it is healed and you need not fear recurrence.
But if the fistula has already penetrated into the buttocks and is extended to the surface of the body, then insert your finger into the anus and examine it with that.
And thus if you find a band or membrane of fat or flesh between you and it, and it is close to the opening, then do not operate on it directly but rather through faith and hope.
Therefore, treatment should be administered in one of three ways: either by cauterizing it as we have said; or by drying it out until you can reach the cavity and insert the necessary instruments for proper care; but do not proceed too much with drying to avoid cutting into the intestine, which could lead to an accidental release of feces on the part of the patient without their consent. And then treat that area with water as we have said, because it will heal quickly; or extend and clean out that membrane, and dry it out near the anus, either with a probe or another sharp instrument, and then cleanse the fistulized flesh in the dried section to the best of your ability with dressing. And then strive to completely heal the wound with drying, and if the pus-filled opening is not healed and the fistula remains open near the anus, it will be easier for the patient to pass stool. And sometimes the fistula ends in this manner: it is when you insert the probe into the fistula, and it emerges from the side of the anus around the surface of the body with the cord and on the margin of the anus. Then take a perforated tip probe, which is like a needle used for preparing hearts in this way:
And insert it into that fidel, wrapped in five threads or around those; and then insert the probe with the thread into the fistula until you reach its cavity.
However, if it penetrates into the margin of the anus deeply inside, then you extract the thread from that hole in such a way that you insert your finger into the anus; and you pull out the end of the thread and join the two ends together, and tighten each one, and leave it like this for a day or two. And when the thread is more incised into the flesh, tighten well until those fleshes between the two ends of the thread are incised and come together.
Then care for the wound until it is healed and consolidated.
However, if the orifice of the fistula is not penetrating, then make it penetrate by any method you are prepared for, so that it is very thin, because it is not your task to do this in order not to incise the skin; and then proceed with that until it is healed.
The form of the spiny spatula with which the fistula is pierced: the tip of which is very sharp and the other end is not sharp, so that you do not introduce anything unnecessary, as sometimes happens.
Of stitches for hemorrhoids in which blood runs during the insertion of those.
Hemorrhoids are of two types: either they appear in the rectum like small lumps of coal, or they may be like a bunch of grapes. And these can be small or large, and blood may constantly run from them, appearing as one or many, and they may protrude from the anus, and appear at the extremities of it.
However, those that protrude from the anus are generally of less liquidity, from which runs citron-colored water or a little blood with clots continuously, and they appear according to the color of the body.
And the treatment for those that are inside the anus is to instruct the patient to sit and press until the anus protrudes and the hemorrhoids appear to you. Then you cut and suspend with scissors what you have grasped with your nail, and then you should cut them off at their roots.
This text seems to describe a medical procedure for treating an unspecified condition affecting the nails. Here's a line-by-line translation: And then treat those with the other treatment until they are healed.
And if the feces do not obey evacuation, then give the patient an enema with a small nozzle, and wash them with the water that is in the colon, so that it obeys evacuation lightly when the patient is pressed.
But if the hemorrhoids are outside the anus, then their cause is light, and it is that you should take them with your finger or with a hook, and squeeze them, and then treat them with the water we mentioned until they are healed.
And for those that you have squeezed, it is necessary to administer sutures in this way: take a thread wrapped around and insert it into a needle, and then extract the hemorrhoids from the divided parts above, and make the thread penetrate with the needle into the root of the other part, and wrap the two ends of the thread around the part below the needle, and tie them tightly; and bind the hemorrhoid with strong strength, and then cut the thread and extract the needle.
Do this to all [hemorrhoids], and leave one of them open, so that the excess blood can flow from it.
Based on the context and similarities with other Romance languages, here's a line-by-line translation of the given sentence: E aproximadamente deja entrar el líquido; y cuando se haya vaciado, trata la herida con ungüentos u otro tratamiento hasta que esté curada.
And since they are old and not valuable in that medicine, then it is necessary for you to scrape them with the point of a spatula or with your nail until they become moist, and place the skin of those [pus] on top; and prohibit those from healing; and then care for them until they heal.
And then you remove them with intense pus until they begin to bleed and become raw; and then care for them until they are healed.
Know that leprosy is the key, and it is not unless the night is red according to the color of the body similar to a clove head, and it appears throughout the body, especially in the parts below the feet and at the fingers, and through these pains you must treat them.
And then it is necessary that it be cut out what is in the circle of the nail, and held with tweezers or pincers, and eradicated from its root; and then care for that.
And if you wish, cauterize it according to what has been said in the previous chapter.
But a wart is a small, rough, round excrescence on the surface of the body, and they are often seen in children more than adults.
And the treatment for this is to extend and compress it, or tighten it with a bandage or with leather that is not too tight. And if you wish, cauterize it, as we have said, with fire or with sharp medicine.
But a formica is a small elevated or large fistula on the surface of the body, and when the cold reaches it, it is felt like a formica bite, and it occurs around the body.
The treatment for this is to take a hollow pen made of goose feather or vulture feather, and it should be strong. Place the canula over the formica until it contains the circle of the canula from its edges; then rotate your hand with the canula until you compress what is around the formica, and place it on the flesh, and thus eradicate the formica from its root.
And if you wish, do this with an iron or iron needle in this manner:
Let the tip of the needle be fine and blunt (that is, not piercing) and wrapped in such a way that the touch of it on the finger should be gentle and the rotation of it should be slow.
And if you want to cauterize a fly [or an insect], do so according to what was previously said in the chapter on cauterization of insects.
Regarding the forms of instruments used for treatment.
Sometimes cauterization is done with silver, or lead, or melted or hammered iron; and sometimes these instruments are made small or large according to those for whom they are used, because that which is used in the treatment of small children should be small; and for those whose buttocks are freckled or painful, their cauterizations should be small.
The shape of large and few [cautery irons]:
The end of the tube on which the bag is tied should be wide in this manner; and there should be a distinction where the bag is tied, as seen here.
And the lower end of the tube, which is inserted into the rectum, should be blunt (i.e., not open) like a lion, beyond subtility; and on one side of it there should be two holes, and on the other side one hole, and the width of the hole should correspond to the thickness of the rays and slightly larger.
And let there be a bag in which are placed the medications of animal bladder or sheepskin, and its size should be one palm.
And let it be punctured with sharp needles in such a way as it is turned; and if the space that is between the needles is the thickness of a finger.
Then insert strongly the crude bile into those needles, which should be from the same needles or envelop them; and fasten with it the bag; and when the bag is placed on it, tightly seal its opening between two distinct parts with strong constriction, and then sterilize each needle with it: However, the method of sterilizing with it is that you fill the bag with the medication, which should be warmed according to the patient's tolerance level; and be careful not to make it too hot or too cold.
Then let the patient lie on their back, and raise their legs high and place a stool or something similar underneath them; then anoint the tip of the cautery with oil or egg white or fenugreek mucilage or something similar; then insert it into the rectum gently, then the attendant should take the bag and squeeze it with both hands until all its contents are expelled into the intestine; then remove the cautery and let the patient raise their legs to the wall.
And if the medicine causes that person to vomit, let it be so as much as possible; and if he sleeps with that for a whole night, it is better for healing.
And if you treat that person for abdominal pain and his vomiting ceases, then you should continue using the cautery until he is healed.
And if there are hemorrhoids or painful swellings in the anus, then let it be gently and delicately cauterized, as infants are treated with cautery.
On treating wounds.
I have already said in the division of wound treatment what is appropriate for this book, and now I say that their treatment with the hand and with medicines should be complete.
Therefore, I say that wounds are classified according to how they were made and the place where they occur.
And the causes by which many times wounds are made are also like these: discharge of stone, cutting with a knife or sword, striking with a spear or club, arrow, or similar to those from many other causes.
But the wounds that are in the places of the body are such as: a wound that falls on the head, or the neck, or the feet, or the belly, or the chest, and similar to those in the limbs.
And I am recommending the treatment of some diseases, so that you may apply this reasoning and rule to other diseases as well.
And I will begin with simple head ailments, for the memory of composite ones will come at the beginning of the third chapter.
Therefore, I say that when a simple head wound occurs and it is not a fracture, consider: if it is caused by the impact of a stone or something similar, and the cord has already been severed only slightly and the wound is large and you fear the formation of an abscess on that patient, then be cautious and perform a trepanation of the cephalic vein immediately; do not delay this; and extract from him as much blood as the strength of the patient allows, unless there is some other cause prohibiting trepanation, especially if the blood that has come out of the wound is little.
And let the trepanation be on the opposite side of the wounded part; and keep the patient from stuffing, heavy food, and coarse meals.
But if any cause prevents him from having a light meal, then let it be reduced to food and do not approach meat or wine.
And place on the wound, if an abscess is forming on it, a piece of linen soaked in rose oil or in wine that has been made astringent.
"But if it is certain that there is an abscess, then place a poultice on the wound. If it is recent, use its own blood and unchanged air, and add to it a little of the powder I will mention shortly.
"And if the air has already changed it, then place on some salves until it is healed.
"But if the wound is large or deep and has an irregular shape, and its edges are not closely approximated by nature, then approximate those edges with stitches as I will describe to you about the method of stitching.
"But if the wound is exposed to the bone and sinew, and there is no retention but only a small suspension, then incise it and treat the wound with medicines, and restore the flesh in its place as best you can, and instruct the patient to eat foods that are oily: heads and poultry of a similar kind, until it heals.
"And if you find putrefaction in the flesh and it does not adhere to the bone, then cut away all that is rotten and remove it, and treat it accordingly.
"But if in these wounds there is an artery or vein from which blood can flow, and it has not been divided by medicines, then inquire about the artery, and if you find that it is not cut, then cut it with a spatula, or tie it off; and if necessity compels you to do what we have said you cannot do, then cauterize until the blood is divided.
And if these sores are simple and small, then their cause is light; thus, you should sprinkle this powder over them because it hardens before the air changes them.
And the method for the powder is this: take one part olive oil, two parts dragon's blood, and three parts of fresh wax; let all be well sifted and sieved, and with it fill the sore, and press it down tightly until it sticks well to it and coagulates with the blood.
Then strengthen it above with a bandage and leave it alone, and do not remove it until it is healed, because the medicine has not been taken from it until it is cured.
And sometimes this alone helps, when you do not have olive oil and dragon's blood at hand.
And also perform this same operation on large wounds when it is necessary to cover them and bind them tightly, and these fresh wounds with their blood, which the air has not altered.
And if the air has altered them, especially in summer, then this powder is not suitable for that purpose. But then treat them with the water we mentioned earlier, so that you place over them some thick unguents, or sprinkle over them powdered barley flour mixed with water and honey until they crust over; and then treat them with the other treatment until they are healed.
But if you encounter a small bone fracture with the injury, then extract it using tweezers.
And I will explain the treatment for skull fractures as follows:
For injuries to the neck.
But if the injury occurs in the neck, there is no difference in treatment from a simple head injury.
But if the nerves or arteries of the neck have been cut, then if it is the nerve, there is no remedy for it except to avoid any treatment that causes vigorous constriction, such as applying ziniar and zegi which are vitriol and similar substances, because they harm the nerves and contract them. And do not place anything on the wound that causes heat, because the substance of the nerves is cold and its continuation is with the brain, which is the most important of all members.
And if it is treated with light medicines, such as being washed with sweet water, sometimes infused with rose oil or non-rose oil, and poulticed when washed with sweet water and the other stones diminishing according to this manner, and moist ointments.
If the wound is large, then administer stitches, or sew up its lips, and then treat it with powders until it is healed.
But if the wound is deep or if pus has collected in its lowest part, then pierce it in the most depressed place.
But if an artery has been cut in the wound and blood is flowing, then separate or dry it up, or bind it tightly, or cauterize it if necessity requires it.
But if the gullet has been cut or completely severed and the neck veins are saved, then you should stitch the lips of the wound along the length of the throat and do not touch it; before that, equalize it and return it to its natural shape, and then strengthen it with a suitable bandage, and leave it for some days; and then treat it with ointments that contain hemostatic and stimulant properties until it is healed.
But if the wound has penetrated to the bone and splintered it, then you should percuss it, and if there are fragments of bone in the wound, extract all that you can; and what is not apparent to you, leave it until the wound putrefies, and the foreign body separates, and the pain of it is relieved.
And if the wound is recent, then sprinkle over it the powder that has been recommended to you. And if in the wound a fistula is formed, then cure it with water, of which the recipe will be found shortly in its respective chapter.
If it is a piercing by lance or dagger and you see blood coming out of it, then consider whether there is any air escaping when the patient exhales; if so, know that the wound is mortal.
And if there is not much depth and the wound is recent with its blood, then in the first hour you should sprinkle on it powder so that the blood does not remain at the bottom of the wound and return to the heart and kill the patient; instead, put on it an attractive ointment, and do this twice a day.
And if the ointment is not at hand, then place on the opening of the wound cotton soaked in water from the dew; and make sure that the patient sleeps on the wound so that the moisture in it flows out.
Here's a line-by-line translation of the given text:
Here is a line-by-line translation of the given text:
If the wound is due to a cut from a sword or knife and it's simple on the surface of the foot or back, then cure that with water preceding stitching if it's large, or with powder if it's small.
But if the cut has reached the bone and heavy pieces have fallen off it, then you turn the wound to extract those pieces if they are separate. But if they are not separate, then leave them inside so that the wound may heal, as their removal is difficult.
And for other wounds occurring in other members, the same treatment in care is the same treatment that we have said.
Of the wounds of the belly.
The disorder which occurs in the belly is either great, small, or moderate.
A small wound is difficult to treat in any other way, and you know that their reduction is more difficult if you do not pay attention to the introduction of them into their place immediately, because it swells and thickens, making its treatment difficult.
"And therefore the best incision is the middle one, because with that one it is not difficult to return the intestine, unlike the two previously mentioned types.
"And know that the closure of the belly is done in four ways, but two closures are common and appropriate for the closures of other diseases of the body.
"And the other two closures are more specific to other diseases, but nevertheless they are most specific for the closure of the belly.
"And I will recount to you each one with an explanation and description.
"Therefore, I say that when the wound is small and there is some cause for the intestine through it, and it is difficult to return it, then this is in one of two ways: either because of the smallness of the incision as we have said, or when the intestine has swollen due to the coldness of the air.
"And therefore when it is so, then you should scrape that place until you can insert a sponge or cloth dampened only in lukewarm water, or boil it with vinegar, cumin, pepper, and cloves in order for the swelling to be resolved.
And sometimes this is done with a substance that has astringent properties, and it is better than water alone in reducing the swelling.
And when you see the swelling has been reduced, then you should moisten the intestine with water in which althea and mallow have been steeped, because by this means it is relieved of its inflammation with little pain.
But if the intestine of the patient has been removed, then perform this treatment: cut the opening a little with an instrument used for cutting hemorrhoids.
And the primary treatment is better when it is performed so that there is no cutting, and there is no need for drying and weakness.
Concerning the instrument, see its shape:
One part of it is twisted and sharp, while the other part is not sharp. The tip should be fine but not as fine as a needle; instead, it should be somewhat blunt at the end.
And so when the wound is enlarged and the intestine protrudes, then its reduction should be according to its natural shape in its proper place, if possible on this [water]. For it is better that way.
But when the opening is large and is in the lower part of the abdomen, then you should make the patient lie on their back, and raise their legs higher than their head; and if it is in the upper part of the abdomen, then place the patient's head and feet higher than their middle.
And similarly, if the disruption is in one of the two parts of the abdomen, then always place your attention and consideration on it so that the part where the wound is located is higher than the other.
And thus you must administer this to both large wounds and smaller ones.
And in the case of small wounds, place what you have prepared on them, and then ensure that the one administering it is between your hands, with the entire wound held by their hand and the lips of the wound sealed, so that there is no cause for another suture.
And this is the common method of suturing: take a needle, or count the needles according to the width of the wound; then pass through the edge of the disruption on the little finger, and pull the thread taut, ensuring that you do not sew both ends of the string with two ends of the needle, but rather leave the end of the thread outside between the parts within, until you make that penetrate into that part; and having added two ends of the thread and two ends of the needle, you have made four stitches.
Certainly! Let's break down the text and translate it line by line:
And the needles should be moderate between thickness and fineness because fine needles lightly cut into the flesh; thick ones are difficult to insert into the vein, so they should be moderate in both fineness and thickness.
It is not necessary that the needle be placed at both ends of the vein too close, so that the flesh is not lightly cut and the wound opens before it heals.
And do not extend the stitches, so that the wound is not prevented from healing.
Then cut the ends of the needles so that they do not irritate the patient during their sleep; and you will place on the stitch powdered dust expanded from every side, which has the ends of the needles; and leave those until you know that the wound has already healed.
And this kind of stitching with needles is most suitable for small wounds, because only one or two needles are used in their stitching.
But the second kind of stitch is common: it is that you join together with a stitch the four ends, of the vein and the two ends of the skin, in one go, with a needle on which thread is wrapped equally in fineness and thickness.
Based on the context and the words used in the sentence, here's a line-by-line translation:
And place between each stitch the amount equal to the thickness of the smallest finger.
And this stitch is known as a "whipstitch".
And with this stitch I sutured the wound which was inflicted on a man's belly, and he had been wounded with a knife, and the disruption of the wound was greater than one palm, and it protruded from the intestines around two palms from the middle of the intestine, and the disruption was in the middle of the member; and then I reduced that after the intestine had been out of the wound for twenty-four hours.
And the wound was healed within fifteen days or thereabouts, and I cared for him and he recovered; and after that he lived for many years, and led an active life.
And the other doctors had judged that he would not recover; and it was a miracle, for I did not treat him with ointment, because it was in a place where ointment or any medicine could not be found, but I placed cotton over the wound twice a day and washed it frequently with honey water until he recovered.
But I will describe two types of stitches according to the account of Paulus (Aegineta).
And it is that you should begin with the suturing of the tendon, and insert the needle from the outside to the inside.
And then, with the needle penetrating the tendon and the ligament according to its length and straightness throughout the entire body, leave the end of the thread at which you have inserted the needle; and make the needle penetrate from inside to outside in the other end of the middle.
And then when you have done that penetration, you should do it again in the same end of the middle from outside to inside; and leave the thread's end that is on this side, and make the needle penetrate in the other end from inside to outside.
And make that penetration with the same thread you used to suture, and ensure that all of it penetrates into the end of the middle that is on his inside.
And then begin from this same side and sew it with that end which is on the other side of the thread, and extract the needle from the tendon which you have penetrated, and then return that to the tendon and sew the end of the thread which is on the other side with this end of the middle; and extract that from the tendon which is on his part.
And do this one time and another, and do this one time close to another until you sew everything that is outside according to that example.
And the summary of this method of suturing is that you sew with leather thread, with which you sew the hairs, so that you sew one end of the thread from the part near the tail and leave the other end until it is completed.
But the second type of suture, which they call likewise Gualia, and about this one he speaks and recommends it, is that you sew that according to symmetry with which some doctors sew it, so that all its divided parts are joined together in their corresponding part by nature; and apply the end of one to the other end of it, and this is done as I recommend to you.
Be sure to insert the needle into the end of the thread at your fingertip, then make it penetrate that part from outside to inside in one stroke, and leave two ends of the thread; then turn the needle around and make it penetrate from outside to inside in two strokes.
And then you should turn each of these [parts], and make each one penetrate from the inside to the outside in two opposite directions, except for those that are on the contrary side.
And this manner of stitching is better than common slight stitching, and it is the stitching about which a previous mention was made.
This is the text from Gaul
And some may say to you, "The stitching of the abdomen is done with two needles." So it is that you insert into these [needles] a thread on each one. Begin with the insertion of the needle where you should, and make it penetrate through to the other side according to the stitching method used for those who have had their hearts removed equally.
And know that when the rupture is in the middle of the abdomen, then its stitching is more difficult than in other parts of the abdomen.
But the judgment of treatment for a wound is the same as for other wounds.
The reason is that when you find the wound recent with its own blood before the air has affected it, and you have reduced the intestine and closed it, then place on it powder for flesh formation.
And if the air has already altered the wound, then place on that sore ointments which are at your disposal until they form a hard scab and close the wounds; they should be ciphas and mirated; and then treat it in this manner as with other wounds until it is healed.
But if you do not have the medicines at hand, then apply to it immediately, as it begins to ooze pus and blood, and change that twice a day as you have been taught, until it is healed, because you should not need any other medicine in most cases when the wounds are simple.
But if you fear that the wound may spread and affect the main limbs, then it is necessary for you to dip wool in oil of good quality, or in rosemary oil, and place it around the circumference of the areas that are between the joints and under the armpits.
And if there is pain or putrefaction in his intestines, for many times this happens, then cauterize it with black stiptic beets, and especially if the putrefaction has penetrated into the intestine and has made a perforating exit into its cavity.
And know that which is of the large intestine is of lighter healing than that which is in the small intestines.
And it is difficult to heal because the intestine that is called "gegunu" does not receive healing from any wound that falls on it; and this is due to the large number of veins in it and the size of those veins, and the subtlety of its body, and its proximity to the nature of nerves.
But if what proceeds from the wound is the intestine, and you manage to get it fresh, reduce it according to your skill in the same way you reduce the intestines likewise.
But if it has passed into the space and has already turned green or black, then you should strengthen that with oil on the spot that is darkened by it, so that blood flow may come, for in the intestine there are veins and arteries.
And then insert that which is another ligament, and place the two ends of the oil hanging from the side of the wound outside it, so that on you may be alleviated the attraction of the intestine and the emission of the arm of the wound.
Based on the pattern you've provided, here's a line-by-line translation of the given text:
When a rupture occurs in the intestine and it is small, then it may be possible to restore it in some men, for this reason: I have seen a person who was wounded in his belly with the blow of a lance, and the wound was on the right side of the stomach. The wound had become old and formed a fistula, from which excrement and gas were issuing.
Then I proceeded with the healing of him, even though he was not fully cured, but I followed that method to ensure that it was healed and the place became consolidated.
And I told the patient that he could resume his normal activities after the injury to his belly; and no one was afflicted by this misfortune or experienced any complications in their habits of eating and drinking, and then he entered a bath and followed my instructions.
And some experienced ones said that when a wound occurs in the intestine and it is small, then it should be tied in this manner: and it is that you take maggots with large heads; and then adjust the two lips of the wound and place one of those maggots on the two lips of the wound so that when it bites onto them it strengthens its mouth and does not dissolve.
And then place another ant near the first one, and do not stop doing this with ants one after another according to the quantity of the entire wound.
And then reduce the swelling and close the wound; let those attached heads remain in the intestine until the intestine is healed; and do not cause any harm to the patient.
And it is possible to tie the intestine with a thin thread made from the animal's intestine attached to it, since it is more in need of a needle; and this means that you take the end of these intestinal threads, and it should be very thin, and then tie the end of it with thread around it, enveloped, and then insert that thread with needles and close the intestine with that, and reduce it in the rupture.
And this method of suturing with ants is nothing but a way of trust and hope.
But if the wound is large and wide, especially if it is in one of the thin intestines, for then there is no remedy but to remove it, and it will not heal completely.
Of the treatment of hemorrhoids and fistulas.
Certainly! Let's translate the sentence line by line:
Sure, here is the line-by-line translation into English:
And in some men, it is moist, which causes the arm to swell; and very quickly, the moisture is absorbed within a few hours. And sometimes this moisture is moved, and it is little, and it is thick, and it is subtle.
I have already shown all those causes, their signs and how to treat them with medicines in the division.
And it is necessary that I teach you the treatment of a fistula, which is caused by an operation with the hand.
And know that fistulas can occur in all parts of the body; for there are those which reach the large veins and arteries, or the nerves, or the bladder, or the intestines, or the bladder, or one of the ribs, or one of the vertebrae of the back, or one of the compound joints made by composition such as that of the hand and foot; and there are those which are close to the main member and resemble it.
Therefore, of these fistulas, that which is according to this manner is one of the difficult-to-cure illnesses, and it does not accept treatment, and dealing with it is labor and ignorance.
And if there is any of the fistulas whose depth does not reach these places that have been mentioned, and you wait for and hope in its treatment, and you wish to reach knowledge of it, then take a probe of iron or steel, and if the fistula goes straight, seek it with it.
But if the fistula is twisted, then seek it with a thin lead probe, for lead, due to the lightness of its body, bends and follows the twist.
And if the fistula has horrible words (i.e., is causing severe pain), it is not possible for you to understand or comprehend them by attempting to communicate with the patient.
Therefore, irrigate the orifices with syrups, for the moisture used to irrigate them will disperse the other orifices and flow out of them.
And then inquire carefully according to whatever method is possible for you to know if there are bones or nerves here, and whether the cavity of the fistula is distant or near, or if it is a fistula with terrible words and all this is within your power, along with your understanding and skill in treating the patient, and discovering the cause of the pain you should apply pressure with your hand over the area, similar to the signs and symptoms associated with the abscess.
And when you have considered all these causes with certainty, then proceed to the treatment with confidence: and it is that you should consider whether the fistula is apparent and near, or in a safe place, distant from a joint, or a nerve, or an artery, or a vein, or one of the places I mentioned to you.
Then you should dry out the fistula according to what was said earlier about its appearance, and remove whatever is in that discharge, including corrupted flesh, anything born from the orifices of the flesh, as well as pus and similar matter, and treat it until it is healed.
Here's my translation of the provided sentence:
And do this with some vinegar, until the sharp medicine dissolves all that is soft in the cavity of the fistula of the corruption.
And then restore it with ointments that promote healthy flesh until it is healed.
But if it does not heal in this way, then you should cauterize it as we have recommended.
But if the cause of the fistula is bone and you are certain of it, then you should investigate it and dry it out as we have recommended, unless there is any obstacle such as a vein, nerve, or main member, as we have said.
But if the bone is exposed and there is any corruption or blackness in it, then you should scrape it until all the corruption is removed; and then cure it with water that causes flesh to grow until it is healed.
And if it does not heal and continues to discharge as before, then know that you have not reached the total eradication of the corruption; therefore, discover it again with great care and make a thorough scraping and cleansing of it with the strongest vinegar you have, and then restore it.
E therefore if it is healed, it is good; and if not, then know that this corruption is in the deepest part of the body, which has not been reached, and thus in that case, you should only leave it alone.
And if the bone is slightly corrupted, and it is possible for you to extract it, then use fine forceps suitable for this purpose.
And if there are many bones, then carefully extract all of them, and leave none behind with your strength.
But if any moisture causes resistance, and you have no fear or doubt in your incision, then cut those ligaments or flesh that may be here, and deliver the bones.
But if you are not prepared to remove the bones at that time, then place something over the wound to soften it, and leave it until the flesh and ligaments around those bones have dissolved, and ensure that the wound does not close or become constricted in your operation.
Finally, if you are afraid, place a cloth soaked in oil or a cloth soaked in Egyptian ointment, or any of the other ointments on it. For when those ligaments have rotted and the bones are separated from them by absorption, and the attraction to them is relieved.
Here's the translation for the given text:
Sure, let's translate this line by line:
And I recommend that you find something similar in a man's thigh, to use as an example and aid in your operation.
And there was a young man about thirty years old who suffered pain in his thigh due to an internal abscess that had traveled from the inside of the body until it reached the thigh, and this abscess was very large and had not been caused by any external factor.
And so the time passed with him because of the doctors' mistake until the abscess burst, and various materials came out of it. His treatment was then stopped until his thigh was fistulated (punctured), and in him there were many orifices that all exuded pus and the humors of the body.
And then many doctors treated him for about two years, but none of them knew more than the art itself, until I was called in.
And I saw his thigh and the materials that were coming out of those orifices in great quantities; and already that man's body was totally yellowed and his color was citrinous (yellowish-green).
And then I inserted a probe into one of those orifices, and the probe reached the bone.
And immediately I examined all the openings and found that they originated from every part of the thigh.
And then I cut and incised one of the openings which I entered, discovering a piece of bone, and found it to be corrupt, already rotten and putrid; and I discovered that a part of the thigh was also corrupted where it had penetrated into the marrow.
And then I removed what had been revealed and prepared from the exposed bone.
And I thought that it was not in the bone but rather the corruption which I cut away and removed, and I had already shaved it off.
And then I applied healing ointments to the wound for a long time, but it did not heal.
And then I probed and discovered again on the bone according to my first discovery, and found continuous corruption with the bone.
And I removed what appeared to me of that corruption, and then I was determined to perform the treatment and restoration of it, but it did not heal.
And then I exposed it again and did not stop incising the bone little by little specifically, and I persisted in the restoration of it, but it did not heal until I had incised around a palm's width of it, and that I extracted with its marrow, and then I restored that with medicines, and it healed lightly and was cured.
Certainly! Let's translate the provided sentence into English line by line:
And so it is healed by complete healing, and there is nothing hard like bone in that place; and the condition of his body has been improved, and his strength has returned to him; and he can move around without any difficulty or harm in any way.
And if there is a bone protruding in the affected area, then you should proceed as follows: take a ligature and tie it firmly around the end of that protruding bone; have someone extend that part; then place a thicker wool ligature over the first one; next, tie it to the flesh below the bone, extending the end so that you can pull the skin apart; and expose the flesh in the area where you want to cut, so that the saw does not cut into the flesh.
And place a stick or board beneath the bone properly, because when you do this, it is not permitted that the saw cuts into the rotten flesh.
And it is necessary that the sawing be done little by little in the rotten place, because if it is in the cavity of the bone and does not appear to the touch, it will require another sawing.
The text appears to be discussing the treatment of infected or broken bones. Here is a line-by-line translation:
And let the stitch be according to the location of the corruption, a little, as we have said.
And if the corruption is in the joint, cut the corrupted joint and saw the bone where it continues with the other part.
And if the corruption is in the continuation of two joints, then it is not in him by reason but by chance.
And if the corruption is in the palm of the hand or the sole of the foot, it is very difficult; however, you must find out in what manner the corruption appears to you, and scrape it away, and cleanse it according to whatever condition is possible for you, and with each instrument let it be rectified to your satisfaction, when no vein or nerve resists you.
And know that the knives and saws for cutting these bones are varied according to the position of the bones, and their preparation, and their thickness, and their fineness, and their size and smallness, and their hardness and rarity; therefore it is necessary that you prepare for every kind of operation an instrument suitable for that operation.
And understand that this operation requires of you knowledge of the type of instrument you will need; for with you is great study and experience in the methods of this art, and familiarity with the types of illnesses, because then you will know what is appropriate for each instrument for every illness.
And I will guide you at the end of this chapter on the number of instruments that you will use as simple tools with which you will proceed to your treatment, which you will test on others. Form of saw:
Form of another saw
Shape of a large saw
Shape of a ray Let the head of this ray be according to the shape of a star-shaped key, and its points should be in the form of alsteel points.
And it is not suitable unless with that they are rubbed against the heads of the joints when they are damaged or if the opening is very large.

"Form of another, smaller instrument.
"Form of yet another instrument; this one resembles a saw, and its tip is like a saw blade. It is used in many places on the bones.
"Form of a saw suitable for cutting through the bones.
"And its tip is triangular and pointed.
"And it is made of Indian steel, and similarly, all the instruments that we have mentioned, including razors, cutting tools, and saws.
"For incising and sawing the bones.
"The ends can be cut off either due to internal causes or external ones: either because you have treated that corruption with those medicines and the treatment does not work, or sometimes the corruption spreads to a limb which has no apparent cause, in such cases you must incise that limb up to where the corruption has reached, so that the patient can evacuate through that route any poisonous or malignant substance that might be causing greater damage to the limb.
The translation of the given sentence is:
And similarly, if the cause is due to the corruption by some poisonous strikes, such as from a sea scorpion or viper or asp and similar creatures.
And if the corruption or strike is in the extremity of the finger, then you should cut off the finger and not give space for the corruption to enter into the hand.
And similarly, if it reaches the hand, then you should cut off that part from the base of the thumb, and do not give space for the corruption to enter into the upper arm.
And if it goes up further, then cut off the arm at the elbow joint.
And if the corruption passes and surrounds the elbow, then that is the death of the patient; and to administer another cause for cure at that point requires a great deal of skill.
And similarly, with the foot, if corruption reaches the toe of the foot, then you should cut it off at one of the joints.
And if it affects the sole of the foot, then you should cut off the entire foot. But if it goes up into the shin, then you should cut off the leg at the knee joint.
And if the corruption has already spread over the entire body, then there is nothing else to do but let go of the patient and leave them to die.
And the method of cutting or tying off the limb is to have one ligature above the part you wish to cut, and another ligature on the part below; then the assistant extends a ligature below, and the other assistant extends another ligature above; and you separate the flesh that is between the two ligatures until there is enough space for all the flesh to be exposed; and then it is either cut or tied off.
And it should be ensured that cloths of linen are placed on all parts so that they do not touch the clean area, and that the wound is tightly dressed and the pus is cauterized.
But if blood flows when you operate, then you should cauterize the area gently, or place some hemostatic powders on it; and then return to your procedure until it is completed.
And then bind the afflicted limb with a ligature at the appropriate place, and care for it until it is healed.
And I remind you of what happened to a man in his foot, this very accident that I and you have discussed, which is because he experienced darkness in his foot due to a burn that resembled the burning of fire.
"And that corruption occurs first in the joint of the big toe until it affects the entire foot.
"And then that man prepared himself to inject pus into the area where he saw the pain and swelling most severe, and he made an incision into the foot at the joint, and it was cured.
"For a long time, that same corruption occurred in the joint of his index finger.
"And then it happened to me, and I decided to puncture that excess with water from the hand of medicines, near the cleansing of his body; and the excess was not punctured and began to spread to another finger on his hand.
"And he asked me to cut open his hand, and I did not want to do so, hoping for the release of that excess, and moreover, I feared that the cutting of his hand would cause death, because the strength of the patient was failing.
"And after he despaired of me, he returned to his land and it was reported to me that the man prepared himself and cut open his entire hand, and he was cured.
"And I have not told this story except to be of help concerning this disease, and that it may serve as a sign by which it may be recognized and according to which it may be treated.
"On the care of the veins and the quality of enemas with medications.
"When an abscess occurs in fleshy members and the space of the abscess is extended until it forms a collection of pus, and then it breaks open and perforates, and the pus exits from it, leaving the place empty as if it were a vessel, and the skin above it is also like a thin cloth, and it has not reached final corruption, and does not impress on the bones or nerves or ligaments, it is called a vein, and not a fistula.
"However, if the space is extended until corruption touches any member, then it is called a fistula and not a vein.
"And the care of it is that you should cut away all that skin completely as it is rolled up, especially when it is thin and made like cloth, and ensure that it does not adhere to the place because of its corruption.
"However, if you hope that the skin will adhere and that corruption has not reached its final consequence, and in the skin there is still flesh, then you should treat it with an enema.
"And consider the vein, and if it is large and its odor is of fetid smell, then enema that one with Egyptian medication which is made of oil and vinegar and cumin seeds, each in equal parts, placed in a vessel, and heated over the fire until the medicine becomes warm and reaches the consistency of honey.
And then you take from the patient what is necessary and dissolve it in water and honey; and administer an enema with that mixture, and strengthen the patient's openings, and leave the medicine in for two hours.
And then extract it with a spatula; and do this for so many days until the intestine is cleansed and the stench has dissipated.
And sometimes it is enemaed with ashes water when this medicine is not available to you; and it should be that you take the ash of grape vines, and put them in water; and then strain that mixture and administer the enema until you are sure that the intestine has been cleansed.
And if the patient cannot tolerate the Egyptian medicine or the ashes water, then enema them with water and honey, and let it be well mixed, crushed cumin, and enema them with wine and honey mixed together, because of the property of honey is that it cleanses and washes, and the wine makes the intestine adhere, and especially when in the wine there is an excess of astringency and dryness.
And when you do this several times and are sure that the intestine has been sufficiently cleansed, then enema them with a solution that promotes flesh growth in them.
It appears that the text is written in a medieval form of Occitan, a Romance language historically spoken in southern France. Here's my line-by-line translation into English:
And if the opening of the cavity is narrow and does not admit the cannula for the enema, then you should gradually widen it with a small iron instrument, and place in it a piece of cloth wrapped in Egyptian ointment or basilicon ointment until it is sufficiently widened.
Similarly, if the opening is wide, then you should bring together its lips with a stitch and leave it in such a state that the enema can enter without addition.
And if the opening of the cavity from which the arm protrudes is elevated towards the upper parts, then dry it in the lowest place that is within it so that the arm may enter below, for when the arm is confined in the narrowness of the cavity, flesh will be generated in it.
And if it is not possible for you to dry the cavity within the environment of the lowest part as you wish, then bore a hole and prepare the member with a preparation by which the arm can gently pass through, according to what seems suitable to you, and so that no cause of retention remains in the arm.
Sure, here is my translation of the given text: And so that you may know whether what flows from his arm is much or little, or if it is digested or undigested.
And thus you should also consider the location of that vein; whether the patient feels pain there or not, and if there is an abscess there.
And when your treatment is prolonged in such a manner, and you see that the matter which is placed on the opening of the vein begins to adhere or almost adheres, then you should loosen or remove it on the third day, and when you uncover the wound, then change the cloth for another one and renew the ointment.
But if from the vein there is a long, thin substance coming out, do not despair about its adherence, for the healing of it is appropriate; for some men in whom the generation of flesh in their wounds is slow, and of those are ones in whom the opposite happens to them.
And if from the vein there is an excessive amount of undigested blood coming out for many days, know that the vein will not adhere; and if the adherence of the vein is delayed and the cause is prolonged, then you should adjust the treatment to dryness in the medicines. And if the medicines are moist in their substance and in their virtue, they should be made dry like a diachylon ointment, which has an excess of added pitch.
Based on the pattern and structure of the given text, here's a line-by-line translation attempt:
The text appears to be describing a medical procedure involving the application of a poultice or salve on an area of the body. Here's a line-by-line translation:
And sometimes they are administered with long-stemmed aristolochia and celestial lilies (which are celestial lilies), and earth flour, and centaury, and use these simple or compound plants, grind them, sift them, and powder them over the honey that has been combed; and then use it.
And if the sinus is prolonged and does not heal with this treatment, then know that the corruption is in his lung, and it has already spread to the bones or other hard members or ligaments; then you treat him with a fistula cure, as mentioned above.
On the treatment of paronychia, nail inflammation, and additional finger incisions and sections.
Paronychia is an abscess that forms under the nail of the finger or toe, and easily occurs in other fingers as well. As it prolongs and its treatment becomes less valued, it can become an abscess from an abscess, or it can corrupt, throwing pus into the root of the nail, fortunately corrupting the whole nail, and fortunately its corruption reaches the bone, making it stink, causing the end of the finger to be painful, and its color becomes dark.
And so when you have that which we mentioned in the division and do not complete your treatment, then it is necessary for you to cut away with an iron all the excess that remains from the nail and then cauterize the wound nearby, because cautery is very helpful in this case.
But if the bone is healthy and the nail is intact, and the additions of the nail already compress the flesh in the divided parts inside, and they begin to sting and hurt that place, then it is necessary for you to put a thin ribbon under the edge of the nail that is stinging the flesh, and push it up and cut that flesh easily, and place on that which remains of the flesh some burning corrosive medicines until all is removed; and then heal that with ointments until it is healed.
But if the corruption has already reached the bone, then it is necessary for you to cut away that part of the bone and extract it, because it will never heal if the bone is corrupt.
And if you see the rot and corruption going into the finger, then cut it off at one of the joints according to what seems best for your memory, and then heal that until it is healed.
Based on the given text and the similarities to Latin, Italian, Spanish, and French, let's translate the sentence line by line:
Based on the given context and the pattern of the language, here's a line-by-line translation of the sentence:
"And some of his are born in the root of the joint, or it is the birthplace of him in some nuts of the said. "But he who is born in some nuts of the finger does not get sick, and this one who is born in the joints becomes very ill.
"And of those that are born fleshy, the cut is easier, and it is that you should incise him along his root with a flat scalpel.
"But of he who is born in the root of the joint, the cure is difficult; therefore beware of his incision.
"But in he who is born in the finger, you must incise at the beginning of his flesh with a round incision into the bone, and then cauterize with one of those appropriate irons, and then cure him until he is healed.
"But the consolidation that occurs between their visible joints, whether by birth of a man born thus, or by consolidation of a wound, or by burning with fire, or by similar cause, then you must cut that consolidation until the joints return to their natural shape.
"And then place between them dressings soaked in rose oil to prevent them from being easily consolidated, and separate them, or place between them a thin sheet of lead until it is consolidated as needed.
"And similarly, if there is a callous on the palm of the hand, then dry out that callous according to what is prepared and suitable for the shape of the member.
"From a lack of virtue comes vice; these are called varicose veins.
"Vices are varicose veins, and these are large, swollen veins filled with excess melancholic humors that appear in the limbs of the body, most commonly in the legs, especially in the legs of travelers, workers, and bearers.
"Therefore, it is necessary that you administer purging of the body with black hellebore some times with strong expulsion, and then bleed the patient from the basilic vein.
"But their cure with iron is done in two ways: one way is that it should be incised and the black blood drawn out; the other way is that the vein should be raised and all of it extracted.
"The incision is done in this way: first, soak the leg with very hot water until the thick blood, which is muddy from the leg, has dissolved. Then strengthen the patient's leg to a point higher than the thigh, between the knee and the ankle, with a bandage. Then make a wide incision in one place, or two, or three on the vein, and then raise the black blood from below the leg towards you, moving upwards and downwards until the desired amount of blood has been drawn out, which will restore the patient's strength.
And then tie it [the bandage or compress], and command him [the patient] to abstain from foods that generate black bile.
And repeat the treatment with phlebotomy when the veins are full and this is known to the patient.
But the elevation of them is according to this manner: you who rub the patient's leg, if there are hairs on it, first put it in hot water and soak the leg with hot water until it becomes reddened and the veins are prominent; or if it is to be exercised by strong exercise, if a bath is not available to you, until the limb is scraped.
And then dry the cord in the right side of the vein by sectioning it along its length or at the back of it; you should place the needle in the lowest part of it, towards the sole [of the foot].
And then open the vein with scissors and strip it of all parts until it is perceptible, and you should expect that what you see will become darker when it is rubbed.
And thus, as the blood flows out from the vein, if you see that it [the blood] is white, it should be a cord.
And then place under it the reed until it is raised and separated from the vein, and suspend that with a thread.
Sure, I'll do my best to translate the sentence line by line:
Sure, let's translate this line by line:
And perform this operation such that you draw out the most superior or highest section until all has been removed; and then incise it.
And if it does not obey you to extract and elevate, then insert a double-threaded needle with a strong wire and tie it off, or insert a graft underneath it and rotate your hand in all directions until it is expelled. And be careful not to incise it; for if it is broken, it becomes difficult for you to elevate that part and it has come upon the patient with harm because of this.
And when all of it has been expelled, then place over the location of the wound a piece of wool soaked in oil and both olive oil and non-olive oil, and care for it until it is healed.
And if the intestine is twisted and has tortuosity by which it is enveloped in parts, and it is not straight according to what we have said, then you must cut along all of its tortuous parts and at the points where it is enveloped, and then suspend it with hooks until you elevate it completely.
And you must be careful with your section so that you do not incise the vein and that it does not harm it, for it will be difficult for you to elevate it; and use your discretion with this.
Based on the given context and the similarity of the language to Latin, Italian, Spanish, and French, I would translate this line as follows:
It seems like the text is discussing a surgical procedure and the importance of being careful with certain actions to avoid harming the patient. Here's a line-by-line translation:
The text "De extraccio venae cruris" translates to "About the removal of vein from the leg.
Here is a translation of the given text:
And often it is generated in other parts of the body besides the thighs.
And the condition of this person is due to putrefaction, which comes from the colon and enters the body like snakes, worms, scorpions, and maggots generating between the colon and the flesh.
And the sign of the onset of this condition is the appearance of a vein in the thigh, accompanied by severe inflammation; and then the place becomes blistered; and then the vein begins to emerge from that blister as if it were a root of a plant.
And then when the extremity of it appears, you must wrap around it a lead weight that weighs between one and two drams. Attach this to it and leave the lead hanging from the thigh.
And as often as any part of it comes out for some reason, wrap that in lead and attach it. And if it is prolonged, then you should cut off a part of it and wrap the rest; and do not cut it off directly until it has come out, because if you cut it off, it contracts and enters the flesh and causes an abscess and putrefaction in that place and a bad ulcer.
Here's a line-by-line translation of the given sentence:
And from this vein, some men have experienced an emission that is in length of five palms and ten fingers, and it has come to my attention that one man emitted one of twenty palms.
And if it is cut during the time of his treatment, then insert the needle into its opening and pierce it with a long thread through his body until everything in the material is evacuated, and administer putrefaction to the area for several days with medicines; then treat it according to the cure for abscesses.
And this vein sometimes has a tendency to move violently, and especially when it appears at the joint of the foot or in the foot, and it comes to him with many openings, and is emitted from each opening violently.
Therefore, treat it as we have said in the division, and with what has been mentioned above.
About the cutting of worms generated under the skin, which is called cattle sickness.
This illness is called cattle sickness in some places because often it happens to cattle and a worm rarely appears between the skin and flesh, which goes through the entire body ascending and descending, and shows its movement from member to member until it breaks the skin and comes out.
And his generation is due to the putrefaction of some humors, just as happens with worms and serpents and earthworms and roundworms in the belly.
And he is feared for his malice, because when he goes into the body and rises to the head, and reaches the eye, then he quickly enters it and destroys the eye, and this causes many watchful nights.
And therefore, when you want to cure him and remove him, this is not done unless you know his movements and appearances to the touch, and then it is necessary that you have what is above him and what is below him bound tightly together, and then dry over him and extract him.
And if he is buried in the flesh and you cannot find him, then place a cautery with fire on the spot where he dwells, and the greatest cause to be feared is his corruption with which he corrupts the spot as we have said.
And if you see him reaching the head near the eye, then bind the eyelid tightly with a strong bandage, and dry over it, and extract him; and it is necessary that the patient use purgatives to cleanse his body of bad, putrid humors, and he should avoid foods that cause putrefaction.
This phrase translates to "On Section Against Pain in the Nose." The term "nafir" refers to the nose or nasal area, and "aegritudo" is used for pain or discomfort. So, the text discusses a medical procedure related to alleviating nose pain.
This sentence translates to: "This illness is called in our land 'nafir', and it is a pain that comes upon certain members, and it also changes from member to member." In other words, this condition affects various parts of the body and can move between them.
This sentence translates to: "And I have already seen that [condition] as I will describe it to you." The speaker is indicating that they have personal experience or knowledge of the condition they are about to describe. Here's the translation of this sentence: "I was called to a sick woman in a village, and I uncovered her arm and saw a small inflammation in the superficial vein of the arm. And after it had been broken for an hour, I saw that inflammation move like blood rising towards this [location], but more lightly than being porridge, as if it were living silver when it runs from place to place." This passage describes a medical practitioner observing an unusual phenomenon in a patient's arm.
And then the pain moved from that place and settled into the muscle, and it stayed there for an hour.
Then it ran through the rest of her body until it reached the other arm.
And then she told me that it was moving throughout her entire body as I had seen; and I was very amazed at the change in her and the speed with which it moved from member to member. "And I had already seen this before in my dreams following that manner, but I have also seen cases where the pain is transferred from one limb to another. "But I did not see this with the eyes as clearly as in a woman.
"And I did not think it was anything else except that it was due to the fact that the woman had an old body, with dry flesh and exposed veins, and in this state, it seemed to me that the windiness was transferred.
"And it is necessary that this transfer of pain does not appear in those who are delicate and with moist veins.
"And when you wish to heal them, and the patient feels that pain, then it is not apparent to the eye as we have said, so you strengthen yourself on top of it and lightly press and squeeze until the trapped windiness is expelled, and cauterize the spot.
"But if you do not see it with your eyes, then you cure that by purging the body and expelling windiness, and treat them with stinking pills and with serpent pills and similar things.
"On the removal of arrows.
This medieval medical text appears to be discussing the different types of arrows used in surgery or medical procedures based on their specific features and intended locations in the body. Here's a line-by-line translation:
Sure, let's translate the given sentence:
And therefore if these signs appear to you, then abstain from the treatment and removal of the arrow, unless it is urgent.
But the signs of an arrow wound to the heart are such that it is close to the left nipple, and you feel as if it has struck something hard, not something soft; and the movement of the arrow is similar to the pulse's movement, and black blood flows from the wound, and there is coldness in the extremities, and a foul smell, and fainting spells; and therefore you should know that death will come without delay.
And the signs when an arrow has struck the lung are frothy blood coming from the wound, and the veins near the neck are swollen, and there is a change in the patient's color, and they exhale a large amount of breath, and they crave cold air.
And if the arrow strikes the diaphragm which is in the feet, then the pain will be near the small ribs, and there will be a great deal of vehement pain and sighing, and all the limbs' muscles will not feel well.
And if the arrow strikes the stomach, then it is easy to see some undigested food coming from the wound.
And if the arrow hits the belly and is stuck in him, there may be some split in the wound or the flesh, or intestines which are torn apart, and there is no hope for his recovery by extracting the arrow.
And if the arrow hits the bladder and causes urine to leak out, and some other cause leads to swelling outside, and there is strong pain in the patient, then know that it is fatal.
But the other members such as the face, the neck, and the throat, the shoulders and the upper arms, the vertebrae of the back, the collarbone, the pelvis, the thighs and similar parts of the body are saved according to the best practices when the arrow does not strike a vein or artery and is not a poisoned arrow.
And I will tell you this about the nature of these arrows so that you can understand better their treatment.
This happened because in a man an arrow hit the tear duct of his eye at the root of his nose, and I extracted it from the other side, leaving the arrowhead in the ear canal, and he was healed, and there was no harm to his eye.
And another arrow was extracted from a Jew who had it in the gray of his eye, below the eyelid, and the arrow was already hidden, but only a small tip that adhered to its shaft could be obtained, and it was a large arrow of the sharp Turkish arrows with an iron lion's head on which there were no holes.
The Jew died, and the arrow did not affect his eye badly.
And another arrow was extracted from a Christian man who had it stuck in his throat. It was an Arabic arrow, one of those with holes; and I made an incision on that between two tendons, and it was already submerged in his throat; and then I carefully extracted it with that, and immediately removed the arrow, and the Christian was healed.
And another arrow was extracted from a man who had it stuck in his belly, and I thought he would die from it; but after thirty days passed without any change in his condition, I made an incision on the arrow and pulled it out, and he was cured, and no bad accident befell him.
And I saw another man in whom an arrow had fallen into his back, and the wound became infected on him, and after about seven years, the arrow came out of its own accord from the bottom of the body.
And I saw a woman in whom an arrow had lodged in her belly, and the wound was healed within her, and she did not change her disposition or appearance, and the woman did not suffer any damage in any of her natural operations.
And I saw another man in whom an arrow had lodged in his face, and the wound was healed, and the arrow broke off, not causing any pain here, and having a similar appearance to these (others).
And the arrow was extracted from the king's chief man whose nose it had pierced in the middle, and it had already deviated slightly to the right side, and the entire arrow was hidden.
And I was called for his care immediately after the arrow had entered three days earlier.
And then I found the arrow wound to be very narrow; and then I inquired about it with a fine probe, and I did not feel it; but he felt pain below the right ear, and then I suspected that this pain was due to the tip of the arrow.
And I plastered the area with a plaster that had attractive and digestive properties, thinking that this would soften the place so that the site of the arrow would appear to me, on which it could act.
Based on the given text and the similarity to medieval medical treatises, here's my best guess at translating the sentence:
And then I applied on the wound a sharp corrosive medicine for several days until it opened up, and with a probe I searched for it, and found the tip of the arrow adhering to the bone.
And then I adjusted the opening of the wound with that sharp medicine until the tip of the arrow became visible to me, and time passed with it for four months.
And after the wound was widened, and it became possible for me to insert forceps into it, and they remained there without coming out, I did not cease to try and contrive with various means until one day I succeeded in extracting it with forceps properly made, as will be shown at the end of this chapter; after which I restored the wound.
And some doctors judged that the cartilage of the nose could not be restored, but I restored it and the wound was healed, and the patient was healed completely by whole health, and there was no cause for concern about him.
And I tell you the quality of extracting certain arrows so that you may use this rule and explanation regarding what I have not said, because the parts of this art and their definitions cannot be understood by narrative alone, nor can those books comprehend it.
And the wise craftsmen compare with little speech; and what is present over what is absent; and they discover new operations and new instruments when dealing with the intrusion of external causes in the art.
Therefore, I say that arrows are not expelled from the members in which they are lodged except in two ways: either by attraction of the place into which they enter, or by the opposite of the other part.
And that which is thrown by the place into which it entered, either it is a bone arrow entering a fleshy place, and it is drawn out and expelled.
And if it does not obey the moment when it is caught, then you must leave it for some days until the flesh around it softens, and thus the attraction of it and its exit will be easier.
Similarly, if it is lodged in bone and does not obey your extraction, then leave it for some days and repeat this with attraction and moisture every day, and it will be expelled.
And if it does not obey your extraction after several days, then you must bore around the arrow in that bone from all sides with a fine awl until the place is widened by the arrow, and then extract it.
But if the arrow is hidden within the body and cannot be felt, then you should search for it with a probe. And if you feel it, then remove it using appropriate instruments for its extraction.
And if you cannot reach it due to the narrowness of the wound and the length of the arrow, and there are no bones, nerves or veins in its path, then make an incision on the wound until it is sufficiently widened and the arrow can be extracted.
Here's the translation of the given sentence:
When you administer the removal of an arrow from any location, then use a twisting motion with your hand using forceps until it complies; and be subtle and delicate so that the arrow is not broken and so that it is done with great difficulty for both yourself and for that removal.
If you cannot [remove the arrow] at that time, then leave it for several days until the surrounding areas heal, and then repeat [the attempt] when it has eased. But if there is a contrary flow of blood, then administer the treatment that we have mentioned in its respective chapter.
And be careful not to sever an artery, nerve, or tendon, and administer oil in any way possible to facilitate the removal of the arrow; and do this with ease, calmness, slowness, and firmness, as I have recommended to you.
And thus, by turning the arrow in such a way that the patient is according to the figure by which you should have aimed the shot of the arrow at him, for this is more beneficial. But if that is not possible, then administer what is possible according to the figures.
Here's my best attempt to translate the given text into English:
"But if it is lodged in the bone, then you twist the arrow according to the opposite direction until the arrowhead presses into the bone, and widen it further as you insert it, and then extract it.
"Otherwise, leave it for some days, and then try again until it comes out.
"And if the shaft of the arrow is in there, then you push it through with it.
"But if the shaft has broken off and you wish to administer an injection, then you insert that, if it is blunt, with a convex instrument so that it enters the hollow of it at the end of the arrow, and then push it through with it.
"But if the arrow is hollow, then you push it through with a strong instrument entering that, because the arrow is made lighter by that.
"And if the arrow is poisoned, then it is necessary that you cut out all the flesh in which there is the venom, if it is possible for you to do so, and then treat it with the appropriate remedy.
"And if the arrow hits the foot, or the belly, or the bladder, or the side, and it is close enough for you to touch it with your finger, and it is possible to cut over it, then cut over it and be careful not to injure a vein or nerve, and extract it, and then sew up the wound if necessary, and treat it until it heals.
"Method of using forceps with which arrows are pulled out:
"Their ends should be like a bird's beak, made like a saw, to grip the arrow so that it does not slip.
"And from those are made various species, large and small, few and fine, according to the size of the arrow and its thinness, and the extent of the wound, and the constriction of it.
"like a ray, to facilitate its entry into the concave arrow and then it is pushed out with it.
"On bloodletting of the veins.
"The veins commonly used for bloodletting are thirty, of which there are sixteen in the head: two pulsating veins near the ears, called alhasisain; two veins on each temple; and two veins on each lacrimal duct of the eyes, called aspicientz; one vein in the middle of the forehead; one vein at the tip of the nose; two guide-veins on the neck; two veins on the upper lip; two veins on the lower lip; these are the veins known as angelic; and there are two veins under the tongue. Here's a line-by-line translation of the given text:
And in the foot and the leg there are three veins; one of these is below the curvature of the wild boar's back; and the second is the saphenous, and its location is below the domestic pig's leg; and the sciatic vein, and its location is below the wild boar's leg; and in the leg there are other similar veins.
The healing of the veins near the ears is for ancient cataracts, migraines, headaches, and old ulcers.
And the method of bleeding these is as I have told you: it should be done at the top of the patient's head, and the patient's head should be rubbed on the back of the head in the place where both veins are with a broad cloth with good friction; then strengthen the patient's neck with a bandage so that both [veins] and their places are near the ears in two depressed areas of the head; and you will look for it with your finger, and if you feel the pulse of those veins with your finger, this is the sign.
Then you take the scalpel, and it is that which cuts, and then you insert it under the vein until the phlebotomy reaches the bone. "Then, carefully raise your hand with the vein and its connecting tissue towards the upper parts and make an incision in the vein using a sharp incisor. "And let the length of the incision be about two finger widths or close to that; and make as much blood come out as you want.
"Then strengthen with poultices and let it heal on its own.
"And already at the beginning of this book, the incision and subsequent cauterization of these have been discussed.
"However, of the two arterial veins in the temples, the help of phlebotomy is for migraines that are ancient and severe, frequent headaches, and bodies with acute overflowing of excess fluids.
"And the method of phlebotomizing these is as I advise you: have the patient sit quietly until both veins are felt clearly by touch, and then show their pulse below your finger; then you will know with certainty.
"Then raise the connecting tissue over the vein towards the upper part with your index finger, and insert the phlebotomy incision below it, and lift the vein upwards; and cut it in the same way as you did with the other two veins; and make the blood flow according to the amount of your necessity.
Here's a line-by-line translation of the given sentence:
Based on the provided context and similarities with Latin, Italian, Spanish, and French, here's a line-by-line translation of the given sentence:
And therefore the incision for phlebotomy of the vein on the forehead is similar to the incision for the cephalic vein in cases of ancient facial illnesses, migraines, rashes, and foul-smelling ulcers.
And the quality of the phlebotomy depends on what I recommend to you; thus, the patient should strengthen their neck with a bandage until the vein appears; and then take the instrument which is called the fossor, whose form is as follows:
Place the prominent point at the end of the fossor on that vein and strike it with a hammer or another heavy object in a similar manner, allowing the blood to flow as much as you want; then remove the puncture from the patient and secure it until it is healed.
And sometimes it is opened with a wide phlebotomy, but it is not necessary for the phlebotomy to be as sharp as the other phlebotomies; instead, it should be blunt-edged, and make that incision across, because the bone is very close and strong, and would break the thin phlebotomy.  (Note: The text uses "lat" to mean wide or broad, which is a common term in medieval medical texts.)
"But the treatment of the two veins that are in the tear ducts of both eyes for itching of the eyes due to heat and pus in the eyes, and for facial diseases.
"And the method of bloodletting is for the patient to hold his head with a bandage, and then you bleed him, standing over his head.
"And the bloodletting should be done according to the width of the vein, a little less than the length of the finger, because there is not much flesh in that place; and if the bloodletting is too thin, it will break off the end of the vein.
"Then let the blood run as much as is necessary for you, and press on those veins with a cloth, and hold them tightly for one night, and then release them.
"But bloodletting from the nose vein is appropriate for acute fever and intense headache, and for facial diseases, migraine, and heat affecting the face, especially when chronic.
"And the method for this bloodletting is that the patient should hold their head and then you take their nose with your left hand, and take a thin, long flebotome and place it in the middle of the tip of the nose following its length, because the vein is not felt here, and because the blood will begin to flow immediately.
It seems like the text is discussing a medical procedure involving bloodletting. Let's break it down line by line:
This is my translation of the first sentence:
Here's a line-by-line translation of the given sentence:
And then proceed to phlebotomize the vein along its length with a small phlebotomy knife; and then extract blood according to the prescribed amount or as necessary for treatment; and then repeat the process on the other vein.
And then untie the bandage and tightly bind both veins with a stronger ligature to prevent the patient from bleeding out, and leave it until morning when the wound has healed.
And the treatment of venous phlebotomy removes small boils and pustules from the mouth, corruption of the gums, and bad ulcers and cracks, as well as bad ulcers that are in the nose and around it.
And the quality of this venous phlebotomy is that you make the patient sit before you, and bind their neck with a bandage, then turn up their lips and look at the two veins, one on the right side of the lip and the other on the left; and the indication of each is by their darkness, and this is more so because around these veins are small black veins; and then incise each one with an incising incision.
If there is doubt about which of them to use, and you do not know which it is, then you should proceed with the incision on the larger and more obvious one of them.
And make a similar cut as the two veins that are on the lips above.
But the two veins below the tongue are more appropriately used for the phlebotomy of the cephalic at the preferred places on the wrist, for diseases of the uvula and mouth disorders.
The method of phlebotomizing these veins is to follow the patient's finger between your hands in front of the sun, and raise their tongue, and look under the tongue for two veins, one on each side, whose color inclines towards blackness.
And then phlebotomize each one; and be careful not to lift your hand while phlebotomizing them, because under them are arteries.
And the veins that are phlebotomized in the elbow are those that are common in all men, and their phlebotomy is done according to two methods, either by placing the flebotomi mirtilat or olivar with a subtlety inclining towards; or by means of a flebotomi cutellar, which is called alnessil, and this is its form:
Let the lances of it be so made, and they should be used to open the prominent large veins that are full and convex, and those that contain coagulated thick blood.
And this bloodletting is of lesser width and of a more subtle tip, and it is suitable for bleeding thin veins that contain thin citric blood.
But the benefit of bloodletting from the basilic vein, which is one of three main veins, is that it draws blood from patients suffering below the elbow and the neck, as well as those who have issues with their feet and abdomen.
It is advisable for the bloodletter, when performing this bloodletting, to be very careful and cautious, because below it there is an artery. If he errs and strikes it with the lancet, he will cut that artery and cause a flow of blood. Therefore, one should not bleed it with a pointed lancet; instead, one should first make an incision with a lance. ›
And if the basilica does not appear clearly visible, then you should leave that [vein] and move to another one, or look for a branch of it; or perform phlebotomy at the end of the arm, because that is more prominent; and in addition to that, perform phlebotomy on the ankle similarly as we have said.
But if you wish to perform phlebotomy on the same person, then you should touch the spot in front of the constriction of the arm until you recognize the pulse point. Then mark it with a sign and bind the arm; and then ligate the vein with a concave section using phlebotomy similarly as we have said; and be careful that the incision does not fall near the artery.
And when you see, as the ligature is tightened, swelling in the place where you have marked with a sign, then that swelling is from the artery, and therefore avoid it.
And if you see the blood flow in the phlebotomy like the urine of a child, and the blood is subtle and red, then know that it is from the artery; and then cut and press your finger over it for a long time; and then remove your finger, and if the blood has been cut off—for many times it has been cut off—then tighten the arm and leave it.
And watch over the patient's urine and be careful of him, and do not allow him to walk for several days until he is healed.
But if the blood is not cut off and there is no medicine available for this, then you should cut the artery, if it appears to you; because the extremity of it is constricted, and the blood is cut off. Or take some powdered henbane, make a poultice with it, take half of it and apply it strongly over the vein with a bandage and with powder between one day and the other.
And then if the blood is cut off, it's good; and if not, then cure it with the water of which it was mentioned earlier in the place where the cutting off of blood flows.
And the stopping of his blood is difficult due to the small size of the wound and the possibility of tying off the arm.
But from the superficial vein, phlebotomy is beneficial for extracting blood from the top part of the head and the lower part of the body; because it is composed of a branch of the basilic vein and a branch of the cephalic vein, as we have said. 😊
Here's a line-by-line translation of the given text:
And if the vein is between two nerves, then you open the vein along its length.
The help of the phlebotomy of the cephalic vein is to attract blood from the head and improve the illnesses of the eyes.
It is necessary in this case, if you want the phlebotomist to prick with an olive-tree phlebotomy or a myrtle-tree phlebotomy; because it is the safest of all the veins, for there are no arteries nor nerves left.
However, it is very easy for an inflammation to occur in some men, when they are not phlebotomized on the first percussion, but do not note this inflammation afterwards.
The first of these is that you should know that phlebotomy is administered only for the preservation of health and with hope and caution to prevent illnesses, and that it be done on one of the veins that are in the arm, namely: cephalic, dark, and basilic; and that it be done at the beginning of spring, on an empty stomach in the spring and autumn, and in winter after eating, when there are signs of fullness.
And it should be done phlebotomy on the third day or as soon as possible after three hours have passed from the start of the day.
But phlebotomy that is administered should be done more when it brings convenience and necessity, either at night or during the day, at any hour and in all circumstances.
And it is advisable that a child should not be subjected to phlebotomy until he has fourteen years, and a pregnant woman should only be subjected to it from the fourth month up to the seventh, and the elderly should not be subjected to it if they have already passed sixty years.
And when someone wants to be subjected to phlebotomy by any means, it is advisable that they clean their intestines before the phlebotomy with a clyster of lion [herb], if there are many retained fissures in them, so that the veins do not draw the superfluities from the intestines during the phlebotomy, which are corrupted and harmful to the main members.
And patients who are clearly suffering from seasickness or drunkenness should not be subjected to phlebotomy, nor those who are recovering from illness or intoxication until they have recovered from it, nor hydrocephalic patients, and phlebotomy should be especially feared in cases of colic, vomiting, abdominal mass, frequent coitus, heavy labor, fasting, vigils, and any cause that dissolves virtue, whether bodily or animal.
And then consider in the subtlety of humors before this, if the blood is thick, with food and drink, and with medicines if it is possible for them to be directed towards this.
And then enter a bath if no cause prohibits it, or engage in some exercise so that the blood becomes thinner.
And perform phlebotomy on the patient at the foot of the bed, as it should be done around the third hour of the day, as we have said.
And make sure that the patient's feet are protected on that day from all evil animal accidents, such as anxiety, anger, fear, and from all physical accidents, such as work, unnecessary pain, sex, and similar activities.
And at his bedside, place fragrant substances with pleasant smells and balms, according to the amount of affordability.
And have the person performing phlebotomy sit on a cushion that is higher than the patient's cushion.
Then have the patient extend their arm and rub it with their own hand two or three times, and then bind the wound tightly with a bandage, wrapping it twice around.
And if the stricture is temporary, for a stricture that is not equal or a stricture with excess fluid, then you should prohibit blood flow; or if it is with softening, then you should prohibit the body from releasing blood.
And before the operation of bloodletting, he whose veins are to be opened should rub his hands together until the veins swell and become discernible by touch.
And before the bloodletter anoints the place of incision with a little proper oil; and then he places his left index finger on that vein, below the place where he wants to perform the bloodletting, so that the vein swells a little, and the pulsation is stopped. For among the veins it is the one that flees like a string when you should perform the bloodletting, and it is full of windiness, and when you place the incision on it, it contracts, and the bloodletter is discovered; and the incision does not touch the vein, and if it touches, then it is narrow.
Therefore, for this reason, the bloodletter must be skilled and attentive to all these reasons.
And then remove the fleam [bleeding instrument], but if the vein is opened only once, then it's good; and if not, you should try again a little further from that spot, or on top of it with haste, if the spot isn't swollen.
And if the spot is swollen or the patient becomes faint, then leave it for a day or two and do not tighten the bandage, because strong drawing will bring forth pus quickly, nor should one enter into a bath.
And then attempt bloodletting again if needed.
And if the opening is small and blood flows slowly, and you fear that it won’t flow in the desired quantity, then you should attempt bloodletting again in that same location according to what is correct, adjusting the incision a little, and do so hastily before the spot becomes swollen, because many men require only a small opening.
But if you see that it is already swollen, then do not attempt [bloodletting] again in that spot, because no cause is needed for you; and place some olive oil cloth over it, because it relieves the body of blood. And olive oil is better for this purpose than any other oil.
And similarly, in case of cutting with a knife in all cases of bloodletting, with which we open the veins to prohibit the body from bleeding, and they make tiraqua alfadoc and sagzenea when one of them is placed on the wound, because the blood is subtilized and revolved when it is thick.
And if in the place of bloodletting a large abscess is generated, which usually happens, and especially to those who have not been bled except for this time, or when the vein is barely opened, then you cut [the skin?], and place a sponge soaked in water and salt over the wound, slightly pressed, and hold it there for an hour, because it will dissolve.
And it is necessary to do this near the end of the blood flow from that vein with the help of another or another vein.
And if any blackness or greenness remains in the area for several days, do not worry about it; and if you wish, place over it some aloe and myrrh dissolved in vinegar, or some juice of mint or marjoram or something similar to it.
And many times such abscesses and swellings require bloodletting from the basilic vein.
And so place your hand on it, and if you find softness, you should apply pressure to that area, for that swelling is bad and harmful; and therefore be careful not to press on it with any cause of this, because blood will flow from the artery strongly.
Make an emplaster with water that has been boiled and cooled, so that the area becomes hardened, and then treat it with another treatment until it is healed.
It is necessary to extract blood from every person according to the quantity of their strength and according to the prevailing color over the blood that appears.
Because if the blood is black, then let it flow until it turns red; and likewise if you see that it is thick, then let it flow until it becomes thinned out; and likewise if it is sharp, until its sharpness is removed.
It is necessary for someone who is full and strong and has a need to have blood drawn in one sitting that the phlebotomy of the vein be enlarged and that the phlebotomy be wide.
And for someone who is weak, the opposite should be done, and it is necessary to draw blood from that person in several sittings, and that the incision be narrow.
"And the best method in phlebotomy of a vein is that it be a transverse cut, not a puncture.
"And this method of phlebotomy saves from blood flow and nerve injury, and it is more praiseworthy and safer than phlebotomy according to length and width.
"And if fainting is likely to occur during phlebotomy, you should prepare the patient beforehand with a little bread infused in vinegar or simple oxymel; and draw out one-third or one-fourth of the blood.
"And if there is a cold complexion, then before phlebotomy take bread infused in myrrh syrup or in honey syrup flavored with spices such as pepper, cinnamon, ginger and the like, or in strongly aromatic and fragrant syrup.
"And if fainting occurs during phlebotomy due to the loss of too much blood, then they should drink water with meat and strongly fragrant syrup; and use aromatics with aloe, and anoint their feet with it.
"And use the other remedies that we mentioned in the section on fainting for evacuation.
And if one wants to raise the arm and dissolve their blood according to the method, it is necessary for the person whose phlebotomy is for major evacuation, and whose virtue is cold, that they evacuate the blood little by little, so it is according to the quantity of the virtue in continuous days.
But if one wants to raise their arm and expel their blood according to times, and their body is strong, then they should do this approximately seven or nine hours after the first phlebotomy.
But if one wants to draw blood from their body in the opposite direction of the part that is inclined, it should be raised on the second or third day.
But in the body where there is a lot of blood already cut and it is acute and causes fever, it should be expelled from it in one time and a large quantity should be expelled and the opening should be widened until syncope occurs, because you will have preserved all the conditions of phlebotomy; and you should place your hand over his pulse where the blood comes out, so that he does not die instead of fainting, because many times this happens when the phlebotomist is ignorant and negligent.
And it is not recommended when you want to release the arm and evacuate the blood, as the orifices of the vein are already closed and the flow of blood is difficult, that you press firmly on it with force and that it is slightly extended, for this is very harmful.
Hold the lance within until it is properly bloodletting; or remain with the sharpness of the fleubotomy that has coagulated the blood in the orifices of the vein; or place on it some alfarach, or sage, and compress gently until the blood has come out.
And if the vein is inflamed, then leave it alone and do not touch it until the inflammation has subsided.
And if necessity requires you to evacuate the blood accordingly, and there is no other option, then bleed that person in another place or on the other arm in another vein.
And the vein called "tendon of the arm" is bloodletting in place of the saphena or the basilica, when these are not found or are hidden, because it is composed of those.
And the quality of his bloodletting is that the patient puts their hand in hot water until the needle becomes red and the vein appears clearly.
And then it should be tightly bound with a bandage and a moderate pressure; and then make an incision according to the smallest transverse direction, not longitudinally or along the length.
And make the opening wide and your incision should be small on that joint, just enough to insert the tip of your finger.
And if the blood flow is profuse, then you should immerse your hand in hot water and allow the blood to run into the water until you achieve what you need.
But if you are in the summer days, then you are exempt from immersing your hand in hot water, and instead place the vessel of blood in hot water during the winter.
And this vein's incision is safer than any other vein, because below it there are no pulsating veins or nerves.
And the incision of the little finger on the right hand is suitable for liver diseases.
And the method of this incision is to bind the hand tightly with a bandage or your hand, after you have placed it in hot water until the vein is swollen and clearly visible; then make an incision transversely. And if you cut through that entirely, no harm will come from it.
And ensure that you do not perform phlebotomy with your hand, because after that the nerves mentioned will be exposed and without flesh.
And then dip your hand in hot water and let the blood flow into it, because if you do not dip it in hot water, the blood will coagulate at the mouth of the vein, and its flow will be blocked.
And when the blood has been extracted according to the necessary amount, then place oil and salt on the vein so that it does not close immediately; and similarly, you should do this with any narrow vessel.
However, the benefit of performing phlebotomy on the left hand is that it is beneficial for diseases of the spleen.
And perform the phlebotomy on him in a similar manner as you did with the other.
And the benefit of phlebotomy on the saphenous vein is for diseases located below the abdomen, such as uterine disorders, retained menses, and chronic illnesses of the hips and thighs, along with similar conditions.
And the method of performing phlebotomy on this patient is to have them place their foot in hot water and make friction until the veins appear; then bind the foot with a bandage; and the site for the vein, which should be pierced with the needle, is on the sole of the foot, from where branches extend across the surface of the foot like scattered twigs.
And therefore for a bloodletting procedure, place the large cup below the knee, towards the ankle, on the thickest part of the leg, because it is better and healthier.
And if you are performing bloodletting on the surface of the foot, be careful not to cut the nerves that lie beneath the skin on the surface of the foot. Place your bloodletting tool at an angle as if you were trying to cut through it.
And may the bloodletting be successful.
However, if the blood flow is stopped; then immerse the patient's foot in hot water and let the blood flow until it has been completely evacuated.
And if the bloodletting instrument misses its mark on the first attempt, then try again with the instrument a little further up, because the area is healthy; and do not be afraid of making a mistake, but rather be careful of the nerves as we have said.
Do the same for the saphenous vein on the other foot as well.
And for the sciatic vein, the location is also as we have said, below the ankle, towards the heel on the outer side of the foot.
And the remedy for his bloodletting is to apply a poultice to the hip when it is caused by an excess of blood.
And the quality of his bloodletting is that the patient enters the bath, quickly and strongly clamps the artery from the thigh above the ankle on four said things with a long, subtle bandage, because it only appears in this manner.
And so when it appears, then you bleed according to each case as is possible for you and according to the transverse vein, which is better; or you cauterize it by cautery or dry it by drying, because the place of him is healthy.
And it is very common in many men; and if you find this, and it does not appear entirely to the senses, then bleed some part of him, and it is that which appears on the back of the foot opposite the so-called auricular and annular [veins].
And beware of the nerves, and let run as much blood as you wish.
And then immediately release the constriction and place on the bleeding spot cotton and strengthen the area, for it is lightly healed.
Of cupping and of the qualities of using those [techniques].
Cupping is done with horns, or glass, or ivory.
And cupping is done in two ways: one is with scarification and bloodletting, and the other is cupping without scarification.
And this purgation, which is without incision, occurs in two ways: either with fire or without fire.
And the purgations that are administered with incision and bloodletting are fourteen places on the body: one of which is where the purgations are placed in alnocrati, which is at the back of the head; the middle place of the two parts of the neck together; purgations under the chin below the jawbone below the mouth; purgations on both temples; purgations on the big toe, which is at the end of the foot; purgations in both armpits, which are at the ends of both arms; purgations in both knees; and purgations in both hips.
And purgation does not extract blood except from the small veins spread throughout the flesh, and therefore it does not catch the virtue through them, just as it happens in phlebotomy; nor is it necessary for purgation to be done with fire or without fire in any illness caused by repletion until the entire body has been evacuated.
But if necessity requires purgation for illness or a continuum, administer it at the beginning of every month, in the middle, and at the end, or whenever necessary.
And so when the patient experiences any of those causes, and especially if it is in the third or middle part of the month, then command that a bloodletting be done because two or three hours have passed since noon.
Additionally, bloodletting from the neck is done when that causes heaviness in the head and it becomes sunken in the eyes; but it should be an evacuation of the entire body.
And this bloodletting is in the location for phlebotomy of the cephalic [vein].
And it is not allowed that this be used by someone who is of complete coldness, or in whom there is a fever, because it causes great harm to them.
And for this reason, the old should not use this, and those whose heads are afflicted by coldness.
But for that one who persists in using it, there is risk of forgetfulness; and therefore you should command the bloodletter to pause his hand a little with the bloodletting cup after leaving, out of fear of causing forgetfulness.
But bloodletting from the elbow is in the location for phlebotomy of the dark vein and the basilic: and therefore it causes shortness of breath, and constriction of the lung, and splitting of the lung tissue, and coughing, and pleurisy.
And it is necessary to remove the foment from below a little, because if it is placed beneath, it generates weakness in the body and in the stomach.
And apply the alhagdahan foment to pains in the head and to ophthalmia, migraine, pleurisy, and toothaches; it is an alternative to phlebotomy of the basilica vein.
And it is necessary that you order the fomentor not to press with his hand during scarification, lest he cut the artery and cause a flow of blood.
And apply the foment below the chin for alcol in the mouth, and for corrupt gums, and for similar diseases of the mouth; it is an alternative to phlebotomy of the aliheric veins which are on both lips.
However, the foment that is made with two spatulas is used for cephalic vein phlebotomy, which is done to reduce heat in the body.
And the foment made with two parts of the leaves of the fig tree is useful as an alternative to phlebotomy of the three main veins: basilica, jugular, and cephalic, because it attracts the blood from all the smaller veins that are in the flesh, and from the smallest veins of the other larger veins, until the attraction reaches the three main veins.
And command the bloodletter not to proceed too much in scarification, because the place is denuded of flesh, and only its nerves and arteries remain.
And it is a cupping glass with which one is cupped over the buttocks, and it is applied to the hemorrhoids of the anus and to the ulcers beneath them.
And it is necessary to command the bloodletter that it be a large cupping glass and that it be of brass, because the place requires strong suction; and let the subtle and finely drawn cupping glasses be scarified with scarification.
But cupping of the thighs is reduced by obvious reduction, because they draw blood from all over the body, and it is applied to old pains of the joints and of the mother, and of the bladder; and they provoke menstruation, and it is applied to melancholy and sadness; and they serve as a substitute for venesection of two veins, and for hanging, and for two ribs.
However, they greatly weaken the whole body and cause syncope in many men.
And for the cupping of the two veins, the treatment is similar to the treatment for cupping of the two thighs.
Here's a line-by-line translation of the given text: And do not cease repeating this and continuing until you see the area already reddened and swollen, and that the redness of the blood appears.
And then you make an incision and suck out little by little, and afterward consider the patient's condition.
Because a man who is of tender flesh and few pores should be incised only once, and not again, lest the area become ulcerated.
And order the cupping therapist to enlarge the incision a bit and apply suction with ease.
And if the blood is thick, then it is necessary to incise twice, because in the first incision the pathway for the blood and its fluidity is opened. But in the second, to the thorough examination of the extracted thick blood.
And if the blood is very foul, then a third incision should be made in order to obtain the last of it.
And finally, when we want to extract a little blood at a time or a small amount, one incision is sufficient for us.
And if we want to extract a lot of blood, we incise with many incisions; and if we know that the blood is thick, then it is necessary to incise with a wide incision.
And the depth of the cut should be just as deep as the cord.
And if the one whose cord is thick, hard, dark, and its pores are tight, it is necessary that the places of the leeches be anointed with gentle, open, resolving substances; in the summertime, such as oil of aloe or oil of violet, or oil of sweet almonds, or oil of wild cucumber; and if it is wintertime, then oil of narcissus, or oil of lily, or oil of chamomile, or of St. John's wort, and similar ones.
And if the swelling is thick and harsh, then let the oil be of amaranth, or oil of balsam, or oil of aloe, or oil of anise, and similar substances.
But if the one who is to be bled has large pores and soft skin, then it is necessary that he be forbidden from oil, and it is necessary that for this person the places where the leeches are to be applied be washed with vinegar or harsh water of sulfur, or water of wild cucumber, or water of borage, and similar substances.
And if the blood of that person is very fluid, wash their wounds with vinegar or water mixed with myrtle and sumac, similar to those (wounds).
And if the superfluities of that person are thick, wash their wounds with old vinegar, or water mixed with savory (satureja), or with an infusion of dill (anet) or chamomile, and similar to those (wounds).
And it is necessary that the wound dressing be protected before bathing. It is also necessary that it be administered shortly after bathing for one or two hours, and it is necessary to sleep near the wound.
What must be done to regulate the blood flow of a patient before bleeding?
It is necessary to consider at the beginning: if the blood of the person who needs to be bled or the person who will perform the bleeding is choleric and hot, and there is inflammation in their blood, it is necessary for them to take cooling substances, such as acetous myrtle berries, endive with vinegar, lettuce, celery, syrup of roses, and similar.
And they should eat foods such as chicken, lean meats, and foods flavored with vinegar, and similar things.
The sentence you've provided appears to be from an ancient medical text, possibly describing a treatment for a specific condition involving the spleen. Here is my attempt at translating it line by line:
"And it is necessary that on the day of bloodletting and phlebotomy, the drink should be greater than the food.
"And it is necessary to give some men to drink tincture of alpharac or musk medicine, which is muskade, or alcelita before bloodletting or phlebotomy, so that the main members are comforted and the blood is thinned; and they should not take that coldness.
"But the bloodletting that is done without scarification should be bloodletting that is placed on the liver, and on the spleen, and on the bladder, in the joints' places, and the anklebone, because these members do not tolerate scarification upon them.
"And it is not sought for them but the drawing of blood from a member, just as they place a cupping glass on the breast in an illness with nosebleed; and they use this so that the bloated and thickened wind in the member may be dissolved, just as they place [it] on the abdomen and the navel; because this thins the member, cools it, and removes pain by resolving the wind.
"And it is placed on the temples when a headache or fever occurs, because by virtue of strong drawing it removes headaches and eradicates fevers from their place.
And likewise, when placed upon the liver and spleen, you should ensure that there is no wind trapped in them.
These winds are to be administered with suction alone; and some winds are administered with fire.
And some winds are administered full of tepid water in cases of spleen disease.
And this is why the wind should be filled and made larger: it is hot water alone or water in which suitable herbs have been infused.
Form of wind administration with fire: the width of the orifice should be two fingers wide, as we have formed it; and the amount of pressure should be half a palm's length; and on his side, in the circular area, it should be half the size, and the hole should be small, just enough to insert a needle.
It should be made of round iron or copper, with thick edges, smooth and clean, so that it does not injure the member on which it is placed. 》
And in the middle of this rod should be a crosspiece of iron or iron, where a candle with fire is placed.
And this windpipe should be much larger than the one we mentioned earlier, and the smaller one is used according to the patient's condition and state of health.
And the cupping glasses for infants and debilitated individuals are different from those for youths and larger bodies.
And the manner of placing this cupping glass with fire on a member is to extend the wool with decent firewood in front of a few candles made of wax, and place it in the middle of the transverse rod at the midpoint of the cup, so that the fire is ignited around the base to avoid burning the patient's body.
Then it should be placed on the patient's limb, and the finger should be on the orifice that we mentioned, until when we have the cups and do not need them anymore, remove the finger and let the vapor escape from that orifice; at that moment, the cup will dissolve immediately.
Then ignite the wool according to its nature, and repeat this if you need to do it again.
However, in the cupping for pleurisy patients, with water, which does not have a transverse rod or opening, it is only administered when it is filled with water and placed on the limb alone.
And this is its form: And the larger this cup is, the better it is, because it can receive a greater quantity of water.
Chapter 97.
Sanguissugas (leech therapy) is not used on all members but only on those in which it is not possible to apply cupping, due to their small size, such as the hand and gums, or on members devoid of flesh, such as the tongue and nose and similar parts.
And the quality of using those leeches is that you have found them in clean waters of stagnant water.
And then they should be laid in clean water day and night until they become sluggish, so that there is no impurity left in their stomachs; and the body should first be purged with phlebotomy and cupping; and then rub the patient's limbs until they redden; and then place them on the patient.
And when they are full and fall off.
If it is possible to suck the area with a cup (ventoza), it is better for healing.
And if not, then wash the area with vinegar and then with warm water; and rub it and press it out.
And if the body's blood flow is prolonged near the application of leeches and it exudes (bleeds), then you should dip a cloth in warm water and place it on top until the bleeding subsides.
And if the blood is excessive, then sprinkle on it powdered vitriol or substances with similar astringent properties until the blood is absorbed; or apply cooked fava beans to the area and leave them until they adhere, at which point the blood should be absorbed.
And, if necessary, use leeches for bloodletting, changing them as often as possible.
And if the use of leeches is forbidden by law, then wash the area with fresh blood or insert a needle into the site until it draws blood; and then apply a bandage, because these will quickly absorb any blood that they come into contact with.
And when you want them to close, sprinkle a little powdered alum, salt, or ash on them, and they will close quickly.
Thus begins the prologue of the third part: restoration. This chapter is very necessary in the art of medicine; it deals with the restoration of bone fractures and dislocations.
Oh son, know that the foolish doctors and common people who have never read the books of the Ancients or studied their words boast about this chapter.
And for this reason, this method of the learned in our land is concealed; and I have not forgotten it at any time, but rather have applied what follows, only after a long study of the books of the Ancients and reflection on their understanding, until I extracted the science from them.
And therefore I directed my efforts to experimentation and study throughout my life.
And I have already described in this chapter all that contains my science and on which my experiment has passed; since here I have shortened it for you others and delivered you from the labor of lengthiness; and I have shortened it at the end of shortening; and I have shown it at the end of explanation; and I have formed in it many forms of the instruments that are administered in it, as is done by addition of explanation, as I have done in the two preceding chapters.
Chapter one.
Summary and collection of the causes of bone fractures, from which a necessary premise is required before we begin to recall the members fractured and diverse in each one. Therefore, in the prologue to this chapter we will state the sum of the discourse; and the chapters at the beginning of which it is necessary for the craftsmen and surgeons to stand firm on the truth of those; that is you and those who are prompt and know or learn this noble art from you.
And so I say that when it comes to a fracture, dislocation, twist or fall, it is necessary for you to begin with bloodletting or purging, or both at the same time, unless there is some reason against it, such as weakness of virtue, if the person affected is a child, an old man in decline, if it is a time of very hot weather, or of very cold.
Therefore, let him be content with food such as fresh herbs and birds and crabs; and avoid fatty meats and filling himself with all foods that fill the veins with blood, until you are sure to prevent an abscess, and if you do not fear a discharge of matter in the limb.
And then return the patient to his previous diet with which he was accustomed.
And so when the broken bone begins to be restored, it is necessary for the patient to be fed with nutritious foods that are thick and dense, in which there is viscosity, such as foods made from boiled wheat with water, rice, cabbage, peas, and cow's stomachs, and goose, and fresh pork, and fat similar to these, and with this diet the fracture coagulates more lightly and better.
And know that the bones of those who are in their first youth and in old age cannot be continued and healed according to their nature due to the drying out of their members.
However, nature adjusts and binds over the broken bone from any similar cause, like glue, which adheres and strengthens it until it is completely healed and firmly joined together, so that it reaches its end in strength and firmness, just as fire at first, until some cause prevents it from doing its work.
And for this reason, it is necessary to give the patient foods that are heavy, viscous, and dense, as we have said.
And know that the types of fractures are different according to the diversity of the members, for the fracture of the bone in the leg is different from the fracture of the bone in the head; and the fracture of the bone in the foot is different from the fracture of the bone in the hand; and similarly, all the other members are different from one another.
And I come with memory of every type of fracture, distinguished in its own chapter separate from others.
Various types of fractures within themselves. And the species of bone fractures are diversified within themselves; for some fractures are curved while others occur in stars; and sometimes they are fractures according to the length of the bone: and these are the fractures of the patella and shins and splints, both simple and compound, as is done with the pen when it is ready to write, and there is a fracture with bruising and dislocation in the head, and there is a small fissure fracture.
And each type has its own proper treatment or torment for the restoration of it, as will be remembered in the subsequent distinguished chapters.
Signs of bone fracture. And by this bone fracture is known: it is the twisting of it, and the prominence and appearance of it to touch, and so also when you compress that with your hand.
And therefore when there is no apparent twisting or discomfort in that place and you do not feel it when you touch the bone with motion and the patient does not find great pain, then there is no fracture here.
Here's the line-by-line translation of the given sentence:
And know that the location, when it is bent and not cut into two or anything else that does not happen to it, as all parts of its companion are moved away, then you should begin from your hour to straighten the habitant who has an abscess.
And if an abscess appears on it, then leave it alone for several days until the abscess subsides; and afterward, wrap it in any manner you can with softness and skill.
And know that the restoration and treatment of it is easier than in the bone on which this happens.
Then strengthen it according to how you will remember it later.
But if the bone is affected, then it is necessary to extend this broken member into two parts, whether it is the hand or the foot; either with your hand if the member is small; or with two cords, or with one cord and a hand.
And it should be your position with which you place the member in its natural form while the parts are extended from the broken limb, then make sure that you return those additions with skill and in any manner you can in their places.
And be careful according to your strength that nothing happens to the patient due to your operation, neither pain nor injury; and exert yourself according to your power to apply one bone with its companion in the best possible way.
And it is appropriate that at this moment you touch with your hand that area, and if you see any different cause here, correct that and equalize it according to the amount of your skill.
And avoid vigorous extension and compression, as many foolish doctors do, which often cause an abscess to form due to their operation, or cause contraction in the limbs, as we have seen happening due to the operations of their vigorous extensions.
Here's the translation of the given sentence:
And for those that are small like the arm and the finger and the thumb, then it is necessary that the covering be of soft, fine cloth.
But for those that are large such as the thigh or the leg, it is necessary that in these there be a binding of tough and hard cloth, because the strong binding holds the large member firmly on all sides with tightness, so that in it no wound can enter.
And then begin, at the time of your evacuation of waste, place suitable bandages for this, on the location of that fracture with three or four bindings according to what the member needs; and hold your hand firmly a little with the binding.
And then come to that on the higher part of the location of the fracture, and tighten more so that your binding does not loosen with which you have held the place of the fracture. And then extend yourself with the bandage of the location of the fracture a little, and gradually loosen the tightness until you take from the location a large part.
And then take another bandage and wrap it around the broken part with a covering, and then come to the bindings on the lower part of the fracture; and let your operation be in the tightness of the binding and in the loosening of that according to what we have said above in the first covering.
And you should place between the wool packs of linen or cloth with which the contortion of the fracture is wrapped, if there is a contortion; and if not, do not place anything in it for any reason.
And place another bandage over it, and wrap this bandage with these carefully made steel bandages immediately if there is no swelling or abscess in the area, and then place on it whatever drains the abscess and removes the swelling; leave it for a few days; and then strengthen the steel bandages.
And the steel bandages should be made of reed cane, or well-formed bamboo, or pine wood; or palm ribs. Each steel bandage should be as wide as this shape and this figure:
However, the steel bandage that is placed over the fracture should be slightly thicker and wider than the other steel bandages, and the length of the steel should be according to the size of the limb. Then strengthen the steel bandages with another bandage according to your initial tightness; then tie it on top with a decent thread as we have said about tightness, and it is that your tightness should be according to the location of the fracture more, and the further away from the fracture, the less the tightness.
And it is important that the threads be medium in thickness and delicacy, and be of silk; and if the threads are thick, as I have seen in the operation of some foolish people using their threads of linen cord, this is a great error, because when the suture is tightened, equality would not be maintained.
And very thin threads are not suitable, because with them you will not achieve through tightening what you want, and it is not appropriate for there to be more than a finger's width between stitch and stitch.
And if the patient is bothered by the ends of the threads near the stitches, then place under those stoppings a piece of wool or flannel until such time that it does not cause harm to him.
Sometimes a fracture occurs with a wound, and there is a disruption in the tendon, and I will come to that in particular in Chapter Two.
And know that not every fractured limb is bound with bandages on the first day; the reason for this is that when the limb is large, it is not suitable to place bandages on it except after about six or seven days, or more, according to your certainty of avoiding cautious pus.
And this is the method of plasters with which the Ancients used to restore, which are placed on fractures and dislocations and sprains.
Here's the line-by-line translation of the provided text:
And prepare it thus as it is, except that you sieve it with egg white, and place the preparation of him not too thick nor too thin; and then use it.
And another way to make a plaster that heals fractures and dislocations is: take asafetida, ladanum, acacia, enula, and milfoil which is wild chamomile, all in the quantity of ten drams; myrrh and aloe in the quantity of five drams; and aloe in the quantity of twenty drams. All should be ground and sieved and mixed with either alkaline water or egg white if the patient's complexion is scorched; then use this plaster, for it has a good composition and heals broken bones gently, and it helps many men.
Another way to make a plaster for healing fractures and dislocations: take milfoil and equal parts of white altea, ten drams each; myrrh and aloe, five drams each; acacia, six drams; and Armenian bole, twenty drams.
All should be ground in a mortar with a pestle, sieved, and mixed with water or egg white and then applied.
Here's the line-by-line translation of the given sentence:
In this plaster, there is no virtue of restoration, it cauterizes and expels pustules, and properly relieves pain.
Another method of plaster that restores the broken: take leaves of wild fig tree and wild poppy; grind them all together and make a plaster from it.
A method of shortened plaster administered for the restoration of a fractured bone and when you want resolution from the remaining pustule: take roots of mallow, chamomile, and violet flowers; grind them all together and mix with flour, then bind it with wine if the member is not scraped.
But if it is scraped, then make that plaster with moist coriander water or with water and apply it.
Another method of plaster stronger in resolution than the first, when a hard pustule occurs for the restoration of the member: take roots of mallow and linseed, balm, melilot, marjoram, violet flowers, chamomile, all equally; grind them all together and mix with willow water or sweet water or wine, according to the quality of the member and its color rest.
Sure, I'll translate that line for you:
Mays a Gualia es vist que sian pausatz sobre le membre trencat deves la restauracio de lu e las causas en las quals es exsiccacio am petit de caliditat so ayssi cum mirra, enses e semblantz a lor de aquelas causas que havem recomtadas.
Method to make a plaster for wounds and pain: Take equal parts of barley, chickpeas, human hair cut or bird feathers, althea (holy thistle), and salt; grind them together, sift them, mix them, and make a poultice.
But the amount should be adjusted according to how long the bandage needs to stay on. Consider if there is pain or swelling, or if the bone has moved from its place; then do not remove the bandage for many days. And if there is severe pain or swelling or inflammation at the site, then cut or remove it immediately and take off the poultice from him.
And take a cloth of linen and a marine sponge, wet it with warm water, and with that wash the area until the swelling subsides and the pain is soothed; then let the member rest for an hour; then place on it wool soaked in vinegar and oil or rosemary oil, and bind it overnight until you are sure of a cautious abscess, and that the inflammation of the member has subsided and the pain has been removed from him.
And then apply a thin and small plaster to that constriction and do not tighten it too much with your first binding, and make it subtle with that within which it is healed.
And if you see that the abscess and redness and pain and swelling and all the symptoms have already healed completely, and you need to remove the plaster and binding, then apply the same as you did at the beginning equally.
And if no cause occurs in the member of those that we have mentioned, then do not release it except after three or four or five or seven days; and sometimes all this is left for twenty days according to what seems to you by the dislocation of the member, as we have said, within which the fracture adheres, and it approaches the coagulation of the flesh in that place.
Then tighten the binding more than your first binding, and adjust it according to the patient's thickness of flesh, as their memory allows.
However, if you see the place of the fracture is already dried out and thinner than it should be, then know that nutrition is prohibited from reaching there; therefore, moisten that area with lukewarm water every time you release it; and this should be done for three days in total; and loosen the binding slightly, and through this operation, the nutrition will flow to the member and it will heal slightly.
Here's the translation of the given text:
And I have not seen anyone do this, which is why it seems more reasonable that one does not do this.
Chapter Two: On Fractures of the Head.
There are many types of fractures, and their forms vary greatly, with different causes. Some fractures occur due to a blow from a heavy object, which breaks all the bones into pieces, just as it would split wood; this type is called compound fracture. Another type occurs when a sharp object cuts through part of the bone and the skin, but does not penetrate completely through; this type of fracture is called simple or closed fracture.
The wound from these two types of fractures can be large or small, and the fracture can be compressed or crushed. Its cause is a blow with a hammer or fall onto rock, or similar objects.
And this type of fracture can either be penetrating, approaching the layer of fat beneath the bone; or it can be on the surface of the bone, and the wound from these two types of fractures can be large or small.
And there is also a type of fracture that occurs within the bone, in the delicate substance called bone marrow; this type of fracture is called hairline or greenstick fracture.
And it is a fracture that is caused either by falling or by the strike of a stone or similar object, which makes some layer of bone enter between the divided parts within, and it is made in the concave place as occurs to clay pots when they are struck, and their entrance is divided into parts within.
And this is most commonly done in the bones of children, such as in the heads of infants.
And to all these types of fractures, there are weights like stars separated. And I will return with a reminder of all this in its place.
And recognize all these types of fractures by detection upon them, and by investigation with probes and removal of corrupt flesh that is on them.
And it is known that capillary species are characterized by being exposed over the bone, washed, and anointed with tenth oil because the fracture appears black.
But in the treatment of fractures, first consider the patient's symptoms, and if you see through these symptoms that they indicate fear, such as vomiting from anger, tensing up, loss of consciousness, loss of voice, fainting, acute fever, discharge from the eyes and redness of them, similar to the symptoms in more severe conditions, then without a doubt he will not be cured.
And if you see unrelated symptoms, you can expect recovery; then begin the treatment of him.
The cause is that if the patient comes to you at the beginning of their illness as it began and this is in the days of winter, then you must study the bone fracture before the fourteenth day according to all conditions.
And if it is in the days of summer, then you should try to remove the bone within seven days, since after this time the flesh around the bone may become corrupt and the symptoms we have mentioned may occur.
And if the fracture has already reached the flesh covering the brain, and it is with very small splinters and crushed pieces, then you must cut out the crushed and splintered parts, as I will tell you later.
And it is that you shave the patient's head where it is afflicted with disease, and uncover over the bone according to custom and practice as much as possible according to the shape of the disease, and let it be gentle on the patient.
And if it happens to you that you detect bone, blood flow, or pus overflowing, then you should oppose the area with water as needed. It is that you fill the place with cloths soaked in wine and rose oil, and make the wound rest until the pus subsides and you are sure there is no bleeding; then begin with the scraping of the bone and its removal.
And this should be done according to one of two methods of operation.
And the first method is that you cut the bone with a thin knife like this, and this is its shape: Then you administer another knife, this one slightly wider than the previous one; and this is its shape:
And then administer the widest knife of the three.
And it is necessary that you have a diverse number of knives, some of which are wider than others, and some are shorter than the others, and they should be very sharp at their tips, and they should be made of Indian iron or steel.
And use them gently with ease in striking over the scissors, so that you do not hit the head and hurt him.
And if the bone is hard and strong, then it is necessary to drill a hole in its front before you administer the scissors with the burrs, which are called non-penetrating burrs.
And they are not named this way only because those do not penetrate to the end of the bone from that which is nearby, for on the burr there is a rounded edge or margin beyond its sharp tip similar to a small circle, which prevents it from being submerged and passing through the thickness of the bone.
And it is convenient that you take a large number of these burrs, each suitable for the thickness of each bone, until you have all the bones of the skull with sharp tips, in quantity and length according to the thickness of this bone.
And this is the manner of three types of burrs: The quality of drilling into the circuit of the broken bone is that you place the burr on the bone and revolve it with your fingers until you know that the bone has been penetrated; and then remove the burr to another place, and put it in such a way that all around it pulls out the quantity of the thickness of the saw or surrounding it.
And then make an incision with the scalpel between each bone, making it as subtle and light as possible, as we have said, until you remove the bone, either with your hand or some other tool prepared for this purpose, such as tweezers and fine forceps.
And it is necessary that you be very careful that the scalpel does not touch any vital organ.
And then, once you have separated the bone from any attached vital organ and extracted it, you should scrape and smooth the surface of the bone with another instrument similar to a scalpel, but one that is thinner and more subtle than other scalpels.
And if any small fragments or splinters of bone remain, take them out with ease using the appropriate tool for this purpose; then heal the wound with linen and ointments as we have said.
And another method of operation is light and far from fear, which Galen calls praiseworthy; and here are his words on the subject: It is necessary for you at the beginning to start uncovering the part of the bone in the place where the fracture is most severe and obvious. Once you have discovered that part and placed beneath it the tip of this gentle and cheerful scalpel, which has this form:
Here's my best attempt to translate the given sentence into English:

Here's a line-by-line translation of the given sentence:
Here's a line-by-line translation of the given text:
Certainly! Let's translate the given text into English line by line:
Mays in each of the other small fractures, both capillary and subtle, it is necessary to administer care according to what has been lost for its correction.
And this is the reason why [it] should not be treated the same as all those who have studied in that art. And we have written about this in our discussion on large fractures.
And if the skin is torn when you remove the bone, then take a cloth according to the size of the wound, and soak it in rose oil, and place it on the orifice of the wound; and then take another folded or triple-folded cloth and soak it in wine and rose oil and place it on top of the first cloth, and do this as lightly as you can on that, so as not to burden the flesh; and then administer a plaster of white lead on top, and do not make it stronger than is necessary for the wound alone.
Leave it with this treatment for one day or two until you are sure that the abscess has been cauterized; and then remove it and then administer medicines which cause excessive dryness, such as flax seeds and powder of violets and of Aristolochia, and similar things to those.
And it is that you make from these medicines a powder to be sprinkled over the wound as they are dry; and generally, administer to him all medicine whose property it is to soak up and not sting.
And be careful according to your skill that the wound in your care is clean; and there should not be any foolishness of ointment or other; nor let you allow virulence to increase in it; for when it is attached to the panniculus of the brain, it corrupts that part and poisons it, and an evil malignancy occurs upon the patient.
And it occurs in the cavity of the skull, when from it the bone is softened and especially when its care is neglected, and there is blackness on its surface; and therefore consider if these accidents occur to the patient, you will know that it is pernicious without any doubt.
And if there is no blackness except from the medicine that is placed on it, and it is in the power of that medicine to cause that blackness, then you should take one part of honey and three parts of rose oil, and with those linens wrap a cloth, and then place that over the cavity; and then care for it with the specified medicines until it is healed.
Chapter III.
Of the restoration of the nose when it is cut off.
Know that the nose is not cut but rather split into two main parts simultaneously, or one of those parts occasionally, because in it there are two bones, whereas the lower part is cartilaginous and is not cut, and no harm comes to it except for roughness, crookedness, and narrowing.
However, if one of the two parts is cut, then you must insert your little finger into the patient's nose, and with your index finger inside and your thumb outside, reduce the fracture until the nose returns to its natural shape. And do this easily, being careful not to cause pain to the patient during your operation.
And if the fracture is in the upper part of the nose and your finger does not reach it, then it should be reduced with the tip of a small stick.
And if the fracture is in both parts, then you should do the same thing.
And try to restore it on the first day of the fracture, if possible; otherwise, you should wait for the swelling to subside on the seventh or tenth day.
And then insert a piece of linen cloth into the tip of the nose, if the break is in one place, or two pieces of cloth, if the break is in two places, and let it be in the larger piece of such a quantity that it fills the hole in the nose.
And some of the ancient restorers say that the pieces should be wrapped in wool and changed every day, but I have not seen this; it is necessary for the piece to be wrapped in egg white mixed with powdered chalk; and then leave the piece until the bone is set and the cartilage is hardened.
And sometimes it is necessary to insert into the nose, instead of a piece of cloth, a pen of oak wrapped in linen; and this is if the nose fracture is more severe and the patient is not prohibited from breathing.
And for this reason it is not necessary for you; and if you want to, do that, and if you want to, use pieces of cloth.
And if at another time a hot abscess occurs, bandage the nose with wax or cotton soaked in vinegar and rose oil, or with diachylon.
But if a hot abscess does not occur, then it is necessary to bandage that part from the outside with sesame flour and powdered ivy mixed with egg white; and then place over it a linen cloth, and do not touch the nose for any reason.
Here's my attempt at translating the given sentence:
And if a wound occurs inside the nose, then it is necessary to cure that with hot compresses and administer lead cannulae until it is completely healed.
Chapter IV
On restoring the jaw when it is dislocated.
When the jaw has been broken and the fracture is not due to a wound, consider then if the fracture is only on the outside, and it is not broken in two but bent at the inner parts; then its treatment is easy.
And therefore, if the fracture is on the right side, then you should insert your left index finger into the patient's mouth; and similarly, if the fracture is on the left jaw, then you should insert the aforementioned index finger of the right hand; and with that you should push the swelling of the fracture inside to the outer parts, with your other hand on the outer part of the bone; with that you should evenly reduce it.
And if the jaw fracture is already separated into two parts, then you should administer extension of both parts according to correctness until it is possible for them to be joined together.
And if there is a dislocation of the teeth, then strengthen those that you expect to remain with gold or silver thread or silk; and then place wax on the broken jaw, and then place a double cloth over it, and place a large star-shaped bandage or a sole bandage the length of the jaw; and then bind it above in such a way that the binding is appropriate and the application is suitable, until it is not destroyed.
And command the patient to rest and remain calm, and hold back their food from excessive eating.
And if you think that the figure has already been altered in some way, then cut and remove it on the third day; and then rectify what has been altered in the patient and apply a plaster made of powdered mallow, egg white, or sesame flour, after you have removed the covering from them, and place wool over the plaster.
Then, when that plaster is attached and adjusted to the patient, and the bone's position has not been altered, leave it there, do not remove it until it is healed and strengthens the fracture; for many times this fracture is healed in three weeks.
And if another time an abscess occurs, then administer what we have said many times before in the patient's sedation until they are healed, and that abscess is removed.
And if the fracture is with a wound, then consider whether it is a piece of bone separated or splinters, then you should be skillful in removing those splinters with what is convenient for the removal of those instruments.
And if the wound's opening is narrow, then you should widen it using a surgical instrument called a fleubotomi according to the extent of your need.
And immediately after you have removed those shards, and if nothing remains, then you should close the wound's opening if it is wide; otherwise, place one of the appropriate plasters on it and let it heal.
Chapter 5
On restoring the furcula (wishbone) when it is broken.
Often, the furcula breaks at the division of the muscle, and this fracture occurs in one of three ways.
For it is broken, separated, or divided into two parts without fragments; and its restoration is easy; or it happens that there are fragments in it, and its restoration is difficult; or the fracture has a wound.
And the operation in this case, when the fracture is without a wound, is to have two assistants present, so that one holds and follows the broken furcula, and the other extends the neck toward that division. ️
And immediately splint the fracture with the aforementioned ties until its shape is restored as needed, ensuring there is neither prominence nor concavity in it.
And if you need more extension, then place a splint under the patient's throat made of cloth or wool, and let its size be according to your necessity; extend and raise the collarbone and cut the splint with your hand until you have splinted the fracture as needed.
And if you cannot pull the end of the collarbone out to the sides, because it has reached the ribs, then it is necessary that the patient be placed on their back with a pillow under their neck of medium size.
And the assistant should press on the patient's neck to the sides until the bone of the collarbone is raised and returns to its place in the chest, then you correct the fracture and splint it with the aforementioned ties.
But if you feel shards of the collarbone and they are protruding, then it is necessary to cut over them and remove those shards with ease.
And if it is stuck in the bone, then you should make an incision on it with one of the knives that you have prepared for this purpose, after placing under the collarbone the instrument which serves to lift; and this instrument is made of wood or iron, and its shape is as follows:
And it should be like a cup whose concavity is this; and its length should be according to what you need from it, depending on the size of the bone or the smallness of it.
But its length should be according to what is possible for the operation; it should have two ends like this, and one end should be wide while the other should be narrow.
And if the opening of the wound which you have cut when you extracted the arrow from the bone is wide, and you are sure that there will be no suppuration, then you sew the two lips of the wound together with a stitch.
And if the opening is small, or you fear that there will be no suppuration, then you fill the wound with cloths and powders according to the size of the incision in the wound.
And if there is suppuration, then you pour vinegar, oil and wine over a cloth, and place it on top of that.
And all this is to be done without the ligature on top of the broken bone being too tight; and for this reason you must see the patient every day, because when the bandage becomes softened or you see that the ligature has become loose, then you should correct this and strengthen the bandage.
And then place the patient's pillow under their head, and put a small cushion under the patient's feet at night; this way, with that, the helper's arms are lifted off the patient's side, and thus the fracture of the collarbone is raised by the muscle being elevated; or have the patient's arm tied to the bedpost.
And do not untie the bandage unless you notice swelling or pus in that place within twelve days.
And then renew the poultice if you have seen that face become like this, and adjust it in the stricture and restore that, and leave until the fracture of the collarbone is restored and coagulated.
And it is strengthened and comforted according to the month in twenty-eight days, and sometimes in some men it is done in less time than that.
Chapter VI.
Of the restoration of a shoulder fracture.
Based on the context provided and the similarity of the language to Latin, Italian, Spanish, and French, here's a line-by-line translation:
And therefore, when the place is broken — and it is broken in the middle of the body — and it is only known by touch, then according to the shape of the fracture, forcefully prepare it and reduce it back to its natural shape using all possible ingenuity.
And then place powder of ground alum mixed with egg white and cover it with a cloth; and then place on him a double-layered wool blanket; and then place on him a thin wooden board according to the amount of space needed, or perhaps a little more.
But if the board is concave in some parts of the splint, then you should fill that concavity with a cloth, and then adjust the board to make it level.
And then strengthen it on top with a long bandage wrapped tightly and firmly with the board, so that it is not moved from its place.
And examine the bandage every day; and whenever it is softened, bind another time and strengthen and straighten the board if it has moved from its place.
And warn the patient to lie on his side.
And the splint is restored in 20 days or in 25.
And so when this number is completed, then you dissolve the bandage, and know for certain that this pertains to the bones whose beginning is not feared nor their dissolution.
And if you proceed from the bone and place a ligature underneath, then you cut over it, remove it, and act as we have said regarding the breaking of the furcula, of an abscess, cauterize if something happens here.
Chapter VII.
On the restoration of a broken foot.
The foot sometimes breaks in the middle part of it and this is delayed; but the ends of it move apart, which are crushed and broken up.
And the accidents of it when it is broken in the middle part are that it inclines towards the interior parts and great pain occurs, and difficulty in breathing, coughing, a strong fever, and vomiting blood; and this is evident in the cavity of the broken bone and is not hidden from feeling.
And the restoration of it is that the patient be placed supine on their back, and a cushion be placed between their shoulders; and then press firmly on their muscles, and align their ribs with the hands of two assistants, and be subtle in the operation of it and in the reduction according to all possible and necessary methods, until the shape of the bone returns as it should.
Here's the line-by-line translation of the given text:
And if the necessity provokes the draining of that which causes corruption or putrefaction, or pain, or an abscess that occurs in that place, then you cut and dissect it, and remove the poultice and correct what happens there with the manner of healing it; and then return the poultice if it is necessary for the surface; and tighten it to the patient until they are healed.
**Capítulo VIII.**
**Sobre la restauración de las costillas cuando están rotas.**
Sé que la fractura de las costillas generalmente ocurre solo en áreas grandes, como la espalda; y en las extremidades de sus divisiones frontales, no se produce dolor a menos que estén dañadas, ya que son cartilaginosas. Y el conocimiento de ello no está oculto al sentido común a través de las preguntas dirigidas a él.
Y la restauración debe realizarse así: cierre las fracturas con los dedos de la manera más posible hasta que se selle, y luego aplique una venda y fortalece los huesos rotos con una lámina, si es necesario.
Y si la fractura de las costillas se desvía hacia adentro, entonces el paciente experimentará un dolor intenso y agudo, como el que sufre alguien con pleuritis, porque los huesos perforan el tejido; y también le será difícil respirar, toser y vomitar sangre; y este caso es difícil de curar.
And already the Ancients were ingenious with these words.
And of them it is said: it is necessary to place food on the patient that causes inflammation and gas production, so that the stomach is inflated and stretched, and the fracture is pushed outward.
But we would advise against this because it may easily cause the formation of an abscess, if not careful; and if it has already happened, then it will help to do so.
And some of them say that it should be placed on the abdomen and sucked with force; this seems reasonable, but however, it is feared that the suction will draw the excess to the site due to weakness.
And some of them say: it is necessary that the site be covered with wool already soaked in cauterizing oil, and pulp placed between the ribs until it is filled, so that the bandage is equal when you wrap it according to its roundness; and then treat the patient with a diet and medicine for pleurisy.
And if the patient experiences severe pain that cannot be endured, and the bones pierce the flesh with a tooth-like puncture, fear for the patient; then it is necessary to make an incision on the site, expose the broken rib, and place over it the instrument that preserves the ciphac (previously mentioned), which cuts the bone easily and removes it.
And then, approximately (we should) close the two lips of the wound. If it is large, we use stitches, and we treat it with plasters until it heals.
And if an abscess occurs inside, then you should cut (it) and insert poultices in rose oil and place (them) over the area, and let the patient be cured with what is appropriate for the internal abscess.
And let him be laid on his back on the side where he sleeps, until he is healed.
Chapter IX
On the restoration of a broken vertebra of the back and neck.
Sometimes it happens that there is a fracture in the bones of the neck, and later (it happens) to their attrition, and similarly to the vertebrae of the back. And when this happens to someone and you want to know if they will be healed or not, then consider, because if you see their hands softened and stunned and dead and he cannot move those nor extend nor strengthen those, and when you press those with your fingers or prick them with a needle and there is no pain in those, then you should know that it is not healed, and in the same way it is fatal.
And if he has a bad sensation and feels constriction with the words and punctures, then you should know that the bone's nape is saved and that the patient will recover with care.
And if you see on the back of the neck something similar to this and you want to know whether it will be healed or not, then observe his feet.
Then if you see that they are already softened, apply to them what has been applied to the hands, and then when he lies on his back, there will be wind and defecation without his will, and sometimes he is turned over on his back and wants to urinate but cannot, then know that it is fatal, and therefore do not try to cure him.  (This passage seems to describe symptoms of paralysis or stroke.)
However, if none of the above-mentioned causes occur, then the cause is better and lighter.
And the treatment for it is that you pierce towards the suppuration of the aposteme (abscess) with a heated needle, placing over the afflicted spine oil or rosemary alone, or with the juice of houseleeks (sempreiviva); place this on it several times a day until the abscess has drained.
Then place one of the comforting and strengthening plasters, and bind it firmly over that area; and instruct the patient to rest and be calm, and not to sleep on the side where they feel pain until they are healed.
Here's the translation of the given sentence:
Here's the translation of the provided sentence:
And if you feel broken bones in the patient, then press on that area, remove it (possibly referring to splinters or foreign objects), and treat the wound with the remedy prescribed until it is healed.
**Chapter X.**
**On the treatment of the spleen.**
**The bones of the spleen are often broken, and if they do break, the fracture is only in their extremities and extends along their length, bending towards the inside; and the patient experiences pain in that area and a puncture, and the leg becomes numb when it is fractured.**
**And to treat it, you should place your hand over the broken area until it conforms to its natural shape.**
**And if the fracture is only in the extremity, then you should splint it according to what appears suitable for evenness until it returns to its natural shape.**
**However, if the fracture is along the length and bends towards the inside, then you should have the patient lie on their back until you are ready to treat that fracture.** **And then when you have splinted it, apply plasters to it, and next place a wooden or leather bandage over it, binding it tightly so that you do not fear the fracture will puncture through or the bandage will slip off.**
And fill the cavity with water that enters up to where it takes the stricture equally, and command the patient to sleep on their back or on their side.
But if you notice a pustule, then cease from extending it and its restoration until the pustule is subsided. Place water on it that sedates it as described before; then return to the patient's restoration, and strengthen it in the manner required.
And if you find a fracture or broken bones, then treat them.
Chapter XI
On the restoration of the broken thumb.
The thumb is what is between the elbow and the shoulder joint.
And if it is broken, then its restoration is done in one of two ways. One way is that you take a flat dowel of medium thickness according to this form:
And at both ends there are ligaments attached, and then it should be suspended from an elevated place.
And the patient should sit on a chair, and then he throws out his broken arm over the dowel until it reaches the middle of the arm, where the curvature of the dowel is attached.
Based on the provided context and the similarities to Latin, Italian, Spanish, and French, here's a line-by-line translation of the given sentence:
Here's the translation of the provided sentence:
And if you want the extension to be stronger, then strengthen on the break with one ligature and on that with another ligature, and each of the two assistants extends to their respective parts.
And therefore if the fracture is near the end of the muscle, then half of the ligature should be placed above the kneecap and the other half below the fracture towards the elbow.
And similarly, if the fracture is near the elbow, then the ligature should be placed on that spot and on that elbow.
Tie it with ease and without strain, and when it is tied according to what is needed and properly applied, then strengthen it if an abscess does not occur.
But if an abscess occurs, then leave the bandage in place for seven days, and place on it wool soaked in vinegar and rose oil until the abscess subsides, and then you can strengthen it.
And the way to strengthen that is to place a plaster on the fracture, and then wrap a bandage of clean cloth over the plaster; and then fasten the arm on that support, and place your open hand on its muscle.
And place a cloth and strengthen over the supports the arms so that the arm is in its place of stars, if there are no obstacles or broken bones.
And then use stars.
And place over the fracture that star which is more broad and stronger than the other stars; and place between each star the thickness of a finger, and let the length of the stars be according to the break with an addition of three fingers on all sides.
And then strengthen over the stars with the strap that was mentioned at the beginning of the chapter.
And make sure your strap over the site of the fracture is tighter. And the longer the break, the narrower should be the strap.
Therefore, if you see that the arrangement of the stars and the strap is done as we have said at the time when you restore the limb to its proper position, then do it.
But if you fear an abscess forming, then leave the strap and the stars in place for seven days as we have said.
And consider the bandage in all parts for three days so that swelling or inflammation does not occur at the site; or it is prohibited that food reaches the member due to excessive tightness of the strap; and therefore correct everything as we have said.
If you are confident that there is no cause for this (condition), then do not remove the bandage until after three days or more.
And let the patient's sleep be on their back, and their hands should be placed on their stomach.
And place on the injured limb a full meal of wool equally, and beware at all times during the night or day that the shape of the broken limb is not distorted or the ligament softened, so correct this with all your skill.
And feed the patient according to the order that we have mentioned before, so that the food is light at first until the strength begins to return; then it is necessary to make the food of the patient heavier.
Because it is customary for the limb and leg to be strengthened in forty days; then they should be unbound, and a bath should be given, and the limb should be treated with ointments that correct this.
And if the break is rough and jagged, then do not unbind that limb and the splints until after one day or two months.
Chapter XII.
Of the restoration of a broken arm.
Based on the context and similarities to modern Romance languages, here's a line-by-line translation of the given sentence:
And if the larger or smaller splint is broken very lightly, they are usually fractured together.
And when the small splint is broken above, its restoration is easy, and its healing is easier.
And when it is broken below, the fracture is bad, and the healing is difficult.
And even worse than that is when two bones are broken at once.
Therefore, if the bone that is broken is the small splint above, it is necessary for the doctor to make a slight extension with ease until it is healed.
But if it is the larger splint that is broken, then one must make a more forceful extension.
And if both splints are broken together, then you should apply the traction much stronger.
And it is necessary that you place your hand for the restoration and the extension lies on a cushion, and the palm of the hand should be above the parts, more than all other things, and the auricular bone should be lower than the others, and let the patient lie on a soft pillow.
And there should be a cushion in front of him at the height or level of his chest, so that the patient does not encounter difficulty.
And then another minister extends the arm from the affected side, placing his hand or a bandage on it, and another minister does the same above him.
And then the doctor wraps the bones until they are returned to their proper form.
And if there are splinters in the bone, then you must perforate everything until it is completely removed from its place with your skill.
And if a splinter is separated and touches the bone and it is not within your hope to restore it, then you cut it off and remove it in the manner we have said above.
But if the fracture is with a wound, I have already written about that in a special chapter, and so take care of it accordingly.
And if an abscess appears at the beginning of your restoration, then you should line a cloth with a bandage made of rose oil and white wax, which is neither too thick nor too thin, and strengthen the cloth over it with a subtle tightness until the abscess subsides; then remove the bandage and place a prepared paste of powdered chalk mixed with egg white on it, and then place scales; and let the scale placed on that fracture be broader and stronger.
And know that the number of stars on the arm refers to the major arrangements, whether it is a fracture in one bone or in two bones at once.
And place your constricting device over the site of the fracture with great strength and vigor. When the constriction is higher or lower on the break, apply the restriction a little more gently, as was mentioned at the beginning of this chapter.
And the cloths that are wrapped around the fracture should be soft and moist, not hard or rough. The thread used to bind it should be neither too fine nor too coarse, as we have recommended.
And examine the limb and the bandage every few days. And if any swelling occurs that requires correction, as soon as it happens to the limb, you should immediately immerse the limb in hot water until the swelling subsides.
And let the limb rest without constraint until it is at ease, and then reapply the bandage.
And if the restriction has been softened and the bone has healed and appears to be strong, then correct everything with your skill.
And consider if the nourishment is prevented from reaching the member due to an excess of stricture. For then you should soften it slightly and leave it for some days until nourishment reaches it, and then strengthen it.
But if the patient does not experience any of the causes we mentioned, then it is not necessary to release him for about 20 days or around that time.
And the patient's hand should also be suspended due to its power of agitated movements, and make him sleep on his back.
And know that this fracture is healed in thirty days or forty-two days, or rather lightly in twenty-eight days, and all of this depends on the disposition of the complexions and the dispositions of the power.
Chapter XIII
On the restoration of a finger fracture of the hand and similar things.
Know that in the fingers of the hand and in the toes of the feet, it often happens that there is a fracture and nothing but bruising occurs to them.
And when there is a fracture or bruising in the hand, it is then necessary for the patient to lie on his back and before him let a cushion be placed according to its size, and then place the hand of the patient on it stretched out.
And then the minister extends the broken bones, and the doctor binds them together until they are properly healed with a good bandage.
And then it is necessary to place a plaster and some padding there, otherwise a boil may form; and then place a steel plate on top according to the size of the area, and you have already wrapped that in linen cloth.
But if the fracture is in the finger joints, you must press the palm of the hand, and then make a pad similar to a ball from cloth, and tell the patient to hold that with their broken hand; then it should be bandaged with a long piece of cloth.
And the steel plate should be made of leather wrapped in cloth, so that the leather is applied to the palm; and hold it as tightly as necessary.
But if the fracture is in the outer joints, then it is necessary to place one steel plate on top and another on the inner side of the palm, so that the hand remains open and straight; and then bind the splint, as the hand is wrapped with the mentioned bandages.
And if there is a fracture in one of the fingers, then if it is a toe, it should be bandaged as necessary and then held to the palm, and if you wish, place a small straight splint so that the fracture is elevated and not misaligned.
This sentence appears to describe a medical procedure for treating a fracture in the toes. Let's break it down line by line:
Certainly! Let's translate the given sentence line by line:
Capitulo XIV (Chapter Fourteen)
On the restoration of a broken thigh bone.
The thigh bone, when broken, is known by sensation according to its displacement in the front and upper parts.
The restoration of it is done thus: the ligaments are tightened above the fracture and another ligament below the fracture, and the patient should lie on their stomach and face down.
And then the servant extends all the ligaments to their proper place according to the quality [of the break], when the fracture is in the middle of the bone.
However, if it is broken at the head of the thigh, then the ligament should be close to the knee in the direction of the tendon, so that the extension can take place on its own, and the other ligaments below the fracture.
Similarly, if the break is at the knee, then the ligament should be made close to the knee, and the extension should be in the parts below it.
And then the physician should unite the bones with both his hands until he reduces them according to their natural appearance and the bone is united by a good union; in that case, it is necessary to apply a plaster and binding, otherwise an abscess may occur in the member. But if there is an abscess in the patient, then leave it alone for several days until the abscess has subsided, and then return to your treatment.
The stricture of the patient should be done as follows: it is necessary to wrap a hard bandage around the fracture, folding it two or three times, and removing excess material; then wrap the leg until it reaches the ankle and the root of the thigh.
Then insert a long needle between the thigh and the leg close to the bone, at the partitions below, so that the ends of the needle come out from the higher partition of the two parts; then wrap what is left over from the bandage around the leg and the thigh.
Then place a splint on the thigh in the place of that fracture, and place one end of it against the bone of the leg.
Then fill the empty spaces between the leg and the thigh with soft cloth, so that the stricture is made firm.
Then begin with a strong binding in the middle of the place of the fracture with three or four wraps, and as you move further away from the place of the fracture, let your binding be smaller, lighter, and moister.
Here's the translation of the given sentence:
And then release the structure on that part so that it is such that corruption or abscess does not occur in the member, nor inflammation and similar conditions; and if any of these things happen, then beware of being removed from him, and correct what happens very closely, according to what we have said many times.
But if the pressure is in the bone where it hurts, then you should splint that part as much as possible; and if not, put a poultice on it and leave it there, and treat it with the remedy mentioned above until it heals.
And sometimes this fracture of the ribs or other bones is reduced by being pulled into place, as we have said in [the section on] help and the arm.
But however, in the restoration of it done in this manner, no limp occurs in the patient; and if it is restored alone or another leg is applied to it, then it is necessary that he limps on the side from which [the injury] always occurs.
And know that the rib is strengthened in 40 days or a little more or less, and all this is according to the diversity of the complexions and other dispositions.
Given that we're dealing with a medieval medical treatise, I would guess that "Capitol .xv." refers to Chapter XV or Section XV of the text. The Roman numeral "XV" corresponds to the number 15 in modern notation.
About the restoration of a broken rib.
Know that a fracture of the rib of the tooth often takes time to heal, but it happens more quickly with careful attention and care.
However, if it is a fracture, then it is only a fissure or crack in its parts, which can be with or without pain, and everything depends on the sensation.
And its restoration is such that what is broken from its parts should be glued together with the aforementioned, until it is joined and united as much as possible by balance, ease of handling, and skillful work.
Then place a plaster over it and place a round piece of wood on top if you need to; and strengthen it with bindings as appropriate.
And then consider all the recommendations we have given for other fractures, such as avoiding inflammation and similar issues, so that you may prevent any accident from occurring until it is healed.
Chapter XVI
About the restoration of a broken thigh.
Know that in the thigh there are two bones, one of which is large and is called the femur; the other is thin and is called the patella.
And it happens with each of the types of fracture that occur in the two bones of the arm; and because of this, its restoration is done similarly to the restoration of the arm itself, and the operation for it is one.
And if two bones are broken at the same time, the leg becomes completely shattered.
And if a finer bone is broken, the leg becomes shattered in front.
And if a thicker bone is broken, it should be pushed back into place; this is one of the things you are not familiar with.
Then administer extension and alignment and bandaging of the splints in the same way.
However, it is necessary that if the leg fracture has many fragments, the extension should be less and lighter, and you should proceed with your skill.
And in the leg there is one operation similar to that of the arm, and it is when you join the splints and complete all of your operations; then you will take pieces of pine wood which are placed under the soles, which are usually made from palm branches; choose those with small thickness, not too thick, and their length should be according to the length of the leg, and inserted from the inside towards the bottom.
And then wrap each leg in two bandages according to their length, placing one on the upper part of one thigh and the other on the lower part of the other thigh, and they should be tightly wound down to the lowest part of the foot.
And then bind the two shins in three places at both ends and the middle, for with this binding the leg is prevented from bending to the right or left, and it remains in a good position.
And now administer a splint of wood according to the length of the leg, and place it on the leg so that it may be immobilized.
And it is especially important that you do this in case of a fracture, which is properly called a wound in this context.
And then consider the leg each day and examine it carefully for any signs of infection or swelling, or other similar causes; and if any such cause appears, then apply a remedy to it until it is healed.
Chapter XVII.
On the fracture of the ankle and the bones of the foot and toes.
The ankle does not always fracture completely; rather, the bones of the foot sometimes fracture; and the toes of the foot rarely fracture, but only bruise in most cases due to their position.
And if the bones of the foot seem to be broken and you notice those bones rising above the others, then place the patient's foot on a prepared surface as if they were walking.
And then place one foot on what is raised from those bones, and then step on them, press down, and squeeze until they return to their places.
And then place a poultice and dressing on top, and place underneath the sole of the foot a small board with two flat heads.
And then strengthen that with the foot using a descending traction, since you have wrapped it with cloth and other materials as needed.
And after three or four days have passed, then you can unbind it, for you will find the bones pressed together, or displaced, or dislocated, and the operation on them is as you know.
But if some are dislocated, then restore those and squeeze them together as I have instructed you in the restoration of the fingers of the hand. And then place a splint on the dislocated toe according to its length and a little wider than it; and place this board under the foot as instructed, and strengthen it with proper traction.
"But if the bone fracture involves two or three or more bones, then place a splint of corresponding size on each finger, wrapped in linen cloth, and strengthen the table at the lowest part of the foot, standing one of the table legs through the sole of the foot so that it has good support.
"And it is important for you to remember not to overlook any of the causes mentioned to you in other cases of fractures; and prepare yourself for all accidents with what is necessary.
"Chapter XVIII.
"On the Fracture of the Female Hip and Pelvis, and the Male Penis and Testicles.
"When the female hip is broken, have that woman lie in a seated position, and then incline her slightly forward at the waist, and she should be supported from behind.
"And then the midwife should fill the hip with cotton, and it should be done in her hip as if it were a spoon; and then the woman should be shaken, and raise her little by little from behind, because all this is forgotten until it is in front of the hip bone as if in a spoon and the broken bone returns.
And then place a pillow on their back, and when they want to urinate, help them easily and quickly, and then return and place the pillow as it was at the beginning, and then return to their first pillow.
And do this for seven days or thereabouts, because by then they will be restored.
And if you wish, take a sheep's bladder and place a reed cannula on the opening of it; then insert the entire bladder into the patient's vagina, and then blow into the cannula with all your strength until the bladder is inflated inside the vagina, for this will cause the dislocation to return.
And then it should be filled with wine and kept there for several days as we have recommended, until the patient is healed.
And when the bone of a man's or woman's thigh is broken, then administer for its restoration and union that which we have recommended for the hipbone.
And what is correct in these cases is not hidden from those who are skilled and practiced, especially if someone knows and understands this my book well; for that fracture indicates to you the major dispositions of the correct way in its restoration and consolidation, so understand it well.
In the case of a man's penis being caught (trapped), he should take a garlic clove and insert it into the penis; then he should place a cloth covering over him and let it be wrapped, and afterwards it should be left for three days or around that time, and it will be cured.
Chapter XIX
On the healing of bone fractures when they are painful.
It is advisable for one who has suffered a painful fracture, especially if the bone is large, such as the thigh or shinbone, or similar to it, that you bleed him and perform phlebotomy on him immediately if the conditions for phlebotomy are favorable to you or testify to this as we have said above.
And if the wound continues to bleed, then you must ensure that you retain it (the blood) by sprinkling powdered white lead over it, unless there is another reason present.
And then immediately begin to set the fracture on that same day, and do not delay it, unless an abscess occurs.
But if an abscess occurs, then you should delay the setting of it until the ninth day, when the abscess has subsided. And do not approach it on the third or fourth day, because you will cause bad accidents.
If the bone is broken and protruding over the knee joint, then it is necessary to drill into it and smooth it with your hands gently and minimally.
However, if the extension is not ready and the alignment of the bones with your hands is not successful, then you should reduce it using this instrument; and it is an instrument made of iron, whose length is seven or eight digits, and its width is according to the size of the wound; and for this reason, it is necessary for the doctor to take three or four of these instruments according to what is needed in the cure for any type of fracture.
And it should be round and have little roughness, so that it does not bend during the operation.
And it should have a sharp tip with a margin on its edges; and the upper part of it should be widening, and the middle part should be narrowing towards the end.
And this is what it looks like:
And in Greek, it is called "labre volentz atelarem," which means small spatula.
Therefore, the sharp end should be raised above the protruding bone's tip.
And you push him back once until he returns to his senses and is calmed by some means.
And therefore you should strive to bring the ends of the fracture together, and if the broken end is thin and does not take the instrument well, then it is necessary for you to insert the end of that bone until the instrument has power over it.
But if you cannot reduce the bone completely with what we have recommended, then insert it with whatever is suitable among the inserters which we have mentioned; or saw it with one of the saws in any manner that is possible for you.
And then file away what remains on the bone of roughness and small splinters.
And when the bone is reduced, and after the reduction the patient feels a violent pain in the tooth, then know that the bone has not returned to its natural place; and then do what you would confer on the patient great benefit.
When you have completed the restoration that you do to the bone, then immediately immerse a cloth in black stiptic vinegar, especially if it is summer, and do not place wax or any other substance containing oil on the wound, so that it does not cause inflammation and corruption in him.
And then administer herbs at the time of your compliment of the restoration of the bone, and leave the wound uncovered so that you can incise it with forceps and use dressings according to the size of the wound.
And be careful not to strain the wound with the fracture, for many foolish doctors have done this and caused death or severe illness in their patients, which is a mistake. And if the constriction is light, make it soft, unlike the constrictions of other fractures.
And if the wound is large or severe, and you fear that bad accidents may occur as we have mentioned, and you feel pain in the area, then it is not appropriate to place herbs on it; instead, apply a dressing of hard cloth to the area and strengthen it with them.
And when after one or two days the wound begins to heal and a scab forms on it, then remove the cloth that you had placed over it with vinegar, and then administer clay, ointments with which according to our custom we treat wounds, such as tetrapharmacon ointment and similar ones.
And you should ensure that the bandage is removed and examine the wound each morning and evening until it is healed and secure, and it is important that the limb be prepared in such a way that the poison runs out of it to the adjacent areas with ease.
If many days have passed and the wound is neither healed nor separated from his arm, then know that here are the beginnings of little worms, for which it is necessary to probe the wound with a probe. And of those beginnings, those that are separate and extruded, those that are not separated and putrefy the limb and cause pain, you should endeavor to cut them out as much as possible for yourself.
And if you see pus or yellow liquid in the wound, it is indicative of flesh-eating disease or another type of corruption and putrefaction, then you should apply one of those things that are suitable for him from the treatment that was mentioned earlier in its own chapter.
And on this matter, in which I must conclude my discourse and you should present your opinion: when the bone is broken, it protrudes from the limb like the bones of the chest and ribs and similar to those of large members, and do not attempt extraction from it, nor its removal, because many times death occurs due to this; having left it alone until it rots, for it will fall out by itself within about 20 or 30 days; then cure the wound if you see fit, and if not leave it.
Capítulo 20 (Chapter 20)
About the treatment of nodes that occur due to a previous fracture.
This node often occurs in the process of healing a fracture, especially near the joints, and it affects the shape of the limb; it also strongly prevents the limb from functioning naturally.
Therefore, consider if the node is recent and administer to it those medicines that have astringent properties such as alum, henbane, hemlock, crabs' eyes, oak bark, and the like; so that you take some or all of these and mix them with vinegar, egg white, or vinegar, and apply this mixture to the node on a piece of wool cloth, securing it well with a tight bandage.
Allow the dressing to remain in place for several days without removing it; then remove it and apply another, continuing this process until the node has diminished; or, as an alternative, place a lead sheet over the affected area, because lead has the property of reducing all swelling in the limbs.
However, if the node has already hardened and is tightly attached, and it is necessary to remove it promptly, then cut through its most elevated part, and excise any excess or protruding flesh, or shave it with razors until it has diminished; and treat the wound until it heals.
Capítulo 21
Capítulo 21: Sobre la restauración de fracturas Cuando se ha restaurado una fractura y el miembro está todavía débil y frágil, sigue su propia naturaleza.
Capítulo 21: Sobre la restauración de fracturas Cuando una fractura ósea se ha restaurado y el miembro aún permanece débil y frágil, esto no ocurre por ninguna razón específica sino por varias causas. Una de ellas es la excesiva solución del hueso roto y la unión incorrecta realizada; otra causa es el exceso de tensión en los ligamentos, lo que impide que el miembro reciba nutrición adecuadamente; también puede deberse al exceso de férulas o vendajes; o por movimientos inapropiados realizados en momentos no indicados; o por la falta de sangre en el cuerpo del paciente y su debilidad.
Capítulo 21: Sobre la restauración de fracturas El tratamiento para esto es dar al paciente alimentos y hacer que su corazón sea tierno hasta que la sangre se multiplique en él; administrar baños; y proporcionar alegría y diversión sobre el miembro.
Capítulo 21: Sobre la restauración de fracturas Luego, coloca una pomada sobre el miembro para que la pomada atraiga el flujo de nutrición, o continúa con vendajes húmedos con agua tibia hasta que la nutrición fluya y el miembro recupere su forma natural.
Chapter 22.
About the treatment of fractured bones when they are set incorrectly, and you forbid the operation that is necessary.
When it happens to a member that has already been set, you should approach its healing from distortion and prominence of the bone fracture and swelling. This is due to the shape of the member, but nevertheless, the member is not prevented from its natural operation. Therefore, you should not accept the word of someone who thinks that member is newly fractured.
However, there have been foolish physicians and restorers who have done this in our land; and this operation is highly blameworthy, causing great fear, the sign of which is deathly.
But if the swelling and inflammation are recent, it is necessary to apply them with warm water in which softening herbs have been cooked, such as leaves of mallow and roots of this plant, and melilot, and similar ones; and let a plaster be made with a softening plaster such as well-made Dulcamara; or let it be taken powdered mucilage of mallow root and mixed with egg white or oil of rosemary, and let it be plastered with that; or let fat figs be taken and crushed with pigeon dung, and similar ones of the medicines that are named amermans consolidacio.
And sometimes it is resolved with persistent gentle friction using the wettest hands, and the movement of the limb should be administered in all directions at all times.
But if the tortuosity has already advanced and is severe and has turned into stone and there is a necessity to cure it with iron, then it is necessary that the pus be on top and that the continuation of the bone be dissolved, and that which superfluously nodulates from that very same part with the bone with subtle scissors be cut, and facilitation be administered in that with solicitude and study.
Chapter XXIII
On Dislocation
Dislocation is the displacement of any joint from its proper place, which prohibits movement, distorts the shape of the limb, and causes great pain and injuries in the patient.
Therefore, when dislocation occurs, it is necessary to immediately pierce and reduce it, and not delay the reduction, because if it is delayed, the place becomes swollen and very difficult to reduce with water.
And for this reason it should not be moved or stretched during the time of swelling, because many times it causes spasm and severe pain.
When this happens, it is necessary for you to proceed with the bloodletting of the patient, and then allow the abscess to rest; and then wrap the limb with hot water and oil, and then reduce it gently.
And let every member be cured with the water of which the memory will come to its place.
And I have already ordered the chapters on dislocation as follows: from the highest part of the body to the lowest, in the same manner as for fractures.
Chapter .24.
On the treatment of dislocation of the lower jaw.
If both jaws are dislocated at the same time and not immediately treated, the dislocation of both is done in one of two ways: either they are moved slightly from their places and become somewhat softened; or they are completely dislocated to the point where they are softened at the joint, causing saliva to run from the patient's mouth so that he cannot close it, and his tongue is wrapped in his throat.  (This sentence may be a bit difficult to interpret due to the archaic language and medical terminology, but I hope this helps!)
But when the dislocation is slight, it returns to its proper place by itself with little difficulty.
"But if the dislocation is complete and fully developed, then it should be gently reduced, and this should not be delayed at all.
"And let the attendant hold the head of the patient, and let the doctor insert his thumb into the space of the dislocated jaw inside the mouth of the patient, if the dislocation is on one side; or let him insert both thumbs at once, if the dislocation is on both sides. And let the others be outside with their hands, by which they should pull evenly; and command the patient to stop moving his jaws and let them go to each part; and the doctor should pull evenly and reinsert the jaw until it returns to its place.
"And if the reduction is difficult, especially if both jaws are dislocated at the same time, then administer a warm water and oil mixture to facilitate the gentle reduction of both jaws, and do not delay the reduction of both jaws at all, as we have said.
"And when they have returned and are even, and the patient's mouth is closed but not softened, then place a cloth soaked in wax and oil on those pulps, and it should be done gently with soft bandages; and thus it should be bound for ease with soft bands.
And let the patient sleep on their back, with their head resting between two pillows to prevent turning to the right or left; and do not force them to eat anything; have their food be finely chopped lion until such time that the pains have subsided and the jaws are relaxed, then let them eat whatever they want.
And let this be administered with ease, and do not work the mouth opening for eating, drinking, or speaking until the jaw is relaxed and healed.
And if the reduction of two jaws is difficult when they are dislocated at some point and not returned to their places, then well-known fevers and persistent sweating occur, and it is easy for the patient's stomach to become swollen, and easily and vomit pure bile.
And when you see this, then know that it is fatal; and well-known is that one who experiences this dies within ten days.
Chapter 25.  (In this context, "Capitol" is an archaic or medieval spelling of "Chapter.")
Of the reduction of the dislocation of the collarbone and of the end of the muscle.
The collarbone is not dislocated from the back inside due to its connection with the feet; and sometimes it is dislocated on the outside, and this is apparent by touch.
And the restoration of him is that the patient should lie on his back and extend his arms. And then press down firmly on the area with your palm, for it will return to its place.
And then place a plaster and powder on it and bind it tightly.
But the extremity that follows the elbow and is connected to it is not dislocated on any day; therefore, it must be reduced and tied up as we have said and according to what you are capable of doing.
And then place a plaster, and powder, and a tourniquet, and instruct the patient to remain quiet and at rest until he is healed.
And with this same method is reduced the extremity of the muscle when it is separated from its place.
Chapter 26.
On reducing the dislocation of the muscle.
Know that the muscle is not dislocated except in three ways, one of which is that it may be dislocated at the attachment of the tendon to the lower attachment.  (This passage describes different types of muscle dislocations, with "titillic" referring to the tendon and "partida dejos" meaning the lower or distal attachment.)
The second way is that it may be dislocated at the upper end of the muscle, and this happens rarely. And it is not dislocated at the back attachments through the shoulder; nor is it dislocated at the front attachments through the nerves.
And if it is dislocated and comes out of the joints, you should tickle it, especially in those areas where there is little flesh, it dislocates easily; but in those with more flesh, it comes out with difficulty.
And if a strong blow strikes some men, and their muscle becomes inflamed with an acute abscess, it is believed that this has already been dislocated.
Therefore, you should press on that area until you are sure of it, and then proceed with his treatment.
And its dislocation is known when it is in the joints, because you should tickle it; so that you can distinguish between the dislocated muscle and the healthy one, for you will find a clear difference between them; and you will find a concavity at the head of the muscle, and when you tickle it, you should feel the touch of the head of the muscle like an egg, and the patient cannot move their hand to their ear, nor do anything more with all movements.
If it is dislocated in the feet or knees, and you then find a clear touch, and it does not hide.
And from this dislocation, an easy reduction is made when it is fresh and the patient is a child.
Certainly! Let's translate the given text step by step:
"But if, due to what we have said, the condition does not improve, and it is from the initial cause that the dislocation occurred many days ago, then it is necessary for the patient to be bathed in hot water and an embrocation that softens and relaxes should be administered, as if made with althea, fenugreek, and melilot in water, and this should be applied.
Here's a line-by-line translation of the given text:
And if you want to, reduce it in this way: that you have a man present who is taller than the patient, and he stands on the opposite side of the bed, and he inserts his muscle between the patient's ribs and lifts the patient's chest up until the patient is suspended in the air, and another assistant pulls the patient's hands out from under them, placing them at their sides. But if the patient is lightweight, then another person should also be suspended with them, in order to make them heavier, because otherwise the dislocation may return quickly.
And it can also be reduced in another way: that is, a long pole should be placed on the ground with a rounded head, similar to a mortar's pestle, not too thick or thin, and then the patient should be placed on top of it; once cloths are placed under the patient's head, and the patient is standing according to the length of the pole, and then their hands are extended out to the sides, and their body is pulled strongly from the other side, because the joint returns to its place quickly.
And if it is difficult to reduce him for all the reasons we have mentioned, then use this remedy: that you take a pole whose length is two arms long, and its width is four fingers, and its thickness decreases towards the head like this:
And now place linen cloths over the patient's head to prevent the wood from striking them.
And then place your hand under the patient's shoulder blades, and extend your arm or both arms over the beam within the shoulder blades, and tie the beam to the supports, the arms, and the ends of your hands.
Then place your arms on the ladder according to its height, and extend your hand under the shoulder blades, and let the other person be suspended from the other side, because the joint will soon enter.
And when the preparation for them is completed in whatever way possible, it is then necessary to place under their shoulder blades a woolen pad of equal size; and then apply a plaster prepared from powdered poppy seeds and egg whites over all the muscles, turning it around on top, and then bind the shoulder blades tightly with a bandage. And let the bandage be rolled onto the plaster, and their hand be fastened to their neck, and let it remain untouched for seven days.
And it is necessary to give the patient's food in small quantities until the limb is comforted, because it is easier for their healing.
Based on the provided context and the structure of the sentences, here's my best guess at translating the sentence:
Certainly! Let's translate the provided sentence:
Based on the pattern you've provided and the context of medieval medical texts, here's a line-by-line translation:
"Regarding the dislocation that occurs at the feet and ankles or at the back of the joints, the reduction is done with traction and extension of the hands until it returns.
"And another stricture should be applied to that [area], and care for it until it is healed.
"And if it happens that the member becomes heavy and slow to move, then the patient should use warm baths until the heaviness is relieved and it returns to its original nature.
"Chapter XXVII.
"On the treatment of shoulder dislocation.
"Know that the shoulder joint is difficult to dislocate and likewise difficult to return; it can be dislocated in any direction, but most commonly forward from the back, and its dislocation cannot be hidden from you because it will be evident from the appearance or touch depending on how it has been dislocated. And when you set the dislocated shoulder with the arm, this is clearly indicated to you, for the joint is concave and cannot bend the arm nor can that muscle touch it.
"And it is necessary that you push and reduce the dislocation as soon as the swelling comes, for if it comes to the swelling, the reduction of it will be difficult, and it will not heal easily; and especially when it is in the back parts, because it is the worst of all other types of dislocations, and very painful, and many warm treatments can lead to death.
And the restoration of him, when it is possible to reduce it, is that his hand be extended with two hands, and his arms be spread out, and the physician's hands be on the elbows and below him, and he should press the joint with the fingers of both his hands at the same time, or with the edge of his palm until it returns to its place.
But if the dislocation is at the shoulder joints in front, then return it so that you bend his hand with your hand, until it strikes the elbow with the edge of your palm.
And if the dislocation does not obey the reduction, then administer strong extension and very strong force.
And two assistants should extend the arm, and hold it in that same position with two other assistants, so that it is not moved away from the extension.
And then the arm should be turned in every direction, since it is wrapped in a long folded cloth around his hand, or bandage.
And when the physician touches the joint with his hand, anoint that [joint] with some oil so that this is one of the causes which aid in the lubrication of the joint and make it easier; and then press the joint with strong pressure until it returns.
And approximately for the reduction of it is necessary that a bandage be placed on which there is astringency and dryness with egg white, and it should be tightened with a strong cord, and the arm should be suspended from the neck, and it should be left for some days.
And approximately it should be released; and if the joint is formed in its place, then release the bandage of him and leave that.
And if you see that the joint is not strengthened, then repeat the bandage and the binding, and leave it for some days until it is tightened; and then release it.
But if there is a severe occurrence near the reduction of the joint, and his condition is restless, then administer moistening in baths and gentle friction, and coldness, until it is relieved; or place on the joint aloe, as it is for strong motion; and then bind it tightly, and leave it on the bone day and night. And then remove that, and put him in a bath; and when he emerges, then rub the joint with temperate friction, and then apply aloe again, as it is for motion, once, and the second time, and the third time, In the process of bathing, until it is cleansed.
And if you wish, place a moist and scraped cowhide over that wound; and do this several times, because it is moist and reduces to its proper state.
Chapter 28.
About the treatment of dislocation in the wrist joint, which is between the arm and the hand.
Sometimes the wrist of the hand is dislocated, and its reduction is easy, which is different from other joints. However, it is important that the reduction be done quickly in the hour in which it is dislocated, before the place becomes swollen or a swelling forms there.
The reduction of the dislocation is done by placing the patient's hand joint on a table and having them extend their hand, while the physician places his hand or palm on the prominent part of the joint and pushes it until it returns to its place.
However, it is important to consider whether the palm has already been moved towards the back of the hand. If this is the case, let the patient place the back of their hand on a table in front of them for extension and reduction; and if the dislocation is at the base of the back of the hand, then the position of the patient's hand should be entirely on the table, so that the doctor's hand falls on that prominence of the joint.
And therefore, if it returns immediately, it is good; and if not, then strengthen it with a plaster that encourages the abscess to release and leave it; and do not repeat this, because if you do, neither you nor the patient can tolerate the reduction of pus that passes during the day.
But however, the joint remains according to its twisted nature; and if the patient feels no pain, except that the hand is softened and cannot strengthen anything; then know that the nerves are pinched or cut, and there is nothing wrong with him except that he should be strengthened with a cautery near the opening of it, and you will confer great benefit on him in this way.
Therefore, when the illness has returned, then place on him the plaster which we have recommended, and let it be left and strengthened for five days; and then it should be removed and left, and the patient's hand should be exercised.
But if the patient's movement is impeded and some heaviness occurs in him, then relieve it with warm water and some rubbing until it is alleviated.
Chapter .29.
About the treatment of dislocation of the toes.
Sometimes these [conditions] are dislocated at every turn.
And when one of these [conditions] is dislocated to the back of the palm or the front of it, then hold the finger and press the dislocation with your thumbs until it returns [to its normal position].
And then support the head of the finger and suspend it in such a way that the dislocated part is facing downwards, and leave it like this for two days.
And then suspend it and extend it until it is straight in its own day.
And when it is night, bind it according to that story, and do not stop unbinding it during the day and exercising with movements, and bind it again at night; and do this for several days until it is straight.
And do the same if it is dislocated to the front of the hand, and bind it to that part and perform the same first operation until it is healed.
Similarly, do the same when it is dislocated in other parts.
Chapter .30
On the treatment of spinal dislocation.
When complete dislocation occurs to any of the vertebrae in the back or neck, and many vertebrae are moved from their places, then there is no cure for that, because death comes to the patient.
And the sign of this is that the patient's bowel movement occurs without their control and they cannot hold it back; often many members of them or both legs, or both arms, or one of those are softened; or a vertebra has been displaced from its place, because many times it has been displaced and many times the removal of these is done in four parts.
Therefore, that which was removed to the rear parts is named gelotizatio.
However, the treatment of this is that when you consider if the gelotizatio occurs in childhood, then there is no cure for it, nor is there any hope of healing it completely.
But for those that occur due to a fall or a blow or something similar, the Ancients have already spoken of the manners of treatment at length, from which the greatest profit comes; but I have already shortened it, because the little that is left out does not detract much from it, due to my closeness to my own understanding. With this explanation, I have presented and formulated it through various instruments, with which I will show and explain it.
And of those [ailments], only the one that occurs in the back is cured with what I recommend.
And the patient should be placed face up on a soft bed near a wall, and under him there should be a wet instrument to prevent his feet from being lifted.
And then place a straight stick in the ground at the head end of the bed, and another stick at the foot end of the bed under his feet.
And let one servant hold the stick and not fix it in a hole; and another servant should hold the other one accordingly.
Then wrap a bandage around the patient's head and tie it securely under his chin; extend the end of the bandage to the stick at his head, and fasten it there; then strengthen another bandage over his hips and buttocks, and go between his thighs; then adjust all the bandages and fasten them on the other stick at his feet.
Then let each servant extend the bandage to the end of the stick, and do not move the two sticks and the bandages from their places where they are fixed, but however, they should not be fixed as we have said.
And the doctor places his palms on the spine with strength until it returns, or places [something] on that spot a table, and then adjusts his feet on the table until it returns.
But if it does not return this way, then take a table whose width or length is about three spans, and make a hole in the wall next to the patient so that the end of the table can fit into it. Then place the majority of the table on the spine, and the doctor places his feet on the other end, and presses strongly until the spine is straightened and returns to its proper place.
And if you wish, turn around the [device] that is reversed with your hand; and it is that you place yourself on the ground behind the patient's head at the end of two posts, the length of which should be one arm, and at the back of the head equally two posts; and let the distance between each post be one palm, and a hole has already been made in each post through which the turn can run, and each should be firmly fixed to the ground so that it does not move.
And there is also a round post through which the turn runs, and it is turned in the two holes of the two posts.
And at the end of it there is an opening through which a rod has been formed, whose length is one handbreadth and it is wrapped around; and in the other two rods, it is similar to this one.
And then strengthen the ties that you have tied on the patient's feet around the opening that is near their head, and the ties that you have tied on their thighs around the turn that is near their legs.
And then there should be one servant at each turn, who turns the turn with his hand, and the physician holds the spine as we have said.
And after the spine has been returned and the place has been held, it is necessary to put on an astringent plaster with egg white, and then wool; and then place on top of the plaster a board whose width is three fingers or about that, and its length should be such that it covers the place of swelling, and over the part of the spine.
And then it should be tied with the tie that we have mentioned, and the patient should be fed with delicate food until they are healed.
And if there remains any swelling in the place after the healing, then it is necessary to administer medicines that soften and cleanse with a prolonged diet, which we have recommended; and already in that place a lead sheet has been applied.
It seems like the text is discussing a medical condition related to the spine and bones. Let's break it down line by line:
"Chapter 31
About the care of a dislocated hip.
Know that the hip joint and the muscle joint should only be considered as dislocation, and not what happens to other joints with slight displacement or concavity.
And the hip joint can be dislocated in four ways: either towards the inside parts, or towards the outside parts, or towards the front parts, or towards the back parts.
And it is most commonly dislocated inward, and less frequently forward or backward.
And the sign of its inward dislocation is that when you align the healthy leg with the patient's, it appears longer and the affected area is more prominent than on the healthy side. The patient cannot bend their affected foot towards the knee, and this is where a hard swelling forms, indicating that the head of the thigh bone has moved inward. 👉 "The sign of its inward dislocation is that when you align the healthy leg with the patient's, it appears longer and the affected area is more prominent than on the healthy side. The patient cannot bend their affected foot towards the knee, and this is where a hard swelling forms, indicating that the head of the thigh bone has moved inward.
And the sign of outward dislocation is that its symptoms are opposite to those mentioned above.
And the sign of that person to whom dislocation happens in the front parts is that he stretches his leg according to its natural state, but nevertheless without bending it painlessly, and if he tries to walk and cannot do so on the front parts; and his urine is retained and his testicles are swollen, and you should make him walk on the soles of his feet.
And the sign of that person to whom dislocation happens in the back parts is that he does not stretch his leg, nor can he bend it forward as much as he can bend his testicles, and his leg is shorter than the other, and his testicles are softened, and you should place the head of the hip in its proper place.
However, the reduction of this type of dislocation is that you consider, if the dislocation is old and chronic, having already lasted for a long time, then when you administer the reduction to him, he will remain according to his disposition, in which case the treatment is not complete; and therefore, it is not necessary to perform any maneuvers.
However, in the case of recent dislocation and it is one of the four types of dislocation, then you should proceed to turn the joint and stretch it towards the inside and towards the outside, both to the right and left, for it returns easily and does not require any other treatment.
Sure, here's a line-by-line translation of the provided text:
And if the extension is from the inside of the elbow to the shoulder blade, or from behind to the back.
And let the extension be of all those [limbs] at once, until the patient is lifted from the ground with their body and remains hanging.
And this type of extension is common to all four [limbs].
And if the dislocation returns with what we have said, it will be good; and if not, then everything that we say about its own cure is necessary.
In the reduction of itself, when it is dislocated, and the dislocation is in the inner parts, the patient must be placed on their back; and then place the bandages over the front of the chest in that place which is between the head of the chest and the place below the armpit; and then extend the bandage from the part of the armpit to the highest part of the shoulder blade.
And then another strong minister should take the arms of the patient and firmly grasp the thick part of the chest, and extend it to the outer parts with great force, because that returns it to its place.
And this type is of easier cure with which this member is reduced than other types.
Mays si es excusat sobre tu e no obezeys al entrament am aquesta specia de curacio de tot, lahoras cove que sian liatz les dos pes del malaute ensemps am liament fort, leugier, sobre amdos les talos e amdos los denols.
And let each of them be four times as long, and let the ailing leg be extended more than the other by two times.
And then have the patient suspended from the top of the pole, and let them be higher up; and let the length from the ground to them be two arm spans.
And then command a strong young man to press on the head of the cushion, and let another young man be suspended with the patient, and let the other young man forcefully press the cushion with strength, for the joint returns to its place swiftly.
But in the proper reduction, when it is a dislocation that has moved outward, it is necessary for the patient to lie on their back as we have recounted having gelbozitated; and let the bandage be tightly wrapped around the ailing leg specifically and around the feet of the patient.
And then two poles should be placed, one under the feet of the patient and the other under their head; and then appropriately sized poles should be placed in the middle of the bed, on which wet cloths are wrapped, so that the patient is not harmed by the pole being between their thighs, because you must ensure that the extension to the parts below is not disturbed.
And then each assistant should extend their part, and the doctor with his hand guides the reduction according to the art.
And when the dislocation is in front of the parts, then it is necessary that the leg be extended slightly, and according to this same narrative, place it on the knee; and the doctor places the palm of his right hand on the patient's heel, and then presses down with the other hand, and with this pressure, extends the part behind the part of the shin.
And if the dislocation is behind the parts, then it is not necessary for the patient to be extended behind the part, and should be raised from the ground; it is also necessary that he be placed on a hard surface, just as we have said about the elevation if his hip is dislocated outward, according to what has been said about placing him on two hips; and it should be on its face and the limbs stretched out, as we have said, there is no doubt.
And it is necessary that a compression with a board be applied to the location where the joint is.
Therefore, when the reduction is completed as it should be — and the sign of its reduction is not hidden from you, and that is when you extend both legs of the patient and when you see those joints and the patient extends their leg and spreads it without hesitation, then you know that the limb has returned to its proper place — at that point, you adjust two cushions, apply plaster, and bind with a bandage in such a way that the width is not increased in any of the parts; and have the patient rest for three days or four.
And then remove the bandage and the plaster, and compare one leg with the other.
At that point, if you see those joints in their proper form, then you know that the dislocation is already fixed, and therefore let the patient go.
And if you see any sign of swelling, then return and plaster that area, and stretch it according to your initial procedure, and leave it for three days.
And then remove the plaster, and make the patient delay walking on each leg for some days, until it is comfortable.
This appears to be the Roman numeral for the number 32, so it likely translates to "Chapter 32".
This phrase translates to "On the treatment of a dislocated shoulder.
"The shoulder is dislocated in three ways: it can be dislocated outward to the side, inward toward the chest, and more often backward; but it cannot be dislocated forward.
"And the sign of its dislocation is that you command the patient to lift their leg with their hip; then you will know that the shoulder is dislocated.
"And the treatment for all of its dislocations is that you make the patient lie on their back, so that they can extend their leg if possible; then adhere your chest to their face, and place their foot between your feet; and then cause the shoulder to adhere with your palms, and hold those between your fingers above the shoulder with strength, while another assistant extends their leg until the shoulder returns to its place.
"And a sign of reduction is that the patient's leg adheres easily to their hip.
"And then apply a plaster to it and cause the leg to adhere to the hip, and then bind both together with a bandage for three or four days, and then unbind them.
And do not let the patient walk for several days until they are healed and strengthened.
But if the reduction of him to you is difficult, then administer strong extension with the lints which in the treatment of the hip were previously mentioned.
Chapter 33.
About the treatment of the dislocation of the ankle.
The ankle is sometimes dislocated by slight movement, and sometimes it is dislocated according to custom, and the dislocation of it is done either at the inner parts or at the outer parts.
And the sign of its dislocation is that you see the ankle swollen on the side to which it is dislocated.
But the treatment of its reduction is easy, and that is to stretch it gently with the hands and to envelop it until it returns.
But in the treatment of it when it is dislocated according to custom, it is necessary that you make the patient lie flat on his back, and that he have a strong and valiant assistant behind him in the middle of his back.
And then take the foot with your right hand on the upper side, and with your left hand on the lower side of the foot in the heel area.
And then pull the foot towards you with your right hand, and then two times with the left hand, and then extend it with the left hand; and press the sole of the foot with the right hand against the thigh without effort.
And do this two more times as we have said.
Then press the sole of the foot against the thigh a third time, and you are at the ankle.
So if the foot returns to its normal position in one or two times following this method, and you see the foot swollen, it is good; but if not, then repeat the operation on him because he will return.
But if it is forbidden to reduce him with what we have recommended, then make the patient lie on his back on the ground, and fasten a very strong rope firmly to the ground, and let it pass between his thighs, and you have already wrapped a cloth around him so that the patient does not hurt. ︎
Then let the servants hold his thighs, and then another servant extend the foot with their hands or with a band that they place on the neck of the foot; and then each servant extends against the extension of his partner, and the rope should be extended between the patient's thighs holding him, so that his body is not pulled towards the sides beyond its natural extension.
And then the physician reduces the dislocation with his hands, while another attendant holds the healthy part at the sides, because the dislocation returns with ease.
And when the dislocation returns and its health is declared to you by reduction, then place a plaster and secure it with strong bandages, and bind the foot to the leg with a bandage.
And you should be careful or guard against the nerves that are behind the ankle, so that the bandage over them is not too strong and presses on them firmly.
And then leave it for two or three days; and if the bandage becomes softened, remove it.
And then unbind it on the third day or the fourth, and forbid the patient from walking for forty days. But if the patient is forced to walk before that time, it is not certain that the dislocation will not be dissolved and corrupted in him, and then he may not receive cure.
And if an abscess forms, then you should administer to him the treatment that we have previously mentioned in another place of care and poultice, until it is healed.
Chapter 34
Of the treatment of dislocation of the toes.
Tell him who is dislocated to be wrapped with a bandage without much tension, and that it is not difficult, but rather easy.
However, if the dislocation is in some toes of the foot, then tell the patient to place their foot on a soft pad or on a table, and stand as if walking.
And then you stand on the toes, and place your foot on what is softest of the joints, and then step on it with all your weight until it returns to its proper position, and you see that it has been wrapped and no protrusion appears.
And then place under the sole of his foot a board that takes all the foot, which has two handles, and then strengthen it with a decent and firm binding for three days; and then unbind it and make him rest from walking for several days, until it is healed and recovery is assured.
Chapter 35
Of the types of dislocation that are caused by a blow, or by a fracture, or by both together.
When such a cause occurs and you undertake the treatment of that dislocation and its restoration, many times death occurs.
And for this, it is not fitting that someone presumptuous interfere in his care, but rather one who is wise in the art, with long experience, merciful and compassionate, cautious, not rash or presumptuous; and who uses at the beginning of medicines that simply sedate inflammations, and leaves the patient to divine judgment, unless it is someone whom you expect salvation from ruin, with relief from the illness, and in which some hope appears. And then strive immediately to make a reduction of it at the beginning of the cause, before an inflammation occurs.
And then if the member returns as desired, administer a regimen that sedates inflammation and treats the wound with what is suitable for it from the drying ointments.
And if there is a dislocation with fracture and the bones are separated, then bore through their substance, and do in it as we have said concerning simple illnesses, preceding in the places of those.
And guard and avoid according to your power that which is against the path of fear, as my preceding sermon has instructed you; for this is better for you with regard to your Creator, and more permanent to your glory, and more healthful to your true body in your time. "Thus ends the words of Al-Bukhari perfectly, for which may God be praised. "Amen
