of white spots
When the disease called "albaras" is old, and the medical treatments do not work, then cauterize it with a cautery a little deep, according to the thickness of the core, until the whiteness is removed, and the color is changed; then treat with vetch flour and lentils with rose oil and plantain leaves, and the blood of a dove and the blood of a lizard, each a part; and mix it all together, and bind it with a cloth, and air it at the place until it is healed.
