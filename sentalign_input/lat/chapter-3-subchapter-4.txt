On the restoration of the lower jaw when it is fractured.
Chapter V.
When the lower jaw is fractured, and the fracture is not accompanied by a wound: then observe if the fracture is only on the outside and not split in two, and if it bends inward: in that case, its diagnosis is easy.
Therefore, if the fracture is on the right side, you should insert the index finger of your left hand into the patient’s mouth; similarly, if the fracture is on the left side of the jaw, then insert the index finger of your right hand; and with it, gently push the bump of the fracture from the inside toward the outside, using your other hand from the inner side of the bone to align it properly.
But if the jaw fracture is already separated into two, then you should manage the cleaning of both parts, aligning them as straight as possible until adjustment is achievable.
If any teeth have already become loose or dislodged, then secure those which you believe will stay in place with a gold, silver, or silk thread.
Then apply cerate over the fractured jaw.
Then place a folded cloth over it, and place a large splint properly made on the cloth, or a piece of leather of equal length to the jaw.
Then bind it from above, according to how the bandage has been prepared for you, so that it is appropriately applied and does not move; and instruct the patient to rest quietly: and provide them with soft broths for nourishment.
If you think that some part of its shape has already changed in any way, then hasten and loosen it on the third day.
Then correct what has been altered, and apply a plaster made of millstone powder with egg white, or with sesame flour, after you have removed the cerate: and place soft wool over the plaster.
As long as the plaster remains attached over it and the bone’s alignment does not change, leave it undisturbed; do not loosen it until it heals: or tighten the fracture.
For often this fracture is set within three weeks.
If a hot swelling occurs in the meantime, then apply what we have frequently mentioned to alleviate it, until the swelling subsides.
And if the fracture is accompanied by a wound, consider it.
For if a piece of bone or splinter is already separated, then proceed carefully to remove those bone fragments with the instruments suitable for their extraction.
But if the wound opening is narrow, then enlarge it with a lancet according to your need.
Then, when you have removed those splinters and none remain, suture the wound opening if it is large; if not, apply plasters suitable for it that encourage flesh growth until it heals.
