Chapter Twenty-Eight.
On Treating Swelling of the Liver by Cauterization.
If an abscess occurs in the liver and you want to know if that swelling is in the flesh of the liver or in its membrane, if it is in the flesh of the liver, then the patient will feel heaviness and pain without sharpness.
And if it is in the membrane of the liver, there will be severe sharpness with the pain. If you see that it has exhausted the physicians' treatment, then the patient should lie on his back, then mark the swollen area with ink.
Then heat the cautery in the fire, which is the cautery that resembles an awl, and this is its image.
And cauterize it with it one cauterization until you burn all the skin and reach the membrane with the cautery until all the pus comes out. Then treat it with the treatment of abscesses until it heals.
This type of cautery should not be used except by someone who has long been trained in the art of medicine, and has experienced these diseases repeatedly. Only then can he proceed with such a procedure. Leaving it [untreated] is, in my opinion, better.
