Praefatio.	Here is the translation:
Postquam compleui uobis o Filii, librum hunc, qui est postremus scientiae in medicina cum complemento ipsius, et consecutus sum finem in eo, ex expositionibus eius, et ipsius declarationibus, uisum est mihi, ut compleam ipsum uobis cum hoc Tractatu qui est pars operationis, id est, chirurgiae cum manu.	After I had finished the book for you, my sons, this book, which is the last part of knowledge in medicine with its complement, and I have reached the end of it, based on explanations from it, and declarations by it, it seemed to me that I should complete it for you along with this Treatise, which is a part of operation, namely, surgery with hand.
Quoniam operatio cum manu prostrata est in regione nostra, et tempore nostro priuata omnino: donec fortasse periit scientia eius, et abscissum est uestigium eius: et non remanserunt ex ea, nisi descriptiones paruae in libris antiquorum, quas mutauerunt manus: et accidit eis error et haesitatio, donec clausae sunt intentiones eius, et elongata est uis ipsius: Visum est mihi, ut uiuificem eam cum ordinatione huius Tractatus in ea secundum uiam ex positionis, et declarationis, et abbreuiationis: et ut ueniam cum formis ferramentorum Cauterii, et reliquorum instrumentorum operis: cum fit ex declarationis additione, et ex properatione eius quod est necesse.	Since the operation with hand is almost forgotten in our region and time, and its knowledge has almost perished, and a trail of it has been cut off: and except for brief descriptions in ancient books, which hands have altered: and mistakes and hesitation occurred to them until the intentions were closed off and the force was spent. It seemed to me that I should revivify it with the arrangement of this Treatise, according to the way of exposition, declaration, and abridgment: and come along with the forms of iron instruments Cauterii, and other tools of work: as it is necessary from the addition of declaration, and its properation.
Caussa autem propter quam non inuenitur bonus artifex eius cum manu sua in hoc nostro tempore, est: quia ars medicinae est longa, et oportet auctorem eius exercitari ante illud in scientia anatomiae, quam narrauit Galenus, donec sciat iuuamenta membrorum, et ipsorum formas, et eorum coniunctionem, et separationem, et habeat cognitionem ossium, et neruorum, et lacertorum, et numerum ipsorum, et eorum egressionem, et uenarum pulsatilium, et quietarum, et locorum exitus earum.	The reason why a good craftsman of it with his own hand is not found in our time, is: because the art of medicine is long and requires its author to be exercised beforehand in the science of anatomy, as Galenus narrated, until he knows the benefits of limbs, and their forms, and their connections, and separations, and has knowledge of bones, nerves, tendons, and their numbers, and their exit, and the emergence of veins, both pulsating and quiet, and the locations of their exits.
Et propter illud dixit Hippocrates, quod nomen cum nomine est multum, et cum opere est paucum, et praecipue in arte manus.	And for that reason Hippocrates said that a name is much with a name, and little with a work, and especially in the art of hands.
Nos uero iam diximus de illo in introitu huius libri.	We have already spoken about it at the beginning of this book.
Quoniam qui non est sciens, quod diximus de anatomia, non euacuatur, quin iam cadat in errorem, quo interficiuntur homines: sicut ego uidi multos ex illis, qui formantur de hac scientia, et iactant se de ea absque scientia, et sine experimento.	For he who is not knowing what we have said about anatomy, is not purified, but rather falls into error, by which men are killed: as I have seen many of those who claim to be formed from this science, and boast about it without knowledge, and without experience.
Quod est, quia uidi medicum stolidum secuisse apostema scrophulosum in collo mulieris, et incidit quasdam arterias in collo: quare fluxit sanguis mulieris, donec cecidit mortua inter manus eius.	What happened was that I saw a foolish doctor cut away a scrofulous abscess on a woman's neck and then severed some arteries on her neck. Wherefore the woman's blood flowed until she fell dead between his hands.
Et uidi medicum alium, qui praesumpsit ut extraheret lapidem uiro, qui processerat in aetate, et lapis erat magnus.	And I saw another doctor who attempted to remove a stone from an elderly man, and the stone was large.
Peruenit ergo ad eum, et extraxit ipsum cum frusto uesicae.	So he came to him and removed it with a piece of bladder.
Quare mortuus est uir in tertio die.	Wherefore the man died on the third day.
Et ego quidem iam uocatus fueram ad extrahendum ipsum: et uidi ex magnitudine lapidis, et dispositione infirmi, quod moriretur.	And I myself had been summoned to remove it; and I saw from the great size of the stone and the patient's condition that he would die.
Et uidi medicum alium, qui accipiebat stipem apud quendam Ducum terrae nostrae propter medicinam: et accidit eunucho nigro, qui erat apud ipsum, fractura in crure eius prope calcaneum: et properauit medicus cum ignorantia sua, et strinxit fracturam super uulnus cum puluinaribus, et astellis strictura forti, et non dimisit uulneri expirationem.	And I saw another doctor who was receiving payment from a certain Duke of our land for his medical services; and it happened to a black eunuch who was with him that he suffered a fracture in the leg near the heel: and the doctor hastened without knowledge, and bound the fracture over the wound with bandages, and with strong ligatures, and did not permit the wound to breathe.
Deinde absoluit eum secundum desyderia sua.	Then he finished with him according to his own desires.
Postea dimisit eum diebus aliquot, et praecepit ei, ne solueret ligamentum: et stetit sic donec apostematum est crus eius, et ipsius pes, et peruenit ad perditionem.	Afterwards he released him after a few days and instructed him not to loosen the bandage; and he stood thus until his leg and foot became gangrenous and he came to ruin.
Vocatus sum ergo ad eum: et properaui ad soluendum ligamentum: et consecuta est tranquillitas, et euasit a doloribus suis.	I was summoned to him: and I hastened to loosen the bandage; and as a result there was peace, and he was relieved from his pains.
Verumtamen corruptio iam confirmata erat in membro: et non potui refraenare ipsam.	However, corruption had already taken hold in the member, and I was not able to prevent it.
Pon ergo cessauit corruptio perambulare in membro, donec periit.	Then the corruption ceased to spread in the member until he died.
Et uidi medicum alium, qui perforauit apostema cancerosum: et ulceratum est post dies, donec magnificata est malicia eius cum domino ipsius.	And I saw another doctor who pierced a cancerous abscess; and it ulcerated after some days, until the wickedness of his patient was glorified with his lord.
Quod est, quia quando est cancer purus ex humore melancholico, tunc non oportet ut perueniatur ad eum cum ferro omnino, nisi sit in membro quod toleret, ut abscindatur totum eius.	What is this? Because when a pure cancer arises from melancholic humor, then it is not necessary to cut into it entirely with iron, unless it is in a limb that can tolerate it, so that the whole thing may be removed.
Et propter illud o Filii, necesse est uobis, ut sciatis, quod operatio cum manu diuiditur in duas diuisiones: scilicet, operationem cui associatur salus: et operationem, cum qua est periculum in pluribus dispositionibus.	And for this reason, O sons, it is necessary for you to know that the operation is divided into two divisions by hand: namely, an operation with which salvation is associated: and an operation, with which there is danger in many dispositions.
Et ego iam excitaui in omni loco huius libri, in quo uenit operatio, in qua est terror et timor.	And I have already stirred up everywhere in this book where the operation comes that has fear and trembling.
Quare necesse est uobis, ut caueatis illud, et dimitatis ipsum: ut non inueniant stolidi uiam ad loquendum, et dehonestandum.	Therefore it is necessary for you to beware of that and leave it alone: so that the foolish may not find a way to speak and shamefully expose.
Accipite ergo mensuram cum sollicitudine et protectione, et infirmos uestros cum facilitate et firmitudine, et utimini uia meliore perducente gratia Dei ad salutem et successionem laudabilem: et dimittite aegritudines terribiles difficilis sanationis: et tollite animas uestras ab eo quod facit uos timere, ut ingrediatur super uos haesitatio in fide uestra et commodo uestro.	Therefore, receive with solicitude and protection the measure, and treat your infirm patients with ease and firmness, and use a better way guided by the grace of God to salvation and a praiseworthy succession: and leave behind terrible sufferings that hinder difficult healing; and lift up your souls from what makes you fear, so that hesitation may enter upon you in your faith and comfort.
Est enim magis remanens ad gloriam uestram, et sublimius in mundo isto, et postremo ad quantitates uestras.	For it is more remaining for your glory, and higher in this world, and finally for your accounts.
Galenus enim iam dixit in quibusdam suis admonitionibus.	Galenus indeed said in some of his warnings.
Non medicetis aegritudinem malam: ne nominemini medici mali.	You will not heal bad illnesses: lest you be called evil doctors.
Iam autem diuisi hunc Tractatum secundum tria Capitula. ¶	But now I have divided this Treatise into three Chapters.
Capitulum primum.	The First Chapter.
De Cauterio cum igne, et Cauterio cum medicina acuta, capitulatum, et ordinatum a capite usque ad pedes, et formis instrumentorum, et ferramentis Cauterii: et omni quod necessarium est in operatione. ¶	On cauterization with fire and cauterization with sharp medicine, set forth and arranged from head to feet, and the forms of instruments and tools of cauterization: and all that is necessary for the operation.
Capitulum secundum.	The Second Chapter.
De sectione et perforatione, phlebotomia et uentosis, et uulneribus: et extractione sagittarum, et similibus illius: et totum capitulatum, ordinatum formis instrumentorum. ¶	On section and perforation, bloodletting and venesection, and wounds: and the extraction of arrows, and similar things to these: and all set forth in the forms of instruments.
Capitulum tertium.	The Third Chapter.
De restauratione, et dislocatione, et curatione torsionis, et similibus illius: capitulatum, ordinatum a capite usque ad pedes, et formis instrumentorum.	On restoration, and dislocation, and curing of twisting, and similar things to these: set forth in the forms of instruments, from head to feet.
Soli Deo Gloria.	To God alone be the glory.
Liber Chirurgici Albucasis.	Book of Surgery by Albucasis.
Pars I.	Part I.
¶ De Iuuamento, et Nocumento Cauterii: et quibus complexionibus conueniat, et quo tempore: et si cum ferro, uel auro.	About the application and harm of cauterization: to what humoral conditions it is suitable, when to use it, and whether with iron or gold.
Caput I.	Chapter 1.
Sed Ante Quidem Quam rememorer operationis cum eo, oportet ut dicam qualitatem Iuuamentorum eius, et Nocumentorum ipsius: et in qua complexione exhibeatur.	But first of all it is necessary to recall the nature of its benefits and harms, as well as how it should be exhibited in a given complexion.
Dico ergo, quod sermo de qualitate iuuamenti Cauterii, et nocumenti eius, est sermo prolixus, et subtilis, scientia, et secretum occultum.	I say therefore that the discourse on the quality of the benefits and harms of cauterization is a lengthy and subtle one, requiring knowledge and secrecy.
Etiam locuta fuit in eo multitudo sapientum, et dissenserunt in eo: et mihi quidem sufficit parum ex sermonibus eorum, timens prolongationem.	And many wise men have spoken on the subject, and they have disagreed among themselves; and for my part, I am content with a little of their words, fearing prolongation.
Dico ergo, quod Cauterium confert uniuersaliter omni complexioni, quae est cum materia, et absque materia: excaeptis duabus complexionibus, quae sunt complexio calida absque materia, et complexio sicca absque materia.	I say therefore that cauterization is beneficial to all complexions, both those with material and those without; excepting only two complexions, which are the hot dry complexion without material and the dry complexion without material.
In complexione autem calida et sicca cum materia dissenserunt.	But in a hot and dry complexion with material there was disagreement.
Quidam enim dixerunt, quod Cauterium iuuatiuum est in ea.	For some said that cauterization is beneficial in it.
Et dixerunt alii contrarium illius, scilicet quod Cauterium non est conueniens in aegritudine, quae est ex caliditate et siccitate: quoniam natura ignis est caliditas: et inconueniens est, ut sanetur ex agritudine calida et sicca, cum calido et sicco.	And others said the opposite of this, namely that cauterization is not suitable in a disease which arises from heat and dryness; because nature's fire is heat: and it is unsuitable to heal a hot and dry disease with something hot and dry.
Et dixit ille qui dicit contrarium illius: quod per Cauterium fit iuuamentum in omni aegritudine calida et sicca, quae accidit in corporibus hominum: quoniam quando tu comparas corpus hominis, et humiditates eius, ad complexionem ignis, inuenis corpus hominis frigidum.	And he who said the opposite of this said: that through cauterization there is benefit in every hot and dry disease which occurs in human bodies; because when you compare a human body and its moisture to the fiery complexion, you find the human body to be cold.
Et ego quidem dico per sermonem eius: quia ex perimentum iam detexit mihi illud aliquotiens.	And I indeed say so by his words; because through experiment it has been revealed to me on several occasions.
Verumtamen non oportet, ut ueniat super illud, nisi qui iam probatus est, et exercitatus in capitulo Cauterii exercitio ultimo, et cognouit diuersitatem complexionum hominum, et dispositionem aegritudinum in se ipsis, et caussas earum, et accidentia ipsarum, et spacium temporis earum.	However, it is not proper for someone to attempt this unless they have already been proven and trained in the last exercise of Cauterization, and know the diversity of human complexions, and the disposition of diseases within themselves, and their causes, and accidents, and the time span of these.
Ex reliquis autem complexionibus non est super uos timor: et praecipue in aegritudinibus frigidis et humidis.	But as for the other complexions, there is no fear over you: and particularly in cold and moist diseases.
Iam enim conuenerunt omnes medici super eas: et non dissenserunt in iuuamento cum Cauterio in eis.	For now all doctors have agreed on these, and have not disagreed with the use of cauterization in them.
Et scitote filii, quod ex secreto curationis per Cauterium cum igne, et bonitate eius super Cauterium cum medicina comburente est: quoniam ignis est simplex, cuius actio non peruenit, nisi ad membrum quod cauterisatur: et non nocet membro alio coniuncto cum eo, nisi nocumento paruo.	And know, sons, that from the secret of healing by Cauterization with fire, and the excellence of it over Cauterization with medicine burning together is this: because fire is simple, whose action does not reach unless to the part that is cauterized; and it does not harm another adjacent member, unless for a small amount.
Medicinae uero comburentis actio peruenit ad illud quod elongatur ex membris: et fortasse facit accidere in membro aegritudinem difficilis sanationis, et fortasse interficit.	The action of medicine burning together reaches to that which is separated from the member; and perhaps makes an affliction occur in the member difficult to heal, and perhaps kills.
Ignis autem propter subtilitatem suam et bonitatem substantiae suae, non facit illud, nisi superfluat.	But fire, because of its subtlety and goodness of substance, does not do that unless it is excessive.
Iam uero innotuit nobis illud per experimentum, propter longitudinem seruitutis et studii cum arte, et stationem super ueritatem rerum: et propter illud excusor a longitudine sermonis.	And now it has become known to us through experience, because of the length of service and study with art, and standing on the truth of things: and because of this I excuse myself from the length of speech.
Et si non esset, quia non licet huic libro meo, afferrem uobis secretum occultum in igne, et qualitatem operationis eius in corporibus expulsionis suae, qua expellit aegritudines sermone philosophico demonstratiuo, qui acueretur a mentibus uestris.	And if it were not so, because it is not permitted to this book of mine, I would reveal to you the secret mystery in fire, and the quality of its operation in bodies of expulsion, whereby it expels diseases by a philosophical demonstration, which would be sharpened in your minds.
Et scitote filii, quod ipsi dissentiunt in tempore, in quo conuenit fieri cauterium, et ponunt melius tempus ueris.	And know, sons, that they themselves disagree on the time in which cauterization should be done, and put forward a better time for truth.
Et ego dico, quod cauterium conuenit in omni tempore: propterea, quod nocumentum accidens propter tempus submergitur in iuuamento, quod attrahitur cum cauterio.	And I say that cauterization is fitting at any time: therefore, since the harm occurring due to time is submerged in the benefit that is attracted with cauterization.
Et praecipue si cauterium est propter dolores ex doloribus necessariis, fortibus, festinis, qui non tolerant tarditatem: propterea quod timetur ex eis, quod accidat malicia quae est maior, quam paruum nocumentum intrans propter tempus.	And especially if cauterization is done on account of necessary pains, strong ones, festive ones, which do not tolerate delay: therefore because one fears from them that a greater mischief may happen, than a small harm that passes by due to the time.
Et non cadat in mentibus uestris o filii illud, quod non extimant, nisi uulgus et stolidi medici, scilicet quod illi aegritudini quae sanatur per cauterium, non est reditio semper: et ponunt illud consequens, et res non est sicut putant: propterea quod cauterium non est, nisi loco medicinae, quae alterat complexionem, et exiccat humiditates quae sunt caussae, quare accidunt dolores.	And let it not fall into your minds, O sons, that which the uncouth and foolish doctors do not esteem, namely that those who are sickened by what is cured through cauterization are not always restored: and they put forth as a consequence, and it is not as they suppose: therefore because cauterization is not, except in place of medicine, which alters the complexion, and dries up the moistures that are causes why pains occur.
Verumtamen cauterium superfluit super medicinam per uelocitatem ualetudinis suae, et uirtutem suae operationis, et uehementiam dominii sui: et possibile est, ut redeat aegritudo hora aliqua temporis secundum complexionem infirmi, et locationem aegritudinis suae, et uirtutem eius: et quod praeparatur in corpore eius ex aggregatione superfluitatum in eo: et quod peruenit ad ipsum in acquisitione sua ex cibis, et similibus illis ex caussis, nisi fit aegritudo, in qua administratur cauterium.	However, cauterization is superfluous over medicine due to the swiftness of its own health, and the virtue of its own operation, and the vehemence of its own dominion: and it is possible that illness returns at some hour's time according to the patient's complexion, and the location of their illness, and its virtue: and what is prepared in their body from the aggregation of superfluities within them: and what reaches it through acquisition from foods and similar things from causes, unless there is an illness where cauterization is administered.
Aegritudo subtilis in membro paucarum superfluitatum, et humiditatum, sicut cauterium dentis, propter dolorem, et similia illi, possibile est enim, ut non redeat in eo ille dolor.	A subtle illness in a member of few superfluities and moistures, such as cauterization of the tooth, on account of pain, and similar things: for it is possible that the pain does not return in that place.
Sed illud fit in paucis.	But this happens in a few cases.
At uero sermo uulgi iterum, quod cauterium est postremum medicinae, est sermo rectus: non ad illud quod ipsi intendunt in illo: quoniam ipsi credunt, quod non est curatio quae conferat cum medicina, neque cum alio post occasum cauterii.	But the common people's saying again is that cauterization is the last resort of medicine, it is a true statement: not as they intend in that respect: because they believe that there is no cure which contributes along with medicine, nor along with anything else after the occasion of cauterization.
Res autem est econtrario illius, et intentio, quod cauterium est postremum medicinae, non est, nisi quod quando nos administramus modos curationis in aliqua aegritudinum, et non conferunt illae medicinae: deinde administramus in fine rei cauterium, et confert: tunc inde cadit, quod cauterium est postremum mediciuae, non secundum intentionem quam intelligunt uulgus et multistolidorum medicorum.	However, the fact and intention are contrary to that, because cauterization is not the last resort of medicine, unless when we administer methods of cure for some illness, and they do not contribute with medicines: then we administer at the end of things cauterization, and it contributes: thus it falls out, that cauterization is the last resort of medicine, not according to the intention which the common people and many foolish doctors understand.
Antiqui autem dixerunt, quod cauterium cum auro est melius, quam cauterium cum ferro: et non dixerunt illud, nisi propter aequalitatem auri, et sublimitatem substantiae suae: et dixerunt, quod non facit pus locus cauterii.	The ancient ones said that the cautery instrument with gold is better than the one with iron. And they didn't say this unless it was due to the equality of gold and the subtlety of its substance. And they said that the place of the cautery does not create pus.
Verum non est illud absolute: quoniam ego iam probaui illud, et inueni, quod ipsum non facit illud in quibusdam corporibus absque aliis.	But that is not absolutely true: for I have already tested it and found that it does not do so in certain bodies without other things.
Et cauterium cum ipso est bonum, et melius quam cum ferro, sicut dixerunt.	And the cautery instrument with that is good, and better than with iron, as they said.
Verumtamen quando tu ignis cauterium in igne ex auro, non declaratur tibi, quando ignitur secundum quantitatem quam uis, propter rubedinem auri: et quando properat ad ipsum frigus, et si addis super ipsum ignitionem, liquescit in igne, et uertitur in laminas.	However, when you put the gold cautery instrument into fire to burn it, it is not revealed to you what is burning according to the amount you desire, because of the redness of the gold: and when it cools down a bit, and if you add superfluous ignition, it melts in the fire and turns into plates.
Quare cadit artifex ex illo in occupationem: et propter illud fit Cauterium cum ferro apud nos uelocius et propinquius, ex rectitudine ad operationem.	Therefore, the craftsman falls into that occupation: and because of this, a cautery instrument with iron is quicker and more nearby among us, due to its rightness for the operation.
Et ego quidem iam ordinaui hoc Capitulum in Cauterio, secundum capitula: et ordinaui ea a capite usque ad pedes: ut alleuient quaerenti illud quod uult ex eo.	And I indeed have arranged this Chapter on Caustic Instruments, according to chapters, and arranged it from head to foot so that those seeking something from it may easily find what they want.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Caput in commissura coronali.	Of the manner of cauterizing the Head at the coronal suture.
Caput II.	Chapter 2.
Confert hic cauterizatio ad dominium humiditatis et frigiditatis super cerebrum: quae duae sunt caussae sodae, et multitudinis fluxus humorum ex capite ad partes oculorum et aurium, et multitudinis somni, et doloris dentium, et doloris gutturis: et uniuersaliter omnis aegritudinis, quae accidit ex frigiditate, sicut paralisis, et sodae, epilepsiae, et apoplexiae, et similia illis ex aegritudinibus.	This cauterization brings about the dominance of moisture and coldness over the brain: which two are the causes of headache, and the multitude of fluxes of humors from the head to the eyes and ears, and the multitude of sleep, and toothache, and throatache: and universally all kinds of illnesses that occur due to coldness, such as paralysis, epilepsy, apoplexy, and similar ones from those illnesses.
Modus cauterizationis est, ut praecipias infirmo: ut euacuetur in primis cum medicina solutiua mundificante caput tribus noctibus, aut quatuor, secundum quod exigit uirtus infirmi, et eius aetas, et consuetudo eius.	The method of cauterization is, that you prepare the patient: so that it may be done with a solvent and cleansing medicine three nights, or four, according to what the weakness of the patient requires, and his age, and custom.
Deinde praecipe ei, ut radi faciat caput suum cum nouacula.	Then instruct him to make his head bald with a razor.
Deinde fac eum sedere inter manus tuas quadratum, ita quod iam posuit manus suas super pectus suum.	Then make him sit between your hands square, so that he has already placed his hands on his chest.
Deinde pone radicem palmae tuae super radicem nasi sui inter oculos suos.	Then place the root of your palm on the root of his nose between his eyes.
Vbicumque ergo peruenerit digitus tuus medius, signa locum illum cum incausto.	Wherever your middle finger has reached, mark that spot with an inkstick.
Deinde igni Cauterium Oliuare: cuius haec est forma.	Then apply the oil cautery by fire: which is in this form.
Deinde pone ipsum super locum signatum cum incausto, descensione, qua constringatur manus tua paulatim, et tu reuolues ipsum.	Then place it on the marked spot with ink, slowly turning your hand down and reversing it.
Deinde leua manum tuam uelociter, et aspicias locum.	Then quickly lift up your hand and look at the spot.
Quod si uides iam detegi ex osse quantitatem capitis alkiel, aut quantitatem zeuherbi, tunc eleua manum tuam.	For if you see already opened up from bone a quantity of skull or a quantity of zeuberbe, then lift up your hand.
Et si non, itera manum tuam ferro ipso, aut cum alio ab ipso si infrigidatur: donec uideantur ossa, quae dixi tibi.	And if not, repeat your hand with the same iron or with another one that has been cooled; until you see the bones which I told you.
Deinde sume aliquid ex sale, et solue illud in aqua, et imbibe in ipso cotum, et pone super locum: et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus.	Then take something from salt and dissolve it in water, and pour it into the wound, and place it on top; and leave it for three days.
Deinde pone super ipsum cotum imbibitum in butyro, et dimitte illum super locum, donec destruatur eschara ignis.	Then place the soaked compress on top of the wound and leave it there until the scab is burned away.
Deinde cura illud cum unguento tetrapharmacon, usquequo sanetur.	Then care for that with the ointment Tetrapharmakon until it heals.
Iam dixerunt, quod quanto uulnus plus remanet apertum, emittit pus: quare est melius et magis iuuatiuum.	They have said that the more a wound remains open, the more it discharges pus: therefore it is better and more beneficial.
Et dixerunt quidam eorum, ut cauterizetur cutis usque ad os: et teneatur Cauterium, donec aduratur quiddam spissitudinis ossis.	And some of them said that the skin should be cauterized all the way to the bone: and the cautery should be held until something thickened on the bone is burned.
Deinde radatur post illud quod adustum est ex osse, deinde curetur.	Then it should be scraped after what has been burned away from the bone, then it should be healed.
Et dicunt alii, quod oportet ut cum cauterio perueniatur ad ultimum, donec imprimat in os impressionem for tem, ita quod cadat os, quod fit sicut forma kirate: aut instrumentum quod mulieres ponunt infuso alphabeti parui: et extimant, quod exspirantur ex hoc loco uapores capitis, et dimittatur uulnus apertum tempore longo.	And others say that it is necessary to reach the very end with the cautery, until it imprints on the bone a form like a kirate: or an instrument which women use, infused with small alphabet letters; and they suppose that vapors of the head are exhaled from this place, and the wound should be left open for a long time.
Deinde curetur, donec consolidetur.	Then it will be treated until it is consolidated.
Mihi autem non uidentur hae duae species Cauterii omnino nisi in quibusdam hominibus secundum uiam timoris.	But these two kinds of cauterization do not seem to me entirely evident, except in certain people according to the way of fear.
Et dimittere ipsum, apud me est melius cum salute ipsius.	And to let him go, with his own safety, is better for him in my opinion.
Debilitatur enim caput ex solutione continuitatis ipsius naturalis: sicut testificati sumus in reliquis membris: et praecipue quando caput infirmi debile est natura: et species quidem Cauterii prima est magis salua et melior apud me, et ea utor: operare ergo cum ea in salute.	For the head is weakened by the dissolution of its natural continuity, as we have testified in other members; and especially when the head of the weak person is naturally feeble: and indeed, the first kind of cauterization seems to me more salutary and better, and I use it: therefore, I operate with it for the sake of health.
¶ De modo cauterizandi capitis in dolore totius capitis.	On the manner of cauterizing the head when the entire head is in pain.
Caput III.	Chapter 3.
Quando in toto Capite accidit dolor chronicus: et prolongatur illud in infirmo, et utitur hyeris, et cochiis, et caputpurgiis, et oleis, et empleumatis.	When a chronic pain occurs throughout the whole head and is prolonged in the sick person, and they use hellebores, cumin, heads of garlic, and oils, and emplastrums.
Et praecipue si iam cauterizatum est cauterio uno, quod narrauimus, et non confert ei aliquid ex illis: tunc considera.	And especially if it has already been cauterized with the first kind of cauterization that we have described, and does not bring him any relief from those things; then consider.
Nam si caput infirmi est fortis creationis natura, et non est debile, et inuenit frigus uehemens: tunc cauteriza cum cauterio alio sub illo parum.	For if the head of the weak person is strong in natural creation and is not feeble, and finds a moderate coldness: then cauterize with another kind of cauterization slightly below that.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum super omne cornu capitis sui cauterio, do nec pertranseat cutis, et discooperiatur ex osse quantitas, quam narrauimus.	Then cauterize him above all the horns of his own head with a cauterization, so that it does not pass through the skin and open up on the bone as much as we have described.
Et cauteriza ipsum cauterio uno in occipitio capitis sui, in loco qui nominatur uas: et est locus in quo ponitur uentosa: et eleua matum tuam in hoc, et non discooperias os.	And cauterize him with the first kind of cauterization on the back of his own head, in the place which is called the "vase": and it is a location where the vertebrae are placed: and lift up your matron's hands in this way, and do not open up the bone.
Infirmus enim inuenit propter illud dolorem uehementem, et diuersum a dolore reliquorum cauteriorum capitis omnium.	For the sick person finds that because of that severe pain, it is different from the pain of all the other cauterizations of the head.
Et ego dicam hoc Cauterium in loco suo: et oportet quod sit cauterium, quo cauterizantur cornua capitis, et occiput eius subtilius cauterio, quo cauterizatur medium capitis.	And I will say this about the cauterization in its place: and it is necessary that it be a cauterization by which the horns of the head are cauterized, and the back of his head is slightly cauterized with a cauterization by which the middle of the head is cauterized.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in hemicrania, tam cum medicina adustiua, quam cum ferro.	About the manner of cauterizing in a headache, whether with burnt medicine or with iron.
Caput IIII.	Chapter IV.
Quando accidit in parte capitis dolor et soda, aut extenditur dolor usque ad oculum, et euacuatur cum medicinis mundificantibus caput, et administratur reliqua curatio, quam dixi in diuisionibus aegritudinum, et non confert illud totum: tunc cauterizatio in eo est secundum duos modos: aut cauterizatio cum medicina acuta comburente: aut cum ferro.	When pain and swelling occur on the head, or when the pain extends to the eye, and the head is cleansed with medicines and the rest of the treatment, which I said in the divisions of illnesses, is not effective; then cauterization should be done in this case by two methods: either with a burning medicine, or with iron.
Cauterium autem cum medicina acuta comburente, est, ut accipias dentem unum allii, et excortices ipsum, et abscindas extremitates eius ex duobus lateribus.	The cauterization with a burning medicine is this: you should take one tooth of garlic, remove the bark from it, and cut off the ends on both sides.
Deinde scinde locum doloris in tempore cum phlebotomo lato, donec fiat in eo locus sub cute, in quo dens capitur.	Then split the painful area with a wide lancet until a space is made beneath the skin where the tooth can be inserted.
Intromitte ergo eum in ipso sub cute, donec occultetur: deinde stringe super ipsum cum puluillo constrictione decenti, et dimitte ipsum quantitate quindecim horarum deinde solue eum, et extrahe allium, et dimitteuulnus duobus diebus, aut tribus: postea pone super ipsum cotum submersum in butyro, donec locus efficiat pus: deinde cura ipsum cum unguento usquequo sanetur.	Therefore insert it into the space beneath the skin until it is hidden; then tie over it with a thread of decent constriction, and leave it for fifteen hours; afterwards dissolve it and remove the garlic, and let it rest for two or three days: after that put on top of it a poultice soaked in butter until the wound produces pus; then treat it with an ointment until it heals.
Et si uis fac illud cum quibusdam medicinis comburentibus, quas ego scripsi in tractatu duodecimo, de Medieinis adurentibus.	And if you wish to do this with certain burning medicines that I wrote about in the twelfth book of my treatise on Igniting Medicines.
Cauterizatio uero eius cum ferro, est secundum hunc modum.	The cauterization with iron is according to this method.
Igni Cauterium, cuius forma haec est.	Fire Cautery, whose form is this.
Et nominatur Clauilis: quoniam forma capitis eius est sicut forma claui, in quo est quiddam curuitatis, et in medio eius est quaedam eminentia parua.	And it is called Clauilis: because the form of its head is like that of a hook, which has some curvature, and in the middle of it is a small prominence.
Deinde pone ipsum super locum, et retine manum tuam: et tu reuolue ferrum paulatim cum uelocitate: et sit quantitas quae aduritur ex spissitudine cutis, sicut medietas eius.	Then place it on the spot and hold your hand; and turn the iron slowly with some speed; and let the amount that is burned be equal to the thickness of the skin, like its middle.
Et eleua manum tuam, ut non aduratur arteria, quae est inferius, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	And lift up your hand so that the artery below may not be burnt and a flow of blood does not occur.
Deinde imbibe cotum in aqua salis, et pone super locum, et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus: deinde pone cotum cum butyro: postea cura cum unguento usquequo sanetur.	Then soak the poultice in salt water, and place it on the spot, and let it be for three days. Then place the poultice with butter. Afterward care for it with ointment until it is healed.
Et si uis, cauteriza hanc hemicraniam cum extremitate cultellari secunda Cauterii.	And if you wish, cauterize this cerebral hemorrhage with the second edge of a cauterizer.
Et caue ab incisione arteriae in hac hemicrania, non antiqua proprie.	And beware of cutting into an artery in this cerebral hemorrhage, nor make it one's own.
¶ De modo cauteriezandi in hemicrania antiqua.	On the manner of cauterizing in old-fashioned brain hematomas.
Caput V.	Head 5.
Quando curas hemicraniam, cum eo quod diximus ex curatione praecedente, et quod diximus in diuisionibus aegritudinum, et non confert curatio: et uides ex aegritudine, quod non sufficit ei quod diximus ex cauterio primo cum medicina, aut cum cauterio cum igne, tunc oportet ut ignias Cauterium cultellare, donec albificetur postquam signas super locum doloris cum linea, cuius longitudo sit medietas digiti, aut quasi illud: et depone manum tuam uice una, et stringe eam donec incidas arteriam, et peruenias usque ad os.	When you are treating a brain hematoma, as we have said in the preceding cure, and what we have said about the divisions of illnesses, and it does not help to treat: and you see from the illness that what we said from the first cauterization with medicine, or with burning cauterization, is not sufficient for him; then it is necessary that you ignite the Cauterium with a knife, until it becomes white after you have marked on the place of pain with a line, whose length is half a finger or nearly so: and put your hand in one way, and grasp it until you cut the artery, and reach up to the mouth.
Verumtamen necesse est tibi, ut caueas a continuatione mandibulae, quae mouetur apud masticationem, ne aduratur latus, aut neruus qui mouet ipsam, unde accidat spasmus.	However, it is necessary for you to beware of the jawbone's movement during mastication, lest the side or nerve that moves it be burned, and thus a spasms occur.
Et esto super custotiam, et cautelam de fluxu sanguinis arteriae, quae abscisa est.	And be on guard against bleeding from the artery that has been cut.
In abscisione enim eius est timor, et praecipue ei qui ignorat illud quod facit, et non est studiosus, nec expertus: et dimittit operationem cum eo in primis.	For the cutting of it is fearful, and especially for one who does not know what he is doing and is not studious or experienced: and he abandons the operation at first.
Et ego ueniam cum rememoratione regiminis fluxus sanguinis accidentis ex arteria secundum modum suum, et in loco suo huius libri.	And I come with a reminder of the regulation of the flow of blood that occurs from the artery according to its own manner, and in its place in this book.
Quod si uides ex aegritudine, quod non sufficit ei hoc Cauterium, et uides corpus infirmi tolerans cauterium in medio capitis, sicut narrauimus, cura uulnus, donec sanetur.	If you see that from illness, this cautery does not suffice for him, and you see the sick person bearing a cautery in the middle of their head, as we have narrated, treat the wound until it is healed.
Et si uis, administra Cauterium, quod diximus in capitulo extractionis arteriae cum Cauterio habente duos cultellos.	And if you wish, apply the cautery that we mentioned in the chapter on extracting an artery with a cautery having two knives.
Est enim cauterizatio melior hac et magis conferens.	For this cautery is better and more effective.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in dolore Aurium.	About the manner of cauterizing in earache.
Caput VI.	Chapter VI.
Quando accidit in Aure dolor a frigore, et curatur cum solutiuis, et reliqua curatione quam diximus in diuisione, et non remouetur dolor, tunc igni Cauterium: et est illud quod nominatur Punctum, cuius forma est haec.	When earache occurs due to cold and is treated with poultices and the remaining treatment which we mentioned in the division, and the pain does not cease, then use a cauterizing fire: and it is that which is called a Point, whose form is this.
Deinde puncta cum eo post eius ignitionem in circumitu auris totius, sicut reuoluitur: aut in circumitu utriusque, si simul dolor est in utrisque.	Then, the point with him after its ignition is applied around the entire ear, as it revolves; or around both sides if the pain is simultaneously present on both.
Et elonga te cum Cauterio a radice auris parumper, postquam signaueris loca cum encaustro: et sit cauterii quantitas decem punctorum in omni aure, et quasi illa.	And stretch yourself with the cauterizer from the root of the ear for a little while, after you have marked the places with encaustic; and let the quantity of the cautery be ten points on each ear, and so forth.
Deinde cura loca, donec sanentur.	Then, care for the places until they are healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Tortura.	About the manner of cauterizing in Torture.
Caput VII.	Chapter VII.
Tortura quae curatur cum cauterizatione, non est nisi ex speciebus, quae accidunt ex phlegmate, secundum quod diximus in diuisionibus aegritudinum.	The torture that is cured with cauterization is not excepted from the species that occur due to phlegm, according to what we mentioned in the divisions of illnesses.
Et deuita cauterizationem speciei, quae accidit ex exiccatione, et spasmo nerui.	And after the cauterization, treat the species that occurs due to drying up and nervous spasm.
Quando curas hanc speciem torturae cum hyeris, et caputpurgiis, et gargarismis, et non confert curatio tua, tunc oportet ut cauterizes infirmum tribus Cauteriis: uno apud radicem auris, et secundo parum inferius a timpore suo, et tertio apud coniunctionem duorum labiorum.	When you treat this species of torture with purges, and head-purgings, and gargles, and your treatment does not bring relief, then it is necessary to cauterize the patient three times: once at the root of the ear, and secondly a little below its natural position, and thirdly at the conjunction of the two lips.
Et pone Cauterium tuum ex contrario partis infirmae.	And place your cauterizer opposite the weaker part.
Quoniam mollificatio non accidit, nisi in parte quae apparet sana.	Because softening does not occur unless it is in the part that appears healthy.
Et forma cauterizationis est, ut cauterizes ipsum Cauterio in directo extremitatis auris superioris sub cornu capitis parum: et alio in timpore: cuius longitudo sit secundum longitudinem pollicis.	And the form of cauterization is, that you cauterize it with your cauterizer directly on the upper end of the ear, near the horn of the head a little; and again at another time: whose length shall be according to the length of the thumb.
Et depone manum tuam cum cauterio, donec comburatur quantitas medietatis spissitudinis cutis.	And put your hand with the cauterizer until the quantity of the middle thickness of skin is burned.
Et haec est forma Cauterii, et est species ex cultellari, cuius forma praemissa est: uerumtamen non est subtilior ea parum, sicut uides: et oportet ut sit cultellus in eo superfluae grossitudinis parum.	And this is the form of cauterizer, and it is a type from a knife, whose shape is given before: yet not so fine as you see: and it is necessary that the knife be in a little excess of thickness.
Deinde cura loca, cum eo quod praecessit: donec sanetur.	Then take care of the place with what preceded it, until it heals.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Apoplexia antiqua.	Of the manner of cauterizing in ancient apoplexy.
Caput VIII.	Chapter VIII.
QUando antiquatur Apoplexia, et curas eam cum eo quod diximus, et non confert medicatio tua, et infirmus non habet febrem, tunc cauteriza eum quatuor cauteriis super omne cornu capitis sui, et cauterio in medio capitis, sicut diximus, et cauterio in occipitio capitis, secundum quod praecessit: et modus cauterii sit secundum quod praecessit.	When ancient apoplexy becomes old and you have treated it with what we said, and your treatment does not help, and the patient has no fever, then cauterize him with four cauterizers on all of his horn of the head, and a cauterizer in the middle of his head, as we said, and a cauterizer on the back of his head, according to what came before: and the manner of the cauterization is according to what came before.
Etiam cauterizatur cum Cauterio super os stomachi: et est magis ultimum.	And also cauterize with a cauterizer on the mouth of the stomach: and it is the final one.
Deinde curetur, cum eo quod praecessit.	Then take care of it, with what came before.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Obliuione.	Of the manner of cauterizing in forgetfulness.
Caput IX.	Chapter IX.
Oportet ut in potu dentur in primis infirmo hyerae magnae, et pillulae mundificantes cerebrum.	It is necessary that in the drink, for the first patient, there be given great hyoscyamus and cleansing pills for the brain.
Deinde rade caput infirmi totum, et pone super occipitium eius emplastrum de synapi descriptum in tractatu emplastrorum: et pone ipsum aliquotiens.	Then quickly shave the whole head of the patient and place on the back of his head an ointment of honey described in the treatise on ointments, and put it on him several times.
Ipsum namque est modus Cauterii: et fac illud secundum ordinem eundem, quem dixi illic.	This is the way of cauterization. And make it in the same order as I said before that.
Si ergo sanatur per illud, bonum est.	So if it is healed through this, it's good.
Si non: tunc fac ei cauteria tria in posteriori parte capitis sui, quae sint descendentia a superiori parte capitis usque ad inferiorem partem oculi: et pone inter omne cauterium grossitudinem digiti.	If not, then make three cauterizations on the back of his own head, which are descended from the upper part of the head to the lower part of the eye; and place between every cauterization the thickness of a finger.
Deinde cura Cauterium, cum eo quod praecessit.	Then take care of the cauterization, along with what preceded it.
Si autem uis additionem, et infirmus est tolerans illud: tunc fac ei Cauterium in medio.	If however you wish to add and he is weak and endures that: then make a cauterization in the middle.
Quod si uis additionem: tunc cauteriza ipsum super duo cornua.	What if you wish to add: then cauterize him above both horns.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur: sitque Cauterium oliuare secundum formam, quae praemissa est.	Then take care of him until he is healed: and let the cauterization be anointed with oil according to the form that was mentioned beforehand.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Paralisi, et mollificatione.	Concerning the method of cauterizing in paralysis, and relaxation.
Caput X.	Chapter X.
Oportet ut procedas in mundificatione capitis cum hyeeris, et cum eo quod diximus.	You should proceed to the clarification of the head with hot irons and with what we said.
Deinde rade caput infirmi: postea cauteriza ipsum cauterio in medio capitis, et cauterio super omne cornu capitis, et cauterio super posterius ipsius, et tribus super spondiles colli.	Then shave the head of the sick person: afterwards cauterize him with a cauterization on the middle of the head, and a cauterization above every horn of the head, and a cauterization above the back of his own head, and three above the vertebrae of the neck.
Si autem indiges in aegritudine mollificatione corporis pluribus illis, et infirmus est tolerans, et aegritudo est fortis: tunc cauteriza ipsum quatuor cauteriis super spondiles dorsi, et ultima cum cauterio, donec comburatur ex cute plurimum eius, et eleua manum tuam.	But if you need to relax the body more in his illness, and he is weak and endures it, and the sickness is strong: then cauterize him with four cauterizations above the vertebrae of the back, and the last one with a cauterization, until most of it is burned from the skin, and raise your hand.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur: et sic cauterium Oliuare.	Then take care of him until he is healed: and thus anoint the cauterization with oil.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Epilepsia.	Concerning the method of cauterizing in epilepsy.
Caput XI.	Chapter XI.
Non Cauterizatur epilepticus, nisi ille cuius epilepsia est ex phlegmate.	The epileptic is not cauterized, unless he whose epilepsy is from phlegm.
Oportet ergo ut mundifices cerebrum eius in primis cum hyeris, et cum reliqua curatione quam diximus in diuisione: quando infirmus est magnus, aut est tolerans in accaeptione medicinarum.	It is necessary therefore that you cleanse his brain first with myrrh, and along with the other treatment which we mentioned in the division; when the patient is very sick or is able to tolerate medical remedies.
Si autem est puer, qui non tolerat medicinas, tunc administratur gargarisma, et masticationes mundificantes cerebrum, ante illud diebus multis cum bonificatione ciborum.	But if it is a child who does not tolerate medicines, then a gargle and cleansing mastications of the brain are administered beforehand, many days in advance with good nourishment.
Deinde rade caput eius, postea cauteriza ipsum Cauterio uno in medio capitis, secundum quod praecessit in modo: et cauterio alio in occipitio eius, et super omne cornu capitis sui cauterio.	Then shave his head, and afterwards cauterize it with the first cautery in the middle of the head, according to what has been done before; and with another cautery on the back of his head, and over all the horn of his own head.
Quod si infirmus fuerit fortis, et fuerit tolerans, tunc cauteriza ipsum cauteriis, quae dixi in habente paralisim, et mollificationem corporis super spondiles colli, et spondiles dorsi: et sit Cauterium oliuare secundum modum qui praecessit.	If the patient is strong and can tolerate it, then cauterize him with the cauteries that I mentioned in the one having paralysis, and softening of the body over the vertebrae of the neck and back: and let the Cauterium be olive oil according to the manner that preceded.
Si autem infirmus est puer, tunc pone cauterium subtile, secundum hunc modum.	But if the patient is a child, then place a subtle cautery in this way.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Melancholia.	Of the manner of cauterizing in Melancholy.
Caput XII.	Chapter XII.
Quando caussa melancholiae sunt humiditates corruptae, et phlegma grossum, tunc cauteriza ipsum Cauteriis, quae diximus in habente paralisim.	When the cause of melancholy are corrupted humors and thick phlegm, then cauterize him with the cauteries that we mentioned in the one having paralysis.
Et si caussa melancholiae est superfluitas decliuis ad melancholiam, et est corpus infirmi humectum, tunc da ei in potu quod mundificet cerebrum eius, secundum quod praecessit in diuisione: deinde rade caput infirmi, et fac postea tortellam decenter factam ex lino, sicut circulum.	And if the cause of melancholy is an excess that tends towards melancholy, and his body is weakly moistened, then give him to drink what will cleanse his brain, according to what has been done before in the division: afterwards shave the head of the infirm one, and make a tortellum afterwards, well made from linen, like a circle.
Deinde pone ipsam in medio capitis: et infirmus sedens quadratus teneatur ab omni parte.	Then place it in the middle of his head: and the infirm one sitting square should be held back by all parts.
Deinde praesenta linimentum.	Then apply the ointment.
Et est dignius ex butyro ouium antiquo.	And it is more worthy from old sheep's tallow butter.
Et calefac ipsum super ignem calefactione temperata mensura, quam toleret digitus, quando intromittitur in ipsum.	And warm it over a fire with tempered heat measurement, which the finger can tolerate when inserted into it.
Deinde euacua ipsum in medio capitis eius in circulo, et dimitte ipsum donec infrigidetur.	Then remove it from the middle of his head in a circle and leave it until it cools down.
Fac illud infirmo omni hebdomada semel, cum reliquo regimine eius bono, donec sanetur.	Make that for every invalid once a week, along with the rest of his good regimen, until he is healed.
Aut si uis, cauteriza ipsum faciendo puncta parua plurimum eius, praeter quod teneas manum cum cauterio: imo sit odorando.	Or if you wish, cauterize it by making small holes in many places, except for that which you hold with the caustic instrument; and let there be a smell.
Haec enim species cauterii humectat cerebrum cum qualitate.	For this kind of caustic dries out the brain along with its quality.
Deinde pone super ipsum cotum imbibitum in butyro, aut adipe gallinae.	Then place over it a poultice soaked in butter or chicken fat.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in aqua descendente ad oculum.	On the method of cauterizing in descending water to the eye.
Caput XIII.	Chapter XIII.
Quando declaratur tibi principium aquae in oculo per signa, quae dixi in diuisione, tunc incipe et pota infirmum, cum eo quod mundificet caput eius.	When you are shown the principle of water in the eye by signs which I mentioned in the division, then begin and administer to the invalid with what will cleanse his head.
Et custodi ipsum ab omnibus humiditatibus, et fac eum sedere in balneo, in ieiunio diebus aliquot.	And guard him from all moistures, and make him sit in a bath on fasting days for several days.
Deinde praecipe ei, ut radat caput suum, et cauteriza ipsum in medio capitis sui.	Then command him to shave his head and cauterize it in the middle of his head.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum super duo timpora duobus cauteriis, si est incaeptio descensus aquae in duobus oculis simul: aut ex latere uno, si est incaeptio aquae in oculo uno: et abscinde cum cauterio omnes uenas et arterias quae sunt sub cute: et sint cauteria in ea longa in latitudine timporum: et caue a fluxu sanguinis.	Then cauterize it over the two temples with two caustics, if there is an onset of water flowing down into both eyes at once: or from one side alone, if there is an onset of water flowing into one eye; and cut off with the caustic all the veins and arteries that are under the skin: and let the caustics be long on each temple, and beware of bleeding.
Quod si uides aliquid ex eo, tunc abscinde eum statim cum quacumque medicina est possibile: et ego ueniam cum sapientia, quae est in extractione arteriarum, et abscisione earum, et cautela a fluxu sanguinis.	And if you see anything else from him, then cut off immediately with whatever medicine is possible; and I come with wisdom, which is in the extraction of arteries, and cutting off of them, and caution against bleeding.
Et quandoque cauterizatur in ceruice, sub duobus ossibus, duobus cauteriis ultime productis.	And sometimes it is cauterized on the neck, under two bones, with two last-produced caustics.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Lachrymis antiquis.	On the manner of cauterizing in ancient tears.
Caput XIIII.	Chapter 14.
Quando lachrymae oculorum sunt antiquae, assiduae: et sunt super uenas, et arterias quae sunt in manifesto capitis exterius, uerificatur quod illud est ex superfluitatibus frigidis, phlegmaticis: tunc cauteriza cauterio eodem quod narraui in incaeptione aquae descendentis, cauterio in medio capitis, et duobus cauteriis super duo timpora, et duobus cauteriis in ceruice sub duobus ossibus.	When the tears of the eyes are old and persistent, and they flow over the veins and arteries that are manifest on the outer surface of the head, it is verified that this is due to excesses of cold and phlegmatic humors: then cauterize with a caustic in the same manner as I described for the incision of water flowing down, one caustic in the middle of the head, and two caustics on both temples, and two caustics on the neck beneath two bones.
Et si indiges additione, tunc cauteriza ipsum in omni latere caute oculi, super extremitatem supercilii cum cauterio paruo.	And if you desire an addition, then cauterize it on all sides of the eye cautiously, above the outer edge of the eyebrow with a small caustic.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in foetore Nasi.	On the manner of cauterizing in foul-smelling snot.
Caput XV.	Chapter 15.
Quando tu medicaris illud, cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert medicatio: tunc propera, et da in potu infirmocochias tribus noctibus: deinde rade caput eius, et cauteriza ipsum cauterio medio, cum cauterio oliuari.	When you are treating it with the remedy that we mentioned in the division, and the treatment does not take effect: then hurry and give him three infusions of warm poultices at night. Then slowly wet his head, and cauterize it with a mid-caustic and an olive oil caustic.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum cum cauterio clauili duobus cauteriis, super duo supercilia sub capillis parum.	Then cauterize it with a caustic of cloves, two caustics, above the two eyebrows beneath the slightly raised hair.
Et custodite ab arteria, ne incidas eam.	And take care not to cut the artery.
Et haec est forma cauterii Clauilis.	And this is the form of the caustic of cloves.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in mollificatione Palpebrae.	On the manner of cauterizing in softening the eyelid.
Caput XVI.	Chapter 16.
Quando mollificatur Palpebra oculi ab aegritudine, aut humiditate: tunc cauteriza Palpebram cauterio uno, cum hoc cauterio lunari.	When the eyelid of the eye becomes soft from disease or moisture: then cauterize the eyelid with one caustic, together with this lunar caustic.
Et si uis, cauteriza ipsum supra duo supercilia parum duobus cauteriis in omni parte: et elongentur a duobus timporibus: et sit longitudo omnis cauterii, secundum longitudines supercilii: et non ultimes manum tuam cum cauterio, imo secundum quantitatem quod aduritur tertia palpebrae.	And if you wish, cauterize it above the two eyebrows a little with two caustics on all sides: and they should be distant from both temples: and let the length of all the caustic be according to the lengths of the eyebrow: and do not extend your hand with the caustic beyond what is consumed by the third eyelid.
Et haec est forma cauterii secundum hunc modum cauterii lunaris.	And this is the form of a cauterizing instrument according to this lunar cauterizing method.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Palpebram cum pili inuersantur pungentes oculum.	On how to cauterize the eyelid with hairs that are turned upside down and piercing the eye.
Caput XVII.	Chapter 17.
Cauterium in eo est secundum duos modos: aut cauterium cum igne: aut cauterium cum medicina comburente.	The cauterizer is in two modes: either a burning cauterizer or one with a medicine that consumes.
In cauterio autem cum igne, praecipe infirmo ante illud, ut dimittat pilos suos, si est ex illis qui mundant eos, donec prolongentur et aequentur.	In the cauterizer with fire, first instruct the patient to remove their hairs, if they are one of those who pluck them out, until they are lengthened and straightened.
Si autem pungunt eum apud ortum suum: tunc constringe oculos eius cum uitta, ut non moueantur, donec nascantur.	But if they pierce him at the beginning of his growth: then compress his eyes with a bandage, so that they do not move, until they are formed.
Cum ergo nascuntur et aequantur, tunc pone caput infirmi in sinu tuo: deinde signa super Palpebram oculorum eius cum encaustro, signo quod sit secundum figuram folii myrti: et sit principium signi prope pilos.	When they are formed and straightened, then place the patient's head on your shoulder: next mark above his eyelid with a cauterizing instrument, marking it so that it is according to the shape of a myrtle leaf: and let the beginning of the mark be near the hairs.
Deinde pone cotum imbibitum in albumine oui: aut in mucilagine psilii super oculum.	Then place the soaked cloth in egg white: or in psyllium mucus over the eye.
Deinde igni cauterium, cuius forma est haec.	Then apply a burning cauterizer of this form.
Deinde cauteriza super figuram, quam signasti paulatim in uicibus multis, donec comburatur superficies cutis, quae est sicut figura folii myrti, totam apparentem proprie.	Then cauterize over the figure you marked little by little in many places, until the surface of the skin, which is like the shape of a myrtle leaf, appears entirely burned.
Et signum sanitatis operis tui est: ut si uideas Palpebram oculi iam contrahi, et pilos eleuari apud puncturam oculi.	And the sign of the success of your work is: if you see the eyelid contract now and the hairs raised at the puncture in the eye.
Eleua ergo manum tuam tunc: et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus.	So lift up then your hand, and let him go for three days.
Deinde pone super ipsum Cotum cum butyro, donec eradicetur eschara.	Then place over him a cloth with butter, until the scab is removed.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then care for him with an ointment, until he is healed.
Quod si redeat aliquod ex pilis post horam, et mollificetur palpebra: tunc itera Cauterium super illum locum, sicut fecisti in primis.	But if some of the hairs return after an hour and the eyelid becomes soft: then repeat the cauterization over that place, just as you did at first.
Si autem pili sunt in inferiori: tunc cauteriza ipsam, donec eleuetur ad locum suum naturalem: et aequetur ut non pungant pili oculum.	If however hairs are on the lower part: then cauterize it, until it is elevated to its natural place: and it will be even so that the hairs do not prick the eye.
¶ De modo cauterizandi cum medicina comburente in eodem casu.	On the manner of cauterizing with burning medicine in the same case.
Caput XVIII.	Chapter 18.
Est ut praecipias infirmo, ut dimittat pilos, donec prolongentur et aequentur.	It is necessary to press hard on the patient, so that they may dismiss their hair, until it is lengthened and evened out.
Fac ex charta de panno formam folii myrti.	Make a shape of a myrtle leaf from cloth or fabric.
Deinde accipe ex sapone cognito, et ex calce non imbibita ex unoquoque pondus uncia I aut quasi illud: deinde tere ea simul contritione bona, et fac illud cum festinatione, ut non infrigidetur.	Then take known soap and unimbued plaster, one pound or almost that much from each, then grind them together with good rubbing, and do it quickly so that it does not become cold.
Deinde ex pande ex eo super chartam quam fecisti sicut formam folii myrti, et pone ipsum super palpebram oculi unius, aut duorum.	Then spread it over the fabric you made in the shape of a myrtle leaf, and place it on one or two eyelids.
Et pone sub oculo cotum imbibitum in albumine oui: et caput infirmi sit in sinu tuo.	And place the poultice soaked in chicken broth under the eye, and hold the patient's head on your lap.
Et pone digitum tuum indicem super medicinam, et preme ipsum parumper.	And put your index finger on the medicine, and press it gently.
Et tu moueas ipsum quotiens sentit infirmus mordicationem medicinae: quoniam inuenit eius mordicatio sicut ignis.	And you move it as often as the patient feels the sting of the medicine, for the stinging is like fire.
Dum ergo perseuerat hoc quod ipse inuenit mordicatio, tunc dimitte medicinam, et moue ipsam cum digito tuo.	While therefore the patient continues to feel this stinging, then let go of the medicine, and move it with your finger.
Cum ergo quiescit mordicatio, tunc remoue medicinam, et ablue oculum cum aqua.	When therefore the stinging ceases, then remove the medicine, and wash the eye with water.
Et considera tunc, si uides palpebram eleuari, sicut eleuatur apud contractionem cum igne, aut cum incisione, est bene: et si non, tunc itera super ipsam ex medicina super locum, in quo non imprimit medicina, et non denigrat, donec aequetur operatio tua, et contrahatur oculus.	And then consider whether you see the eyelid raised, like it is raised with contraction caused by fire or incision, and if so, that's good: and if not, then apply medicine again on top of it to the same spot where the medicine did not penetrate, and do not stop until your operation is complete and the eye is contracted.
Deinde pone super ipsum Cotum cum butyro, donec eradicetur cutis adustionis.	Then place a poultice with butter on top of it, until the burned skin is eradicated.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento diaphinicon, aut alio, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with a balm of diaphanous quality, or another one, until it is healed.
Et necesse est tibi apud operationem, ut custodias ultima custodia, ne in oculum cadat aliquid ex medicina.	And it is necessary for you to be vigilant during the operation, that you guard the last vigilance, lest anything from the medicine fall into the eye.
Quod si mollificatur palpebra post dies, et pugnat ex capillis aliquid in oculo, tunc itera medicinam super illum locum, qui mollificatur ex palpebra proprie, sicut fecisti in primis.	But if the eyelid becomes soft after a few days and something from the hair is struggling in the eye, then apply medicine to that spot which becomes soft from the eyelid itself, just as you did at first.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then treat it until it is healed.
Et haec est forma folii myrti.	And this is the shape of a mulberry leaf.
Et scias, quod oculi hominum diuersificantur in magnitudine, et paruitate.	And know that the eyes of humans differ in size and smallness.
Ergo secundum illud sit consideratio tua: et non occultatur uia rectitudinis illi, cui est studium de hac arte.	Therefore, according to this, your consideration should be thus: and the way of rectitude is not hidden from him who has a zeal for this art.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Fistula lachrymali.	On the manner of cauterizing in the fistulous tear duct.
Caput XIX.	Chapter 19.
Quando curas Fistulam, cum eo quod diximus in diuisionibus aegritudinum, et non confert curatio tua: tunc, oportet ut cauterizes ipsam secundum hunc modum.	When you are treating a fistula, as we have said in the divisions of afflictions, and your cure does not bring relief: then it is necessary that you cauterize it according to this method.
Praecipe infirmo, ut ponat caput suum in sinu tuo, et teneat caput eius minister inter manus suas taliter, ut non moueatur, neque agitetur cum capite suo.	Order the patient to place his head on your shoulder, and to hold his head in a minister's hands between your own hands in such a way that it is not moved or shaken with his head.
Deinde pone Cotum infusum in albugine oui, aut in mucilagine psilii super oculum eius: deinde igni Cauterium, cuius forma est haec.	Then place the infused balm on the white of the eye, or on the mucus of psyllium over his eye: then apply the cautery iron, which has this form.
Sit concauum, sicut forma cannae pennae uulturis ab extremitate una, cum qua fit Cauterium: et si uis sit penetrans usque ad extremitatem aliam, et si uis sit sursum sic tenta.	Let it be concave, like the shape of a crane's feather at one end, with which the cautery is made: and if you wish it to penetrate up to the other extremity, and if you wish it to go upwards, then pull it.
Verumtamen hoc concauum est melius ad opus tuum.	However, this concavity is better for your work.
Deinde exprime fistulam, si est aperta, et extrahe ex ea saniem, et exicca ipsam: et si non est aperta, tunc aperi eam, et extrahe pus eius.	Then express the fistula, if it is open, and extract the discharge from it, and dry it out: and if it is not open, then open it, and extract its pus.
Deinde pone tunc super eam Cauterium, quod fit ignitum ualde.	Then place a cauterizer on it that is very hot.
Et tene cum eo manum tuam parumper apud Cauterium ab oculo, ad partem nasi, ut non erret manus tua, aut inquietetur infirmus: et ponas Cauterium in adipe oculi, et corrumpas ipsum.	And hold your hand with him near the cauterizer at the eye, by the nose, so that your hand does not wander or disturb the patient; and place the cauterizer on the fatty part of the eye, and destroy it.
Si ergo peruenis in principio Cauterii tui usque ad os, erit bene.	If you then reach to the beginning of your cauterizer right up to the mouth, it will be good.
Et si non: tunc itera Cauterium semel, aut bis, si indiges illo: et dimitte illud tribus diebus.	And if not, then reiterate your cauterizer once or twice as needed; and leave it for three days.
Deinde pone Cotum cum butyro, et cura ipsum cum unguento exiccatiuo, donec sanetur.	Then place a poultice with butter, and care for it with an astringent ointment, until it heals.
Quod si praeterierint ei quadraginta dies, et non sanatur: tunc pone super ipsum medicinam acutam corrosiuam, donec detegatur os: et rade ipsum secundum quod uenit in capitulo suo.	But if forty days have passed and it has not healed: then place a sharp, corrosive medicine on top of it, until the mouth is exposed; and scrape it according to what comes in its chapter.
Et est modus alius Cauterii fistulae, quem quidam primi dixerunt.	And there is another method of cauterizing a fistula that some have said first.
Intende ad locum fistulae, et finde ipsum: deinde pone in ipsam fissuram camahan subtile, id est, Cannulam subtilem, cuius forma haec est.	Direct your attention to the location of the fistula, and find it; then place into the same opening a thin cannula, that is, a thin tube, whose form is this.
Et funde in ipsum quantitatem drachmae ex plumbo liquefacto, et tene manum tuam cum Canna retentione bona, et non moueatur infirmus omnino, ut non currat, uel perueniat plumbum liquefactum ad oculum eius.	And pour into it a quantity of a drachma from molten lead, and hold your hand with the cannula in good retention, and let the patient not move at all, lest he run or get the molten lead in his eye.
Et oportet ut ponas super oculum infirmi cotum infusum in albumine oui, aut in aqua.	And it is necessary to place a poultice infused with egg white or water over the eye of the patient.
Plumbum enim comburit locum fistulae, et sanat ipsam sanatione mirabili.	For lead burns the location of the fistula and heals it with a wonderful healing.
Quod si sanatur fistula, cum eo quod diximus ex Cauterio, et curatione, est bonum.	But if the fistula is healed by what we said from the cauterizer, and by the cure, it is good.
Et si non, tunc necesse est administrare foramen nasi, et reducere fistulam ad cursum nasi, secundum quod ueniet in loco suo sibi proprio.	And if not, then it is necessary to open the nostril and redirect the fistula to its natural course, according to what will come into its own place.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in fissuris Labiorum.	Here is the translation:
Caput XX.	Here is the translation:
Multotiens accidunt in Labio fissurae, quae nominantur Pili, et praecipue in labiis puerorum.	Many times wounds occur on the lip that are called "Pili," and particularly in the lips of boys.
Cum ergo tu curas has fissuras, cum eo quod diximus in diuisione aegritudinum, et non confert curatio, tunc igni cauterium paruum cultellare, secundum hanc formam.	When you are treating these wounds, as we said in the division of illnesses, and the treatment does not help, then take a small pair of scissors, like this.
Et sit concauitas eius secundum subtilitatem cultelli.	And let its concavity be according to the subtlety of the scalpel.
Deinde pone ipsum ignitum festinanter in ipsis fissuris, donec perueniat cauterium ad profundum fissurarum.	Then place the heated instrument quickly into the very fissures themselves, until the cauterizing instrument reaches to the depth of the fissures.
Deinde cura ipsum cum caeroto, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with cerate, until it is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in fistula Oris.	On the manner of cauterizing in the mouth's fistula.
Caput XXI.	Chapter XXI.
Quando accidit apostema in radice gingiuae, aut in palato, aut in radicibus dentium: deinde facit pus, et rumpitur: postea antiquatur, et currit pus, et fit fistula: deinde curas ipsam, et non confert in ea curatio, tunc oportet ut ignias cauterium secundum quantitatem, quod capiat in fistula.	When an abscess occurs at the root of the gum, or on the palate, or at the roots of the teeth: then pus forms and bursts forth; afterwards it becomes old and runs, and a fistula is formed: after that, care for it, and if the treatment does not help in it, then you must use fire to cauterize according to the size that fits into the fistula.
Deinde intromitte ipsum ignitum in foramine fistulae, et tene manum tuam, donec perueniat ferrum ignitum ad profundum eius, et ultimum eius: fac illud semel, aut duabus uicibus.	Then insert the heated instrument into the opening of the fistula, and hold your hand steady, until the hot iron reaches to its depth and its last part: do that once or twice.
Deinde cura ipsum post illud, cum eo quod diximus de curatione usquequo curetur.	Then care for it afterwards, with what we said about treatment until it is healed.
Si ergo abscinditur sanies, et sanatur, erit bonum.	If the pus is then drained and heals, it will be good.
Et si non, tunc necesse est detegere locum, et auferre os corrupum secundum quod ueniet in capite suo.	And if not, then it is necessary to uncover the place and remove the corrupted bone according to what comes into its head.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Gingiuis, et Dentibus mollificatis.	On the manner of cauterizing in Gums and Softened Teeth.
Caput XXII.	Chapter XXII.
Quando mollificatur gingiua propter humiditates, et mouentur dentes, et curas eam cum medicinis, et non confert: tunc pone caput infirmi in sinu tuo.	When the gum becomes soft due to moisture and the teeth move, and you care for it with medicines, but it does not help: then place the head of the invalid on your shoulder.
Deinde igni cauterium, cuius forma ueniet post haec, ita ut ponas Cannulam super dentem: et intromitte in ea Cauterium ignitum festinanter: et tene manum tuam parumper, donec sentiat infirmus calorem ignis iam peruenisse ad radicem dentis.	Then apply the burning cauter to which this form will come after these things, so that you place a cannula over the tooth; and insert into it the ignited cauter quickly: and hold your hand for a little while, until the patient feels the heat of the fire has already reached the root of the tooth.
Et eleua manum tuam: deinde itera Cauterium aliquotiens, secundum quod uis.	And lift up your hand: then repeat the cauterization a few times, as you wish.
Deinde impleat infirmus os suum aqua salis, et teneat ipsam hora una: et exspuat ipsam.	Then let the patient fill his mouth with water of salt, and keep it that way for one hour: and spit it out.
Dens enim motus firmatur, et gingiua mollificata stringitur, et siccatur humiditas corrupta.	For the tooth is strengthened by movement, and the softened gum tightens up and dries out the corrupted moisture.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in dolore Dentium.	Of the manner of cauterizing teeth in pain.
Caput XXIII.	Chapter 23.
Quando dolor dentis est propter frigiditatem, aut in ipso est frigus, aut uermis, et non confert curatio cum medicinis: tunc Cauterium in ipso est secundum duos modos: aut Cauterium cum butyro: aut cauterium cum igne.	When the pain of a tooth is due to coldness, either the tooth itself is cold or worm-like, and treatment does not agree with medicines; then the burning in it is according to two ways: either with butter or with fire.
Cauterium autem eius cum butyro est, ut accipias butyrum uaccinum, et bullias ipsum in cochleari ferreo, aut in uenera.	The burning of that kind with butter is, to take a waxy butter and boil it in an iron pot or in a bronze one.
Deinde accipe cotum, et inuolue ipsum super extremitatem tentae.	Then take a cloth and wrap it around the end of the tent.
Deinde submerge ipsum in butyro bullito: et pone ipsum super dentem dolorosum festinanter, et tene ipsum donec infrigidet: deinde itera ipsum aliquotiens, donec perueniat uirtus ignis ad radicem dentis.	Then plunge the cloth into the boiled butter and place it quickly over the aching tooth; and hold it until it cools down: then repeat it several times until the power of fire reaches the root of the tooth.
Et si uis, submerge lanam, aut cotum in butyro frigido, et pone ipsum super dentem dolentem: et pone super ipsum ferrum ignitum, donec perueniat ignis ad profundum concauitatis dentis.	And if you wish, plunge a cloth or a rag into cold butter and place it over the painful tooth; and place over it a burning iron until the fire reaches the deep hollow of the tooth.
Cauterizatio autem eius cum igne est, ut intendas ad cannulam aeris, aut cannulam ferri.	The burning of that kind with fire is, to take an air tube or a metal tube.
Et sit in corpore eius quiddam grossitudinis, ut non perueniat acuitas ignis ad os infirmi.	And let there be something thickened in the body of it, so that the sharpness of the fire does not reach the mouth of the sick person.
Deinde igni Cauterium, cuius forma ueniet: et pone ipsum super illum dentem: et tene manum tuam, donec infrigidetur Cauterium.	Then take a cauterizing instrument, whose shape will appear; and place it on that tooth; and hold your hand until the cauterizing instrument cools down.
Fac illud aliquotiens, nam dolor remouebitur, aut in illo eodem die, aut die alio.	Do this several times, for the pain is removed, or on the same day, or another day.
Et oportet in impressione illius Cauterii, ut impleat infirmus os suum buyro bono, et teneat ipsum hora una: deinde exspuat ipsum.	And it is necessary when the cauterizing instrument makes an impression, that the patient fills his mouth with good butter and holds it for one hour; then he should spit it out.
Et haec est forma Cauterii.	And this is the shape of the cauterizing instrument.
Cauteriza cum quacumque extremitate uis secundum quod est possibile: et haec est forma Cannulae.	Cauterize with whatever extremity you wish, according to what is possible; and this is the shape of the cannula.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Strophulis.	Of the manner of cauterizing on the strophules.
Caput XXIIII.	Chapter 28.
Quando Strophulae sunt a phlegmate, et ab humiditatibus frigidis, et non sunt obedientes digestioni per mecicinas, et uis digestionem earum uelociter: tunc igni Cauterium concauum, cuius forma est haec.	When the strophules are from phlegm and from cold moisture, and they do not obey digestion through medicines, and you wish to hasten their digestion: then take a concave cauterizing instrument, whose shape is this.
Habens duas extremitates apertas, ut egrediatur fumus apud Cauterium ab extremitate altera: et pone ipsum ignitum super ipsum apostema semel, et secundo, si indiges illo, donec perueniat ad profundum apostematis.	Having two open extremities, so that smoke may exit at the cauterizing instrument from one of its extremities: and place it ignited on the aposteme once, and again if needed, until it reaches to the depth of the apostema.
Quod si apostema est paruum: tunc pone Cauterium secundum quantitatem apostematis.	What if the apostema is small: then place the cauterizing instrument according to the size of the apostema.
Deinde dimitte ipsum tribus diebus, et pone super ipsum cotum infusum in butyro, donec remoueatur quod combussit ignis.	Then let it be for three days, and place a compress soaked in butter on top of it, until what the fire burned is removed.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento dentis, donec sanetur forma cannulae.	Then care for it with tooth ointment, until the shape of the cannula heals.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in raucedine uocis, et constrictione anhelitus.	Of the manner of cauterizing in the roughness of the voice and constriction of breathing.
Caput XXV.	Chapter 25.
Quando uincunt humiditates super cannale pulmonis, et praecipue quando illud est cum frigiditate complexionis, tunc oportet ut euacuetur infirmus in primis cum medicinis solutiuis.	When the humors overflow above the pulmonary canal, and especially when that is accompanied by coldness of complexion, then it is necessary for the patient to be purged first with soluble medicines.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum in nocrati apud radicem gutturis in loce depresso: et caue, ne peruenias cum Cauterio ad guttur, neque in cute, nisi quiddam eius.	Then cauterize it at the back of the neck near the root of the throat in a depressed location; and be careful not to reach with the cautery either to the throat or the skin, except for some small part of it.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum cauterio alio apud iuncturam colli in ultimo spondili eius ultimando: et sit Cauterium clauile secundum modum, qui praecessit.	Then cauterize it with another cautery at the junction of the neck in the last vertebra, and let the cautery be as deep as the one that preceded it.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod praecessit, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with what came before until it is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in aegritudinibus Pulmonis, et Tussi.	On the method of cauterizing for lung diseases and coughs.
Caput XXVI.	Chapter XXVI.
Quando Tussis et aegritudo Pulmonis sunt ab humiditatibus frigidis, et infirmus non habet febrem, neque phthisim, et aegritudo antiqua: tunc cauteriza ipsum duobus cauteriis supra furculam in locis depressis, lenibus, uacuis.	When cough and lung disease are caused by cold moistures, and the patient has no fever, nor phthisis, nor old complaint: then cauterize it with two cauterizers above the furrow in depressed, soft, empty places.
Et cauterio alio in medio pectoris inter duas mammillas: et sit cauterium cannulae secundum formam quae praecessit.	And with another cautery in the middle of the chest between two breasts: and let the cautery be like a cannula according to the shape that came before.
Et si uis sit cauterizatio tua punctando cum cauterio, quod nominatur Punctum, cuius forma praecessit in punctatione doloris aurium: et sint puncta ex triginta punctis usque quasi ad alia.	And if you wish, let your cautization be with a point-like cautery called the Point, whose form came before in piercing the pain of the ears; and let there be points from thirty points almost to others.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod praecessit, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with what came before until it is healed.
Et iam sit cauterium habens tres ramos: secundum hanc formam.	And now let the cautery have three branches: according to this shape.
Quare alleuiatur cum eo cauterizatio, quando tu facis cum eo uice una tria Cauteria.	Why is relief obtained with that cautery when you do it with it once using three cauterizers.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Titillico, in dislocatione Humeri.	On the method of cauterizing for Titillatio, in a dislocation of the Shoulder.
Caput XXVII.	Chapter XXVII.
Quando dislocatur caput adiutorii caussa humiditatum, et nonfigitur in hora reditus sui a dislocatione sua, donec sit illud ei consuetudo reditionis, deinde dislocatur a paruo motu, qui accidit sicut nos iam testificauimus illud, tunc oportet ut reducas dislocationem in primis.	When the head of the assistant is dislocated because of moistures and does not return to its place until it has become accustomed to returning to itself from its dislocation, then until it becomes a habit for it to return, and afterwards it is dislocated by a small movement which occurs as we have already testified, then you must reduce the dislocation first.
Deinde resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum, aut super latus sanum.	Then let the patient be placed on his back, or on a healthy side.
Deinde eleua cutim, quae est in interiori Titillici ad superiora cum digitis manus tuae sinistrae: et si iunctura dislocatur ad interiora.	Then elevate the scalp, which is on the inside of the skull towards the top with your left hand's fingers; and if the joint dislocates to the inside.
Deinde igni Cauterium habens duo uerua.	Then having a cauterizer with two handles.
Cuius forma est haec.	Whose form is this.
Deinde cauteriza cutim, donec penetret eam usque ad latus aliud, et ueniet figura cauterizationis cum quatuor cauteriis.	Then cauterize the scalp until it penetrates to the other side and comes with a figure of cauterization with four cauterizers.
Et quandoque fit cauterizatio cum cauterio habente tria uerua, quare fit figura cauterizationis tunc sex cauteriorum: et sunt uerua secundum subtilitatem tentae.	And sometimes it is done with a cauterizer having three handles, so that the figure of cauterization then has six cauterizers: and they are handles according to the subtlety of the test.
Et haec est forma cauterii habentis tria uerua.	And this is the form of a cauterizer having three handles.
Et quandoque additur super hunc modum unum, quare sunt cauteria octo.	And sometimes one is added to this method, so that there are eight cauterizers.
Deinde pone super cauterium porros contritos cum sale.	Then place crushed reeds with salt on top of the cauterizer.
Deinde fac adhaerere infirmum tranquillitati, ut non moueatur membrum tempore aliquo, donec confortetur.	Then make the patient remain calm and still, so that he does not move a limb at any time, until he is comforted.
Et si dislocatio est ad superiora, et raro fit illud, tunc cauteriza ipsum super humerum cauterio clauili, aut cauteriis multis punctando.	And if the dislocation is above, and this rarely happens, then cauterize it on top of the shoulder with a cauterizer having a claw-shaped point, or with many piercing cauterizers.
Nam iunctura firmatur, et remouetur humiditas: et sanatur infirmus.	For the joint is strengthened and moisture is removed, and the patient is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Stomachum.	Of the manner of cauterizing the Stomach.
Caput XXVIII.	Chapter XXVIII.
Quando accidunt in Stomacho frigus et humiditates multae, donec extrahant ipsum a complexione sua, et multiplicentur catarri ad ipsum, et assiduas modos curationis, et non confert: tunc oportet ut resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum, et extendat crura sua, et manus suas.	When coldness and many moistures occur in the Stomach until they extract it from its natural constitution and multiply catarrhs towards it, and the patient does not recover with continuous modes of treatment: then it is necessary that the patient be placed on his back, and stretch out his legs and arms.
Deinde cauteriza cum tribus cauteriis, cauterio sub cochleari pectoris quantitate digiti unius cum cauterio clauili, et duobus cauteriis inferius a duobus lateribus cauterii unius, donec ueniat figura cauteriorum triangulata.	Then cauterize with three cauterizers, one having the shape of a cochlear pectoris the size of one finger with a claw-shaped point, and two cauterizers below from both sides of one cauterizer, until the figure of the cauterizers becomes triangular.
Et elonga inter utraque ut non coniungantur, quando facient pus.	And make space between them so they will not unite when they form pus.
Et sit profunditas cauterii quantitas duarum tertiarum grossitudinis cutis.	And let the depth of the cautery be the quantity of three skin thicknesses.
Et sit figura cauteriorum secundum hanc formam sine additione: et si uis cauteriza cauterio magno in medio stomachi secundum hanc formam: et sit cauterium quo fit hoc cauterium unum secundum figuram circuli secundum hanc formam.	And let the shape of the cauteries be according to this form without addition: and if you wish, cauterize with a great cautery in the middle of the stomach according to this form: and let the cautery be one which is made in the shape of a circle according to this form.
Et cauterizatur stomachus punctando ei qui terretur ab hoc cauterio: et est, ut signes super stomachum punctum secundum quantitatem, quam uis cum encaustro: deinde cauteriza ipsum cum cauterio puncti: deinde cura ipsum cum curatione, quae praecessit donec sanetur.	And the stomach is cauterized by piercing it with a cautery which fears this cautery; and thus, signs are marked above the stomach's puncture according to the quantity you wish with encaustic: then cauterize it with the cautery of the puncture: then care for it with the cure that preceded until it is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Epar frigidum.	On the manner of cauterizing a cold liver.
Caput XXIX.	Chapter XXIX.
Quando accidit in Epate dolor ex frigiditate et humiditate, aut ex uentositate grossa, donec egrediatur a complexione sua naturali egressione superflua, et curatur infirmus, cum eo quod diximus, et non proficit in illo: tunc oportet ut resupinetur infirmus super ceruicem suam, et signes cum encaustro tria cauteria secundum hanc figuram, et hanc quantitatem eandem super Epar inferius ab hypocundriis, ubi peruenit cubitus hominis: et sit spacium quod est inter omne cauterium secundum grossitudinem digiti: et sit cauterium secundum longitudinem corporis rectum: et non comprimas manum tuam cum cauterio multum.	When it happens that a person with liver pain from cold and moisture, or from thick phlegm, has not been able to rid themselves of their natural superfluous excretion, and the patient is cured by what we have said, but does not benefit in this: then it is necessary for the patient to be lifted up onto their own head, and three cauteries are marked with encaustic according to this shape, on the liver below the hypochondria, where the elbow of a human reaches: and let there be space between each cautery equal to the thickness of a finger: and let the cautery be straight according to the length of the body: and do not compress your hand with the cautery much.
Et sit quantitas eius quod aduritur ex spissitudine cutis, quantitas medietatis eius non additum: et sit infirmus stans super pedes suos.	And let the quantity of what is burned be equal to the thickness of the skin, not adding anything to it: and let the patient stand on their own feet.
Si autem non est stans, tunc sit iacens, qui iam extendit crura sua, et eleuauit brachia sua.	But if they are not standing, then let them lie down, who have already extended their legs and raised their arms.
Haec est forma cauterii.	This is the shape of the cautery.
Et tibi quidem possibile est, ut cauterizes ista cauteria cum cauterio cultellari, quando tecum est subtilitas et prudentia in arte.	And it is possible for you, to cauterize these wounds with this cauter and the surgical knife, when you have subtlety and prudence in the art.
Et custodi te, ut non ultime procedas in cauterizatione, et aduratur spissitudo cutis totius, quare aduratur corpus totum, et perueniat ad intestina: quoniam cutis illic est subtilis, scias ergo illud.	And take care that you do not proceed too late in cauterization, and the thickness of the skin is thoroughly burnt, so that the whole body is burned and reaches the intestines; for the skin is thin there, therefore know this.
¶ De modo cauterizandi apostemata Epatis.	On the manner of cauterizing apostemes of the liver.
Caput XXX.	Head XXX.
Quando accidit exitura, et uis scire, si illud apostema est in carne Epatis, aut in tunica eius: tunc si est in carne Epatis, inuadit infirmum dolor, et grauitas absque acuitate: et si est in tunica Epatis, cum dolore est acuitas uehemens: et uides iam, quia fatigauit medicos eius curatio.	When it happens that an exitus occurs, and you wish to know whether this aposteme is in the flesh of the liver or in its tunic: then if it is in the flesh of the liver, it invades the patient with a severe pain and gravity without sharpness; and if it is in the tunic of the liver, with pain it becomes sharp and vehement; and you see now that its cure has wearied out doctors.
Oportet ergo ut resupinet infirmus super ceruicem suam.	Therefore, it is necessary for the patient to lean back over his own neck.
Deinde figura locum apostematis cum encaustro: deinde ignias cauterium quod assimilatur radio.	Then mark the place of the aposteme with an encaustum; then ignite the cauter which resembles a ray.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form.
Et cauteriza cum eo cauterium unum, donec comburatur cutis tota, et perueniat ad siphac, donec egrediatur sanies tota: deinde cura ipsum curatione exiturarum, donec sanetur.	And cauterize with this cauter one, until the skin is entirely consumed and reaches the siphac, until all pus exits; then cure it by the cure of abscesses, until it is healed.
Et non oportet ut hac cauterii specie utatur, nisi cuius studium in arte medicinae prolongatur: et per cuius manus concurrunt aegritudines istae cum experimento aliquotiens: tunc enim audeat super huiusmodi operationem.	And it is not necessary for this kind of cauter to be used by anyone except one whose study in the art of medicine is prolonged; and through whose hands these illnesses concur with some experiment several times: then indeed he may dare to undertake such an operation.
At uero dimittere ipsam, apud me est melius.	But rather to leave it alone, I think better of it.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Pleuresi.	On the manner of cauterizing in Pleurisy.
Caput XXXI.	Head XXXI.
Dixerunt antiqui, cauterium cum radicibus aristolochiae ad Pleuresim frigidam secundum hunc modum.	The ancients have said that one should use a cauter with the roots of Aristolochia for cold Pleurisy in this manner.
Et est, ut recipias ex radicibus aristolochiae siccae longae, radicem unam longiorem, quae ex ea inuenitur, et sit sicut grossitudo digiti.	And it is that you receive from the dry roots of Aristolochia, one root longer than another which is found in it, and it should be as thick as a finger.
Deinde submerge eam in oleo: et accende ipsam in igne.	Then immerse it in oil; and burn it over fire.
Deinde cauteriza cauterio uno in eo quod est inter continuationem furculae cum collo, et duobus cauteriis paruis sub guidezi parum decliuibus ad partem, quae est sub barba.	Then cauterize it with one cauterizer at the point where the beak of the fork meets the neck, and two small cauterizers slightly declined under the guidance to the part that is below the beard.
Et duobus cauteriis etiam in eo, quod est inter costam quintam et sextam decliuibus ad posteriora parumper: et cauterio alio in medio pectoris, et alio supra stomachum.	And also with two cauterizers in the place where is between the fifth and sixth ribs, slightly declined towards the back a little; and another cauterizer in the middle of the chest, and one above the stomach.
Et tribus cauteriis a posterioribus: uno in eo quod est inter duas spatulas: et duobus cauteriis a duobus lateribus pectoris, inferius cauterio quod est inter duas spatulas.	And three cauterizers from behind: one in the place where is between two spoon-like protrusions; and two cauterizers on either side of the chest, with the lower one being the one that is between two spoon-like protrusions.
Et non oportet ut comprimas manum tuam cum cauterio, imo sit in manifesto cutis odorando.	And it is not necessary for you to compress your hand with the cauterizer, but rather let it be openly on the surface of the skin, smelling.
Et iam dixerunt quidam antiqui, quod ex hominibus sunt qui utuntur cauterio ex ferro simili radio: et igniunt, et intus mittunt ipsum in eo quod est inter costas, donec perueniatur cum eo ad ipsum apostema, et egrediatur sanies: sicut diximus in apostemate Epatis.	And already some ancients have said that there are people who use a cauterizer like a iron rod, and they burn, and put it inside in the place where is between the ribs, until it reaches with it to the abscess, and pus comes out: as we said in the abscess of Epatis.
Sed in hac perforatione cum cauterio est ex timore, quod aut moritur infirmus statim, aut accidit in loco fistula, cui non est sanatio.	But in this perforation with a cauterizer there is fear that either the patient immediately dies, or a fistula occurs in the place, to which there is no cure.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Splenem Caput XXXII.	¶ On the manner of cauterizing the Spleen Chapter 32.
Quando tu curas aegritudinem splenis, cum eo quod diximus ex curatione in diuisione aegritudinum, et non confert curatio tua, tunc cauterium in ea est secundum tres modos, qui omnes sunt recti.	When you cure the disease of the spleen, with what we said about curing diseases in division of diseases, and your cure does not help, then the cauterizer is used in three modes, all of which are straight.
Quorum unus est, ut facias tria cauteria, aut quatuor lineando secundum longitudinem splenis secundum figuram cauteriorum Epatis, quorum praecessit figura.	One of which is, that you make three or four cauterizations, lining them up according to the length of the spleen, following the figure of the cauterizers of Epatis, whose preceding form came before.
Et sit inter omne cauterium quantitas grossitudinis digiti, aut plus parum.	And let there be among all cauterization a quantity of thickness equivalent to that of a finger, or slightly more.
Et sit modus cauterii, quem diximus in cauterio epatis aequaliter.	And let the method of cauterizing be as we have described for cauterizing the liver.
Et non comprimas manum tuam cum cauterio: et sit infirmus resupinus super dorsum suum.	And do not compress your hand with the cauter, and let the patient lie on his back in a weak position.
Et modus alius de cauterizatione est: ut ignias cauterium habens duo uerua, quod diximus in capitulo dislocationis humeri: et eleua cutem, quae est in directo splenis, ubi peruenit cubitus infirmi sinister: et sit eleuatio tua qua eleuas cutem secundum latitudinem corporis, ut cadant cauteria secundum longitudinem corporis.	And another method of cauterization is this: that you take a cauter with two handles, as we described in the chapter on dislocation of the shoulder; and lift up the skin which is directly above the spleen, where the patient's left arm lies; and let your elevation be according to the width of the body, so that the cauter falls along the length of the body.
Deinde intromitte duo uerua ignita ualde, donec cum eis penetres cutem a parte altera: deinde extrahe cauterium: fiunt ergo cauteria quatuor.	Then insert two very hot handles into the skin, until you pierce it on the other side; then withdraw the cauterer; thus four cauterizations are made.
Et si uis cauteriza cum cauterio alio habente tria uerua.	And if you wish to use a cauter with three handles.
Deinde cura cauterium postquam dimittis ipsum emittere pus diebus multis: est enim magis conferens quamque reliqua quae praecesserunt ex curatione.	Then care for the cauter wound after you have stopped it from discharging pus over many days; for it is more helpful than all the other things that preceded in the cure.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Hydropisi.	¶ On the manner of cauterizing in Hydrocephalus.
Caput XXXIII.	Chapter 33.
Cauterium non cadit in Hydropisi, nisi ascliti proprie.	The cauter does not fall in Hydrocephalus, unless it is properly applied.
Quando tu curas Hydropicum cum modis curationis, quos diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio, tunc oportet ut cauterizes ipsum quatuor cauteriis in circumitu umbilici, et cauterio uno super stomachum, et cauterio alio super epar, et cauterio super splenem, et cauteriis duobus post dorsum inter spondiles, et uno in directo pectoris, et alio in directo stomachi: et sit quantitas profunditatis cauterii propinqua spissitudini cutis.	When you are treating Hydrocephalus with the methods of treatment that we mentioned in the division, and the treatment does not take effect, then it is necessary to cauterize it with four cauterizations around the navel, one on the stomach, one on the liver, one on the spleen, two behind the back between the vertebrae, one directly on the chest, and another directly on the stomach: and let the quantity of depth of the cauter be close to the thickness of the skin.
Deinde dimitte cauterium apertum, ut emittat pus tempore longo.	Then leave the cauter open so that it discharges pus over a long period of time.
Et non euacues infirmum a curatione post cauterium cum eo: quod oportet ut aggregentur ei duae intentiones: et festinabit ad ipsum sanatio cum auxilio Dei.	And do not remove the patient from treatment after cauterization with him, since it is necessary that two intentions aggregate to him; and the cure will hasten to him with God's help.
Forma uero cauterii cum quo cauterizatur uenter, sit clauilis: secundum quod praecessit forma eius: et illius cum quo cauterizatur dorsum, sit oliuaris secundum quod praecessit eius forma.	The form of the caustic with which the belly is cauterized should be a key shape; according to its previous form. And the form of that with which the back is cauterized should be olive-shaped, according to its previous form.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Pedes, et Crura.	On the manner of cauterizing Feet and Legs.
Caput XXXIIII.	Chapter 44.
Quando apostemantur in Hydropico, et replentur aqua citrina: oportet ut cauterizes super dorsum Pedis in nocrati, quae est inter auricularem et anularem: et eleua manum tuam cum cauterio, et non torqueas ipsum: deinde eleua manum tuam: et non iteres ipsum omnino.	When they apostemate in hydropica and are filled with citrina water, it is necessary that you cauterize above the dorsal part of the foot, which is between the auricular and anular parts; then lift up your hand with the caustic and do not twist it; afterwards lift up your hand again and do not repeat it at all.
Resudet enim aqua citrina, et sit cauterium secundum hanc formam.	The citrina water will drain away, and the caustic should be according to this shape.
Deinde fac super duo crura duo cauteria in omni crure, et fiat cauterium cum extremitate cultellari cauterii: et fiat cauterium secundum longitudinem cruris, unum sub genu, et alterum inferius eo, circiter medium cruris: et super omnem coxam cauteria duo: et dimitte cauterium apertum absque curatione tempore longo: ut resudet ex eo aliquod aquae: deinde cura ipsum cum reliquis quae diximus.	Then make two caustics on each leg, one on every calf, and the caustic should be made with the edge of a knife-shaped caustic; and it should be made according to the length of the leg, one under the knee and another below that, about in the middle of the leg. And above all the hip make two caustics, and leave the caustic open without treatment for a long time until something drains out from it; then cure it with the rest as we have said.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in solutione Ventris.	On the manner of cauterizing in the dissolution of the Womb.
Caput XXXV.	Chapter 35.
Quando est solutio uentris ex frigore et humiditatibus, donec debilitet uirtutes retentiuam et digestiuam, quae sunt in stomacho et intestinis: et curatur illud cum modis curationis, et non sanatur: et uides infirmum tolerantem cauterium exuberantis uirtutis, tunc cauteriza ipsum cauterio magno super stomachum suum, secundum quod praecessit in cauterizatione stomachi cum cauterio circuli, et quatuor cauteriis in circumitu umbilici subtilibus, cum cauterio clauili subtili: et cauterio super alcatin supra alhosos magno, aut duobus cauteriis.	When the womb is dissolved due to cold and moisture, until the retaining and digestive powers in the stomach and intestines are weakened, which is cured with methods of treatment but does not heal; and you see the patient tolerating a caustic of excessive power, then cauterize him with a great caustic above his stomach, according to what preceded in the cauterization of the stomach with a circular caustic and four small caustics around the navel, with a key-shaped caustic; and a large caustic above the cecum or two caustics.
Et si uides humiditates exuberantes, et infirmum tolerantem illud, tunc cauteriza ipsum cauterio super pectinem, et cauterio super omne ilium: et fortasse addes duo cauteria parua super stomachum prope magnum.	And if you see excessive moistures and the patient tolerates that, then cauterize it with a cautery over the ribcage, and a cautery over all the hipbone; and perhaps add two small cauteries near the large one on the stomach.
Est enim curatio proficiens, cuius iuuamentum non errat.	For indeed, the cure is progressing, whose benefit does not fail.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Hemorroidas.	On the manner of cauterizing hemorrhoids.
Caput XXXVI.	Chapter 36.
Quando in ano sunt Hemorroides antiquae multae, aut una, et sunt ex humoribus grossis, frigidis, aut humiditatibus corruptis, et curantur cum eo, quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio: tunc cauteriza tribus cauteriis super inferiorem spondilem dorsi sub almeidati parumper triangulatim, et cauterio sub umbilico quasi duobus digitis.	When in the anus are old and many hemorrhoids, or one, and they are formed from thick, cold, or corrupted humors, and they are cured as we said in the division, and it does not help to cure; then cauterize three times with a cautery over the lower vertebra of the back under the navel somewhat triangularly, and a cautery under the belly button almost two finger-widths.
Et si cogitas, quod stomachus eius infrigidatus sit, et cibus eius non digeratur, et faciem eius uides apostemari, tunc cauteriza eum super stomachum cauterio magno, secundum quod praecessit: et cauterio super Epar eius, et alio super Splenem ipsius, cum cauterio clauili: et dimitte cauterium apertum tempore aliquo: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	And if you think that his stomach is chilled, and his food is not digested, and you see his face breaking out with pimples, then cauterize him on the stomach with a large cautery, following what came before: and a cautery on his spleen, and another on his liver, with a thumb-sized cautery; and leave the cautery open for some time: then cure him until he is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi althelul post abscisionem eorum.	On the manner of cauterizing altitudo after their abscession.
Caput XXXVII.	Chapter 37.
Quando tu abscindis althelul, tunc ignias cauterium quod assimilatur radio.	When you cut away the altitudo, then ignite the cautery that is similar to a ray.
Deinde intromittite ipsum ignitum in ipsum althelul abscisum: et ultima manum tuam, donec perueniat cauterium ad orificium uenae, ex qua currit sanguis: fac illud semel, aut bis.	Then insert the ignited cautery into the cut altitudo: and with your last hand, until the cautery reaches the opening of the vein from which blood flows: do this once or twice.
Si ergo althelul fuerint multa, tunc cauteriza unumquodque cauterio secundum quod narrauimus.	If then there are many altitudos, then cauterize each one with a cautery as we described.
Deinde cura ea, cum eo quod confert eis ex unguentis, donec sanentur.	Then cure those things with the ointments that are useful for them, until they heal.
Et si cauterizas eum cauterio magno super alcatin, est magis ultimum in iuuamento.	And if you cauterize him with a great cauterizer above the bladder, it is more effective for his benefit.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Fistulam in ano.	On the manner of cauterizing a fistula in the anus.
Caput XXXVIII.	Chapter 38.
Quando non obedit infirmus sectioni et operi quod narrauimus in loco suo, et terretur ab illo, fortasse sanatur cum cauterio.	When an invalid does not obey the cutting and operation that we described in its place, and is terrified by it, perhaps he will be healed with a cauterizer.
Cum ergo accidit alicui Fistula, et antiquatur, currit pus ex ea, et humiditates corruptae.	Therefore, when an abscess occurs in someone, and it becomes old, pus flows from it, and corrupted moisture flows out.
Dignius ergo quod oportet est, ut probes eam cum tenta subtili.	It is therefore more fitting that you probe it with a thin probe.
Deinde cognosce quantitatem profunditatis eius cum tenta.	Then know the depth of it with the probe.
Deinde ignias cauterium, quod est simile radio.	Then apply a cautery fire, which is like a ray.
Deinde intromit te ipsum ignitum in ipsam Fistulam et quantitatem in qua intrauit clauus.	Then insert yourself, burning, into the abscess and as much of it as you have entered with force.
Et itera super eam cauterium, donec comburantur illa omnia corpora corrupta, semel, aut bis, aut ter, secundum quantitatem necessitatis tuae.	And repeat the cautery over it until all those corrupted bodies are burned away, once, twice, or three times, according to your necessity.
Et custodi te ab adustione nerui, si est illic, aut uenae magnae: aut si Fistula uadit ad corpus uesicae, aut ad corpus intestini, tunc custodi te ab istis locis omnibus.	And take care to avoid burning the nerve if it is there, or a large vein; or if the abscess goes to the bladder's body or the intestine's body, then take care to avoid these places all.
Et non facias illud, nisi quando fistula est in loco carnoso: et cogitas, quia non est penetrans.	And do not do that unless the abscess is in a fleshy place; and think, because it is not piercing.
Deinde cura locum usquequo sanetur.	Then take care of the place until it heals.
Si autem sigillatur locus, et abscinduntur ab eo materiae, et remanet sic tempore longo: tunc scias, quia iam sanatus est integre.	But if the place is sealed, and the materials are cut away from it, and it remains thus for a long time: then you will know that it has already been healed entirely.
Et si non abscindunt ab eo materiae, tunc scias quia est penetrans, aut in profundo eius est os corruptum, aut quasi illud ex illis: quorum rememoratio ueniet in loco suo.	And if the materials are not cut away from it, then you will know that it is piercing, or there is a corrupted opening deep within it, or something similar: of which the recollection will come to its place.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Renes.	Chapter on the manner of cauterizing Kidneys.
Caput XXXIX.	Here is the translation:
Quando accidit in Renibus dolor ex frigore, aut ex uentositate grossa, et minuitur propter illud coius infirmi, tunc oportet ut cauterizes ipsum super almethenem super ipsos renes, cauterio super omnem renem cum cauterio clauili, cuius praecessit rememoratio.	When it happens that pain occurs in the kidneys due to cold or thick phlegm, and is diminished because of some infirmity of its own, then it is necessary to cauterize it above a layer of alum above the kidneys, cauterizing over all the kidney with a caustic implement, which was previously mentioned.
Et fortasse cauterizamus ipsum secundo in ipso almeidatu.	And perhaps we cauterize it again on top of that alum.
Quare uenient tria lineata.	Why are there three stripes?
Ergo erunt magis ultima in iuuamento.	So they will be more useful afterwards.
¶ De modo cauteritzandi Vesicam.	About the method of cauterizing a Bladder.
Caput XL.	Chapter 40.
Quando accidunt in Vesica debilitas, et mollificatio a frigo re et humiditatibus, donec non retineat infirmus urinam, tunc cauteriza ipsum in inferiori parte suminis super Vesicam, ubi incipiunt pili pectinis, et cauterio a dextra suminis, et alio a sinistra illius: et sit longitudo illius cauterizationis lateris secundum quantitatem nodi pollicis: et cauteriza ipsum cauterio inferiori dorsi, aut duobus cauteriis, si indiges illo: et sit secundum quod praecessit cauterium clauile.	When debilitation and softening occur in the Bladder due to cold and moisture, until the infirm person no longer retains urine, then one should cauterize it at the lower part of the back above the Bladder, where the pubic hairs begin, and with a caustic implement on the right side of the back and another on the left side of that: and let the length of this cauterization be according to the size of a thumb's knuckle: and one should cauterize it with an inferior caustic or two caustics if needed, in accordance with what has been previously mentioned.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Matricem.	About the method of cauterizing the Womb.
Caput XLI.	Chapter 41.
Quando accidunt in Matrice frigus et humiditates, et prohibetur per illud ab impregnatione, et corrumpuntur menstrua eius, et tardatur prouocatio eorum, et accidit ei apud aduentum eorum dolor, tunc oportet ut cauterizetur tribus cauteriis in circumitu umbilici, sicut diximus in cauterizatione uesicae, et cauterio super alcatim inferius dorso, aut duobus cauteriis: et sit cauterium clauile.	When cold and moisture occur in the Womb, and it prevents conception by means of that, and its menstrual fluids are corrupted, and their production is delayed, and pain occurs to her at their arrival, then it is necessary for three caustic implements to be applied around the navel, as we mentioned in the cauterization of the Bladder, and a caustic implement below the belt on the back or two caustics: and let there be a caustic implement with a clasp.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Ancham in dislocatione.	About the method of cauterizing the Shoulder in a Dislocation.
Caput XLII.	Chapter 42.
Quando effunduntur humiditates mucosae ad pixidem Anchae, et fiunt caussa exitus eius a loco suo: et signum illius est, quod prolongatur crus super alterum, quando comparantur adinuicem: et inuenitur locus dislocationis in eo uacuus.	When the mucous humors are poured out at the shoulder blade of the Shoulder, and become the cause of its exit from its place: and the sign of this is that the leg extends over another when they are brought together; and the location of the dislocation is found to be in a vacant spot.
Oportet ergo ut cauterizes infirmum super pixidem Anchae ipsius cauterio simili circulo: postquam tu signas cum encaustro in circumitu pixidis, sicut reuoluitur: et ut cadat ipsa pixis in medio circuli.	It is necessary therefore that you cauterize the patient over a lump of pine resin, similar to the circle made by Albucasis' own cautery; after which you mark with encaustic around the circumference of the pine resin, just as it will roll: and so that the pine resin falls in the middle of the circle.
Et sit cauterium cuius forma praecessit in cauterizatione stomachi.	And let the cautery be one whose shape preceded in the burning of the stomach.
Quod si tibi non est praesens hoc cauterium, tunc cauteriza ipsum tribus cauteriis, cum cauterio oliuari magno: et fiat cauterio profunditas secundum quantitatem spissitudinis cutis totius.	But if this cautery is not present to you, then burn the patient with three cauterizations, using a great olive oil cautery; and let the depth of the burning be according to the thickness of the skin in its entirety.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then take care of him until he is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Sciatica.	Of the manner of cauterizing for sciatica.
Caput XLIII.	Chapter 43.
Quando accidit dolor in pixide anchae, et sunt caussa illius frigus et humiditates: et curatur infirmus cum eo, quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio, et antiquatur illud: tunc oportet ut soluas infirmum ab humoribus grossis cum pillulis foetidis, aut cum pillulis artificialibus, et similibus.	When the pain occurs in the pine-like anchae, and the cause is coldness and moisture; and the patient is treated with what we said in the division, and the treatment does not bring relief, and the condition becomes worse: then it is necessary that you purge the patient of gross humors with foul pills, or artificial pills, and similar ones.
Deinde cauteriza eum.	Then burn him.
Et modus cauterii in ea est secundum duos modos: aut cauterium cum medicinis adurentibus, aut cauterium cum igne.	And the method of burning in this case is according to two modes: either a burning with incendiary medicines, or a burning with fire.
Cauterium cum igne, est secundum multos modos.	Burning with fire is according to many methods.
Quorum unus est, ut cauterizes super pixidem anchae ipsius tribus cauteriis triangulatis, secundum hanc formam.	One of which is that you burn over a lump of pine resin anchae its own three triangular cauterizations, according to this shape.
Et fac eis profunditatem bonam, uel malam.	And make their depth good or bad.
Et sit spacium quod est inter omne cauterium quantitatis grossitudinis digiti: sitque cauterium oliuare.	And let the space that is between all of these burnings be the size of a finger's thickness; and let the burning be with olive oil.
Quandoque autem fit cauterium in medio super caput anchae ipsius.	Sometimes, however, the burning is done in the middle over the head of the pine resin itself.
Quare sunt quatuor cauteria.	Therefore there are four burnings.
Et si uis cauteriza cum circulo, cuius praecessit forma in cauterizatione dislocationis anchae, uno: ut sit circulus continens ancham totam.	And if you wish, burn with a circle, whose form preceded in the burning of the dislocated anchor, one, so that the circle contains the entire anchor.
Et combure spissitudinem cutis totius.	And burn the thickness of the skin entirely.
Iste est modus cauterii in Sciatica, quando dolor est adhaerens anchae ipsi, et non extenditur usque ad coxam et crus.	This is the method of cauterization for sciatica, when the pain adheres to the backbone itself and does not extend as far as the hip and leg.
Si autem extenditur usque ad coxam et crus, tunc cauteriza ipsum duobus cauteriis super coxam, super locum ad quem innuit illic infirmus, in quo est dolor, et cauterio tuo super cauillam quatuor digitis ad partem syluestrem parumper: et sit cauterium cultellare.	But if it extends as far as the hip and leg, then you should cauterize that spot on the hip with two cauteries, above the spot where the patient is afflicted by pain, and cauterize your own with a small knife for about four finger-widths towards the left side: and let the cautery be a cutting one.
Et sit profunditas cauterii secundum profunditatem spissitudinis cutis.	And let the depth of the cautery be according to the thickness of the skin.
Quod si infirmus innuit quod dolor extenditur usque prope digitos pedis, tunc cauteriza ipsum illic ubi innuit cum cauterio puncti, tribus, aut quatuor, aut pluribus, si indiget illo.	But if the patient indicates that the pain extends as far as the toes of the foot, then you should cauterize him there where he indicates with a cautery point, three or four or more times, if necessary.
Et si innuit dolorem esse sub genu uersus crus, tunc cauteriza ipsum illic cauterio uno cultellari.	And if the patient indicates that the pain is under the knee towards the leg, then you should cauterize him there with one cutting cautery.
Et caue tibi in omni cauterizatione tua, ut non ultimes cum cauterio ad hoc ut comburas neruum, aut arteriam magnam, et attrahas per illud super infirmum nocumentum malum, aut contractionem.	And beware of yourself in every cautery of yours, lest you burn a nerve or a major artery and cause harm to the patient through it, or contraction.
Et ego quidem iam uidi unum et alium, ex eis qui cauterizauerunt supra cauillam, et ultimauerunt in cauterizatione, et inflatum est crus, donec tumor consecutus est pedem, et perforatus est totus, et corruptus est totus pes: deinde accidit solutio uentris, et mors post illud.	And I myself have seen one and another of those who have cauterized above the calf, and have burned themselves in the cautery, and the leg has become swollen until a tumor has developed at the foot, and the entire foot has been perforated and corrupted: then followed abdominal dissolution, and death after that.
Quod si dolor est in duabus partibus simul, cauteriza utramque secundum hunc modum.	But if the pain is in both parts at once, cauterize each one according to this method.
Et sapientes quidam dixerunt in cauterizatione anchae, cuius cauterii iste est modus.	And certain wise men have said about the cautery of the backbone, whose method is this one.
Fac simile samio ex ferro, cuius diametrus sit medietas palmi: et sit apud orificium suum secundum grossitudinem nuclei dactyli, aut minus parumper: et intra illud samium sit samium tertium.	Make a similar one from iron, whose diameter is the middle of the hand: and let it be at its opening according to the thickness of the tip of the finger, or slightly less: and inside that samian be another samian.
Et sit spacium quod est inter omne samium per quantitatem nodi pollicis: et sint samia aperta a duabus partibus: et sit altitudo eorum quasi nodus, aut duo nodi: et fac eis manubrium ex ferro decenter aptatum in samiis.	And let there be space which is between all the bones by the quantity of a thumb's knuckle; and let the bones be open on two sides; and let their height be as a knot, or two knots; and make for them a wing-shaped handle from well-fitting iron in the bones.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form.
Deinde igniatur in igne, donec rubeat, et proiiciat scintillas: deinde ponatur super pixidem anchae infirmo accubitato super latus sanum.	Then let it be ignited in fire until it is red and sends sparks: then place it on a piece of wood above an anchor for the weakly seated person, sitting over a sound limb.
Cauteriza ergo eum tribus cauteriis rotundis in uice una.	Therefore, cauterize him with three round cauters one after another.
Deinde dimitte ipsum tribus diebus.	Then let him go for three days.
Postea emplastra cum butyro: et dimitte uulnus apertum diebus multis.	After that, apply poultices with butter; and let the open wound be left for many days.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then care for him with ointment until he is healed.
Inquit Albucasis, hac specie cauterii o filii, parum usi sumus, propter terrorem aspectus eius: et propterea, quod paucos inuenimus qui expectent super ipsum.	Albucasis says, that in this manner of cauterization, my sons, we have used it little, on account of the fear caused by its appearance; and therefore, because few are found who will venture to apply it.
Verumtamen est ex bonis cauteriis ei qui suffert, et inuenit cum eo locum eius.	Yet it is from good cauterizations that one who suffers finds relief, and finds a place for himself with it.
Cauterium autem cum medicinis adurentibus est, ut tu facias duo samia habentia perforatam armillam, in quam descendit cardo portae eius ex aere, aut ferro, longitudo parietis: quorum in altitudinem eorum sint duo nodi, aut quasi ipsi.	However, the cauterium with burning medicines is, as you make two bones having a perforated ring, into which descends the hinge of its gate from air or iron, of the length of the wall: whose height they are two knots, or almost so.
Et sit spacium quod est inter utraque quantitas grossitudinis digiti, et sint aperta inferius et superius: et sit quod contineant se adinuicem, secundum hanc formam.	And let there be space which is between the two by the quantity of finger thickness, and let them be open below and above; and let it be so that they contain themselves together, according to this shape.
Deinde depone eam super pixidem anchae, infirmo iacente super latus sanum.	Then place it on a piece of wood above an anchor, for the weakly seated person sitting over a sound limb.
Et comprime manum tuam super pixidem anchae multum.	And press your hand firmly onto the piece of wood above an anchor very much.
Deinde funde inter duos circulos ex aqua calida, quae sit calefacta cum igne parumper, et tene eam quantitate horae temporalis: et toleret infirmus mordicationem eius, et ipsius adustionem, nam ipse inuenit mordicationem sicut ignis, donec quiescat mordicatio.	Then pour between the two circles hot water which is heated with fire for a little while, and hold it for the length of an hour: and let the infirm person endure its burning and charring, for he finds the burning as if by fire, until the burning subsides.
Deinde eleua manum tuam cum instrumento, et absterge aquam calidam ab ancha tota cum aqua dulci: deinde dimitte illud tribus diebus.	Then elevate your hand with the instrument and wash away hot water from the entire area along with sweet water; then let it be for three days.
Et pone super illud butyrum, donec remoueatur nigredo adustionis: et dimitte illud diebus aliquot, et curret ex eo pus.	And place butter on top of it, until the blackening of burning is removed; and let it be for several days, and a discharge will flow from it.
Est enim ultimum in iuuamento.	For this is the last resort.
Deinde cura illud cum unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then take care of that with ointments, until it heals.
Quod si extendatur dolor usque ad coxam, aut crus: fac ei statuam in eo quod continet aquam, secundum quod fecisti in ancha aequaliter.	And if the pain extends to the hip or leg, put it in a position that contains water, as you did for the groin.
Et iste est modus aquae calidae: et ego iam scripsi eam in tractatu rectificationis medicinarum.	And this is the method of hot water; and I have already written it in my treatise on the correction of medicines.
Sume alcali, et calcis non extinctae amborum ana partem unam: tere utraque, et pone ea in ollam nouam, cuius inferior pars sit perforata foramine uno paruo, secundum quantitatem quod ingrediatur ipsum radius: et pone sub fundo ollae ollam aliam uitreatam: et proiice super alcali et calcem ex aqua dulci, quod submergat utraque per digitum: post quam tu comprimas ea manu tua compressione bona: et dimite ollam, donec descendat aqua acuta inferiori parte ollae uitreatae.	Take alkali and unburned lime, each one part of both, pound them well, and put them in a new pot whose lower part is perforated with a small hole, according to the quantity that will fill the radius; and place another earthenware pot beneath the bottom of the first pot: and pour over the alkali and lime with sweet water, so that it covers both by the finger's breadth; after which you compress them with your hand in good compression: and let the pot sit until the sharp water flows down into the lower part of the earthenware pot.
Deinde aggrega illam aquam totam, et proiice eam super aliam calcem: et cola, donec renouetur.	Then gather all that water together and pour it over another lime: and let it stand until it is renewed.
Ipsa enim erit tunc fortis acuitatis ualde, quae administratur in multis operationibus medicinae, et in cauterizatione reliquorum membrorum.	For then it will be very strong and sharp, which is administered in many medical operations and in the cauterization of other limbs.
Quoniam efficit operationem ignis ipsius.	Because it produces a burning operation of its own.
Et ex medicinis sunt, cum quibus cauterizantur ancha, etiam sicut tesisie, et mel anacardi, et calx cum sapone, ita quod utraque sint permixta. ¶	And from medicines are those with which one cauterizes the groin, as well as testicles, and honey of bitter almonds, and lime with soap, so that both are mixed together.
Et Galenus quidem narrando retulit, cuiusdam uiri ex antiquis curationem, qua curatus est dolor anchae et uenae sciaticae: et magnificauit esse eius ualde.	And Galen indeed reported, while telling the story of some ancient man's cure, that he was healed from the pain in his groin and sciatic vein by this treatment, and magnified its great effectiveness.
Et dixit, quia non indiguit alia curatione, et quia sanatus est ex uice una, donec retulit, quia ipse fortasse intrauit balneum delatus, et exiuit ex eo iam sanus.	And he said, because it does not need another cure, and because it was healed by one treatment, until it returned, because the man himself perhaps entered the bath carried away, and went out from there already healthy.
Et est, ut accipiatur ex seitaragi uiridi: et si non inuenitur uiride, sumatur siccum, recens: et teratur multum cum aliquanto adipe, et ponatur super ancham, ubi est dolor, aut crus, aut in coxa: et ligetur, et dimittatur quantitate trium horarum, aut per quantitatem quod sentiat infirmus sedationem adustionis.	And it is, that it should be taken from the green aloe: and if it cannot be found, let a dry one be taken, fresh: and let it be rubbed much with some fat, and placed above the hip, where there is pain, or thigh, or in the groin: and bound, and left for the amount of three hours, or as long as the sick person feels relief from burning.
Deinde intromitte eum in balneum.	Then introduce him into a bath.
Cum ergo roridum fit corpus eius, intromitte ipsum in solium.	When therefore his body becomes clammy, introduce him onto a couch.
Nam dolor recedit, et sanatur.	For the pain subsides and he is healed.
Et scias, quia non oportet ut utatur aliquis cauterio cum istis medicinis, nisi post euacuationem corporis.	And know that it is not proper for anyone to use a cauterizer with these medicines, unless after the evacuation of the body.
Et Dioscorides qui dem dixit, quod stercus caprarum, quando cum eo cauterizatur uena sciatica, confert ei: et fit cauterium secundum hunc modum.	And Dioscorides said that goat dung, when applied with it to cauterize the sciatic vein, is beneficial to him: and it becomes a caustic in this way.
Sumatur lana, et imbibatur oleo antiquo, et ponatur super locum profundum, qui est inter pollicem pedis, et inter focile, et est propinquior focili.	Let wool be taken and soaked in old oil, and place it on a deep spot, which is between the thumb of the foot and the ankle bone, and is closer to the ankle.
Deinde accipe stercus caprarum siccum, et inflamma ipsum in igne, donec fiat carbo.	Then take dry goat dung, and set it on fire until it becomes ash.
Deinde pone ipsum super lanam, et dimitte ipsum, donec extinguatur.	Then place the ash on top of the wool, and leave it until it is extinguished.
Deinde itera illud.	Then repeat that.
Non cesses ergo facere illud, usquequo perueniat sensus super mediatione usque ad ancham, et quiescat dolor.	And do not cease to do this until the sensation reaches the hip and the pain subsides.
Et iste modus cauterii nominatur cauterium Vaccinum.	And this method of cauterization is called the "Vaccinium" caustic.
¶ De cauterizatione doloris Dorsi.	¶ On the Cauterization of Back Pain.
Caput XLIIII.	Chapter 44.
Quandoque accidit dolor in Dorso ex caussis multis, aut a casu, aut a percussione, aut euacuatione superflua, et illis similibus, ex infusione materiei frigidae, et humidae: et cauterium quidem non cadit, nisi in hac specie sola, quae fit ex infusione materiei frigidae.	Sometimes it happens that there is pain in the back due to many causes, or by chance, or from a blow, or from excessive evacuation, and similar things, due to the infusion of cold and moist matter: and cauterization indeed does not apply, unless in this single case which occurs through the infusion of cold matter.
Oportet ergo post euacuationem infirmi cum pillulis foetidis, et eis similibus, ut fiant super Dorsum, ubi est dolor, tres lineae secundum latitudinem almeidati ipsius, postquam signas cum encaustro in omni linea quinque cauteria, aut plura secundum quantitatem quae uenit ex tolerantia infirmi uirtute eius: et fiat cauterizatio cum cauteriopuncti.	Therefore it is necessary after the patient has been purged with pills and things similar to them, that they be placed on the back where there is pain, three lines according to the width of the patient's body, after which marks are made with encaustic in each line five cauterizations, or more as much as comes from the patient's endurance by their own virtue: and let the cauterization be done with a cauteriopunct.
Et si uis, cauteriza tribus cauteriis, aut quatuor, cum cauterio clauili mediali, secundum hanc formam.	And if you wish, cauterize three times or four with the middle key cauterizer, in this form.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in incaeptine Gibbositatis.	On the method of cauterizing for Gibbous Inflammation.
Caput XLV.	Chapter 45.
Multotiens accidit haec aegritudo infantibus paruis.	This affliction often occurs in small children.
Et signum incaeptionis eius in pueris est: quod accidit super eum strictura in anhelitu apud eleuationem, et motum: et inuenis in ultima spondilium Dorsi et nodorum eius, quod iam incaepit eminere super reliquos spondiles.	And the sign of its inception is that it occurs on a child as a constriction in breathing when they are lifted up and moved: and you will find it in the last vertebrae of the back and knots thereof, which has already begun to protrude above the other vertebrae.
Cum ergo uides illud, et uis facere illud, tunc cauteriza ipsum cum cauterio quod sit circulus secundum hanc formam.	When therefore you see this and wish to do it, then cauterize it with a cauterizer that is a circle in this form.
Et capiat cauterium super omnem partem spondilis aequaliter: et si uis cauteriza in circumitu spondilis cum cauterio puncti duas lineas, aut tres: et sint puncta propinqua adinuicem.	And take the cauterizer over all parts of the vertebra equally: and if you wish, cauterize around the vertebra with a cauteriopunct two lines or three: and let the points be close together.
Deinde cura locum, donec sanetur cum eo quod diximus.	Then care for the place until it is healed as we have said.
Et caue, ne administres cauterium in gibbositate, quae fit in spasmo nerui.	And beware, lest you apply the cauterizer to a gibbosity that occurs in a muscle spasm.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Podagra, et doloribus iuncturarum.	On the method of cauterizing for Gout and pains of joints.
Caput XLVI.	Chapter 46.
Quando dolores iuncturarum sunt ab humiditatibus frigidis, quae effunduntur ad cuiuslibet membra corporis, tunc quando accidunt dolores in pedibus, de consuetudine medicorum est, ut nominent illud Podagram proprie.	When the pains of joints are caused by cold humors which flow to any part of the body, and when they occur in the feet, it is according to the custom of physicians to name that properly Podagra.
Cum ergo curatur Podagra frigidae caussae cum modis curationis, et non remouentur dolores, tune cauterium remouet eos.	When therefore podagra is cured due to cold causes with modes of cure and pains are not removed, then a cauterization removes them.
Et est, ut cauterizes eum post euacuationem in circumitu iuncturae pedum, cauteriis multis: et sit cauterium Oliuare.	And it is, as he cauterizes him after evacuation in the surrounding area of the ankle joint, with many cauterizations; and let the cauterization be olive-like.
Cuius haec est forma.	Whose form this is.
Et si indiges ut punctes super faciem pedis, tunc fac cum cauterio puncti.	And if you wish to make points on the surface of the foot, then do it with a cauterization point.
Quod si ascendunt dolores usque ad genua, aut reliquas iuncturas, et multotiens accidit illud, tunc cauteriza ipsum super omne genu tribus cauteriis, aut quatuor ab omni parte, cum hoc eodem cauterio Clauili.	Which if pains ascend to the knees or other joints, and often this happens, then cauterize him on all of his knee with three cauterizations or four from every part, with the same cauterization as a chisel.
Si autem necessaria sunt tibi plura hoc cauterio, tunc cauteriza ipsum.	But if you need more of this cauterization, then cauterize him.
Et non submergas manum tuam cum cauterio, imo sit circiter spissitudinem cutis tantum.	And do not immerse your hand with the cauterization, rather let it be as much as the thickness of the skin.
Si autem ascendunt dolores ad genua, et dorsum: tunc administra quod diximus ex cauterio in capitulo suo.	If however pains ascend to the knees and back: then apply what we said in its own chapter from the cauterization.
Quod si dolores sunt in manibus tantum, tunc puncta in circumitu focilium, sicut reuoluuntur duae lineae.	Which if pains are only in the hands, then make a point in the surrounding area of the fingertips, as two lines revolve.
Si autem remanet ex doloribus in digitis, tunc puncta eos, super omnem nodum punctum, et super pectinem manus.	If however there remains pain in the fingers, then make a point on them, above every knot of a point, and on the palm of the hand.
Si autem ascendunt dolores post dies ad cubitos, aut ad humeros, tunc cauteriza utrosque ab omni parte.	If however pains ascend after days to the hips or shoulders, then cauterize both from every part.
Et non euacues infirmum ex regimine bono, ex recaeptione medicinarum.	And do not remove a patient from good management, by rejection of medicines.
Nam si bonum fiat regimen, et euacuetur phlegma, sanabitur auxilio Dei cum isto cauterio.	For if good treatment is made, and the phlegm is evacuated, he will be healed with the help of God by means of this cauterization.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Rupturis.	Of the manner of cauterizing in Wounds.
Caput XLVII.	Chapter 47.
Quando accidit Ruptura in inguinibus, et descendit intestinum, aut zirbum ad testiculum, et est illud incipiens propinquum: tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmo dimittere comestionem in die suo.	When a rupture occurs in the groin and the intestine or bladder descends to the testicle, and it is beginning to be near: then it is necessary that you hasten to have the patient stop eating on his day.
Et utatur ex lenientibus, quo descendat stercus a uentre suo.	And he should use mild substances so that stool descends from his belly.
Deinde sedeat inter manus tuas super dorsum suum: et praecipe ei, ut teneat anhelitum suum, donec egrediatur, uel appareat zirbum, aut intestinum.	Then sit him between your hands on his back, and command him to hold his breath until he goes, or a flatulence appears, or the intestine.
Deinde reduc ipsum digitis tuis, et signa cum encaustro sub Ruptura super os pectinis, cum signo cuius extremitas sit similis medietati circuli ad superiora corporis.	Then lead him back with your fingers and mark with an enema under the rupture on the pubic bone, with a sign whose extremity is like half a circle above the body.
Deinde igni cauterium, cuius haec est forma, donec ueniat album, et proiiciat seintillas.	Then apply a cautery to fire, which has this shape, until white comes out and it discharges pus.
Deinde reduc intestinum, aut zirbum ad concauitatem suam.	Then lead the intestine or flatulence back to its concavity.
Deinde ponat minister manum suam super locum, ut non exeat intestinum: et tu iam aperuisti inter crura infirmi, et posuisti sub eo puluinar, et seruiens alius super crura eius, et alius super pectus eius qui tenet manus.	Then the assistant should place his hand on the spot so that the intestine does not come out: and you have now opened between the patient's legs, and placed a pad underneath him, and another servant above his legs, and another above his chest who is holding hands.
Deinde depone cauterium super ipsum signum, manu tua cum cauterio stante recta.	Then place the cautery on top of him, with your hand standing straight with the cautery.
Et tene ipsum, donec cum eo consequaris os: aut itera cum eo uice alia, si non consecutus fueris cum eo in prima usque ad os.	And hold him until you reach his mouth: or else go around with him the other way, if you are not able to reach his mouth on the first try.
Et prudenter obserua ab exitu intestini in hora cauterizationis tuae, ne comburas ipsum, et eueniat per illud super infirmum aut mors, aut malicia magna.	And carefully observe from the exit of the intestine during your cautery hour, lest you burn him and harm occurs to the patient through that or death, or great evil.
Et scias, quod quando tu non consequeris cum cauterio os, non confert operatio tua.	And know that when you do not reach the mouth with the cautery, your operation is of no use.
Et oportet ut sit cauterium infantium subtile, secundum mensuram eorum.	And it is necessary for a cautery to be made for infants, according to their measure.
Deinde cura cum reliquis unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then take care with the other ointments until he is healed.
Et sit infirmus iacens super dorsum suum quadraginta diebus, donec sigilletur uulnus.	And let the patient lie on his back for forty days until the wound is sealed.
Et oportet, ut ponas nutrimentum eius longitudine temporis curationis eius, quod leniat uentrem eius: ut non exeat intestinum apud conamen et egestionem.	And it is necessary to put his food in proportion to the length of time of his cure, so that it soothes his stomach: lest his intestine goes out during eating and evacuation.
Deinde quando uult surgere post quadraginta dies, tunc administra ligamentum decenter factum, et teneat ipsum quadraginta diebus aliis.	Then when he wishes to operate after forty days, then administer a well-made ligament, and hold it for forty other days.
Et minoretur a labore, et repletione cibi et potus, et uocibus uehementibus.	And let him be freed from labor, and the filling of food and drink, and loud voices.
Nam quando utitur hoc regimine, ita sanatur sanatione integra.	For when he uses this regimen, so he is healed by a complete cure.
Et ego dicam curationem Rupturarum cum incisione in capitulo suo.	And I will say the treatment of ruptures with an incision in its chapter.
Quando autem Rupturae accidunt in reliquo uentre, et sunt incipientes, et uis ut non addantur, tunc cauteriza Rupturam eius cauterio rotundo secundum quantitatem eius: et sit illud quod aduritur ex tunc sicut tertia eius.	When, however, ruptures occur in the remaining part of the belly, and are beginning to form, and it is desirable that they not be added to, then cauterize the rupture with a round cauterizing iron according to its size: and let what is cauterized from then on be like one-third of it.
Deinde cura ipsum, cum eo quod diximus: et non addetur.	Then care for it as we have said, and nothing will be added.
Et iam dixerunt quidam primi: ut cauterizetur Ruptura cum cauterio triangulato, secundum hanc formam.	And already certain ones have said that the rupture should be cauterized with a triangular cauterizing iron, according to this shape.
Postquam signatur cum encaustro, et ponitur linea quae est per latitudinem in latere superiori Rupturae, et linea altera ad inferius.	After it has been marked with encaustum, and a line is placed which is along the width on the upper side of the rupture, and another line below.
Et depone manum tuam in medio cum cauterio clauili.	And place your hand in the middle with a curved cauterizing iron.
Sed cauterium primum est facilius et melius.	But the first cauterization is easier and better.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in doloribus propter casum, aut percussionem.	Of the manner of cauterizing for pains due to fall or blow.
Caput XLVIII.	Chapter 48.
Quando accidit in quibusdam membris a casu, aut percussione dolor: et perseuerat ille dolor tempore longo, et non confert in eo curatio cum medicinis: tunc oportet ut cauterizetur cum cauterio Puncti.	When it happens to some members from a fall or blow, and the pain persists for a long time, and there is no relief in that pain with medicines: then it is necessary that it be cauterized with the puncturing cauterizing iron.
Et sit cauterium omnis membri cauterium secundum magnitudinem eius, et ipsius paruitatem, et debilitatem eius, et ipsius uirtutem, et locationem torsionis, et doloris ex eo.	And let the cauterizing iron be for every part of the body according to its size, and its smallness, and weakness, and power, and twisting location, and pain from it.
Si ergo sanatur ex cauterio primo, est bene.	If then he is healed by the first cauterization, that is good.
Si non: tunc itera super ipsum cauterium.	If not, then proceed with the cautery instrument over it.
Quoniam de consuetudine horum dolorum est, ut permutentur ex membro ad illud quod appropinquat ei.	Because of the custom of these pains, they change from member to that which is nearest to them.
Quare oportet ut consequaris eos cum cauterio, donec sanetur infirmus.	Therefore it is necessary that you follow them with a cautery instrument until the patient recovers.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Lepra.	On the manner of cauterizing leprosy.
Caput XLIX.	Chapter 49.
Leprosi autem quandoque iuuantur cauterio iuuamento maximo.	But lepers are sometimes helped by cauterization, with the greatest benefit.
Et praecipue species Leprae, quae fit propter putrefactionem phlegmatis et melancholiae: cum ergo uis cauterizare ipsam considera.	And especially those types of leprosy that occur due to the putrefaction of phlegm and black bile; when you wish to cauterize this, take heed.
Si ergo Lepra est ineipiciens, et curasti eam cum eo, quod diximus in diuisione, et non descendit, neque stat: et times super infirmum, quod comprehendat corruptio super totam complexionem eius: tunc cauteriza eum super caput quinque cauteriis: uno in medio capitis noto, et secundo inferius eo uersus frontem apud finem capillorum, et duobus super duo cornua, et uno posterius super nucea ceruicis.	So if the leprosy is not subsiding and you have treated it as we mentioned in the division, and it does not descend or remain steady: and you fear for the patient, because corruption may spread to his entire complexion; then cauterize him with five cauterizations: one in the middle of the head, noted; and a second below it towards the forehead at the end of the hairline; and two above the two horns; and one behind on the nucha of the neck.
Et ultima manum tuam cum cauterio parumper, donec imprimat in os impressionem paruam, et dislocentur ex eo cortices: ut alleuietur expiratio uaporum grossorum ex eo, et cauteriza cauterio etiam super ipsum splenem, secundum quod praecessit.	And then hold your hand with the cautery instrument for a little while, until it impresses a small mark on his skin and loosens the scabs: so that he may be relieved of the expiration of thick vapors from him; and cauterize also the spleen with the same cautery, according to what has preceded.
Sin autem Lepra iam sparsa est super infirmum, et apparet manifeste: tunc oportet ut cauterizes cum istis cauteriis, quae diximus in capite, et cauterio super extremitatem nasi, et duobus cauteriis super duas maxillas, et duobus cauteriis super spondiles colli, et sex super spondiles dorsi, et uno magno super alhahosos apud gran caudae et uno supra ipsum, in ipso almeidati: et duobus super anchas: scilicet super omnem ancham uno, et duobus super genua: uno super omne genu, et duobus super humeros, et duobus super cubitos, et duobus super teneritudines pectoris sui: et cauteriza ipsum super omnem iuncturam, ex iuncturis digitorum manuum suarum, et pedum suorum: et cauteriza super omnem calcaneum pedum suorum, et focilia manuum suarum.	But if the leprosy has already spread over the patient and is manifestly apparent: then it is necessary that you cauterize with those cauterizations which we mentioned in the chapter; and with a cautery instrument on the tip of the nose, and two on each cheekbone, and two on the vertebrae of the neck, and six on the vertebrae of the back, and one large on the alhahos at the granular part of the tail and one above it in the midst of the loins: and two on the shoulders; that is to say, one on each shoulder; and two on each knee, and two on each upper arm, and two on the tendons of his chest: and cauterize him over all the joints, from the joints of the fingers of his hands and feet, and cauterize also over every heel of his feet, and the soles of his hands.
Et caue tibi a neruis qui sunt super postremum calcanei, ut non comburas eos.	And beware of the nerves which are above the last bone of the heel, so that you do not burn them.
Et quandoque cauterizatur cauterio super os pectinis, et alio super os stomachi, et alio super epar.	And sometimes it is cauterized with a cauterizer over the bone of the hip, and another over the bone of the stomach, and another over the liver.
Et scias, quod quanto plus addis cauterium, est magis iuuamentum, et magis conferens.	And know that as much as you add to the cauterizer, it is more beneficial and more effective.
Et scias, quod infirmus non inuenit in cauterio dolorem, sicut inueniunt ipsum sani: propterea, quod corpus eius iam stupefactum est.	And know that an invalid does not find pain in the cauterizer as the healthy do; therefore, since his body is already numb.
Et oportet ut sint cauteria ex magnitudine, et paruitate secundum membra et iuncturas: secundum quod praecessit ex speciebus ferramentorum.	And it should be that the cauterizers are of great size and smallness according to members and joints: according to which preceded from the species of tools.
Deinde cura cauterium ex farina herbi cum melle, et reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then cure the wound with a cauterizer made from wheat flour mixed with honey, and other treatment, until it heals.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Stupore.	Chapter on the method of cauterizing in numbness.
Caput L.	Book 5
Quando stupet aliquod membrum, et curatur cum medicinis, et oleis, et emplastris, et non sanatur, tunc cauteriza ipsum membrum stupefactum cauteriis, secundum quod meretur magnitudo membri, aut paruitas eius.	When some member is numb and is treated with medicines, oils, and poultices, and does not heal, then cauterize the numb member with cauterizers, according to the size or smallness of the member.
Et sit cauterium tuum intrans in spissitudinem cutis parumper.	And let your cauterizer go into the thickness of the skin a little bit.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then cure it with ointment, until it heals.
Et quandoque cauterizatur ad quiddam stuporis, qui accidit manui, et pedi, in spondilibus dorsi apud exitum neruorum, qui mouent illud membrum: et remouetur stupor.	And sometimes it is cauterized for some numbness that occurs in the hand and foot at the vertebrae of the back near the exit of the nerves that move that member; and the numbness is removed.
Verum non praesumat super illud, nisi qui est sapiens in anatomia membrorum, et egressione neruorum mouentium corpus.	But one should not presume to do so unless he is wise in the anatomy of members and the exit of nerves that move the body.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Albaras.	Chapter on the method of cauterizing in ulcers.
Caput LI.	Book 51
Quando antiquatur Albaras, et non confert in eo aliquid ex ingeniis medicinae: tunc cauteriza super ipsam cauterio profundo parumper, secundum quantitatem spissitudinis cutis, donec remoueatur albedo, et mutetur color eius.	When an ulcer ages and does not respond to anything from the skills of medicine: then cauterize over it with a deep cauterizer for a little bit, according to the quantity of the thickness of the skin, until the white part is removed and its color changes.
Deinde cura ipsum cum farina herbi, et lentis cum oleo rosa, et foliis arnoglossae, et sanguine columbae, et sanguine hyrundinis: de unoquoque sit pars una: misceantur haec omnia, et liniantur super pannum, et adhaereant loco, donec sanetur.	Then take care of it with barley flour and lentils mixed with rose oil, and the leaves of arnoglossa, and the blood of a dove, and the blood of a hoopoe: each part should be one: mix all these together, and spread them on a cloth, and let them adhere to the place until it is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Cancro.	On the manner of cauterizing in Cancer.
Caput LII.	Chapter 52.
Quando Cancer est incipiens, et uis ipsum sistere: tunc cauteriza ipsum cum cauterio circuli in circuitu eius, sicuti reuoluitur.	When cancer is beginning to form, and you wish to stop it: then cauterize it with a caustic ring around its perimeter, as if it were revolving.
Sapientes autem dixerunt, ut cauterizetur cauterio ultimo in medio.	However, the wise have said that one should cauterize with the last caustic in the middle.
Mihi autem non uidetur illud: quoniam timeo quod ulceretur: et ego iam uidi illud aliquotiens.	But it does not seem right to me: because I fear that it will be inflamed: and I have already seen this happen a few times.
Et rectius est, ut cauterizetur in circumitu eius cum circulo, sicut diximus: aut cauteriis multis.	And it is more right to cauterize around its circumference with a circle, as we said: or with many caustics.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Adubelati.	On the manner of cauterizing in Adenomas.
Caput LIII.	Chapter 53.
Quando aliquis habet Adubelati, et tardatur in maturatione, aut propter superfluitatem facientem eam, aut propter aetatem infirmi, quando est decrepitus pauci sanguinis, aut propter tempus, et uis festinare in maturatione Adubelati, tunc cauteriza in circumitu eius cum cauteriis paruis multis punctando.	When someone has an adenoma and it is delayed in its maturation, either because of excess making it so or because of the old age of a weak person, when he is worn out by little blood, or because of time, and you wish to hasten the maturation of the adenoma, then cauterize around its circumference with small caustics, puncturing many times.
Deinde dimitte eam.	Then leave it.
Nam ipsa festinabit cum maturatione.	For it will hasten along with the maturation.
Si autem uis perforationem eius cum cauterio, tunc igni cauterium, cuius haec est forma.	But if you wish to make a perforation in it with a caustic, then ignite the caustic, which has this shape.
Et depone ipsum in medio Adubelati, donec penetret cutem: et sit cauterium ab eo quod sequitur infirmus, ut alleuietur cursus puris.	And place it in the middle of the adenoma, until it pierces through to the skin: and let the caustic be from what follows weakly, so that the flow of pus may be alleviated.
Deinde cura ipsum donec sanetur.	Then take care of it until it is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in malo corrodente.	Here is the translation:
Caput LIIII.	Here is the translation:
Corrodens non est nisi corruptio in membro ambulans, et corrodit ipsum: sicut ignis comedit ligna sicca.	Decaying is not except corruption in a walking limb and it decays itself; just as fire consumes dry wood.
Si ergo uides corrodentem in loco qui toleret cauterium cum igne, tunc igni cauteria multa, clauilia parua et magna, secundum quod conueniet illi loco in quo est corrodens.	So then if you see a decaying thing in a place that can be cauterized with fire, then many little and great iron clamps will fit, according to the place where the decaying thing is.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum ab omni parte donec eradices corruptionem totam, et non remaneat ex ea aliquid penitus.	Then cauterize it from every part until you eradicate the entire corruption, and nothing at all remains of it.
Deinde dimitte ipsum tribus diebus, et pone super loca cauterizata sulphur tritum cum oleo, donec eradicentur escharae omnes, et omnis corruptio.	Then let it be for three days, and place over the cauterized areas powdered sulfur with oil, until all scabs are eradicated and all corruption is gone.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguentis generantibus carnem.	Then care for it with ointments that promote flesh growth.
Si ergo uides, quod post tres dies caro nascitur natiuitate sana, in qua non est corruptio, est bonum.	So then if you see that after three days the flesh is born healthy and uncorrupted, it is good.
Et si non: tunc itera cauterium super illud quod remansit ex locis corruptis.	And if not: then repeat the cautery over what remains of the corrupted areas.
Et corrodens medicatur quandoque cum medicina acuta.	And the decaying thing is healed sometimes with sharp medicine.
Ipsa namque surgit loco cauterii.	Itself rises in the place of the cautery.
Verumtamen cauterium cum igne est uelocioris iuuamenti: et ego quidem iam dixi cauterizationem eius cum medicina acuta in diuisione: accipe ergo eam illic quando ea indiges.	However, the cautery with fire is a more speedy remedy: and I have already said that its division with sharp medicine is for this purpose; therefore, take it there whenever you need it.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Clauis, et Verucis.	About the method of cautering in Claws, and Warts.
Caput LV.	Chapter 55.
Multotiens accidit in inferioribus partibus pedum haec aegritudo: et est res grossa, filtrata, quae laedit pedem.	This illness often happens in the lower parts of the feet: and it is a thick, filtered thing that injures the foot.
Et cauterium quidem in eis est secundum duos modos: cauterium cum igne, et cauterium cum aqua calida.	And there are two ways of cautering in them: a cautery with fire and a cautery with hot water.
Quantum autem cum igne est, ut ignias cauterium concauum simile pennae uulturis: quod fiat ex ferro, secundum quantitatem quod contineat clauum ab omni parte: et sit subtilium marginum.	And as much as it is with fire, so the cautery should be made like a concave spoon similar to a vulture's claw: which is made of iron, according to the quantity that contains the nail from every part, and has a thin edge.
Deinde depone ipsum ignitum super clauum.	Then place the heated instrument over the nail.
Deinde reuolue manum cum cauterio in circumitu claui, donec perueniat cauterium ad profunditatem claui: et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus, donec incipiat emittere pus.	Then turn your hand with the cautery around the nail until the cautery reaches the depth of the nail: and leave it for three days until it begins to discharge pus.
Deinde emplastra ipsum cum maluis syluestribus, contritis cum sale: et dimitte emplastrum super ipsum in nocte.	Then apply poultices to it with crushed wild mullein, mixed with salt: and leave the poultice on it at night.
Ipse enim eradicabitur ex radicibus suis.	For it will be uprooted from its roots.
Deinde cura locum unguento generatiuo carnis, donec sanetur.	Then take care of the place with a flesh-generating ointment until it is healed.
Quod si sunt non conuersi, et multotiens accidunt in superficie corporis, praecipue in manibus et pedibus: tunc administres in eis cauterium cum aqua calida: et est, ut accipias cannulam ex aere, aut ferro, aut ex penna uulturis: et depone eam super clauum, aut althelul.	But if they are not converted and frequently occur on the surface of the body, especially in hands and feet: then apply to them a cautery with hot water: and thus take a tube made from air, or iron, or from a bird's quill: and place it over the nail, or elsewhere.
Deinde proiice in cannulam ex aqua calida quantitatem paucam: retine manum tuam, et tu reuolue eam cum compressione manus tuae parumper, ut imprimatur margo cannulae in radice claui, et inueniat aqua calida uiam ad profundum, ad radicem claui: et expectet infirmus parumper super mordicationem aquae calidae hora una.	Then pour a small amount of hot water into the tube: hold your hand firmly and turn it with pressure from your hand for a little while, so that the edge of the tube is impressed on the root of the nail, and the hot water finds its way to the depth, to the root of the nail: and the patient should wait for a little over one hour above the morsuration of the hot water.
Deinde dimitte ipsum, nam clauus eradicatur cum radicibus suis.	Then leave it alone, for the nail is uprooted with its roots.
Ita fac cum eis uno post unum, donec uenias super omnes qui ex eis sunt in corpore.	Do this with each one after one, until you come to all those that are in the body.
Deinde cura eos postquam eradicantur, cum eo quod generat carnem ex unguentis.	Then take care of them after they have been uprooted, with what generates flesh from ointments.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Tremore.	Regarding the method of cauterizing in Tremor.
Caput LVI.	Chapter 56.
Quando accidit alicui Tremor ex frigore in neruo, aut ex febre quartana, aut alio: tunc oportet ut cauterizes ipsum quatuor cauteriis, aut quinque super spondiles dorsi, et inter omnem spondilem cauterio, et in pectore eius cauterio, et super stomachum eius cauterio.	When someone suffers from Tremor due to cold in the nerve, or quartan fever, or another cause: then it is necessary that you cauterize it with four or five cauteries on the vertebrae of the back, and between each vertebra, and in his chest, and above his stomach.
Tremor enim quiescit cum cauterio oliuari, et festinat sanitas aegritudinis frigidae.	Shaking ceases with an olive oil cautery, and the recovery from cold illness hastens.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Albathir.	On the manner of cauterizing by Albatheer.
Caput LVII.	Chapter 57.
Quandoque expelluntur in corpore Albathir foedae, id est, pustulae, quae fiunt a materiis grossis corruptis.	Sometimes unclean things are purged from the body by Albatheer, that is, pustules which arise from corrupted gross matter.
Oportet ergo in primis cum apparent, ut cauterizentur super omne caput pustulae cauterio subtili cum ligno myrti, cuius extremitas accensa est cum igne.	It is therefore necessary at first to cauterize with a fine cautery and myrtle wood, the ends of which are set on fire, over all the pustules that appear.
Aut cum radice aristolochiae longae.	Or with the root of long Aristolochia.
Aut cum cauterio lenticulari.	Or with a lentil-shaped cautery.
Et quandoque cauterizantur ademenul, in principio expulsionis suae secundum hunc modum: et non augentur: et disrumpitur superfluitas faciens eos, et sanatur ex eis.	And sometimes they are cauterized again at the beginning of their evacuation in this manner: and they do not increase; and the superfluity is broken up making them healthy, and healing ensues from them.
Verumtamen oportet ut fiat illud post euacuationem cum phlebotomia.	However, it is necessary that this be done after evacuation with bloodletting.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in fluxu sanguins ex arteria in uulnere.	On the manner of cauterizing in a flow of blood from an artery in a wound.
Caput LVIII.	Chapter 58.
Multotiens accidit fluxus sanguinis ex arteria, quae incisa est apud uulnus, quod accidit extrinsecus, aut apud incisionem apostematis, aut cauterium membri, et similia eis: et fit difficile abscindere eum.	Many times it happens that a flow of blood occurs from an artery which has been cut at the wound, either because it happened externally or at the incision of an apostema, or at the cautery of a member, and similar things: and it becomes difficult to stop it.
Cum ergo accidit alicui illud, tunc propera cum manu tua ad orificium arteriae, et pone super ipsum digitum tuum indicem: et stringe eum multum, donec obsessus sit sanguis sub digito tuo, et non egrediatur ex eo aliquid.	When therefore it happens to someone, then hurry with your hand to the opening of the artery, and place your index finger upon it: and grasp it tightly until the blood is pressed beneath your finger, and nothing escapes from it.
Deinde pone in ignem cauteria oliuaria parua, et magna numero plura: et suffla super ea, donec fiant ignita ualde.	Then place a small and many large olive oil cauteries in the fire, and blow on them until they become very hot.
Deinde accipe ex eis unum, aut paruum, aut magnum, secundum uulnus et locum, in quo disrupta est arteria, et depone cauterium super ipsam uenam, post quam tu remoues digitum tuum festinanter: et tene cauterium, donec abscindatur sanguis.	Then take one, small or large, according to the wound and place, where the artery is disrupted, and place the cautery on the wound, after you quickly remove your finger; and hold the cautery until the blood is stopped.
Quod si expellatur cum eleuas digitum ab orificio arteriae, et extinguis cauterium, tunc accipe cauterium aliud festinanter, ex cauteriis quae in igne sunt praeparata.	If an artery is expelled as you raise your finger from the arterial opening and you extinguish the cautery, then quickly take another cautery from those that are prepared in the fire.
Non ergo cesses facere illud cum uno post aliud, donec abscindatur sanguis.	Therefore, do not cease to do it with one after another, until the blood is cut off.
Et caue, ne comburas neruum qui est illic, et accidat super infirmum malicia alia.	And beware that you do not burn the nerve that is there, and another evil occurrence happens on the patient.
Et scias, quod quando ex arteria fluit sanguis, tunc non est possibile abscindere ipsum: praecipue quaudo arteria est magna, nisi cum uno quatuor modorum.	And know that when blood flows from the artery, then it is not possible to cut it off: especially if the artery is great, unless by one of four methods.
Aut cum cauterio, sicut diximus.	Or with a cautery, as we said.
Aut cum extractione, quando non est extracta.	Or with an extraction, when it is not extracted.
Nam quando extrahitur, contrahuntur extremitates eius, et abscinditur sanguis.	For when it is drawn out, its ends are contracted and the blood is cut off.
Aut ligetur cum filo ligatione forti.	Or it should be tied with a strong binding thread.
Aut ponantur super ipsum medicinae de proprietate, quarum est abscindere sanguinem, et stringatur cum puluinari constrictione decenti.	Or medicinal substances of the kind that stop bleeding should be placed on it and tightened with a decent compression.
Qui autem administrat abscisionem eius cum ligamento, et strictura cum panno, aut positione rerum comburentium, et similium, non confert ei penitus, nisi raro.	But whoever performs the removal of it with a binding and compression with a cloth, or positioning of things that constrict, and similar things, does not benefit it greatly, unless rarely.
Si autem accidat alicui illud, et non sit ei praesens medicus, neque medicina: tunc incipiat cum positione digiti indicis super orificium uenae ipsius, sicut narrauimus, et constrictione eius ualde, donec obsessus sit sanguis a superiori parte uulneris, et super arteriam.	If it happens to someone and there is no doctor present nor medicine: then he should begin by placing his index finger over the opening of the vein itself, as we have said, and constricting it very much, until the blood is blocked on the superior part of the wound, and above the artery.
Et digitus non remoueatur, desuper ipsum cum aqua frigida uehementis frigoris semper, donec congeletur sanguis, et ingrossetur, et abscindatur.	And the finger should not be removed from above it with cold water of great coldness always, until the blood congeals and thickens and is cut off.
Et interim consideret in eo, quid indiget ex cauterio, aut ex medicina.	And meanwhile he should consider what treatment by cautery or medicine it needs.

¶ De Incisione, Perforatione, et Phlebotomia in uulneribus, et his similibus.	About incising, perforating, and bloodletting in wounds and similar things.
Iam Diximus in Capitulo Primo, omnem aegritudinem in qua conueniens est cum igne cauterium et medicina comburente, et occasiones eius, ipsius caussas, et instrumenta eius, et formas cauteriorum.	We have already spoken in the first chapter about every affliction which is suitable for burning with a caustic and medicine consuming fire, and its occasions, causes, instruments, and forms of cauterizations.
Et posui illic capitula a uertice usque ad pedem.	And I have placed the chapters there from top to bottom.
Et ego procedam in hoc capitulo illa eadem uia: ut alleuietur super quaerentem quaesitum eius.	And I will proceed in this chapter by the same path, so that what is sought may be found for one seeking it.
Et antequam incipiam illud, oportet ut addiscatis o filii, quod in hoc capitulo est ex terrore illud quod est in capitulo primo de cauterizatione.	And before I begin that, it is necessary for you, my children, to learn what is in this chapter, which is a terror, just as it was in the first chapter on cauterization.
Et propter illud oportet, ut sit cautela in eo uehementior, quoniam in operatione quae est in hoc capitulo, multotiens cadit euacuatio cum sanguine, cum quo stat uita apud apertionem uenae, aut incisionem super apostema, aut apertionem exiturae, aut curationem uulneris, aut extractionem sagittae, aut incisionem super lapidem, et illis similia: ex quibus omnibus associatur tremor, et timor, et cadit in pluribus eorum mors.	And because of this, it is necessary to be all the more cautious, since in the operation that is in this chapter, evacuation often occurs with blood, which, when it flows from an open vein, or incision over a suppurating wound, or opening of an exit wound, or cure of a wound, or extraction of an arrow, or incision over a stone, and similar things: from all these, fear is associated, and terror falls upon many of them, leading to death.
Et ego moneo uos, ne cadat super uos illud in quo est haesitatio, nam quandoque cadunt ad uos in hac arte modi hominum cum modis infirmitatum.	And I warn you, lest that which is uncertain fall upon you, for sometimes such people as are feeble-minded and weak in this art come to you.
Ex eis enim est qui irascitur cum aegritudine sua, et est leuis apud eum mors: propter uehementiam eius quod inuenit ex infirmitate sua et longitudine eius maliciei.	For one of them is the man who grows angry at his own affliction, and death is light to him because of the intensity of his anger which he finds from his own weakness and the length of his wickedness.
Et cum aegritudine est ex timore quod significat mortem.	And with affliction it is from fear that signifies death.
Et ex eis est, qui dat tibicensum suum, et ditat te cum eo, sperans sanitatem, et aegritudo eius est perniciosa.	And one of them is the man who gives his doctor, and trusts in him with his illness, hoping for recovery, and his affliction is deadly.
Non ergo oportet ut consentiatis ei qui uenit ad uos ex eis, cuius modus est talis.	Therefore, it is not fitting that you should agree with one who comes to you from among them, whose manner is such.
Et sit cautela uestra uehementior, quam cupiditas et uestra rapacitas.	And let your caution be more vehement than your desire and avarice.
Et non praesumatis super aliquid ex illo, nisi post scientiam certam, quae uerificat apud uos illud ad quod peruenit successio laudabilis.	And do not presume over anything from that, unless after certain knowledge has been verified in you, which confirms what it achieved through praiseworthy succession.
Et utimini in curatione omnium infirmorum uestrorum, prognosticatione et indicatione de eo ad quod conuenienter sit salus.	And use prognosis and indication for the cure of all your patients, so that salvation may be suitable.
In illo namque est uobis adiutorium super acquisitionem famae et gloriae, et memoriae et laudis.	For in him there is help to you for acquiring fame and glory, and memory and praise.
Inspiret uobis Deus o filii, intellectum suum, et non auferat uobis directionem et inspirationem: quoniam illud est in manu eius.	May God inspire you, O sons, with His own understanding, and not take away from you guidance and inspiration; for it is in His hand.
Et ego quidem ordinaui hoc Capitulum distinguendo per capitula, secundum quod praecessit in capitulo Cauterii, a ceruice usque ad pedes: ut alleuietur uobis quaesitum quod uultis ex eo, et quo indigetis.	And I indeed have arranged this Chapter by dividing it into sections, just as it preceded in the chapter on Caustics, from head to feet: so that what you seek may be alleviated to you and what you need.
¶ De curatione Aquae quae aggregatur in capitibus puerorum.	On the Cure of Water which accumulates in the Heads of Boys.
Caput I.	Book One.
Scias, quod haec infirmitas multotiens accidit pueris apud partum: aut quando stringit obstetrix caput pueri absque leuitate.	Know that this weakness often occurs in boys at birth: or when the afterbirth is tightly wrapped around the boy's head without gentleness.
Et quandeque accidit etiam ex caussa occulta quae non scitur.	And sometimes it happens even due to a hidden cause that is unknown.
Et ego quidem non uidi hanc aegritudinem in aliis quam in pueris: et ad omnem quem ex eis uidi properauit mors: propter illud ergo uisum est mihi dimittere operationem in ea.	And I indeed have not seen this affliction in anyone except in boys: and all of them whom I saw succumbed to death because of it. Therefore it seemed to me that I should abandon the treatment for it.
Et ego quidem uidi ex eis puerum, cuius caput impletum erat aqua, et caput magnificabatur in omni die, donec non poterat sedere super seipsum, propter magnitudinem capitis sui: et humiditas augmentata fuit, donec mortuus est.	And I indeed saw one of them, a boy whose head was filled with water, and his head was swelling every day until he could no longer sit up due to the magnitude of his own head; and the moisture increased until he died.
Et haec quidem humiditas, aut aggregatur inter cutem et os: aut aggregatur sub osse super sifac.	And this moisture either accumulates between the skin and mouth: or it accumulates beneath the bone above the sphenoid.
Et operatio in illo, si est humiditas inter cutem et os, et apostema est paruum, tunc oportet ut findas in medio capitis fissura una in latitudine: et sit longitudo fissurae quasi duo nodi, donec currat humiditas.	And the operation in him, if there is moisture between the skin and mouth, and an abscess is small, then it is necessary to make a incision in the middle of the head, one cut in breadth: and let the length of the incision be almost two knots, until the moisture flows.
Et haec est forma spatumilis.	And this is the form of a spatula.
Si ergo humiditas est magis augmentata, et apostema est maius, tunc pone eas duas fissuras, secundum formam hanc.	So if moisture is greatly increased and an abscess is larger, then place these two incisions according to this form.
Et si humiditas est sub osse, et signum eius est, quod uides commissuras capitis apertas ab omni parte: et aqua deprimitur quando comprimis eam manu tua ad interiora, et non occultatur tibi illud: tunc oportet ut findas in medio capitis tribus fissuris, secundum hunc modum.	And if moisture is under the bone, and its sign is that you see the commissures of the head open on every part: and water is pressed down when you compress it with your hand to the interior, and it does not hide from you: then it is necessary to make incisions in the middle of the head three times, according to this manner.
Et post incisionem extrahe humiditatem totam.	And after making the incision, remove the moisture entirely.
Deinde stringe fissuras cum pannis et puluillis.	Then tie the incisions with cloths and poultices.
Deinde embroca illud desuper cum uino et oleo usque ad diem quintum.	Then pack that over it with wine and oil up to the fifth day.
Deinde solue ligamentum, et cura uulnus cum tentis, et unguentis.	Then loosen the bandage, and care for the wound with threads and ointments.
Et non dimittas stringere caput cum aequalitate.	And do not stop binding the head evenly.
Et ciba infirmum omni cibo sicco paucae humiditatis, usquequo confortetur membrum, et sanetur.	And feed the sick person with all dry food and little moisture, until the limb is comforted and healed.
Et modus alius incisionis est, ut consideres ubi apparet magnitudo apostematis, et collectio aquae.	And another method of incision is, to consider where the magnitude of the abscess appears, and the collection of water.
Quoniam quandoque est in occipitio plus, aut in sincipite, aut in dextra, aut in sinistra.	Because sometimes it is more on the back of the head, or on the forehead, or on the right side, or on the left.
Ascende ergo cum incisione ubi apparet tibi apostema et impletio aquae: et scinde illud secundum quod tibi possibile est.	So climb up with an incision where you see the abscess and filling of water, and cut it as far as is possible for you.
Et obserua, ne incidas arteriam, et accidat fluxus sanguinis, et moriatur infirmus ex illo fluxu cum euacuatione humiditatis.	And beware that you do not cut the artery, and a flow of blood occurs, and the sick person dies from that flow with the evacuation of moisture.
¶ De incisione Arteriarum quae sunt post aures.	De incisione Arteriarum quae sunt post aures.
Caput II.	Caput II.
Quando accidunt alicui catarri ad oculos, aut ad pectus, et antiquatur illud, et non confert curatio medicinarum: tunc magis ultima curatio est in illo, incisio harum duarum arteriarum.	When anyone suffers from cataracts to the eyes or to the chest, and it becomes old and does not improve with medical treatment: then the final cure for this is the incision of these two arteries.
Oportet ergo quando uis incidere eas, ut radat infirmus caput suum.	Therefore it is necessary when you wish to cut them, that the patient should place his head back.
Deinde frica locum cum panno aspero, ut appareant arteriae.	Then prepare a spot with a rough cloth, so that the arteries may be visible.
Deinde stringat infirmus collum suum, cum quolibet panno suo.	Then the patient should tie his neck with any of his own cloths.
Deinde considera, ubi pulset uena.	Then observe where the pulse beats in the vein.
Et loca utriusque sunt loca quae sunt post aures depressa: et raro occultatur, nisi in quibusdam hominibus.	And the places are those which are behind the ears, depressed; and it is rarely hidden, except in certain people.
Deinde signa cum encaustro super utraque: et incide utramque cum spatumili utrimque acuro, incisione perueniente ad os: et fiat illud per latitudinem capitis.	Then mark both with encaustic above each one; and cut both with a spatula on either side to the point of being able to reach the mouth, and make it along the width of the head.
Et si uis, intromitte spatumile sub arteria, et incide eam ad superiora cum incisione.	And if you wish, insert the spatula under the artery, and cut it upwards with the incision.
Et sit longitudo incisionis quasi duo digiti iuncti.	And let the length of the incision be almost two joined fingers.
Nam quando inciditur uena, egreditur sanguis egressione pulsatili, qui salit ad interiora saltu frequenti.	For when the vein is cut, blood flows out with a pulsating gush, which jumps to the inside with frequent leaps.
Si autem arteria non apparet sensui, tunc oportet ut mensures ab aure quantitatem spacii trium digitorum.	But if the artery does not appear to the sense, then it is necessary to measure from the ear a space of three fingerbreadths.
Deinde signa cum encaustro, et finde usque ad os.	Then mark with encaustic and find your way up to the mouth.
Et illud quod oportet emittere ex sanguine, est VI uncia et fortasse emittis ex eo plus, aut minus.	And that which is necessary to be emitted from blood is six ounces, and perhaps you may emit more or less from it.
Totum illud secundum quantitatem quae apparet tibi ex uirute infirmi et repletione arteriae eius.	The whole of that according to the quantity which appears to you from the virility of the patient and the filling of his artery.
Deinde considera ad uulnus.	Then examine the wound.
Tunc si remanet ad os ex sifac aliquid, tunc incide illud, ut non accidat apostema calidum: tunc stringe uulnus cum liciniis ex panno lini.	Then if anything remains at the mouth from the flow, then cut it off so that a warm abscess does not occur; then bind the wound with linen cloths.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then care for him with ointment until he is healed.
¶ De extractione arteriarum, quae sunt in timporibus.	Of the Extraction of Arteries which are in Temporal Regions.
Caput III.	Chapter III.
Quando accidit homini hemicranea antiqua, aut catarri acuti propter humiditates acrimoniales, et caliditate in lacertis timporum, aut soda antiqua, uehemens, et similia illis: et medicatur cum modis curationis medicinae, et non confert illud: tunc experti sumus in his aegritudinibus extractionem arteriarum ex timporibus, aut cauterizationem earum, sicut narrauimus.	When an old hemicrania or acute catarrah occurs in a person due to bitter humors and heat in the temporal limbs, or ancient ulcers, swollen, and similar ones: and it is treated with modes of medical cure, and not by this means: then we are experienced in these afflictions with the extraction of arteries from the temporal regions, or their cauterization, as we have described.
Et modus operationis in extractione earum, est, ut radat infirmus pilos qui sunt in timporibus, et intendat ad arteriam apparentem in timpore.	And the method of the operation for extracting them is, that the patient should shave off the hairs which are on the temporal regions, and direct himself towards the artery appearing in the temple.
Ipsa namque ostenditur tibi ex pulsu suo, et raro occultatur nisi in paucis hominibus, aut uehementia frigoris.	For it is shown to you by its pulse, and rarely hidden unless in a few people or by excessive cold.
Quod si occultatur tibi, tunc stringat infirmus caput suum cum quolibet panno suo: deinde frica locum cum panno aspero.	For if it is hidden from you, then the patient should tie his head with any of his cloths: afterwards, he should rub the spot with a rough cloth.
Aut uapora locum cum aqua calida, donec appareat tibi apparitione manifesta.	Or he should apply a poultice to the place with warm water, until it appears to you in manifest appearance.
Deinde accipe spatumile, quod paulo ante formaui.	Then take the spatula, which I shaped a little while ago.
Deinde excoria cum eo cutem cum facilitate, donec peruenias ad arteriam.	Then scrape with it the skin with ease until you reach the artery.
Deinde proiice in eam uncinum, et extrahe eam ad superiora, donec extrahas eam ex cute, et facias eam euadere ex tunicis quae sunt sub ea ab omni parte.	Then insert the hook into it and pull it out upwards until you pull it out of the skin and make it pass through all the tunics which are underneath it from every part.
Si autem arteria est subtilis: tunc inuolue eam cum extremitate uncini.	If however the artery is slender, then wrap it around with the end of the hook.
Deinde incide ex ea partem secundum quantitatem qua elongentur extremitates eius, et contrahantur, et non accidat fluxus sanguinis.	Then cut from it a portion according to the length by which its ends are extended and contracted, and that no bleeding of blood may occur.
Nam si non inciditur, et si non abscinditur, non ascendit sanguis penitus.	For if it is not cut and not severed, the blood will not rise deeply.
Deinde euacua ex sanguine ana VI unci, usque ad .III.	Then remove from the blood six unciae up to three.
Quod si arteria est magna: tunc oportet ut liges eam in duobus locis ex filo duplo, forti, ex serico: aut ex chordis alhohod, ut non properet ad ipsam putrefactio ante consolidationem uulneris, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	For if the artery is large, then it is necessary to tie it in two places with a double thread of strong silk or from the intestines of an ass, so that it may not proceed to putrefaction before the wound is consolidated and bleeding occurs.
Deinde incide superfluitatem, quae est inter duo ligamenta.	Then cut away the excess which is between two ligaments.
Fac illud in illa hora, aut post horam aliam.	Do that at that hour or after another hour.
Et si uis, cauteriza eam cauterio usque ad os, cum cauterio cultellari: donec incidantur extremitates eius, et stabit loco eiusdem operis.	And if you wish, cauterize it with a cauterizing knife up to the bone, until the ends of it are cut and it remains in its place as part of the same operation.
Et est melius opus, nisi si infirmus habet febrem, autest calefactae complexionis.	And it is a better operation, unless the patient has a fever or a warm complexion.
Quoniam cauterium est ex eis, quae iuuant ad finiendas humiditates.	Because the cautery is one of those things that help to dry up humors.
Ergo est melius iuuamentum.	Therefore it is a better remedy.
Et oportet post extractionem arteriarum, ut impleatur locus cotto antiquo: et ponantur super ipsum puluilli decenter facti.	And after the removal of arteries, the location should be filled with old boiled cloth, and small lint pillows should be placed on top.
Et post solutionem curetur cum medicinis siccis, quae faciunt nasci carnem, et cum liciniis, donec sanetur.	And after the wound has been cleansed, it should be treated with dry medicines that cause flesh to grow and with lint, until it is healed.
Quod si interim dum operaris accidit fluxus sanguinis ex arteria, tunc propera ad abscindendum eum cum cauterio, aut ut impleas locum cum zegi: et stringe manum tuam, donec abscindatur sanguis.	Which if a bleeding occurs from an artery while you are operating, then hurry to stop it with a cautery or by filling the location with wool: and tie your hand, until the blood is stopped.
Quod si nihil ex illis est tibi praesens, tunc pone super locum digitum tuum, donec congeletur sanguis.	Which if none of those things are present to you, then place your finger on the location until the blood coagulates.
Et embroca locum cum aqua uehementis frigoris, donec quiescat acuitas, et stringatur secundum quod oportet.	And moisten the location with water of very cold heat, until the sharpness ceases and is bound as needed.
Et ex eo quod est leuius et facilius extractione arteriae, est, ut cauterizes uenam cum hoc cauterio habente duos cultellos: sitque acuitas duorum cultellorum similis almagdatem.	And because it is easier and less difficult to extract an artery, it is that you should cauterize the vein with this cautery having two knives: let the sharpness of the two knives be like a well-cut thread.
Verumtamen sunt multo minoris acuitatis, quam duo cultelli.	However they are much less sharp than two knives.
Quoniam si sunt acutae, sicut duo cultelli, properat utrisque frigus: et non incidunt carnem cum uelocitate.	Because if they are as sharp as two knives, the cold will rush to both and not cut through the flesh quickly enough.
Cum ergo in eis est aliquantulum grossitudinis, tenetur in eis calor ignis, et abscinditur caro uelociter: cum hoc ergo opus est melius omni opere, et leuius, et facilius.	Therefore when there is a certain amount of coarseness in them, the heat of fire is held within them, and the flesh is cut quickly; with this therefore the work is better than any other, and easier.
Et sit spacium quod est inter duos cultellos quantitas grossitudinis digiti, postquam tu signas duo loca cum encaustro: et depone utrosque ignitos ualde, donec perueniant ad os, et incidant uenam in duobus locis: ut elongetur quod est inter extremitates eius.	And make a space which is between the two knives the thickness of a finger, after you mark two places with encaustic: and place both of them very hot, until they reach the mouth, and cut the vein in two places: so that what is between its extremities is separated.
Nam non consolidantur cum hoc cauterio penitus.	For they are not thoroughly consolidated with this cauterization.
Et haec est forma cauterii.	And this is the form of the cauterization.
¶ De cura cursus lachrymarum acutarum assiduarum ab oculis.	On the treatment of constant and sharp eye discharges from the eyes.
Caput IIII.	Book IV Chapter 4
Quando sunt lachrymae assiduae, et est cursus earum ex uenis, quae sunt super craneum capitis exterius: et non confert in eis aliquid curationis medicinae cum medicinis, et uides faciem infirmi iam rubere, et sentit in fronte sua deambulationem, sicut est deambulatio formicarum: et oculi eius sunt extenuati, humidi, ita quod iam corrosi sunt pili eorum cum corrosione: et calefactae sunt palpebrae eius ex acuitate lachrymarum: tunc antiqui indiguerunt in curatione earum hac operatione, et denominauerunt eam curationem, cum Ense.	When there are constant discharges and the flow of them is from the veins which are above the outer surface of the head: and nothing contributes to their healing with medicines, and you see the sick person's face already reddening, and he feels a walking sensation in his forehead, just like the marching of ants: and his eyes are worn out, damp, so that their hairs have already been corroded along with the corrosion: and his eyelids have been heated up by the sharpness of the discharges: then the ancients had to resort to this treatment, and they called it a cure with forceps.
Et est, ut praecipias infirmo radere pilos qui sunt in fronte sua.	And so you should have the sick person shave the hairs that are on his forehead.
Deinde incide in fronte tres fissuras aequedistantes secundum longitudinem frontis: et sit longitudo fissurae quasi duo digiti, et fissura una sit aequedistans longitudini nasi in medio frontis, et secunda secundum longitudinem parumper a motu lacertorum, et tertia a parte altera: et caue ab incisione arteriarum quae sunt in duobus lateribus: et elonga manum tuam a continuatione duarum mandibularum, et sit spacium omnis incisionis quantitas trium digitorum coniunctorum: et sit tibi frustum spongiae praeparatum, aut panni siccati multi, cum quibus exsicces sanguinem.	Then make three incisions in the forehead, equidistant from each other according to the length of the forehead: and let the length of the incision be almost two fingers long, and one incision be equidistant from the middle of the nose on the forehead, and the second according to the length a little bit away from the movement of the arms, and the third on the other side: and beware of cutting the arteries which are in both sides: and extend your hand from the continuation of the two jawbones, and let there be space for all the incision, the quantity of three connected fingers: and have prepared a sponge fragment or many pieces of dry cloth with which to absorb the blood.
Deinde intromitte spatumile duarum acutarum extremitatum, cuius mox sequens est forma.	Then insert the spatula of two sharp extremities, whose form follows next.
Ab incisione quae est a parte timporis, usque ad incisionem secundam: et excoria cum eo totam cutem, quae est inter duas incisiones, cum sifac, quod est super os.	From the incision that is from the part of the temple, up to the second incision: and remove with it all the skin which is between two incisions, together with the saphenous vein that is above the bone.
Deinde fac illud etiam ab incisione media usque ad incisionem secundam.	Then make also from the middle incision up to the second incision.
Deinde extrahe hoc spatumile, et intromitte in incisionem primam iterum instrumentum aliud, quod nominatur cultellare acutum, ab una parte lene, non acutum ab altera parte.	Then withdraw this spatula and insert another instrument into the first incision again, which is called a sharp scalpel, blunt on one side and not sharp on the other.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its shape.
Et pone latus eius acutum uersus carnem annexam cum cute, et latus eius lene uersus os: et impelle ipsum, donec perueniat ad fissuram mediam: et abscinde cum eo omnia uasa, quae descendunt a capite ad oculos: praeter quod continuetur incisio usque ad illud quod apparet de cute.	And place the sharp side of it towards the attached flesh with the skin, and the blunt side towards the bone; and push it until it reaches the middle cleft: and cut with it all the vessels that descend from the head to the eyes: except for what is contained in the incision up to what appears on the skin.
Deinde fac illud in fissura media usque ad fissuram aliam.	Then do this in the middle cleft up to another cleft.
Et postquam currit ex sanguine quantitas aequalis, exprime loca ex frustis sanguinis coagulati.	And after an equal amount of blood has flowed out, express the areas from the clot of congealed blood.
Deinde pone in omnem fissuram licinium ex cotto ueteri, et pone super eos puluillos imbibitos in uino, et oleo, aut aceto.	Then place linseed oil from old bread into every cleft, and put over them poultices soaked in wine, oil, or vinegar.
Et uide ut non accidat apostema calidum.	And take care that no hot abscess occurs.
Et in die tertia solue ligamentum, et administra infusionem multam cum aqua tepida.	And on the third day dissolve the bandage and administer a great infusion with warm water.
Deinde cura illud ex unguento basilicon, et reliquis quibus curantur uulnera: usquequo sanetur.	Then take care of that with basilicon ointment and other remedies with which wounds are treated until it is healed.
¶ De cura lachrymarum acutarum et catarrorum ad oculos ex interioribus capitis.	Of the cure for sharp lachrymation and catarrh affecting the eyes from internal head causes.
Caput V.	V.
Quando accidunt alicui catarri acuti, acres, assidui: et uides oculos eius extenuatos, paruos, et iam debilitatus est aspectus eorum: et palpebrae ulceratae, et cadunt pili ex eis, et in profundo capitis est dolor acutus, laedens, et sternutatio consequens: tunc sume ex istis accidentibus, quod illae materiae, et catarri non ueniunt, nisi ex uenis multis.	When sharp and constant catarrh occurs to someone, and you see their eyes are worn out, small, and already weakened in appearance: and the eyelids are ulcerated, and hair falls from them, and there is a sharp pain deep in the head, hurting, and coughing follows; then take note of these accidents, that those materials do not come unless from many veins.
Et melior curatio in eis est haec.	And the better cure for them is this.
Et est, ut praecipias infirmo radere frontem suam.	And it is, that you should order the sick person to shave his forehead.
Deinde incide in eam fissuram unam in medio frontis, aut alterius parumper per latitudinem, et incipe cum fissura a timpore sinistro ad timpus dextrum: et sit incisio usque ad os: et elonga manum tuam a lacertis timporum, qui mouentur apud masticationem: donec quando detegitur os: et exsiccabis totum sanguinem cum spongia.	Then cut one incision in the middle of the forehead, or on either side for a short distance, and begin with the incision from the left time to the right: and let the incision be up to the bone; and stretch out your hand from the temples which move during mastication: until when the bone is exposed; and dry all the blood with a sponge.
Tunc separa inter duo labia fissurae cum cotto ueteri, aut cum liciniis ex lino.	Then separate the two lips of the incision with a warm cloth, or with linen strips.
Deinde stringe desuper cum puluillis: et imbibe puluillos cum uino et oleo, ut non accidat apostema calidum.	Then bind it above with poultices: and soak the poultices with wine and oil, so that no hot abscess may occur.
Et quando soluis illud, et uides quod apostema calidum iam imminuitur: tunc oportet ut frices os, donec incipiat in eo nasci caro.	And when you dissolve that and see that the hot abscess is already subsiding: then it is necessary to burn the bone, until flesh begins to grow in it.
Deinde cura ipsum cum regimine exiccatiuo quod facit nasci carnem: sicut si accipias ex farina tritici partes duas, et ex colophonia quatuor partes: et praepares ex eis emplastrum, et administretur ad natiuitatem carnis in istis uulneribus.	Then care for it with a regimen of drying that makes flesh grow: just as if you were to take two parts from wheat flour and four parts from colophony: and prepare an ointment from them, and administer it to the birth of flesh in these wounds.
¶ De cura eius quod cadit in Aurem.	Of the Cure for What Falls on the Ear.
Caput VI.	Chapter VI.
Omne Quod in Aurem cadit, est una quatuor specierum: aut lapis mineralis, aut simile lapidi, sicut ferrum, et uitrum: aut est ex planta, sicut est cicer, et fabae: aut est res fluxibilis, sicut aqua, et acetum, et eis similia: aut aliquod animal.	All that falls on the ear is one of four kinds: either a mineral stone, or like a stone, such as iron and glass; or it is from a plant, such as chickpeas and beans; or it is a fluid substance, such as water, vinegar, and things similar to them; or some animal.
Quando ergo cadit in aurem lapis, aut genus lapidis ex eis quae non adduntur, neque crescunt in aure, expone Aurem soli: si ergo uides lapidem, tunc distilla in Aurem aliquid ex oleo uiolato, aut sisamino.	When therefore a stone falls on the ear, or one of those kinds that do not accumulate and do not grow in the ear, expose the Ear alone. If however you see a stone, then pour something from violet oil or sesame oil into the Ear.
Deinde administra extractionem eius, et fac sternutare cum condisi, et opila nares apud aduentum sternutationis, postquam tu ponis in circumitu auris frusta ex pannis, aut lana, et extendis aurem ad superiora.	Then administer the extraction of it, and make him sneeze with you, and block his nostrils at the approach of the sneezing, after you put strips of cloth or wool around his ear, and stretch his ear upwards.
Multotiens enim egreditur cum hac cura.	For many times it goes out with this treatment.
Si autem non egreditur, tunc administra extractionem eius cum Gesti, id est, Pizigarolis subtilibus: cuius forma est haec.	But if it does not go out, then administer the extraction of it with Gesti, that is, Pizigarolis subtle ones: whose form is this.
Si ergo egreditur cum gesti, est bonum.	So if it goes out with the Gesti, it is good.
Et si non, tunc administra extractionem eius cum uncino caeco subtili paucae duplicationis.	And if not, then administer the extraction of it with a blind and subtle forceps for a few doublings.
Si ergo non egreditur per illud, tunc fac cannulam ex aere, et intromitte extremitatem cannulae in foramen auris multum, et opila quod est in circumitu cannulae cum caera mollificata cum oleo, ut non sit uento uia nisi cannulae: deinde extrahe cum uento tuo attractione forti.	And if it does not go out through that, then make a pipe of air, and insert the end of the pipe into the ear canal very much, and block what is around the pipe with wax softened with oil, so that there will be no way except the pipe: then draw it out with your breath attraction strong.
Multotiens enim egreditur cum eo quod narrauimus.	For many times it goes out with that which we narrated.
Si autem non egreditur hoc modo: tunc accipe ex helkalimbat, aut ex uisco, id est, gluten praeparato, cum quo capiuntur aues, rem modicam: et pone ipsum in extremitate radii postquam tu inuoluis super eam cotum decenter positum: deinde intromitte ipsum in foramen auris cum facilitate, postquam tu exiccas aurem ab humiditate.	But if it does not go out this way: then take a small amount of helkalimbat or veso, that is, prepared glue with which birds are caught: and place it at the end of the radius after you have wrapped around it a cord decently placed: then insert it into the ear canal with ease, after you have dried the ear from moisture.
Si ergo non egreditur cum omnibus quae narrauimus, tunc propera ad scindendum, antequam accidat apostema calidum, aut spasmus.	And if it does not go out with all that we narrated, then hasten to cut, before a warm abscess or spasms occur.
Et modus fissurae est, ut phlebotomes infirmum in primis in cephalica: et extrahe ei ex sanguine secundum mensuram uirtutis eius.	And the method of cutting is, as phlebotomists cut the weak first in the head: and draw out from him a measure of his strength.
Deinde fac sedere infirmum inter manus tuas, et conuerte aurem eius ad superiora, et finde fissuram paruam in radice auris apud adipem eius in loco depresso ipsi: et sit fissura lunaris figurae, donec peruenias ad lapidem: deinde aufer eum cum eo, quod est tibi possibile ex instrumentis.	Then make the infirm person sit between your hands, and turn his ear upwards, and find a small incision in the root of the ear at the fatty part in a depressed place on him: and let the incision be of a lunar figure, until you reach the bone: then take it away with whatever is possible from your instruments.
Deinde sue fissuram ab hora tua cum uelocitate, et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	Then you should cut open the wound as soon as possible with speed and care it until it heals.
Quod si res cadens in aurem est ex uno granorum, quae crescunt, et inflantur: tunc administra extractionem eius.	If something falls into the ear, such as a grain that grows and swells: then perform its extraction.
Si autem non obedit tibi ad exitum, tunc accipe spatumile tenue, subtile, secundum hanc formam.	But if it does not obey you at the exit, then take a thin, fine forceps, according to this shape.
Et administra cum eo abscisionem illius speciei ex granis, quae cadunt in aurem, et non facias illud, quando tu cogitas, quod illud granum iam humectatum est per uaporem auris, donec ponis ipsum frusta multa: deinde extrahe ea cum uncinis, aut cum gesti subtili, aut cum suctione, sicut diximus, nam extractio eius alleuiatur.	And administer with it the cutting off of that kind of grain which falls into the ear, and do not do what you think when you see that grain is already moistened by the vapor of the ear, until you have placed many plugs: then extract it with a hook or with a fine gauze or with suction, as we said, for the extraction of it is eased.
In aqua autem quae ingreditur in aurem, oportet ut utatur infirmus sternutatione cum condisi in primis: et iam impleuit aurem suam cum aliquanto cotto ueteri: et est iacens super illam aurem, in qua est aqua.	However, when water enters the ear, it is necessary for a weak person to use expectoration first, and then fill their own ear with some warm old oil; and they should be lying above that ear where there is water.
Si ergo egreditur per illud, est bonum.	If therefore it comes out through that, it is good.
Et si non: tunc accipe lapides multos, secundum longitudinem digiti, tenues, lenes, et calefac eos cum igne parumper, et intromittat infirmus ex eis unum in foramen auris suae: et saliat super pedem suum unum ex illa parte, et percutiat cum lapide alio super lapidem qui est in aure.	And if not: then take many small stones, according to the length of a finger, thin, soft, and warm them with fire for a little while; and the infirm person should insert one of them into the ear canal of their own ear; and let them step over one foot from that side, and strike with another stone on top of the stone which is in the ear.
Non ergo cesset facere illud cum lapide et lapide, donec egrediatur tota aqua.	And therefore do not cease to do that with stones and stones until all the water has gone out.
Et iam egreditur aqua ita, ut accipias ex parpyro, aut ex iunco unum, et intromittas extremitatem eius unam in aurem: et accendas extremitatem alteram cum igne, donec comburatur plurimum eius.	And now that the water has gone out, take a papyrus or a reed, and insert one end of it into the ear; and light up the other end with fire, until most of it is burned.
Deinde itera iuncum alium, et fac illud multotiens, donec egrediatur tota aqua: et extrahe ipsam cum cannula secundum quod praemissum est in lapide.	Then take another reed and do that many times, until all the water has gone out; and extract it with a cannula as was mentioned earlier.
In extractione autem animalis intrantis in eam, si est parui corporis, ut pulex, et ei simile, cura ipsum sicut dixi in diuisione.	In extracting an entering animal from it, if it is a small body like a flea and similar to it, cure it as I said in division.
Sed si est corporis magni, quod appareat sensui: tunc administra extractionem eius cum gesti, et uncinis: et res eius est facilior omnibus, quae tenentur in aure.	But if it is a large body that appears to the sense: then administer its extraction with gestures and hooks; and its result is easier for all those held in gold.
In extractione autem uermis generati in aure, quando curas eum cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et in tractatu distilationum, et non confert curatio tua: tunc oportet ut aspicias aurem in sole.	In extracting a generated worm from the ear, when you cure it with what we said in division and in the treatise on distillations, and your treatment does not bring results: then it is necessary to look at the ear in the sun.
Si ergo apparet illic aliquid ex uermibus, tunc extrahe illud cum gesti, aut cum uncinis subtilibus.	If therefore something appears there from worms, then extract that with gestures or with subtle hooks.
Si autem non apparet illic aliquid, tunc accipe cannulam, cuius haec est forma, stricta inferius, ampla superius: et intromitte extremitatem subtilem in aurem secundum quantitatem quod tolerat eam infirmus: deinde suge cum ea suctione forti.	But if nothing appears there, then take a cannula of this shape, narrowed below and broad above: and insert the thin end into the ear according to the amount that a sick person can tolerate it; then suck with a strong suction.
Fac illud multotiens, donec egrediantur omnes uermes.	Do that many times, until all the worms come out.
Si autem non obediunt tibi ad exitum, tunc opila circumitum cannulae cum caera, sicut dixi in lapide.	But if they do not obey you at the exit, then wrap a strip of caur around the cannula as I said in stone.
Quod si non egrediuntur cum eo quod diximus: tunc administra distillationes quas iam experti sunt antiqui in interfectione uermium: et inuenies illud in tractatu distillationum.	But if they do not come out with what we said, then administer the distillations which ancient people have tried in the destruction of worms; and you will find that in the treatise on distillations.
Et sit effusio tua qua effundis olea et medicinas in aurem cum hoc instrumento, cuius forma depicta est hic.	And let your flowing be as you flow oil and medicines into the ear with this instrument, whose shape is depicted here.
Sicut uides fac ipsum ex argento, aut aere, inferius strictum, in quo sit foramen paruum, amplum superius.	Just as you see it made of silver or air, narrowed below, with a small hole at the bottom and broad above.
Sit ergo ut impellens quod est in concauitate cannulae, sit ex aere decenter factum.	So let what is in the concavity of the cannula be made of air.
Et si uis, accipe radium, et inuolue in extremitate eius cottum inuolutione decenti: deinde proiice oleum, aut succum, aut quod uis ex istis medicinis in cannulam: et ipsa sit in aure: deinde intromitte radium cum cotto desuper, et exprime ipsum manu tua compressione temperata, donec impellatur oleum in concauitate auditus, et sentiat ipsum infirmus interius: et illud quod infunditur in aurem, sit iam calefactum cum igne parumper: et caue ne sit res quae distillatur in eam frigida ualde: medicinae enim non tolerant illud.	And if you wish, take a radium and wrap it with cotton wrapping decently around the end of it. Then pour oil, or sap, or what you like from those medicines into the cannula: and let it be in the ear: then insert the radium with the wrapped cotton on top, and express it by your hand compression tempered until the oil is forced out into the concavity of the hearing, and the sick person feels it inside: and that which is poured into the ear should already be warmed up a little with fire: and beware lest what distills into it be very cold; for medicines do not tolerate that.
¶ De cura opilationis accidentis Auri.	On the cure of accidental gold filling.
Caput VII.	Chapter VII.
Quandoque egrediuntur quidam infantes ex uentribus matrum suarum non perforati.	Sometimes certain infants emerge from their mothers' wombs unperforated.
Et iam accidit etiam quibusdam hominibus opilatio in meatu Auris a uulnere, aut carne nata in ea.	And it also happens to some people that gold filling occurs in the ear from a wound, or flesh born in it.
Et haec opilatio quandoque fit in profundo foraminis Auris, quam non consequitur uisus: et quandoque accidit ad exteriora foraminis parum, et consequitur eam uisus.	And this filling sometimes occurs in the deep recess of the ear, which is not visible; and sometimes it happens near the outer opening of the ear, and is visible.
Illa ergo quae accidit in profundo Auris, et quam non comprehendit aspectus, est in pluribus dispositionibus difficilis sanationis.	Therefore, that which occurs in the deep recess of the ear, and is not comprehended by sight, is often difficult to cure in many cases.
Et in illa quam consequitur uisus, oportet ut ponas Aurem infirmi in sole, et aspicias in ea: tunc si uides opilationem apparentem, aperi eam cum spatumili subtili, cuius forma est haec quae sequitur, sit extremitas eius in qua sit quaedam latitudo parua, cuius quaedam pars sit acuta: et reliquum spatumile sit duarum laterum lenium: ut non laedat aurem.	And in that which is visible, it is necessary to place the ear of the patient in the sun, and look at it: then if you see the filling appearing, open it with a small file having the following shape, with its end where there is some slight notch, one part being sharp: and the rest of the file should be two rounded sides so that it does not hurt the ear.
Si ergo opilatio est a carne nata in meatu auris: tunc tene eam cum uncino subtili, et incide eam cum facilitate uehementi, donec auferatur tota caro.	If the filling is from flesh born in the ear canal, then take it with a small hook and cut it with great ease until all the flesh is removed.
Quod si opilatio est in profundo auris: tunc accipe radium subtilem, lenem, et calefac ipsum cum igne parumper: deinde mitte ipsum in meatum auris.	What if the filling is in the deep ear canal? Then take a small, soft reed and warm it with fire for a little while: then put it into the ear canal.
Si ergo senseris opilationem cum eo, quod inuenit infirmus cum grauitate auditus, conare apertionem eius cum facilitate: et caue, ne uulneres neruos auris.	If you sense the filling with the patient who finds difficulty in hearing, try to open it with ease: and beware of not wounding the nerve of the ear.
Deinde pone in aurem licinium secundum quantitatem amplitudinis foraminis, quod inuoluisti in unguento aegyptio: fac illud aliquot diebus, donec sis securus de consolidatione uulneris.	Then put a linen cloth into the ear according to the size of the opening that you wrapped with Egyptian ointment; do this for several days until you are sure of the wound's consolidation.
Aut accipe licinium, et infunde ipsum in aqua rosata, et pulueriza super ipsum zegi tritum, et utere ipso.	Or take a linen cloth, and soak it in rose water; then powder the powdered bezoar on top of it, and use it.
Quod si uides aurem iam apostemari: tunc oportet ut extrahas licinium, et permittas ipsum cum licinio alio, quod inuolues in caeroto quod sit factum cum oleo rosato, donec sedetur apostema calidum: deinde cura ipsum usquequo sanetur.	If you see the ear already becoming inflamed: then it is necessary that you remove the ligature, and allow it to be tied with another ligature, which you should wrap in a cloth that has been made with rose oil, until the hot inflammation subsides: then care for it until it heals.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis: tunc submerge spongiam, aut pannos in aqua frigida, et pone super eam aurem: et utere reliqua curatione, quae abscindit fluxum sanguinis praedicta in tractatu distillationum.	But if bleeding occurs: then submerge a sponge or cloths in cold water, and place them on the ear: and use the remaining treatment that stops the flow of blood mentioned in the treatise on distillations.
¶ De cura Altheli palpebrarum.	Of the cure for Althaea's eyelids.
Caput VIII.	Chapter VIII.
Isti Althelil qui accidunt in Palpebris oculi, quandoque sunt humidi, et sunt sicci.	These Althelelia that occur on the eyelids of the eye are sometimes moist and sometimes dry.
Oportet ergo ut teneas eos cum tenaliis: aut cum uncino, et incidas eos cum spatumili a radicibus suis.	Therefore it is necessary to keep them with lint or with a forceps, and cut them away from their roots.
Deinde pone super loca zegi tritum.	Then place powdered zinc over the places.
Si autem ex eis fluat sanguis, tunc cauteriza eos cum cauterio lenticulari subtili.	But if blood flows from them, then cauterize them with a fine glass cauterizer.
Et cauterizare eos, est melius post incisionem.	And to cauterize them is better after the incision.
Multotiens enim redeunt quando remanet ex radicibus suis aliquid.	For indeed they often return when something remains from their roots.
Et quando cauterizantur cum igne, comburuntur illae radices, et non redeunt.	And when they are cauterized with fire, those roots are burned and do not return.
¶ De cura Grandinum palpebrarum oculi.	Of the cure for Granulation of eyelids of the eye.
Caput IX.	Chapter IX.
Multotiens accidit in palpebris aliquid quod assimilatur Crandini in fortitudine sua, et sua duricie, et propter illud nominatur Grando: et est aggregatio humiditatis grossae in palpebra superiore, et palpebra inferiore.	It often happens on the eyelids that something forms which is similar to Granulation in its strength and hardness, and because of this it is called Granum: and it is a concretion of thick moisture on the upper and lower eyelid.
Operatio ergo in eis est, ut consideres tunc, si est Grando procedens in eo, quod apparet de palpebra, et mouentur ad omnem partem, et res eius est facilis.	The operation therefore is to observe whether it is Granum growing out of the eyelid, which appears from the eyelid and moves to every direction, and its nature is easy.
Finde ergo super eam fissura per latitudinem.	Therefore find a slit above it across its width.
Deinde excoria eam ab omni parte cum facilitate, donec euadat.	Then strip it off from every part with ease until it comes out.
Deinde suspende eam cum uncino, et abscinde ipsam.	Then hang it up with a hook, and cut it off.
Si autem non praeparatur tibi abscisio eius, nisi postquam tu penetras palpebram cum incisione parumper, tunc nocet infirmo illud in aliquo.	But if it is not prepared for you to cut it off, unless after you have pierced the eyelid with a little incision, then that will harm the sick person in some way.
Quod si fissura est magna: tunc aggrega ipsam cum sutura: et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	But if it is a large wound: then gather it up with stitches and take care of it until it heals.
Et si est parua, non superueniet tibi malum ex ea.	And if it is small, no evil will come to you from it.
Vnguentum enim restaurat ipsam, et incarnat eam.	For ointment restores it and fleshes it out.
Et si grando est decliuis ad interiora auris uersus superficiem intrinsecam, tunc inuersa palpebram, et suspende grandinem cum uncino: praeter quod indigeas incisione, et preme eam ab omni parte.	And if the discharge is flowing downward from the interior of the ear towards the inner surface, then turn back the eyelid and hang the discharge with a hook: besides which you will need an incision, and press it off from every part.
Quod si elongatur palpebra per incisionem, non nocet illud in aliquo.	But if the eyelid is lengthened by incision, that will not harm it in any way.
Deinde ablue oculum post incisionem grandinis, cum aqua salsa: et cura locum cum eo quod incarnat, donec sanetur infirmus.	Then wash the eye after the incision of the discharge with salt water, and take care of the place with that which fleshes it out, until the sick person heals.
¶ De cura Axirnath palpebrarum.	Of the Treatment of Eyelid Swelling.
Caput X.	Chapter 10.
Axirnath est adeps qui generatur in tunicis palpebrae superioris: et plurimum quidem accidit illud pueris: et ipsum grauat oculos eorum, et accidunt eis catarri in matutinis, et non possunt intueri lumen solis, propterea, quod lachrymae properant ad eos, et propter illud uides eos discumbere super facies suas semper, et super eas dormiunt, et sunt palpebrae eorum sub superciliis humidae, quas iam cooperuit inflatio: et eminentia quidem Axirnath apparens est oculo, et quando tu premis locum cum digitis tuis, sentis Axirnath inter eos.	Axirnath is a fatness that is generated in the skin of the upper eyelid: and it indeed happens most to children: and it weighs down their eyes, and causes them to have cataracts in the mornings, and they are unable to look at the light of the sun, because tears flow towards them, and therefore you see them lying down on their faces all the time, and sleeping on them, and their eyelids are wet beneath their eyebrows, which is already covered with swelling: and indeed Axirnath appears as a prominence to the eye, and when you press the place with your fingers, you feel Axirnath between them.
Et modus operationis eius est, ut ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo.	And the method of its treatment is that the patient puts his head on your shoulder.
Deinde accipe pannum lini, et praepara in eo licinia, et fac ex illo licinio circulum secundum quantitatem quod continet Axirnath ab omni parte.	Then take a piece of linen cloth, and prepare it with linseed, and make from it a circle of lint according to the size that contains Axirnath all around.
Deinde pone eum super eam, et preme cum digitis tuis ab omni parte, ut aggregetur Axirnath in medio circuli.	Then place it on top and press with your fingers all around, so that the Axirnath may gather together in the middle of the circle.
Deinde finde in medio illius humiditatis cum spatumili incidente fissuras per latitudinem, et non sit fissura maior illa quae fit in phlebotomia in profundo.	Then find in the middle of that moisture with a spatula or something similar, making incisions through its breadth, and let no incision be deeper than those made for bloodletting.
Aut oportet ut findas cutem totam, donec peruenias ad Axirnath in pluribus enim dispositionibus procedit Axirnath ex fissura secundum formam frusti pinguedinis albae.	Or it is necessary to make the incision all the way through until you reach the Axirnath, for Axirnath proceeds from the incision in many forms according to the shape of white fatty residue.
Extrahe ergo eam cum panno, quem infiltrasti inter digitos tuos ad exteriora: et tu reuoluis manum tuam ad dextram et sinistram, donec dispergatur: et caue, ne addas in fissura, ut non peruenias cum spatumili ad oculum, et laedas eum.	Therefore, extract it with the cloth which you inserted between your fingers to the outside: and then turn your hand to the right and left until it is dispersed; and be careful not to add anything to the incision, lest you come with a spatula to the eye and hurt it.
Si autem non appareat tibi Axirnath in principio fissurae, tu addas in fissura parum cum facilitate, donec procedat Axirnath.	But if Axirnath does not appear to you at the beginning of the incision, you should add a little bit to the incision with ease until Axirnath proceeds.
Deinde extrahe eam, sicut diximus.	Then extract it as we said.
Deinde submerge pannos in aceto et aqua, et pone eos super locum, et stringe eum cum puluillis.	Then submerge the cloths in vinegar and water, and place them on the spot, and bind it with lint.
Et ex hominibus sunt qui terunt salem, et ponunt ipsum in concauitate fissurae, ut liquefiat quod remansit ex illa humiditate.	And there are people among men who scrape salt, and put it into the hollow of the incision, so that what remains of that moisture may melt.
Deinde cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	Then take care of it until it is healed.
Si autem accidat in loco apostema calidum, tune cura ipsum cum emplastris sedatiuis, donec sanetur.	But if an abscess arises hot in that place, then treat it with soothing poultices until it is healed.
¶ De modis Ataxmir oculi, id est, cum palpebra mollificatur oculi, unde fit ut rugetur sicut non debet.	On the modes of Ataxmir for the eye, that is, when the eyelid becomes soft and the eye swells up, so that it is rubbed as it should not be.
Caput XI.	Chapter 11.
Quando nascuntur in palpebris oculi pili additi praeter cursum sub pilis naturalibus, et antiquantur: tunc ipsi nocent oculo, et faciunt accidere modos aegritudinum, sicut lachrymas assiduas, et mollificationem palpebrarum, et albuginem, donec fit illud caussa destructionis oculi.	When hairs added to the eyelids of the eyes are born and grow beyond their natural course under the natural hairs, and become outdated: then they harm the eye, and cause various afflictions, such as constant tears, softening of the eyelids, and opacity, until it becomes a cause of destruction of the eye.
Et Ataxmir quidem oculi curatur secundum quatuor modos.	And indeed, ataxy of the eye is cured according to four modes.
Aut per cauterium cum igne.	Or by cauterization with fire.
Aut cum medicina acuta, secundum quod praemissum est in capitulo cauterii.	Or with sharp medicine, according to what has been said previously in the chapter on cauterization.
Aut curatur Ataxmir per incisionem et suturam.	Or ataxy of the eye is cured by incision and suture.
Aut per cannas, secundum quod ego dicam.	Or by probes, according to what I shall say.
Oportet ut ponas caput infirmi in sinu tuo.	You should place the head of the sick person on your shoulder.
Deinde conuerte palpebram oculi manu tua sinistra.	Then turn the eyelid of the eye with your left hand.
Si ergo conuertitur, bonum est.	If it turns, that is good.
Et si non: intromitte acum in eam, in qua sit filum ab inferiori parte palpebrae, et fac penetrare acum cum filo desuper, et sit illud prope pilos ipsos, id est, prope marginem palpebrae, in quo nascuntur pili: et trahe filum ad superiora cum palpebra, et conuerte eam cum radio.	And if not: insert the needle into it, at the point where a filament is from the lower part of the eyelid, and make the needle penetrate with the filament above, and let it be near the hairs themselves, that is, near the margin of the eyelid, where hairs are born; and pull the filament upwards with the eyelid, and turn it with the radius.
Deinde finde in interiori parte palpebrae sub pilis additis cum spatumili incidente a lachrymali maiore usque ad lachrymale minus.	Then find in the inner part of the eyelid, beneath the added hairs, with the spatula slipping from the larger tear duct to the smaller one.
Deinde extrahe filum, et pone sub palpebra puluillum paruum ex cotto, aut panno: deinde signa super palpebram cum encaustro, quod sit sicut figura folii myrti.	Then pull out the filament and place a small piece of cloth or linen under the eyelid; then mark on top of the eyelid with encaustic, so that it resembles the figure of a myrtle leaf.
Verumtamen oportet, ut fit figura secundum quantitatem et eleuationem palpebrae: quoniam iam diuersificatur illud in hominibus.	However, it is necessary that the figure be made according to the size and elevation of the eyelid; for this already differs among individuals.
Ex eis enim est, qui indiget ut incidatur ex palpebra quantitas magna, secundum quantitatem quae mollificatur a palpebra.	For some people need to have a large amount removed from the eyelid, according to the amount that is softened by the eyelid.
Deinde cum spatumili finde super duas lineas quas signasti, et incipe a lachrymali maiore usque ad lachrymale minus, et sit fissura una prope pilos naturales, sicut est grossitudo radii.	Then when you find the spatiumili above two lines which you marked, and begin from the larger tear duct to the smaller one, and let there be a gap one near natural hairs, as is the thickness of a radius.
Deinde intromitte uncinum in uno duorum angulorum cutis.	Then insert the forceps into one of the two corners of the skin.
Deinde excoria ipsam totam.	Then scrape off the whole thing.
Deinde aggrega cum sutura duo labia, cum acu et filo lana subtili: et absterge sanguinem, et fac adhaerere quod superfluit ex filis super duo supercilia, cum quibusdam rebus inuiscantibus, si uis facere illud: et si non, non cures.	Then gather the two lips together with a suture, using a fine needle and subtle wool thread; and wipe away the blood, and make what remains superfluous above the two eyebrows adhere, with certain things that are bound together, if you wish to do so: and if not, don't bother.
Deinde dimitte suturam et fila usque ad tres dies, aut quatuor: postea cura illud.	Then let the suture and threads remain until three or four days later: after that, take care of it.
Et si uis, dimitte uulnus absque sutura, et cura ipsum cum eo, quod exsiccat et constringit.	And if you wish, leave the wound open without a suture and take care of it in such a way that it dries out and tightens.
Nam palpebra eleuatur apud sigillationem uulneris et aggregationem eius: sed futura est melior.	For the eyelid is raised with respect to the cicatrization of the wound and its gathering: but it will be better in the future.
Hunc modum curandi Ataxmir docuerunt antiqui.	The ancient ones taught this method of treatment for ataxy.
Verumtamen in eo est sollicitudo super infirmum, et est ex bona operatione, et non est in eo timor.	However, there is concern for the weak one, and it comes from good practice, and there is no fear in this.
Et modus alius est in Ataxmir etiam: et est, ut signes super palpebram figuram, quae sit sicut figura folii myrti, sicut narrauimus.	And another method exists in Ataxmir as well: and it is, to mark signs on the eyelid in the shape of a figure like that of a myrtle leaf, just as we have narrated.
Deinde eleua palpebram cum tribus uncinis separatis, aut aggregatis, secundum formam hanc quae sequitur, deinde incide quod superfluit cum forficibus paruis, secundum hanc formam, cum aequalitate incisionis.	Then lift the eyelid with three separated or gathered forceps, according to this shape which follows, then cut away what is superfluous with small scissors, according to this shape, with equal cutting.
Si autem non est tibi possibile tenere uncinum, et non aequatur illud: tunc accipe acum in qua sit filum, et intromitte ipsum in medio figurae: et intromitte filum aliud prope lachrymale maius, et filum secundum prope lachrymale minus: et aggrega inter digitos tuos fila cum aequalitate.	But if it is not possible for you to hold the forceps and it does not remain equal: then take a needle with thread on it and insert it into the middle of the figure: and insert another thread near the larger tear duct, and a second thread near the smaller one: and gather the threads between your fingers with equality.
Deinde eleua manum tuam eleuatione aequali: et eleua cutem super quam est signatum cotum, sicut narrauimus.	Then lift up your hand with equal elevation; and lift up the skin over which is marked out a cut, just as we have narrated.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris cum sutura: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then bring together the two lips of the wound with a suture; and care for it until it heals.
Si uero accidat apostema apud incisionem tuam, aut fissuram tuam: seda illud apostema cum caeroto, et his similibus, ex unguentis sedantibus.	But if an abscess should occur at your incision or cut, treat it with a poultice and such-like ointments that soothe.
Et quandoque accidit palpebrae etiam, ut conuertantur pili eius.	And sometimes it happens that the eyelids also turn inwards, so that their hairs are inverted.
Oportet ergo ut utaris in ea quod diximus in incisione: sed sutura utrisque magis est artificialis.	Therefore you should use what we said about the incision, but with a suture more artificial to both.
¶ De cura Ataxmir cum cannis.	Of the Cure of an Abscess with Canes.
ET Est, ut conuertas palpebram, et scindas fissuram quae est deintus, secundum quod narraui.	And you should turn the eyelid and cut the cleft that is inside, as I have narrated.
Deinde arte fac duas cannas, aut duo ligna subtilia: quarum longitudo sit secundum longitudinem palpebrae, et latitudo earum sit minor latitudine spatumilis: et tu iam incidisti in extremitatibus utriusque ab utrisque partibus ubi tenes fila.	Then make two canes or two thin sticks: whose length is according to the length of the eyelid, and their width is less than the width of a little finger; and you have already cut them at both ends from both sides where you hold the threads.
Deinde aggrega utramque cum subtilitate super illud quod superfluit ex palpebra oculi, et stringe duas cannas ab utrisque partibus strictura forti, et dimitte eam diebus aliquot.	Then bring together both canes with subtlety over what protrudes from the eyelid of the eye, and tie the two canes tightly on both sides with a strong binding, and let it be for several days.
Cutis enim stricta morietur, et denigrabitur, et putrefiet, donec cadet per se.	For a tightened skin will die, and become blackened, and putrid, until it falls off by itself.
Si ergo tardatur, tunc incide eam cum forficibus.	If then it is delayed, then cut it with forceps.
Deinde cura eam, donec sanetur.	Then care for it until it heals.
Cum ergo consolidatur, eleuatur palpebra: et non pungunt pili.	When it has consolidated, the eyelid will rise and the hairs do not cause pain.
Et haec est forma duarum cannarum, quas facies secundum hanc figuram, et quantitatem in longitudinem et latitudinem.	And this is the shape of two canes which you will make according to this figure and proportion in length and width.
¶ De eleuatione pilorum pungentium in oculo cum acu.	Of the Lifting Up of Hairs Causing Pain in the Eye with a Needle.
Caput XII.	Here is the translation:
Operatio in illo est, ut accipias acum subtilem, et intromittas in eam filum ex serico subtile, lene.	Operation is this: take a fine needle and insert into it a thread of fine silk, soft.
Deinde aggreges extremitates eius, et nodes utramque nodo subtili ualde: et sit longitudo filorum palmus unus.	Then gather together its ends, and tie each with a very fine knot: and let the length of the threads be one palm.
Deinde compone in Alinxotati filum aliud subtile sub eo in breui, et noda extremitates eius si uis.	Then place another fine thread under it, short, and tie its ends if you wish.
Deinde ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo, et sit prope solem ut declaretur operatio: quoniam est operatio subtilis, uel minuta.	Then place the patient's head in your arm, and let it be near the sun as the operation is to be declared: for this is a subtle or minute operation.
Deinde intromitte acum cum alinxotati in radicem palpebrae, et fac eam penetrare in palpebram festinanter, donec extrahas eam desuper pilum naturalem.	Then insert the needle with Alinxotati into the root of the eyelid, and make it penetrate quickly into the eyelid until you withdraw it from above a natural hair.
Deinde trahe pilum usque supra alinxotati: et intromitte in alinxotati illum pilum: si est unus, aut duo, aut tres, non plures.	Then pull the hair up to Alinxotati and insert into Alinxotati that hair, if it is one, or two, or three, not more.
Deinde trahe manum tuam cum eo, donec egrediatur pilus cum alinxotati in palpebra cum pilo naturali.	Then pull your hand with it until the hair goes out with Alinxotati into the eyelid with a natural hair.
Si autem trahatur alinxotati, et non egrediatur pilus cum ea: trahes alinxotati ad inferiora, cum filo quod tu composuisti in ea, donec egrediatur alinxotati ex foramine superiori, et uideas eam uisione oculi: tunc enim trahes alinxotati, et filum: et extrahe utraque, et claude oculum: et dimitte ipsum clausum duobus diebus, aut tribus, donec adhaereat pilus loco suo, et nascatur super ipsum caro.	But if Alinxotati is pulled and the hair does not come out with it: pull Alinxotati down to the lower part, along with the thread that you placed in it, until Alinxotati comes out from above and you see it by the vision of the eye: then indeed pull Alinxotati and the thread; and extract both, and close the eye: and leave it closed for two days or three, until the hair adheres to its place and grows over it with flesh.
Quod si pilus est breuis, tunc aut associa ei pilum longum ex pilis naturalibus, et eleuatur cum eo: aut dimitte ipsum, donec elongetur post spacium, et tunc eleua ipsum.	But if the hair is short, then either join a long hair to it from the natural hairs and elevate with it: or leave it, until it will elongate after some space, and then elevate it.
¶ De cura Alxatrati quae accidit in palpebra superiori.	Of the cure of Alinxotati which happens in the upper eyelid.
Caput XIII.	Chapter XIII.
Quando accidit oculo haec Alxatrati, nominatur Leporina.	When this happens to an eye, it is called Leporina.
Et haec Alxatrati est aut naturalis, aut accidentalis.	And this is by Al-Xatrati, either natural or accidental.
Accidentalis ergo fit ex consolidatione uulneris, aut sectionis, aut cauterii, et similium illis.	So it therefore occurs from the consolidation of a wound, or a cutting, or a cauterization, and similar things to these.
Et modus operationis in ea est, ut tu findas illam consolidationem, et ut separes labia eius, et ponas in eo quod est inter ea licinium ex lino, et liges eam, donec sanetur.	And the method of treatment for this is that you should open up that consolidation, and separate its edges, and place a linen strip between them, and tie it until it heals.
Et non oportet, ut utaris in curatione eius rebus quae exiccant et constringunt: nam si tu facis illud, redit Alxatrati deterior quam fuit: imo utere in ea rebus quae mollificant, sicut foenumgraecum: et embroca cum aqua, in qua cocta sit althea, semen lini: et unguento dyaquilon, quod liquefactum sit cum aliquo ex oleis: et inuolue cum eo licinium, et cura cum eo.	And it is not necessary to use on its cure things that dry and constrict: for if you do this, Alxatrati will become worse than it was. Rather, use on it things that soften, such as Greek flaxseed: and smear it with a poultice made from the seed of althea mixed with water, and linseed; and anoint it with dyaquilon, which is mixed with some oil, and wrap it in linen and care for it.
Et thesaurus curationis tuae est, ut coneris omni ingenio, ut non consolidetur, secundum formam quae fuit in primis.	And your treasure of treatment is that you should apply yourself with every skill, so that it may not consolidate, according to its original form.
Et haec quidem operatio quam diximus, non est nisi quaedam rectificatio Alxatrati, ut non redeat forma loci secundum quod fuit omnino.	And this operation that we have described is not more than a correction of Alxatrati, so that it does not return to its original form in every way.
¶ De cura Alxatrati quae fit in palpebra inferiori, et est rugatio uel contractio sursum ad dextrum et sinistrum.	On the cure of Alxatrati that occurs on the lower eyelid, and is a roughening or contraction upward to the right and left.
Caput XIIII.	Chapter XIV.
Haec Alxatrati quae fit inferius, est quae uere nominatur Alxatrati.	This Alxatrati which occurs below is truly called Alxatrati.
Et est naturalis, et est accidentalis.	And it is natural, and it is accidental.
Et accidentalis fit ex uulnere, aut fissura, aut cauterio, et illis similibus.	And it becomes accidental from a wound, or a cleft, or a cauterization, and similar things to these.
Et uia operationis in ea est, ut accipias acum, in qua sit filum duplum, et tingas eam in carnem, et facias eam penetrare a lachrymali sinistro usque ad lachrymale dextrum, donec perueniat filum in duabus extremitatibus carnis.	And the method of treatment for this is that you should take a needle with a double thread, and dip it in flesh, and make it pierce from the left lacrimal to the right lacrimal, until the thread reaches both ends of the flesh.
Deinde extende carnem ad superiora cum acu, et incide eam cum spatumili lato.	Then stretch the flesh upwards with a needle and cut it with a broad spatula.
Si ergo redit figura palpebrae secundum quod oportet, est bonum.	If then the figure of the eyelid returns as it should be, it is good.
Et si non, accipe radium, et pone ipsum in fissuram, et conuerte cum eo palpebram: et finde duas fissuras in latere interiore palpebrae, et sint extremitates duarum fissurarum ex duobus angulis incisionis, donec concurrant et fiat ex eis angulus: donec quando aggregantur fiat figura earum haec figura, et est litera lauda graeca.	And if not, take a bone and place it in the cleft, and turn with it the eyelid; and make two clefts on the inner side of the eyelid, and let their ends be at the two corners of the incision until they meet and form an angle: until when they are gathered together the figure becomes this figure, and it is the Greek letter lambda.
Deinde aufer illam carnem per quantitatem, quod est latus eius acutum inferius, ab eo quod sequitur palpebram.	Then remove that skin as far as its sharp lower edge below the eyelid.
Deinde aggrega partes separatas: sue eam cum filo lanae.	Then gather the separated parts together, or sew them with a thread of wool.
Deinde cura eas cum eo quod diximus, de medicinis mollificantibus, et liciniis, donec sanentur.	Then take care of them with what we have said, the softening medicines and lysonia, until they are healed.
Et si Alxatrati accidat ex fissura, et sutura, aut cauterio: tunc oportet ut findas fissura plana sub pilis palpebrarum, etiam secundum quod praecessit.	And if the edge of the cleft, or seam, or cauterization happens to break open: then it is necessary that you make the cleft flat under the eyelashes, just as it happened previously.
Deinde separa inter duo labia cum licinio, secundum quod diximus.	Then separate the two lips with lysonia, according to what we have said.
Et summa sermonis de cura Alxatrati, quando est desuper, aut inferius, est, ut currat in ea operatio, secundum quod praeparatur ex forma Alxatrati.	And the summary of the speech on curing Alxatrati, whether it is above or below, is that the operation should be carried out according to the preparation made from the form of Alxatrati.
Ipsa namque est multarum diuersitatum in forma: et artifex prudens praeparat ingenium cum quocunque modo est possibile ei, donec redire faciat figuram ad formam naturalem, aut prope eam, et ipsemet infirmus, secundum quod conuenit ei ex operatione et instrumentis in plurimis dispositionibus.	For it is itself a multitude of diversities in form: and a skilled craftsman prepares the material according to whatever means are possible for him, until he makes the figure return to its natural form or nearly so, and the patient himself, according to what suits him from the operation and instruments in many dispositions.
¶ De adhaerentia palpebrae oculi cum coniunctiua, aut cornea.	¶ On the adhesion of the eyelid to the eye with conjunctiva or cornea.
Caput XV.	Chapter 15.
Quandoque accidit haec consolidatio multis hominibus, ita ut consolidetur palpebra superior cum albedine oculi, et prohibeat ipsum ab operationibus suis naturalibus.	Sometimes this consolidation occurs in many people, so that the upper eyelid becomes consolidated with the white of the eye and prevents it from performing its natural operations.
Oportet ergo quod intromittas extremitatem radii sub palpebra, et eleues eam sursum: aut extendas eam cum uncino: deinde incide adhaerentiam cum spatumili subtili, quod non sit cum acuitate incisionis spatumilium, imo sit obtusum parumper: ut non inquietetur infirmus apud operationem, et remoueatur spatumile, et laedat oculum cum acuitate sua: et sit incisio tua quasi tu excories illam adhaerentiam cum facilitate, donec quando redit palpebra secundum formam suam naturalem, et sanetur adhaerentia tota.	Therefore it is necessary that you insert the end of the radius under the eyelid and lift it up: or stretch it with a hook: then cut off the adhesion with a thin spatula, which should not be sharp like the incision of a spatula, but rather obtuse for a little while: so that the sick person is not disturbed during the operation, and the spatula is removed, and the eye is injured by its sharpness: and your incision should be as if you were scraping off that adhesion with ease, until when the eyelid returns to its natural shape and the adhesion is completely healed.
Funde tunc in oculum aquam salsam, cum aqua ablue ipsum: aut distilla in ipsum ex sief facto, ex ziniar dissoluto cum aqua.	Then pour salt water into the eye, washing it with the same water: or let it drip into it from a piece of linen made wet by dissolving gum arabic in water.
Deinde separa inter palpebram et oculum cum licinio lini: et pone super oculum lanam infusam cum albugine oui: et post diem tertium utere sief, et cum solidatiuis, donec sanetur.	Then separate the space between the eyelid and eye with a linen cloth: and place a woolen cloth soaked in egg white on the eye: and after three days use a poultice, and with salves, until it heals.
¶ De incisione ungulae et eminentiae carnis lachrymarum.	Of the cutting of the nail and the prominence of flesh tears.
Caput XVI.	XVI.
Scias, quod ungula est secundum duos modos.	Know that a nail is according to two modes.
Aut est neruosa: et est similis sifac duro, subtili.	Or it is hairy: and it is similar to a piece of skin, hard, thin.
Aut est non neruosa, similis humiditati congelatae albae: quae quando tangit cam ferrum, aut conaris capere eam cum uncino, abscinditur, et non figitur in ea uncinus.	Or it is not hairy, similar to frozen white moisture: which when touched with iron or caught with a hook, is cut off and the hook does not stick in it.
Et utraeque species non incipiunt, nisi a lachrymali maiore, usquequo uadit paulatim, donec cooperit uisum, et prohibet lumen, et motum oculi.	And both kinds do not begin, unless from the larger tear gland, until it gradually flows, until it covers the visible part, and prevents light, and movement of the eye.
Et modus operandi in incisione eius est: ut ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo.	And the method of operation in cutting it is: that the patient puts his head in your arm.
Deinde aperi oculos eius, et eleua palpebram manu tua.	Then open his eyes and lift up his eyelid with your hand.
Deinde collige ungulam cum uncino paucae duplationis, et extende eam ad superiora.	Then collect the nail with a hook of slight duplication, and stretch it upwards.
Deinde accipe acum, et intromitte in eam pilum ex pilis equi, et bouis, aut uaccae: et sit filum forte, et duplica extremitatem acus parumper, et fige eam in medio ungulae: et penetra eam cum acu, et liga cum filo ungulam, et extende eam ad superiora: et excoria cum pilo latus ungulae quod sequitur pupillam, ac si tu serres eam cum pilo usque ad postreimnum eius.	Here is the translation:
Deinde incide residuum in radice lachrymalis cum spatumili subtili, aut cum forficibus paruis: et dimitte carnem lachrymalis naturalem, ut non accidat ex incisione eius cursus lachrymarum assiduus.	Then cut the remainder at the root of the tear duct with a thin spatula or with small forceps: and let the natural flesh of the tear duct remain, so that it does not happen from its incision a constant flow of tears.
Et quandoque extenditur ungula cum uncino solo: aut cum filo, sicut diximus.	And sometimes it is stretched with a claw alone: or with a thread, as we have said.
Deinde excoriatur cum spatumili leni, cuius haec est forma.	Then scrape off with a gentle spatula, which has this shape.
Et caue, ne tangat spatumile tunicam corneam, et accidat in ea ruptura, et perforetur pupilla.	And beware, lest the spatula touch the cornified membrane and a tear occur, and the pupil be perforated.
Deinde post incisionem, proice in oculum aliquid salis contriti, aut ex sief facto ex ziniar, et dimitte ipsum usque ad diem alium.	Then after the incision, pour something crushed salt into the eye, or make a mixture from the root of the Zinnia plant, and leave it until another day.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod oportet, usquequo sanetur.	Then take care of it with what is needed, until it heals.
Quod si ungula est non neruosa, et non potes intromittere in eam acum, neque figitur in ea uncinus, tunc multotiens curatur haec species ungulae cum medicinis, et sanatur sicut narraui in diuisione.	What if the claw is not fleshy and you cannot insert a needle into it, nor does a thread stick to it, then this kind of claw is often treated with medicines, and heals as I narrated in the division.
Quod si uis incidere eam, tunc aperi oculum infirmi, et accipe spatumile subtile, lene, debilis acuitatis, secundum hanc formam.	What if you want to cut it, then open the eye of the patient and take a thin, gentle, weak, sharp-edged spatula according to this shape.
Et rade ungulam desuper rasione cum subtilitate.	And scrape the claw off above with smoothness and subtlety.
Quod si uides quod ipsa rarificatur et confringitur, et imprimit in eam rasio, tunc distilla ex hora tua in oculum ex sief facto ex ziniar, aut ex sief rubeo, aut sale trito: et opila oculum usque ad diem alium.	What if you see that it is becoming rarefied and broken, and impressing itself into it; then drip from your hour into the eye from the root of Zinnia, or from the red root, or crushed salt: and cover the eye until another day.
Deinde itera super ipsam operationem, donec remoueatur totum eius.	Then repeat the same operation over it, until the whole thing is removed.
Nisi contrarium sit tibi in oculo apostema calidum: tunc enim dimitte ipsam, et cura apostema, donec sanetur.	Unless there is an opposite hot aposteme in the eye; then indeed leave it and cure the aposteme until it heals.
Deinde itera operationem super ipsam cum rasione, donec sanetur.	Then repeat the operation over it with scraping, until it heals.
Eminentia autem carnis lachrymalis, si nocet in oculo nocumento magno, suspendatur cum uncino, et incide ex ea partem eius: et non ultimes incisionem, ut non accidat cursus lachrymarum.	The prominence of the flesh of the eyelash, if it hurts the eye with great harm, should be suspended with a hook and cut from it that part; and do not make the incision too long, lest the flow of tears occur.
Deinde stilla in lachrymale sief rubeum, aut factum ex ziniari, donec sanetur.	Then an ointment should be applied to the eyelash, whether it is red or made from safflower, until it heals.
¶ De incisione Alguardenic, et carne nata in oculo.	About the incision of Alguarden and the flesh that grows in the eye.
Caput XVII.	Chapter XVII.
Nascitur quandoque in quibusdam oculis hominum caro rubea composita, uel superposita, donec cooperit pupillam, aut appropinquat, aut stringit super palpebras, et fortasse conuertit palpebras ad exteriora: et assimilatur rosae balaustinae.	There are times when in some people's eyes flesh, red and composed or superimposed, grows to cover the pupil, approach it, or stretch over the eyelids, and perhaps turns the eyelids towards the outside, and is similar to a rose bush.
Et operatio in ea etiam est, ut ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo.	And the operation for this also is, that the patient puts his head in your lap.
Deinde aperi oculos eius, et collige illam carnem totam cum uncinis conuenientibus ad illud: et tene illud cum forcipe uno, aut gesti.	Then open his eyes and gather up the entire flesh with hooks suitable for this purpose; and hold it with a single forceps or instrument.
Deinde incide carnem in primis, donec finiatur totum eius cum incisorio.	Then cut the flesh first, until you have finished the whole of it with a cutting instrument.
Et caue ab oculo, ut non laedas ipsum apud operationem: et sit incisio tua qua ipsam incidis, aut cum spatumili, quod narrauimus in incisione ungulae: aut cum forficibus paruis, cum quibus colligitur asebel, secundum quod ueniet forma eius post hoc capitulum.	And beware of the eye, so that you do not hurt it during the operation; and let your incision be as one that cuts it, or with a spatula, as we have narrated in the cutting of the fingernail: or with small forceps, by which a sebaceous gland is gathered, according to its shape as will come after this chapter.
Cum ergo completur incisio tua, et remouetur tota alguardenici, tunc imple oculum ex sale contrito: aut distilla in eum puluerem rubeum, et similia illi ex medicinis corrosiuis: et pone super oculum deforis cottum cum albugine oui: ut securetur ab apostemate calido.	When your incision is complete and the entire Alguarden is removed, then fill the eye with crushed salt: or distill red powder into it, and similar substances from corrosive medicines; and place a poultice made of wool and albino sheep's fat over the eye outside to secure it from warm apostema.
Quod si remanet ex alguardenici aliquid, et dominatur tibi sanguis calidus, et times apostema calidum: tunc dimitte oculum, et cura ipsum cum eo quod sedat apostema.	But if something remains from the Alguarden and a hot blood dominates you, and you fear hot apostema; then leave the eye alone and care for it with that which settles apostema.
Deinde itera super ipsum cum operatione, donec sanetur.	Then proceed over him with an operation until he is healed.
Et similiter fac cum carne addita quae accidit in oculo ex hac specie.	And similarly do this with added flesh which happens in the eye of this kind.
Verumtamen oportet, ut alienes curationem omnis oculi debilis ex uia naturali, aut ex uia accidentali, operando cum ferro: et non intromittas manum tuam in aliqua harum operationum, donec uideas, quod illud membrum est tolerans illam operationem.	However, it is necessary to let outsiders with weak eyes, whether the weakness comes from a natural or accidental cause, be treated with iron: and do not put your hand on any of these operations until you see that that member is bearing up under that treatment.
¶ De collectione Sebel ex oculo.	On collecting Sabi from the eye.
Caput XVIII.	Chapter 18.
Sebel sunt uenae rubeae quae texuntur super oculum, et prohibent uisui operationem suam: et debilitant oculum cum longitudine dierum.	Sabi are red veins that form over the eye and prevent their own natural function from operating: and they weaken the eye with the passage of days.
Necesse est ergo tibi in primis, ut consideres, si oculus in quo est Sebel, est fortis, et non est in eo aegritudo aliqua, praeter Sebel: tunc collige Sebel eius.	Therefore it is necessary for you first to consider whether the eye in which Sabi are present is strong and not troubled by any disease other than Sabi: then collect its Sabi.
Et est, ut praecipias infirmo, ut ponat caput suum in sinu tuo.	And it is, that you should instruct the weak person to place their head on your shoulder.
Deinde suspende illas uenas cum uncino uno, aut duobus secundum prudentiam tuam: et sit uncinus subtilis duplationis, secundum hanc formam, aut sint duo uncini gradat in corpore uno, secundum hanc formam.	Then suspend those veins with one or two clamps, according to your prudence: and the clamp should be thin and doubled, like this, or there should be two clamps graded in one body, like this.
Deinde collige cum forficibus subtilibus illas uenas cum subtilitate, et absterge sanguinem hora post horam, donec uideas illas uenas remoueri ex oculo, et resoluuntur: et caue ne laedas oculum cum extremitatibus spatumilis.	Then collect those veins with sharp forceps in a subtle manner, and wash away the blood an hour after an hour, until you see those veins being removed from the eye and resolving: and beware of hurting the eye with the extremities of the splinter.
Et sit operatio tua in meridie coram sole, et sis firmus in operatione tua ualde: ut non incidas nisi illas uenas.	And let your operation be at noon before the sun, and be steadfast in your operation very much: so that you do not cut unless those veins.
Et cum tu expleueris, tunc distilla in oculum sief uiride, aut rubeum: ut sua acuitate corrodat quod remansit ex sebel.	And when you have finished, then dilute into the eye whether it is green or red: so that its keenness may dissolve what remains of the Sabi.
Si autem non est tibi possibile colligere illud totum in illa hora, tunc emplastra oculum cum eo, quod sedat dolorem oculi: et dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot, donec sedetur dolor eius: et securetur ab apostemate calido: deinde itera super ipsum secundum modum eundem, donec sanetur.	But if it is not possible for you to collect the whole of it in that hour, then apply a poultice to the eye with what soothes the pain of the eye: and leave it for several days until the pain subsides: and guard against hot abscesses: then proceed over it in the same manner until it is healed.
Et haec est forma forficis.	And this is the form of the forceps.
¶ De reductione Arissati ad nasum.	On the reduction of a broken nose.
Caput XIX.	Chapter 19.
Nominant medici Arissati Fistulam, quam curas cum cauterio, aut cum medicina acuta comburente, secundum quod praecessit eius narratio.	I name the doctor of Arissa's boil, which he treats with a cauter or burning medicine, according to his previous account.
Et si non sanatur, tunc non est ingenium in ea: nisi ut findas super apostema apud natiuitatem eius, et extrahas totam humiditatem quae est in eo et pus, donec detegatur os.	And if it is not healed, then there is no talent in it; except that you should open up the abscess at its birth and extract all the moisture that is in it and pus, until the mouth is uncovered.
Cum ergo detegitur os, et uides in eo corruptionem, aut nigredinem, tunc rade ipsum cum instrumento, cuius forma est haec.	When therefore the mouth is uncovered, and you see corruption or blackness in it, then scrape it with an instrument whose form is this.
Et nominatur Asperi capitis.	And it is called the scraper of the head.
Fiat ex ferro indo, et sit caput eius rotundum sicut azir, quod sit punctatum punctatione limae, aut punctatione aliskilferi punctatione subtili: et pone ipsum super locum corruptum ossis.	Let it be made of tempered steel, and let the head of it be rounded like an azir, which is pierced with a filing or the fine puncture of a skiver's point; and place it over the corrupted bone.
Deinde reuolue ipsum inter digitos tuos, et tu preme manum tuam parumper, donec scias quod illa corruptio iam rasa est: et fac illud aliquotiens.	Then turn the scraper between your fingers, and press your hand upon it for a little while, until you know that the corruption is now scraped away; and do this several times.
Deinde restaura locum cum medicinis exiccatiuis stipticis.	Then restore the place with medicines of dried herbs, stiptics.
Si ergo consolidatur locus, et nascitur in eo caro, et abscinditur cursus saniei: et remanet quadraginta diebus, et non renouatur, et non apostematur, et non accidit in eo accidens: tunc scias quia iam sanatus est.	If therefore the place is consolidated, and flesh grows in it, and the flow of pus ceases: and remains for forty days, and does not renew itself, nor apostematize, nor happen anything else to it: then you will know that it is now healed.
Et si non, tunc non est in eo ingenium, nisi reducere fistulam ad foramen nasi, secundum hanc formam.	And if not, then there is no talent in it, except to reduce the fistula to a nasal opening, according to this form.
Et est, ut detegas ab osse secundo cum ferro, aut cum medicina acuta: et cum detectum est os, tunc accipe terebrum secundum hanc formam, sit extremitas ferrea, triangulata: et lignum eius sit pyramis extenuata usque ad extremitatem, sicut uides.	And it is, as you uncover the bone with a file or a sharp medicine; and when the bone is uncovered, then take the trephine according to this form, whose iron extremity is triangular: and its wood part is a thin pyramid extending to the end, as you see.
Deinde pone illud super os ipsum: et sit illud prope lachrymale: et elonga manum tuam ab oculo parum.	Then place that on the same eye: and let it be near the tear duct: and stretch out your hand a little from the eye.
Deinde reuolue manum tuam cum terebro, donec penetret os, et sentiat illud infirmus: per hoc quod inuenit uentum exire ex eo, quando tenet manum suam super nasum suum.	Then turn your hand back with the scraper, until it pierces the eye and the patient feels it: because through this, he finds air coming out of it when he holds his hand over his nose.
Ergo tunc restaura locum cum medicinis stipticis exiccantibus, sicut docui te.	Therefore then restore the place with drying astringent medicines, as I have taught you.
Cum ergo nascitur caro, et induratur locus: tunc materia quae effundebatur ad exteriora, redit ad nasum: est ergo leuius illud super infirmum.	When then the flesh grows and hardens the place: then the matter that was flowing out to the outside returns to the nose: therefore it is less troublesome for the patient.
¶ De reductione eminentiae Oculi.	A chapter on the reduction of a bulging eye.
Caput XX.	Chapter 20.
Quando eminet Oculus cum totalitate sua, et non accidit in uisu nocumentum, neque diminutio: tunc oportet ut soluas infirmum: deinde phlebotomes eum: postea ponas uentosas in ceruice absque scarificatione, sed cum suctione.	When the eye bulges with its entire contents and does not cause harm or loss of vision: then it is necessary to let the patient sit down: afterwards have someone bleed him: subsequently place poultices on the neck without scarification, but with suction.
Deinde pone super Oculum linimentum quod fit ex acacia, et aloe, et olibano, et sarcocolla.	Then place over the eye a lotion made from acacia, and aloe, and frankincense, and wax.
Deinde stringe Oculum desuper super emplastrum cum puluillis multis.	Then bind the eye above with a poultice and many linten strips.
Et modus puluillorum est: ut accipias pannos lenes, multos, et duplicetur omnis pannus ex eis super quatuor: fac ex eis multos: deinde pone eos unum super alium, secundum quantitatem qua indiget Oculus: deinde stringe super ipsos cum panno duro strictura forti.	And the method of linten strips is: to take soft cloths, many, and double each cloth from them over four; make many of them; then place one on top of another, according to the quantity needed by the eye; then bind over them with a strong durable cloth.
Et itera uentosas cum suctione sine scarificatione.	And repeat the poultices with suction without scarification.
Deinde aufer uentosas, et dimitte oculum strictum die et nocte.	Then remove the poultices and leave the eye bound day and night.
Si autem ligamentum iterum mollificatur, tunc oportet ut stringatur multum: deinde aufer ligamentum post diem et noctem, sicut diximus.	But if the bandage becomes soft again, then it is necessary to bind it tightly; afterwards remove the bandage after a day and night, as we said.
Si ergo uides oculum iam redisse uuae tunicae, est bonum: et si non, tunc itera emplastrum, et puluillos, et stricturam, et uentosas, donec sanetur.	So if you see the eye has returned to its normal state, that is good; and if not, then repeat the poultice, linten strips, binding, and poultices until it heals.
¶ De incisionie Vuae tunicae.	On cutting the foreskin.
Caput XXI.	Chapter 21.
Quando accidit disruptio in tunica Vuea, deinde eminet et procedit extra palpebras sicut granum Vuae, et foedatur forma hominis propter illud, et uis incidere illud: tunc operatio in eo est, secundum quod narro: et est, ut intromittas acum in radice Vuae ab inferiori ad superiorem partem.	When a disruption occurs in the foreskin and it protrudes and proceeds outside of the eyelids like a grain of skin, and disfigures the shape of a man because of that, and one wishes to cut it off: then the operation is done as I shall tell. And it is, by inserting an instrument into the root of the foreskin from the lower part to the upper.
Deinde intromitte acum aliam in qua sit filum duplum a parte lachrymalis, et fac eam penetrare: et dimitte acum primam secundum dispositionem suam.	Then insert another instrument with a thread double from the lacrimal part and make it penetrate; and leave the first instrument according to its position.
Deinde incide locum fili dupli, et liga cum eo partem Vuae in circumitu acus: et stringe eam multum.	Then cut the place of the thread, and tie with it the foreskin around the instrument; and tighten it much.
Deinde extrahe acum, et pone super oculum lanam infusam in albugine oui: et dimitte eum, donec cadat filum cum Vua.	Then withdraw the instrument, and place a woolen cloth soaked in egg white on the eye's white; and leave it until the thread falls with the foreskin.
Deinde cura oculum cum eo, quod confortat ipsum, donec sanetur uulnus.	Then care for the eye with that, because it comforts it, until the wound is healed.
Et quandoque stringitur Vua ab omni parte cum circulo ex panno, donec addat oculus eminentiam magnam.	And sometimes the foreskin is tightened all around with a cloth circle, until the eye becomes very prominent.
Deinde perforetur cum spatumili subtili, quod perueniat ad profundum oculi, et currat humiditas albuginea, et descendat oculus, et ingrediatur statim: deinde stringe eum, donec sanetur.	Then pierce with a sharp awl that reaches the depth of the eye, and allow the moisture to flow into the white part, and let the eye descend and settle; then tighten it until it heals.
¶ De curatione Alcomnati.	On curing the Alconny.
Caput XXII.	Chapter 22.
Haec Aegritudo quae nominatur Alcomnati, non, est nisi sanies, quae aggregatur in oculo, similis aquae descendenti, et non est ipsa.	This affliction which is called Alconny is not anything except a discharge that gathers in the eye, like water flowing down, and it is not itself.
Et modus operandi in ea est, ut facias sedere infirmum super sedem praeparatum, uel directum.	And the method of procedure in this case is to make the patient sit on a prepared seat or a straight one.
Deinde accipe caput eius manibus tuis a partibus duabus, et moue ipsum, donec uideas saniem peruenire ad inferiora oculis tuis.	Then take hold of the patient's head with your hands on both sides and move it until you see the discharge reach the lower parts of your eyes.
Deinde figatur, et non descendat, et absoluatur lumen: et uideat infirmus res sicut uidebat: et si non descendit inferius, scias quia est aqua.	Then he is fixed and does not flow down, and the sight is cleared; and the patient will see things as he used to see them: and if it does not go down below, you know it is water.
Si autem non praeparatur descensus saniei cum eo quod diximus, tunc fac sedere infirmum inter manus tuas.	If however the preparations for descent of the intestines are not made as we said, then make the patient sit between your hands.
Deinde accipe spatumile subtile, et finde cum eo supra panniculum corneum parumper apud continuationem coniunctiuae cum tunica cornea in corona, donec egrediatur sanies.	Then receive a thin spatula and insert it above the fatty membrane for a little while at the point of connection with the skin in the crown, until pus emerges.
Cum ergo egreditur, tunc distilla in oculum aquam calidam in qua miscuisti mel: aut aquam in qua iam bullisti foenumgraecum et mel: deinde curetur cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	When it emerges, then pour hot water mixed with honey into the eye, or water in which you have already boiled Greek chamomile and honey; afterwards, it should be treated along with the rest of the treatment until healed.
¶ De cura aquae, quae descendit in oculo, uel cataracta.	On the cure of water that descends into the eye, or cataract.
Caput XXIII.	Chapter 23.
Iam Diximus species aquae in diuisione, et quae conuenit ad perforandum sermone declarante et exponente, tunc accipe illud idem secundum sanitatem.	Now we have mentioned the kinds of water for division and what is suitable for piercing, as explained and demonstrated by speech; then take the same thing according to health.
Tunc ergo oportet ut facias sedere infirmum inter manus tuas quadratum, oppositum lumini, prope solem: et liga oculum eius sanum, et stringe eum ualde: deinde palpebram oculi eius manu tua dextra, si oculus in quo est aqua, est oculus sinister: aut manu tua sinistra, si oculus est dexter.	Then it is necessary that you make the patient sit between your hands, square and opposite to the light, near the sun; and bind his healthy eye, and tie him tightly. Then cover his eyelid with your right hand if the water is in the left eye, or with your left hand if it is in the right eye.
Deinde accipe manu tua dextra almagda, si oculus est sinister: aut manu tua sinistra, si oculus est dexter.	Then take your right hand as an almagda if the eye is left; or with your left hand if it is right.
Deinde pone extremitatem almagda prope coronam per grossitudinem radii in ipsa albedine oculi apparente lachrymalis minoris: deinde impelle almagda cum uirtute: et tu reuoluis cum eo manum tuam, donec penetret in albuginem oculi: et sentias, quod almagda iam peruenit ad rem uacuam.	Then place the tip of the almagda near the crown by the thickness of the radius on the apparent white of the small conjunctival eye: then push the almagda with force and you turn with it your hand, until it penetrates into the cornea of the eye; and feel that the almagda has already reached the empty space.
Et oportet, ut sit mensura itineris almagda ad profundum, mensura spacii quod est a pupilla usque ad finem nigredinis: et est corona oculi.	And it is necessary that the distance traveled by the almagda to depth be measured as far as the space from the pupil to the end of the blackness and it is the crown of the eye.
Uidebis enim ea in ipsa pupilla uisione oculi, propter claritatem tunicae corneae.	For you will see these things in the very pupil of the eye, because of the clarity of the corneal tunic.
Deinde pone almagda usque ad locum in quo est aqua.	Then place the alum up to the place where there is water.
Deinde preme ipsum inferius uice una post aliam.	Then press it downwards with a gentle motion, one stroke after another.
Si ergo descendit aqua statim, tunc infirmus uidet illud super quod aperit uisum suum statim, et almagda in oculo suo.	If then the water descends immediately, then the patient will see that thing which he opens with his sight immediately, and the alum is in his eye.
Deinde quiescas paululum.	Then rest a little bit.
Si ergo descendat aqua, tunc depone eam secundo, praeter quod egrediatur almagda.	If then the water has gone down, then remove it secondly, besides what comes out of the alum.
Quando ergo figitur, et non ascendit: tunc extrahe almagda cum facilitate: et tu reuoluis manum tuam paulatim.	When it is fixed and does not rise: then draw out the alum with ease; and you revolve your hand slowly.
Deinde dissolue in aqua aliquid ex sale claro gemmae: et ablue cum eo oculum deintus.	Then dissolve something from clear crystal salt in water, and wash the eye afterwards with it.
Deinde pone extra oculum totum stuppam, aut lanam infusam oleo rosato, et albugine oui: et liga cum eo oculum sanum.	Then place a whole poultice or a cloth infused with rose oil and the whites of an egg on top of the eye, and bind it to the healthy eye.
Nos autem, et illi qui sunt nostri temporis, ponimus super eum ciminum tritum cum albumine oui.	But we, and those who are of our time, place a powder of cumin ground with egg white over it.
Quod si non obedit tibi almagda ad introitum in oculum propter duriciem suam, quoniam ex hominibus est, cuius oculus est durus ualde: tunc oportet ut accipias spatumile, quod nominatur Alberid, cuius haec est forma.	But if the alum does not obey you at the entrance to the eye because of its hardness, since it is made of human bone, which is very hard: then it is necessary that you take a sponge called Alberid, whose shape is this.
Pefora ergo cum eo ipsam coniunctiuam tantum, et non ultimes manum tuam in foramine: et non est nisi ut facias uiam ad almagda locum subtilem.	Therefore tie it to that with the same connected thing just enough, and do not leave your hand in the opening; and there is nothing except that you make a path to the alum's subtle place.
Deinde intromitte almagda, secundum quod diximus.	Then introduce the alum, according to what we said.
Et apud complementum operis tui, praeparetur infirmo dormitorium decenter factum, in quo dormiat super dorsum suum in domo tenebrosa: et prohibeatur ab omnibus motibus, et a tussi: et pone cibum eius illud quo lenitur natura eius: et non moueat caput suum dextra, neque sinistra omnino.	And at the completion of your work, prepare for the patient a decent bedchamber, in which he will sleep on his back at home in a dark room; and forbid him from all movements, and from coughing: and give him food that soothes his nature; and do not let him move his head to the right or left at all.
Et sit ligamentum secundum dispositionem suam usque ad diem tertium.	And let the ligament be according to its arrangement until the third day.
Deinde solue illud in illa domo tenebrosa, et experire uisum eius: et fac eum uidere res.	Then dissolve that in that dark house, and try out what you see of it; and make him look at things.
Deinde reduc ligamentum usque ad diem septimum.	Then bring the ligament back until the seventh day.
Et non oportet ut faciat illud in hora curationis, aut post incisionem statim: imo oportet, ut alienes illud: propterea quod aqua ascendit uelociter per aspectum uehementem.	And it is not necessary for him to do that at the time of healing or immediately after the incision, but rather let someone else do it, because water rises quickly due to a strong and vehement appearance.
Si autem accidit apostema calidum: tunc oportet ut soluas oculum ante septimum: et rectifica illud cum eo quod sedat apostema, donec sedatur: tunc absolue ipsius uisum, et pone super faciem eius orale quo regatur uisus eius sub eo diebus aliquot, ipso existente in illa domo tenebrosa.	But if a warm abscess occurs, then it is necessary to dissolve the eye before the seventh day: and correct it with what calms the abscess, until it is calmed; then release his sight, and place over his face an oral application by which his sight will be regulated under those days, while he remains in that dark house.
Deinde egrediatur a domo gradatim, et conuersetur in casis suis.	Then let him go out from the house gradually and live in his own tents.
Et scias, quod in zaltea non excusatur discipulus a uisione aliquotiens: tunc enim audeat super operationem.	And know that in zeal one's pupil is not exempt from seeing sometimes: then he may dare to operate.
Et iam quidem peruenit ad nos quidam ex illis qui sunt de Alayrach, qui dixit, quod factum fuit in Alayrach magdan perforatum, quo sugitur aqua.	And now indeed has reached us one of those from Alayrach who said that in Alayrach a madman had his perforation made through which water flows.
Verum ergo non uidi aliquem in terra uostra, qui fecerit illud: neque legi illud in aliquo ex libris antiquorum: et est possibile, ut sit illud nouum.	Therefore I have not seen anyone on your earth who has done that: nor have I read it in any of the ancient books: and it is possible that it is new.
Et istae sunt formae specierum ex magda, ut stet super ea qui ea ignorat.	And these are forms of kinds from madman, so as to stand over him who does not know them.
Fiant ex aere proprie: et sint extremitates eorum cum hac eadem subtilitate triangulatae, et extremitas acuta.	Let them be made from proper air: and let their extremities be like this same fine triangular shape, with an acute point.
Formae magda.	Madman's forms.
¶ De cura Carnis natae in naso.	¶ On the treatment of a born-in nose.
Caput XXIIII.	Chapter XXIV.
Quandoque nascuntur in naso Carnes diuersae additae, ex quibus est aliquid quod assimilatur scorpioni multorum pedum: et ex ea est caro cancerosa, lapidea, fusci coloris: et ex ea est quae est caro lenis, non fusci coloris.	Sometimes flesh is born in the nose of different kinds added to which there is something that resembles a scorpion with many feet: and from it is the fleshy cancerous, stony, red-colored one: and from it is the soft flesh, not red-colored.
In ea ergo quae ex istis carnibus est lenis, non fraudulenta, neque cancerosa, oportet ut facias sedere infirmum inter manus tuas oppositum soli, et aperi nares eius, et proiice uncinum in illas carnes: deinde trahe eas ad exteriora, et incide quod comprehendisti ex eis cum spatumili subtili acuto a parte una, donec scias quod caro tota iam ablata est.	So then in the one which is soft from these meats, not deceitful nor cancerous, you should make the patient sit between your hands opposite the sun, and open his nostrils, and insert a hook into those flesh: then draw them out to the outside, and cut off what you have grasped of them with a sharp and thin scalpel on one side, until you know that all the flesh is already removed.
Quod si remaneret aliquid ex ea cuius abscisio non est possibilis: tunc rade illud cum uno instrumentorum subtilium cum facilitate, donec non remaneat ex eo aliquid.	But if something remains of that which cannot be cut off: then scrape it away with one of the fine instruments with ease, until nothing remains.
Si autem sanguis tibi dominatur, aut accidat apostema calidum: tunc oppone ei per id quod oportet: aut est ex apostematibus malignis, tunc propera cauterizando eum, donec abscindatur sanguis, et auferantur omnes carnes.	But if blood dominates you, or a warm abscess occurs: then apply to it as needed: but if it is from malignant abscesses, then hasten by cauterizing him, until the blood ceases and all flesh is removed.
Deinde proiiciatur in nasum post incisionem acetum, et aqua, aut uinum.	Then a vinegar, water, or wine mixture should be poured into the nose after the incision.
Si autem aperitur nasus, et procedat ex eo humiditas usque ad palatum, tunc scias quia iam sanus est.	But if the nose opens and moisture flows from it all the way to the palate, then you will know that he is already healed.
Si uero non penetrat humiditas, secundum quod oportet, tunc scias quod intra ipsum est caro nata in superioribus ossibus naris, ad quae non peruenit cum incisione instrumentum.	But if moisture does not penetrate as it should, then you will know that there is flesh that has grown above the bones of the nose, which the instrument cannot reach with incision.
Tunc ergo oportet, ut intromittas filum lini cui sit quaedam grossitudo, et noda in eo nodos multos: et pone inter omnem nodum quantitatem digiti, aut minus: et ingeniet infirmus, ut mittat extremitatem unam fili in nasum cum radio, aut cum quo possibile est ei postquam fecerit ipsum simile azer: et trahat odoratum suum, donec perueniat usque ad caassum, et egrediatur super guttur suum.	Then it is necessary to insert a linen thread with some thickness and tie many knots in it: and place between every knot the amount of a finger or less: and let the patient, as he is able, pass one end of the thread into his nose with a rod, or whatever is possible for him after he has done so, similar to a string: and draw out his odor, until it reaches the hump, and emerges above his throat.
Et multotiens quidem faciunt simile huic Attomi pueri in scholis: et est res facilis ei, qui uult.	And many people indeed do this similar to the boy Attomus in schools: and it is an easy thing for one who wishes.
Deinde pone duas extremitates fili, extremitatem unam quae egreditur super nasum, et alteram quae remansit in naso.	Then place the two ends of the thread, one end which emerges above the nose and the other end which remains inside the nose.
Deinde ac ministra serraturam carnis cum nodis qui sunt in filo.	Then one ought to sharpen the flesh-cutting saw with the knots that are on the string.
Fac illud donec scias quod carnes iam sunt cum nodis fili.	Do that until you know that the skin is now tied up with the knots of the thread.
Deinde extrahe filum: et pone in nasum post abstersionem sanguinis licinium quod imbibisti in unguento aegyptio: fac illud tribus diebus, aut plus, donec unguentum corrodat totum quod remansit ex carnibus.	Then draw out the thread; and put it in the nose after wiping away the blood with what you have taken in Egyptian ointment: do that for three days or more, until the ointment has consumed all that remains of the flesh.
Deinde pone in fine rei in nasum cannulam de plumbo, diebus aliquot, donec sanetur.	Then put a lead tube at the end of the thing into the nose for several days until it heals.
Si autem indiget curatione quae exiccet, utere illa.	But if it needs to be dried out, use that.
Ad caputpurgium faciendum, cum quo distillantur olea, et aliae medicinae in nasum, fac illud ex argento, aut aere: quod sit simile lampadi paruae, apertum sicut conchula: et meatus eius similiter.	To make a head-purging instrument with which oils and other medicines are poured into the nose, make that out of silver or air: which is similar to a small lamp, open like a shell, and its passage similarly.
Et si uis fac cannulam clausam, sicut canna.	And if you wish, make a closed tube, like a reed.
Et conchula instrumenti ad caputpurgium faciendum, sit plena, detecta: cui sit manubrium in postremo eius, cum quo teneas ipsam, quando calefacis in ea oleum, aut quod uis ex succis, et rebus fluxibilibus.	And the shell-shaped instrument for head-purging should be full and uncovered: with a handle at its end, by which you will hold it when you warm it with oil or whatever substance you wish from sap and flowing things.
Et haec est forma instrumenti.	And this is the shape of the instrument.
¶ De cura Thelul nasi.	Of the care for a swollen nose.
Caput XXV.	Chapter 25.
Multotiens nascitur in extremitate nasi Thelul, et magnificatur, et augmentatur cum diebus, donec foedus fit aspectus eius.	A swelling called Thelul frequently arises at the end of the nose and grows and increases with days until its appearance becomes foul.
Et propter illud oportet, ut in cidas illud in principio apparitionis eius, et eradices totum eius.	And because of that, it is necessary to cut off all of it at the beginning of its appearance and uproot the whole thing.
Deinde pone super locum, aut cauterium, aut medicinam comburentem quae stat loco eius.	Then place something over the spot, or a caustic or a burning medicine that will take the place of what was there.
Si ergo tardatur incisio eius, donec magnificetur, tunc considera, si est lapideum, durum, fusci coloris, pauci sensus: tunc non tangas ipsum cum ferro: quoniam apostema est cancerosum.	So if the cutting of it is delayed until it grows large, then consider whether it is hard, stony, rough-colored, and has few sensations: then do not touch it with iron, since it is a cancrum-like apostema.
Multotiens enim uidi, qui incidit hmoni apostema, et accidit ex eo malicia magna super illum qui ipsum habebat.	I have often seen many who cut away a swelling of the humors and afterwards a great evil befell him who had it.
Et si apostema est lenis tactus, non fusci coloris, et uides quod incisio possibilis est in toto eius, tunc euacua infirmum, et incide ipsum sine timore, absque pauore: et cura locum cum eo quod exiccat et constringit, donec sanetur.	And if the swelling is slight to the touch, not of a dark color, and you see that it can be cut in its entirety, then remove the patient, and cut it without fear, without anxiety: and care for the place with what coagulates and constricts, until he is healed.
¶ De sutura nasi, et labii, et auris.	On the stitching of the nose, and lip, and ear.
Caput XXVI.	Chapter 26.
Scias Quia quando accidit solutio continuitatis in una harum cartilaginum, parum confert in ea operatio, nisi in quibusdam hominibus.	Know that when a separation of continuity occurs in one of these cartilages, it is not very useful to perform an operation on it, unless in certain people.
Oportet ergo quando accidit alicui aliquid ex illo, ut consideres, si est uulnus recens cum sanguine suo: et tunc aggrega duolabia uulneris cum sutura: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Therefore, when something occurs to someone from that, you should consider whether it is a fresh wound with its own blood; and then gather the edges of the wound with a suture: afterwards, care for it until he is healed.
Et si solutionis continuitatis labia iam separata sunt, et facta est unaquaeque pars sana: tunc oportet ut excories omnem partem a cute sua apparente, donec sanguinetur.	And if the separation of continuity has already caused the lips to be separated, and each part is healed: then it is necessary that you remove all parts from their apparent skin until they are bled.
Deinde aggrega duo labia cum sutura, et stringe ea, et pulueriza super ipsum sanguinem draconis, et olibanum trita: et pone supra pulueres frustum emplastri diafinicon, et alicuius alterius ex emplastris consolidatiuis: et dimitte ipsum ligatum duobus diebus, aut tribus.	Then gather the two lips with a suture and tie them, and powder over it dragon's blood and ground olibanum: and place above the powders a piece of diaphanous plaster or some other consolidating plaster: and let him be bound for two days, or three.
Deinde solue ipsum, et permuta medicinam: et dimitte ipsum, donec abscindantur fila per se.	Then loosen it and change the medication: and let him go until the strings detach on their own.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with an ointment, until he is healed.
Modus autem suturae est, ut aggreges solutionem continuitatis, aut cum acubus, sicut narrauimus in sutura uentris: aut aggrega solutionem cum filo, sicut feci te scire.	The method of stitching is, that you gather the separation of continuity with needles, as we narrated in the stitching of the belly: or gather the separation with a thread, as I have taught you to know.
¶ De extractione nodorum labiorum.	On the removal of nodes of lips.
Caput XXVII.	Here is the translation:
Multis Quidem hominibus accidunt plaerumque in interioribus labiorum suorum apostemata dura similia granis herbi: et quaedam eorum minora, et maiora.	Many people indeed have growths on their inner lips that are similar to seeds of herbs, and some of them are smaller, others larger.
Ergo oportet ut conuertas labium, et findas super omnem nodum eius, et suspendas ipsum cum uncino, et incidas ipsum ab omni parte.	Therefore, you should turn the lip and scrape over all its knot, and hang it with a hook, and cut it from every part.
Deinde impleas locum post incisionem zegi trito, donec abscindatur sanguis.	Then fill the place after the incision with powdered alum, until the blood is stopped.
Deinde colluatur cum aceto, et curetur locus cum eo, in quo est stipticitas, usquequo sanentur uulnera.	Then anoint it with vinegar, and treat the place where the inflammation is, until the wounds are healed.
¶ De incisione carnis natae super gingiuam.	About cutting the flesh born on the gum.
Caput XXVIII.	Book 28.
Multotiens nascitur super gingiuam caro addiat, quam antiqui nominant abuluss.	There is often born on the gum a piece of flesh which the ancients call an abuluss.
Oportet ergo ut suspendas eam cum uncino: aut teneas eam cum forcipibus, et incidas eam apud radicem suam, et dimittas saniem currere, aut sanguinem.	Therefore, you should hang it with a hook, or hold it with forceps, and cut it at its root, and let the pus flow, or blood.
Deinde pone super locum zegi tritum, aut alios pulueres stipticos, exiccatiuos.	Then place powdered alum, or other stiptic and astringent powders, over the place.
Quod si redit illa caro post curationem, nam multotiens redit, tunc incide eam secundo, et cauteriza ipsam: ipsa namque non redit post cauterium.	And if that flesh returns after it has been cured, for it often returns, then cut it again and cauterize it; for it does not return after cauterization.
¶ De rasione Dentium cum ferro.	About trimming teeth with iron.
Caput XXIX.	Book 29.
Quandoque aggregantur in superficiebus Dentium ab interiori et extetiori parte, et inter gingiuas cortices asperi, turpes, et quandoque denigrantur, et citrini fiunt, et uirides, donec peruenit ex illo corruptio ad gingiuam, et foedi fiunt dentes per illud.	Sometimes they gather on the surfaces of teeth from both inside and outside, and between the gums rough, foul, and sometimes turn yellow, green, until the corruption reaches the gum, and the teeth become foul through it.
Oportet ergo ut facias sedere infirmum inter manus tuas, et caput eius in sinu tuo, et rade molam et dentem, in quo apparent tibi cortices, et res similis arenae: donec non remaneat ex eis aliquid, et similiter fac de nigredine, et uiriditate, et citrinitate, et aliis donec mundentur.	Therefore, you should make the patient sit between your hands, and his head in the hollow of your arm, and scrape and file each tooth, in which rough surfaces appear to you, like sand: until nothing remains of them, and similarly do this for yellowness, greenness, citrineness, and other similar things, until they are cleansed.
Si ergo auferatur quod in eis est a principio rasionis, bonum est: et si non, tunc itera super eos rasionem die alio, secundo, et tertio, donec ad ultimum perueniat studium in eo quod uis.	If then what is in them from the beginning of reason is taken away, it is good: and if not, then iterate over them the reason on another day, secondly, and thirdly, until one arrives at the ultimate goal in that which one wishes.
Et scias, quod dens indiget rasoriis diuersarum formarum, multarum figurarum: secundum quod praeparatur operationi tuae: proptera, quod rasorium quo raditur dens ab inferiori parte, est aliud a rasorio quo raditur inter dentes, secundum formas alias.	And know that the tooth requires various forms and figures of rasps, many shapes, according to how you prepare your operation: therefore, because the rasp used to remove the tooth from the lower part is different from the one used between teeth, in other forms.
Et istae formae rasoriorum sint apud te praeparatae, quas uides.	And those shapes of rasps should be prepared by you, which you see.
¶ De extractione doloris Dentium.	Of the Extraction of Toothache.
Caput XXX.	Chapter 30.
Oportet ut cures Dentem a dolore suo cum omni ingenio, et tardes in eradicatione eius.	It is necessary to treat the tooth from its pain with all skill, and delay in eradicating it.
Non est enim quod uicem eius suppleat quando eradicatur: quoniam est substantia sublimis: donec quando non est excusatio de eradicatione eius, tunc oportet quando cogitur infirmus eradicare ipsum, ut firmetur, et certificetur apud te dens dolens.	For it is not the case that its place will be filled when it is eradicated: since it is a noble substance: until when there is no excuse for eradicating it, then it is necessary to eradicate it when the weak person is compelled, so that it may be strengthened and certified by you as the tooth that hurts.
Multotiens enim decipit infirmum dolor, et putat quia est in dente saha et eradicat ipsum: deinde non recedit dolor, donec eradicetur dens infirmus.	For indeed pain often deceives the weak person and makes them think that there is a toothache and eradicates it; then the pain does not cease until the weak person's tooth is eradicated.
Nos enim iam uidimus illud ex operatione phlebotomatorum.	For we have already seen this in the operations of bloodletters.
Cum ergo certificatur apud te dens dolens ipsemet, tunc oportet ut scarifices in circumitu dentis cum spatumili, in quo sit quiddam uirtutis, donec soluatur gingiua ab omni parte: deinde moue ipsum digitis tuis, aut cum forcipibus subtilibus in primis paulatim, donec concutias ipsum.	When therefore the tooth that hurts is certified by you itself, then it is necessary that you scarify around the tooth with a spatula, in which there is something of virtue, until the gum is loosened from all parts: then move it with your fingers or with fine forceps little by little, until you shake it.
Deinde loca tunc in eo forcipes magnos locatione bona, et caput infirmi inter genua tua: quod iam bene tenuisti, ita quod non moueatur: deinde trahe dentem secundum rectitudinem, ut non frangas ipsum.	Then place the large forceps in a good location on it, and the head of the infirm person between your knees: which you have already held well, so that it does not move: then pull out the tooth according to its straightness, so as not to break it.
Si ergo non egreditur, tunc accipe aliquod illorum instrumentorum, et intromitte ipsum sub eo ab omni parte cum facilitate, et conare motionem eius, sicut fecisti in primis.	If therefore it does not emerge, then take some of those instruments and insert it under that part from all sides with ease, and try to move it as you did at first.
Si autem dens est perforatus, aut corrosus: tunc oportet ut impleas illud foramen panno: et stringas ipsum cum extremitate radii subtilis, ut non frangatur in hora constrictionis tuae super ipsum cum forcipibus.	But if the tooth is perforated or corroded: then it is necessary to fill that hole with cloth and tie it with the end of a thin thread so that it does not break during your constriction upon it with forceps.
Et oportet, ut exquisite agas cum scarificatione in circumitu gingiuae ab omni parte multum.	And it is necessary to do this carefully with scarification all around the gum from every side much.
Et custodi fortitudinem tuam, ut non frangas ipsum, et remaneat pars eius, et redeat super infirmum ex ea malicia quae sit maior dolore eius primo.	And preserve your strength so that you do not break it and the part remains and returns above the sufferer from the greater evil that is worse than his first pain.
Et caue, ne facias illud quod ignorantes faciunt phlebotomatores in festinatione sua, et audacia ipsorum super eradicationem eius, praeter quod administrent illud quod narrauimus.	And beware lest you do what ignorant bloodletters do in their haste and boldness towards its removal, beyond what we have narrated.
Multotiens enim faciunt euenire super homines infirmitates magnas, quarum difficiliores sunt ut frangantur, et remaneant radices eius omnes, aut quaedam earum: aut ut extrahant ipsum cum quibusdam ossibus mandibulae: sicut testificati sumus multotiens illud.	For they often bring about great infirmities on men, which are more difficult to break and remain all the roots of it or some of them, or to extract it with certain bones of the jawbone: as we have testified many times regarding that.
Deinde colluatur post eradicationem eius cum uino, aut cum aceto et sale.	Then it should be bound after its removal with wine, or with vinegar and salt.
Quod si accidat fluxus sanguinis ex locis (multotiens enim accidit) tunc tere aliquid ex zegi, et imple cum eo locum: et si non, cauteriza ipsum si non confert tibi zegi.	But if bleeding occurs from the place (which often happens) then take something from zege and fill it with that in the place; and if not, cauterize it if zege is not convenient for you.
Formae forcipum subtilium quibus mouetur dens in primis, sint longarum extremitatum, breuis manubrii, grossi, ut non duplicentur quando cum eis premitur super dentem: sint sicut uides grossorum manubriorum, donec quando stringis cum eis, non dent seipsas, neque duplicentur: breuium extremitatum, et sint ex ferro indo, aut ex faled decenter facti, directarum extremitatum: et in eorum extremitatibus sint dentes, quorum quidam ingrediantur in quosdam, et stringant constrictione decenti, forti.	The shapes of the fine forceps with which the tooth is moved at first should be long in their extremities, short in their arms, and thick so that they do not bend when pressed upon the tooth: let them be like what you see as thick armors, until when you tie with them, they do not bite themselves nor bend: short extremities, and let them be made of tempered iron or well-forged steel, straight in their extremities: and on their extremities should be teeth that enter into certain ones and bind with decent constriction, strong.
Et quandoque fiunt extremitates sicut forma oris auis quae nominatur ciconia, et sunt fortis constrictionis.	And when they occur, extremities are formed like the beak of a bird called a heron, and they are strong in their constricting nature.
¶ De eradicatione Dentium, et extractione ossium mandibularum fractorum.	On the removal of teeth, and the extraction of fractured jaw bones.
Caput XXXI.	Chapter 31.
Quando remanet apud eradicationem Dentis qui frangitur aliquid, tunc oportet ut ponas super locum cotum cum butyro die uno, aut duobus diebus, donec mollificetur locus: deinde intromitte ad ipsum algasti, aut forcipes: quorum extremitates assimilantur ori auis quae nominatur ciconia.	When there is something left over during the removal of a tooth that breaks, then it is necessary to place a plug or poultice on the spot for one day, or two days, until the spot becomes soft: then introduce into it a gag or forceps: whose ends resemble the beak of a bird called a heron.
Forma autem haec est forcipum.	The form of this is a forceps.
Sint extremitates eorum factae sicut lima deintus: aut sicut aliskilfegi.	Let the ends of them be made like a file inwardly, or like an alkali-fig.
Si ergo non obedit tibi ad exitum cum istis forcipibus, tunc oportet, ut caues super radicem, et detegas carnem totam, et intromittas instrumentum quod nominatur Palanca parua, cuius forma est haec.	If therefore it does not yield to you at the exit with these forceps, then it is necessary that you cauterize above the root, and remove all the flesh, and introduce the instrument called a small lever, whose form is this.
Sit breuis extremitatis, grossae parumper: et non sit imbibitum, ut non frangatur.	Let the short end be thick for a little while: and not be wet, so that it will not break.
Si ergo egreditur radix per illud, est bonum: et si non, iuuare oportet cum istis instrumentis aliis quorum formae sunt istae.	If therefore the root emerges through this, it is good: and if not, it is necessary to help with these other instruments whose forms are these.
Forma primi triangulatae extremitatis, in qua est quaedam grossitudo.	The form of the first instrument is a triangular end, having some thickness.
Forma triangulatae extremitatis subtilis.	The form of the triangular end is subtle.
Etiam iuuatur cum hoc instrumento habente duos ramos, cuius haec est forma.	And it is also helped with this instrument having two branches, whose form is this.
Et cum aliis instrumentis et ferramentis quae praecesserunt in rasione dentium.	And with other instruments and tools that have preceded for tooth extraction.
Etiam sit iuuamentum cum hoc instrumento quod assimilatur uncino magno, huius formae, triangulatae extremitatis tortae, in qua est quiddam grossitudinis, ut non frangatur: et sit non imbibitum.	And it is also helped with this instrument that resembles a large hook, of this form, a twisted triangular end, having some thickness, so that it will not break: and let it be not wet.
Et scias, quod instrumenta dentium sunt multa: et similiter reliqua instrumenta non computantur, et artifex prudens, subtilis in arte sua inuenit per se ipsum instrumentum, secundum quod significant ei operatio et aegritudines ipsae.	And know that the instruments of teeth are many: and similarly other instruments do not count, and a wise and skilled craftsman finds for himself an instrument according to what is required by the operation and ailments themselves.
Quoniam ex agritudinibus sunt ad quas non dixerunt antiqui instrumentum, propter diuersitatem specierum earum.	Because from ailments are those to which ancient people did not mention an instrument, due to the diversity of their kinds.
Si autem frangatur os ex mandibula, aut ex aliis ossibus oris, aut putrefit: tunc perscrutare super ipsum in loco suo cum eo quod conuenit ei ex instrumentis et forcipibus quae dixi in extractione radicum, et iuuare cum gesti, cuius forma est haec.	But if the jawbone is broken from the mandible or from other bones of the face, or it has begun to putrefy: then search on top of it in its place with what suits it from the instruments and forceps that I mentioned in extracting roots, and help with a gesture whose form is this.
Sit in eo quiddam grossitudinis paulatim, ut stringatur, uel teneatur cum eo os, et non fugiat et uadat, donec egrediatur os: et restaura locum cum medicinis conuenientibus ad illud.	Let something of thickness be placed in it gradually, so that it is tied or held with the bone, and does not flee or move away, until the bone goes out: and restore the place with medicines suitable for it.
Si autem in osse est putredo parua, tunc rade ipsum a putredine sua, et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	But if there is a small rot in the bone, then scrape it away from its own rot, and care for it until it is healed.
De serratura Dentium eminentium super alios.	On cutting out prominent teeth over others.
Caput XXXII.	Head XXXII.
Quando Dentes eminent non secundum cursum suum naturalem, foeda fit per illud forma: et praecipue quando accidit illud in mulieribus, et puellis, scilicet uenalibus.	When prominent teeth do not follow their natural course and become deformed because of this shape; and especially when this happens to women and girls, namely those with venereal disease.
Oportet ergo ut consideres.	Therefore you should consider.
Nam si dens est natus post dentem alium, et non locatur, uel est possibilis eius serratura, neque limatura ipsius: tunc eradica ipsum: et si est annexus cum dente alio, tunc incide ipsum cum isto instrumento, cuius haec est forma.	For if a tooth is born after another tooth and does not fit, or it is possible to cut it off or smooth it down: then pull it out; and if it is connected to another tooth, then cut it off with this tool, whose form is this.
Est simile rostro paruo, et fit ex ferro indo, acutae extremitatis ualde.	It is similar to a small rasp, and is made from an iron rod, very sharp at the end.
Et sit incisio tua qua ipsum incidis in diebus multis, et propter duriciem dentis, et ut non commoueatur alius ex dentibus.	And let your cut be such that you cut it off on many days, and because of the hardness of the tooth, and so that another tooth is not disturbed.
Si autem est eminens expositus limaturae suae: tunc lima ipsum cum lima ex indo, cuius forma est haec.	But if it is prominent and exposed to its own smoothing: then smooth it with a file from an iron rod, whose form is this.
Sit totum ex indo, et manubrium eius minutorum punctorum ualdae, sicut lima cum qua fiunt acus: cum quo limetur dens paulatim in diebus multis cum facilitate, ut non commoueatur dens, et cadat: deinde leni ipsum, in fine rade ipsum cum quibusdam rasoriis.	Let the whole thing be from an iron rod, and its handle have small pointed tips very sharp, like a file with which needles are made: with which the tooth is gradually filed down over many days with ease, so that it does not become disturbed, and falls out; then smooth it off, and finally scrape it with certain rasps.
Quod si est dens, ex quo frangatur pars, et laedit linguam: tunc oportet ut limes eum etiam, donec auferatur asperitas illius fractionis, et aequetur: et applanetur, et non laedat linguam, neque corrumpat sermonem.	If there is a tooth that breaks and causes harm to the tongue, then it is necessary to trim it too, until the roughness of the fracture is removed, and smoothed: and not hurt the tongue, nor corrupt speech.
¶ De retatione Dentium cum filis auri.	On the removal of teeth with gold wires.
Caput XXXIII.	Chapter 33.
Quando accidit Dentibus anterioribus concussio et commotio a percussione, aut casu: et non potest infirmus stringere super illud quod comedit ut non cadat: et curasti eos cum medicinis stipticis, et non ualuit curatio: tunc ingenium in eis est, ut stringantur cum filo auri: quoniam argentum fit uiride, et putrefit post dies: sed aurum nunquam mutatur.	When the front teeth are shaken and moved by a blow or fall, and an infirm person cannot hold what they have eaten without it falling out; and you have treated them with stiptic medicines, but the cure has not worked: then there is ingenuity in this, that they should be bound with a gold wire: for silver turns green and putrefies after days: but gold never changes.
Et sit filum medium in subtilitate et grossicie secundum quantitatem quod capiat inter Dentes.	And let the thread be of a moderate fineness and thickness, according to the quantity that will fit between the teeth.
Et forma quidem retationis est, ut accipias filum, et intromittas duplum eius inter duos dentes sanos: deinde texeas cum duabus extremitatibus fili inter dentes motos, siue unus sit, aut plures, donec peruenias cum tela usque ad dentem sanum alterius partis.	And the form of the binding is, that you take a thread and insert double its length between two healthy teeth: then tie it with both ends of the thread between the movable teeth, whether one or more, until you reach the end of the thread to the healthy tooth on the other side.
Deinde itera texturam usque ad partem a qua incaepisti: et stringe manum tuam cum subtilitate et sapientia, donec non remoueatur prorsus: et sit constrictio tua qua stringis filum, apud radices dentium, ut non euadat.	Then continue to tie the texture up to the part where you started: and bind your hand with subtlety and wisdom, until it is not at all loosened: and let your constriction be such that you bind the thread around the roots of the teeth, so that it will not come loose.
Deinde incide extremitates fili superfluentes cum forficibus: et aggrega utrumque, et conuerte eas cum gesti: et occulta ipsas inter dentem sanum et dentem motum, ut non laedat linguam: deinde dimittatur ita strictum dum remanet.	Then cut off the excess threads with scissors: and gather both ends together, and turn them back into their original shape: and hide them between the healthy tooth and the movable tooth, so that they do not harm the tongue: then let it be left thus bound until it remains.
Si autem soluitur, aut inciditur, stringe eos cum filo alio, et stabit cum eo taliter tempore toto.	But if it comes undone or is cut, bind them again with another thread, and it will stay thus for a whole time.
Et haec est forma Dentium, et figura retationis duorum dentium sanorum, et duorum dentium motorum, sicut uides.	And this is the form of teeth and the figure of the binding of two healthy teeth and two movable teeth, as you see.
Et quandoque fit, ut redeat dens unus, aut duo post casum urriusque in locis suis, et retentur sicut narrauimus, et remaneant: et non facit illud nisi artifex, prudens, et expertus.	And sometimes it happens that one tooth or two returns to its place after a fall, and remains as we narrated, and does not occur unless the craftsman is skillful and experienced.
Et quandoque aptatur aliquod ex ossibus uaccinis: et fit ex eo sicut forma dentis, et ponitur in loco, ex quo munitur dens et stringitur, sicut diximus: et remanet, et seruitur cum eo tempore longo.	And sometimes a bone from the shin fits together: and it becomes like the form of a tooth, and is placed in the position where the tooth is rooted and bound, as we said: and it remains and serves with it for a long time.
¶ De incisione ligamenti quod accidit sub lingua, et prohibet loquelam.	On the cutting of the ligament that occurs under the tongue, and prevents speech.
Caput XXXIIII.	Chapter 34.
Quandoque ligamentum hoc quod accidit sub lingua, est aut naturale, cum quo nascitur homo, aut accidentale, a uulnere quod iam consolidatum est.	Sometimes this ligament that occurs under the tongue is natural, which accompanies a person from birth, or accidental, caused by a wound that has already been consolidated.
Et operatio in eo est, ut aperias os infirmi in capite eius in sinu tuo, et eleua linguam eius: deinde incide illud ligamentum neruosum per latitudinem, donec soluatur lingua a retentione sua.	And the operation is to open the patient's mouth in your lap and lift up his tongue: then cut that fibrous ligament from side to side, until the tongue is released from its constriction.
Quod si in eo fuerit quiddam duriciei et nodationis, et fuerit illud ex consolidatione uulneris: tunc proiice in illud uncinum, et finde illud per latitudinem, donec incidas ligamentum, et soluatur nodatio.	And if there is something hard and knotty in it, and that is from the consolidation of a wound: then throw in it a hook, and find it from side to side, until you cut the ligament, and the knot will be loosed.
Et caue, ne sit fissura in profundo carnis, et incidas arteriam illic, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	And beware lest there be a tear in the deep flesh, and you cut an artery there, and bleeding occurs.
Deinde colluatur in uestigio incisionis cum aqua rosata, aut cum aceto, aut aqua frigida.	Then apply to the incision with rosewater, or vinegar, or cold water.
Deinde pone sub lingua licinium ex lino, quod teneat infirmus in omni nocte: ut non consolidetur secundo.	Then place a linen pad under the tongue that the patient should wear every night: so that it will not consolidate again.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis, tunc pone super locum zegi tritum.	But if bleeding occurs, then apply powdered alum above the spot.
Si uero uincit te sanguis, tunc cauteriza locum cum cauterio lentiginoso, quod conuenit ad illud: deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	But if the blood overflows, then cauterize the spot with a caustic, which is suitable for it; then care for it with the rest of the treatment until it heals.
¶ De extractione Ranulae quae fit sub lingua.	On the removal of a ranula that forms under the tongue.
Caput XXXV.	Head Thirty-Five.
Quandoque accidit sub lingua apostema quod assimilatur Ranae paruae, prohibens linguam ab operatione sua naturali: et fortasse magnificatur adeo, donec implet os.	Sometimes it happens that a pustule forms under the tongue, resembling a small frog's skin, which prevents the tongue from performing its natural function; and it may swell up so much that it fills the mouth.
Et operatio in eo est, ut aperias os infirmi coram sole: et considera apostema.	And the operation for this is to open the patient's mouth before the sun and examine the pustule.
Si ergo uides ipsum fusci coloris, aut nigri, durum, cui non inuenit infirmus sensum: tunc non tangas ipsum, quoniam est cancer.	If then you see it is of a dark or black color, hard and insensitive to the touch, so that the patient cannot feel it; then do not touch it, for it is a cancer.
Et si est decliue ad albedinem, in quo est humiditas, tunc proiice in ipsum uncinum, et incide ipsum cum spatumili subtili, et libera ipsum ab omni parte.	And if it is pale and has moisture, then insert a needle into it, and cut the pustule with a sharp, fine scalpel, and free it from all parts.
Quod si uincit te sanguis in hora tuae operationis, tunc pone super ipsum zegi tritum, donec abscindatur sanguis: deinde redi ad operationem tuam, donec extrahas ipsum cum complemento eius.	And if blood flows on you during your hour of operation, then place a piece of crushed zengi above it until the bleeding ceases: afterwards return to your operation and extract the pustule with its contents.
Deinde colluatur cum aceto et sale: et cura ipsum reliqua curatione conueniente ad illud, donec sanetur.	Then wrap it in vinegar and salt: and care for it with a suitable remaining treatment until it heals.
¶ De curatione apostematis duarum Amigdalarum.	On the cure of a pustule affecting both tonsils.
Caput XXXVI.	Head Thirty-Six.
Quandoque accidunt inter guttur godad, id est, glandulae, quae similantur algodad, quae accidunt deforis: et nominantur duae Amigdalae: quas quando curas cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et non sanantur, tunc considera.	Sometimes swellings occur between the throat's glands, which are similar to those that occur externally and are called two Tonsils; and when you treat them as we mentioned earlier, but they do not heal, then examine.
Si ergo est apostema durum, fusci coloris, pauci sensus: tunc non tangas ipsum cum ferro.	If it is a hard pustule of dark color and little sensitivity: then do not touch it with iron.
Et si est rubei coloris, et radix eius est grossa: tunc non tangas ipsum etiam cum ferro, timens fluxum sanguinis, imo dimitte ipsum, donec maturetur.	And if it is of red color and its root is thick: then do not touch it with iron, fearing the flow of blood; rather leave it alone until it matures.
Et tunc aut perforabis ipsum: aut rumpetur per se.	And then either pierce it or allow it to burst on its own.
Et si est albi coloris, rotundum, et est radix eius subtilis: tunc oportet ipsum incidi.	And if it is of white color, round, and the root is fine: then it is necessary to cut it.
Et operatio in ipso est, ut consideres ante operationem suam, si quieuit apostema eius calidum quiete completum, aut imminuitur quadam diminutione: tunc ergo fac sedere infirmum coram sole, et caput eius sit in sinu tuo: et aperi os eius, et accipiat seruiens inter manus suas, et premat linguam eius inferius cum instrumento, cuius haec est forma.	And the operation is this: that you consider beforehand the wound of the patient, whether it has cooled completely and quietly or diminished by some diminution. Then, therefore, make the sick person sit before the sun, and his head be in your bosom; and open his mouth, and let the servant take hold between your hands, and press down his tongue with an instrument, whose form this is.
Fiat ex argento, aut aere, quod sit subtile sicut cultellus.	Let it be made of silver or copper, so that it may be as thin as a razor.
Cum ergo premis cum eo linguam, et ostenditur tibi apostema, et cadit super ipsum uisus tuus: tunc accipe uncinum, et fige ipsum in amigdalam, et extrahe eam ad exteriora quantum potes, praeter quod trahas cum ea aliquid ex tunicis.	When you then press with it the tongue and the wound is shown to you and falls upon it as far as your sight reaches: then take a forceps and insert it into the tonsil and bring out as much of it as you can, except that you remove something from the tunics.
Deinde incide eam cum instrumento, cuius haec est forma quae sequitur.	Then cut it with an instrument, whose form follows this:
Assimilatur forficibus: uerumtamen extremitates eius sint curuatae, ita quod orificium cuiusque earum est in directo alterius acute: unde cura ut sit ex ferro indo, aut alfuled imbibitum.	It is assimilated to scissors: yet the extremities of each are bent, so that the opening of each is on a straight edge of the other sharp one: therefore take care that it be made of iron inlaid, or else bronze anointed.
Si autem non est praesens hoc instrumentum, tunc incide ipsum cum spatumili, cuius haec est forma.	But if this instrument is not present, then cut it with a spatula, whose form follows this:
Sit acutum a parte una, non acutum a parte altera.	Be sharp on one side, not sharp on the other.
Et postquam incidis amigdalam unam, incide alteram secundum hanc eandem speciem incisionis.	And after you have cut out one tonsil, cut out the other according to this same form of incision.
Deinde post incisionem gargarizet infirmus cum aqua frigida, aut cum aceto et aqua.	Then after the incision, let the patient gargle with cold water, or with vinegar and water.
Si autem accidat ei fluxus sanguinis, gargarizet cum aqua in qua bulliti sunt cortices granatorum: aut folia myrti, et similia illis ex stipticis, donec abscindatur fluxus sanguinis: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	But if bleeding occurs to him, let him gargle with water in which the rinds of pomegranates have been boiled: or myrtle leaves and similar things from stiptics, until the flow of blood ceases: then take care of him until he is healed.
Et quandoque nascuntur in gutture apostemata alia, praeter amigdalas duas.	And sometimes other abscesses are born in the throat, besides the two tonsils.
Incide ergo ea secundum quod dixi in incisione duarum amigdalarum aequaliter.	Therefore, make an incision accordingly as I said about the equal incision of two almond-shaped things.
Et ego quidem iam medicatus fui mulierem ex apostemate, quod natum erat inter guttur eius, quod trahebat ad fuscedinem, pauci sensus, quod iam fere clauserat guttur: et mulier respirabat a meatu stricto, et iam prohibuerat ei comestionem, et potum aquae: et iam peruenerat ad mortem, si remansisset uno die, aut duobus diebus.	And I myself have already been treated for the woman with an abscess, which had arisen between her throat and was drawing towards blackness, with few senses, because it had nearly closed off her throat: and the woman was breathing through a narrow opening, and had already forbidden her food, and drinking of water: and she had already reached death's door if she were left for one day or two days.
Et apostema tantum ascenderat, quod emiserat duos ramos, donec exierant super duo foramina nasi.	And the abscess had risen so high that it had discharged two sinuses, until they had opened above the two nostrils.
Properaui ergo festinanter, et fixi in unum eorum uncinum.	I therefore hastened and fixed one of those hooks into one of them.
Deinde traxi ipsum, et tracta ex eo est portio magna.	Then I pulled it out and drew off a large portion from it.
Deinde abscidi eam, ubi comprehendi ex foramine nasi.	Then I cut away the part where it was grasped through the nostril.
Deinde feci illud ei quod processit ex foramine nasi altero.	Then I did to her what had protruded from the other nostril.
Deinde aperui os eius, et pressi linguam eius: et postea fixi uncinum in ipsum apostema: deinde abscidi ex eo partem eius, et non cucurrit ex eo nisi sanguis paucus: absolutum est ergo guttur mulieris, et incepit statim bibere aquam, deinde accepit ex cibo.	Then I opened her mouth and pressed her tongue; and afterwards I fixed the hook into the abscess: then I cut away from it a part of hers, and only a little blood flowed out: therefore her throat was cleared, and she began to drink water immediately, then took food again.
Non ergo cessaui incidere ex illo apostemate multotiens tempore longo: et apostema succedebat loco eius quod incidebam, donec prolongatum est nimis et cum ea illud.	I therefore did not cease to cut into that abscess many times over a long period of time: and the abscess kept growing in place where I was cutting, until it became too long with that.
Ingeniaui ergo, et cauterizaui apostema inter guttur.	I therefore conceived the idea and cauterized the abscess between her throat.
Stetit ergo ab additione: deinde ambulaui a parte, et non sciui quid fecit Deus cum ea post me.	It stood still from then on; afterwards I walked away from there, and did not know what God had done with her after me.
¶ De incisione apostematis uuulae.	A chapter on the cutting of a uvular abscess.
Caput XXXVII.	Chapter 37.
Quando descendit catarrus ad uuulam, et apostematur, et est long: tunc ipsa nominatur perpendicularis: et si est in inferiori parte grossa, rotunda, tunc ipsa nominatur uua.	When a phlegm descends to the uvula and abscesses, and is long: then it is called perpendicular: and if it is in the lower part thick and rounded, then it is called a uvula.
Quando curatur cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio: et uides quod apostema calidum quieuit ab ea, et est subtilis: tunc oportet ut incidas eam.	When the cure is being done with what we mentioned in division, and the cure does not concur: and you see that the hot abscess has subsided from it, and is subtle: then it is necessary to cut it.
Et quae ex ea est aggregata rotunda, et non est ei longitudo, et est sanguinea, aut fusci coloris, aut nigri, et non est ei sensus: tunc oportet ut deuites incisionem eius.	And what is attached to it, rounded, and does not have length, and is bloody, or of a dark or black colour, and has no sensation: then it is necessary to remove the incision from it.
In ea enim est timor super infirmum.	For indeed there is fear above the weak one.
Oportet ergo quando uides eam secundum modum quem dixi ex albedine, et longitudine sua, ut facias sedere infirmum coram sole: et premas linguam eius cum instrumento, cuius praecessit narratio: deinde fige uncinum in uuam, et trahe eam inferius: et incide eam cum uno duorum instrumentorum quae dixi in incisione duarum amigdalarum.	Therefore, when you see it as I described by whiteness and its length, make the weak one sit before the sun: and press his tongue with an instrument whose previous narration was given: then insert a hook into it, and pull it down: and cut it with one of the two instruments which I mentioned in cutting both tonsils.
Et oportet ut non incidas ex ea, nisi illud quod additur super naturalem terminum sine additione.	And it is necessary to not cut from it unless that which is added above the natural term without addition.
Nam si tu incidis ex ea plus, laedes uocem et sermonem.	For if you cut from it more, you will harm the voice and speech.
Deinde post incisionem utere eo quod narrauimus in incisione duarum amigdalarum: et cura eam, donec sanetur.	Then after cutting, use what we narrated in cutting both tonsils: and care for it until it is healed.
Si autem terretur infirmus ab incisione: tunc oportet ut utaris ingenio in cauterizatione eius absque timore et pauore.	But if the weak one is frightened by the cutting: then it is necessary to use cleverness in cauterizing it without fear and trembling.
Et modus cauterii in ea non est, nisi cum aqua acuta: et est, ut ponas caput infirmi in sinu tuo.	And the method of cauterization in it is not, unless with sharp water: and it is, as you place the head of the weak one on your shoulder.
Deinde preme linguam eius cum instrumento quod diximus.	Then press his tongue with the instrument which we mentioned.
Deinde accipe ex aqua quam dixi tibi in capitulo cauterizandi, et confice cum ea calcem non extinctam, et pone eam non spissam, neque subtilem, et imple ex ea concauitatem huius instrumenti, cuius haec est forma.	Then take from the water which I mentioned to you in the chapter on cauterizing, and fill with it a burnt hoof that is not extinguished, and place it not thick nor thin, and fill into its concavity this instrument, whose shape is this.
Sit extremitati eius in qua ponitur medicina concauitas, sicut concauitas cochlearis radii.	Let the extremity of it, where the medicine is placed, be hollow like the concavity of a radiating bone.
Et pone instrumentum cum medicina super uuulam ipsam: et infirmus sit iacens super latus suum, ut currat saliua ex ore eius ex intrinseca medicina, ut non descendat ex ea ad guttur ipsius aliquid, et laedat ipsum.	And place the instrument with medicine on the wound itself: and let the patient lie on his side, so that saliva flows from his mouth inwardly by means of the medicine, lest anything from it falls into his throat and harms him.
Deinde tene manum tuam cum medicina.	Then hold your hand with medicine.
Et tu ex primas eam super uuulam quantitate medietatis horae, donec uideas eam iam denigratam, et sedatam mordicationem medicinae.	And you shall put it on the wound for a period of half an hour, until you see that it has become clean and the irritation from the medicine has ceased.
Et si uis ut accipias cotum, et inuoluas ipsum super extremitatem radii, et infundas cotum cum medicina, et intromittas radium cum coto in cannulam desuper, donec adhaereat cotum super uuulam.	And if you wish to take a thread, and wrap it around the end of the radius, and pour medicine into the thread, and insert the radius with the thread into a tube above, until the thread sticks to the wound.
Fac illud multotiens, donec consequaris quod uis de cauterizatione uuae.	Do that many times, until you achieve what you wish from the cauterization of the wound.
Deinde dimitte eam: ipsa namque arescit et cadit post tres dies, aut quatuor.	Then let it be: for it indeed becomes dry and falls off after three days or four.
Quod si indiges ut iteres medicinam, itera ipsam: et post cauterizationem absterge in circumitu uuae cum coto imbibito in butyro, et mundifica cum eo quod est in circumitu eius ex medicina: et colluatur cum aqua frigida.	But if you need to reapply medicine, apply it again: and after cauterization, wipe the surrounding area of the wound with a thread soaked in butter, and cleanse it with what is left from the medicine; and bathe it with cold water.
Et curetur extrinsecus cum embrocis, et deintus cum gargarismis, donec sanetur.	And be treated externally with ointments, and internally with gargles, until it heals.
Haec ergo species curationis est salubrior incisione et longinquior a timore.	This therefore is the more wholesome method of treatment by incision and longer to be feared.
Et quandoque curatur uuula etiam cum eo quod est subtilius quam cauterium et incisio: curatur enim cum suffumigatione, secundum hunc modum.	And sometimes the wound is cured with what is finer than cauterization and incision: it is cured by fumigation, in this way.
Sume calamentum, et hyssopum, et origanum, et rutam, et sseah, et chamomillam, et abrotanum, et similia eis ex herbis: et aggrega ea omnia, aut quaedam eorum in olla, et submergantur cum aceto, et bulliant: et olla sit lutata cum luto decenter: et sit in medio ollae foramen, super quod componatur instrumentum concauum secundum hunc modum.	Take calamus, hyssop, origanum, rue, sseah, chamomile, and abrotanum, and similar herbs from the plants: and gather all of them together, or some of them in a pot, and immerse them with vinegar, and boil: and let the pot be coated with clay decently: and let there be a hole in the middle of the pot, on which a concave instrument is to be placed according to this method.
Fiat ex argento, aut aere: et intromittatur extremitas, in qua est granatum, in os infirmi, donec ascendat uapor ad uuulam super cannulam, donec obscuretur uuula multum.	Let a silver or copper tube be made; and the end of it, where the stone is situated, be inserted into the mouth of an invalid until the vapor ascends to the throat above the tube, until the uvula becomes much obscured.
Deinde itera super ipsam multotiens, donec arescat.	Then iterate over it many times, until it is cured.
Et caue, ne facias hanc curationem in principio aduentus apostematis.	And beware not to perform this cure at the beginning of an aposteme's outbreak.
Plaerumque enim addit in apostemate: et non oportet ut facias illud nisi apud declinationem apostematis eius calidi.	For it often adds to an aposteme, and you should not do that unless there is a decline of the aposteme's heat.
Si autem non est praesens tibi hoc instrumentum, tunc accipe cannam, et compone in extremitate eius corticem oui: ut non comburatur os infirmi: quoniam cortex oui prohibet uaporem comburere os: et haec est ex bona curatione cum salute.	But if you do not have this instrument, then take a cane and bind the outer bark of an olive tree to its end, so that the mouth of the invalid is not burned; for the bark of the olive tree prevents vapor from burning the mouth: and this is good care with salvation.
¶ De extractione spinarum, et ossium de gula.	Of the Extraction of Spines and Bones from the Throat.
Caput XXXVIII.	Chapter 38.
Multotiens adhaeret in gutture os, aut spina piscis, aut aliud.	Often a bone or spine of a fish sticks to the throat.
Oportet ergo ut extrahas quod ex eis est apparens super quod cadit uisus, postquam premis linguam cum instrumento apud solem, et declaratur tibi quod est in gutture.	Therefore, you must extract what appears to be on top of it, after you have pressed the tongue with an instrument in the sun, and it is declared to you that it is in the throat.
Et quod non apparet tibi et occultatur in gutture, oportet ut facias uomere infirmum antequam digeratur cibus in stomacho.	And what does not appear to you and is hidden in the throat, you must make the invalid vomit before food is digested in the stomach.
Fortasse enim egredietur res annexa per uomitum.	Perhaps indeed something attached will come out through vomiting.
Aut deglutiat infirmus frustum napi, aut radicem lactucae, aut deglutiat buccellam panis sicci: aut accipiat frustum spongiae marinae siccae lenis: et liga ipsum in filo, deinde deglutiat ipsum.	Or the invalid may swallow a piece of frog, or a radish, or a piece of dry bread; or he may take a piece of dried seaweed and tie it to a thread, then swallow it.
Cum ergo peruenit ad locum ubi sunt spinae, aut os, et extrahitur, tunc egreditur.	When therefore it arrives at the place where the spines or bone are, and is extracted, then it comes out.
Si ergo non egreditur cum eo quod diximus: tunc utere instrumento ex plumbo secundum hanc formam.	If therefore it does not come out with what we said, then use a leaden instrument according to this shape.
Sit grossius quam Radius parumper, et in extremitate eius sit curuitas, quam intromittat in guttur suum cum facilitate: et ipse habeat caput suum eleuatum sursum.	Let it be situated so that the coarse one is a little longer than the radius, and at its end there is a curvature, which should be inserted into his throat with ease; and he himself should have his head raised upwards.
Et caueat a tactu suae epiglotis, ut non accidat ei tussis, et impellat cum eo os, aut spinam, aut intromittat ipsum medicus manu sua.	And beware of touching his epiglottis, lest he should cough; and push with him the bone or spine, or insert it himself with his own hand.
Verum quod infirmus intromittat, hoc est melius: propter scientiam suam de loco rei annexae: et impellat inferius, aut trahat manum suam cum instrumento sursum, totum illud secundum quantitatem quae praeparatur ei, donec egrediatur.	But it is truly better for the infirm to insert [it], that is, this: because of his knowledge of the location of the attached thing; and push downward or draw up his hand with the instrument, all according to the quantity prepared for him, until he departs.
¶ De extractione Sanguisugae.	Chapter on the Extraction of the Bloodsucker.
Caput XXXIX.	Chapter 39.
Quando medicatur sanguisuga cum eo quod dixi in diuisione ex curatione cum medicinis, et non confert, tunc considera in gutture infirmi coram sole, siue apud solem postquam premis linguam eius cum instrumento quod narraui tibi.	When the bloodsucker is treated with what I said in the division of treatment with medicines, and does not concur, then consider in the throat of the infirm before the sun or after the sun, having pressed his tongue with the instrument that I told you.
Si ergo cadit uisus tuus super sanguisugam, extrahe eam cum uncino paruo, aut cum gesti subtilibus decenter.	If then your sight falls on the bloodsucker, extract it with a small forceps or with subtle gestures of the fingers.
Quod si non est possibile cum eis: tunc accipe cannulam concauam, et intromitte eam in guttur infirmi usque prope guttur: deinde intromitte in concauitatem cannulae ferrum ignitum cum igne.	But if it is not possible with them: then take a hollowed-out cannula and insert it into the throat of the infirm up to near the throat; then insert into the hollow of the cannula a heated iron rod with fire.
Fac illud multotiens: et abstineat infirmus ab aqua tota die.	Do that many times: and let the infirm person refrain from water all day.
Deinde accipiat uitreatam plenam aqua frigida, et aperiat os eius in ea: et colluat os suum cum ea, et non deglutiat ex ea aliquid: et moueat aquam una hora post aliam cum manu sua.	Then let him take a full vomit with cold water, and open his mouth in it; and swallow his mouth with it, and not swallow anything from it: and move the water one hour after another with his own hand.
Sanguisuga enim ilico cum sentit aquam cadit.	For the bloodsucker indeed immediately when it feels the water falls down.
Si autem non egreditur cum eo quod narrauimus, tunc suffumiga infirmum cum cimicibus, aut cum asa cum instrumento quod narraui in suffumigatione uuulae.	But if it does not depart with what we have narrated, then suffumigate the infirm person with mice or with a feather with the instrument that I told you about in the suffumigation of the uvula.
Fac illud multotiens, quoniam ipsa cadet.	Do that many times, because it will fall itself.
Et modus operationis in suffumigatione est, ut accipias ollam, in qua sint prunae uiuae cum igne: et olla sit cooperta cum coopertorio, in cuius medio sit foramen: et componatur in illo foramine extremitas instrumenti.	And the method of operation in suffumigation is, that you take a pot, in which are living apricots with fire: and the pot be covered with a coverer, in which there is a hole: and fit it into that hole the end of the instrument.
Deinde proiice suffumigationem, et ponat infirmus os suum in extremitate cannulae, et claudat os suum, ut non egrediatur suffumigatio, donec scias quod suffumigatio iam peruenit ad sanguisugam.	Then pour the suffumigation, and let the patient put his mouth into the end of the cannula, and shut his mouth, so that the suffumigation does not escape until you know that the suffumigation has already reached the bleeding point.
Nam sanguisuga statim cadet.	For the blood-sucker will fall immediately.
Quod si non cadit, tunc itera suffumigationem multotiens.	Since it does not fall, then repeat the suffumigation many times.
Et toleret infirmus sitim, et comedat salsa, et allia, et non bibat aquam.	And let the patient be thirsty, and eat salt, and vinegar, and not drink water.
Necesse est ergo ut egrediatur cum hoc regimine.	It is necessary therefore that it go out with this regimen.
Et haec est forma instrumenti cum quo extrahitur sanguisuga ex gutture, quando cadit super ipsam uisus.	And this is the form of the instrument with which the blood-sucker is drawn out from the throat when it falls over it in sight.
Est simile forcipibus, sicut uides: nisi quia est ei haee curuitas quae intromittitur ad guttur.	It resembles forceps, as you see: except that it has this curvature which is inserted into the throat.
Et extremitas eius similis ori auis quae nominatur ciconia, in quo est asperitas limae: quando comprehendit aliquid, non dimittit ipsum omnino.	And its end is like the beak of a bird called a stork, in which there is the roughness of a file: when it catches something, it does not let it go entirely.
¶ De apertione Apostematum, et eorum sectione, et cura in genere.	Of opening Apoemata, and their cutting, and care in general.
Caput XL.	Chapter 40.
Apostematum species sunt multae, multorum modorum, secundum quod uenit rememoratio eorum, scilicet unius, et unius in hoc libro: et sunt diuersae in perforatione eorum, et sectione ipsorum ex duobus modis.	The species of Apoemata are many, of various kinds, according to the recollection of them, namely one, and one in this book; and they are diverse in their perforation, and cutting from two modes.
Quorum unus est ex specie apostematis in seipso, et eo quod comprehendit ex humiditatibus.	One of which is from the species of Apoemata in itself, and because it contains from moistures.
Et modus secundus est propter loca, in quibus accidit ex corpore.	And the second mode is due to the places in which it occurs on the body.
Quoniam apostema accidens in capite, est aliud ab apostemate accidente in ano: et apostema accidens in loco carnoso, est aliud ab apostemate accidente in iuncturis: et unicuique eorum est iudicium suum ex operatione.	Since an abscess occurs in the head, it is different from an abscess occurring in the anus. And an abscess occurring in a fleshy place is different from one occurring at joints: and each of them has its own judgment based on treatment.
Et ex apostematibus sunt quae non oportet ut perforentur, nisi post maturationem saniei in eis, et complementum eius: et ex eis sunt, quae oportet ut perforentur, dum sunt cruda, et non maturantur secundum complementum.	And from abscesses are those which should not be opened unless after the maturation of pus within them and its completion; and from these are those which must be opened while still raw, and do not mature according to its completion.
Sicut apostemata quae sunt propinqua iuncturis.	Like abscesses that are near joints.
Quoniam apostema quando accidit prope iuncturam, et prolongatur esse eius, donec putrefit quod est in circumitu eius fortasse corrumpuntur ligamenta, aut nerui illius iuncturae: quare est caussa propior contractionis illius membri.	For since an abscess when it occurs near a joint and prolongs its presence until what is inside its surroundings has perhaps corrupted the ligaments or nerves of that joint; therefore, it is a more proximate cause of contraction of that member.
Aut est apostema apud membrum principale: quoniam si tu tardas perforationem eius, donec maturetur, nocebit uel illi, uel per illud membro principali.	Or it is an abscess on the main limb: for if you delay piercing it until it matures, it will harm either that one or through that main limb.
Aut est prope anum, perfora ergo ipsum immaturum: et non oportet, ut perfores, apostema crudum, non completae digestionis, nisi quod est prope anum, ut non putrefiat profundum, et longetur ad interiora ani, et fiat fistula, aut fiat in termino eius quod non sanatur.	Or it is near the anus, therefore pierce it unripe: and one should not open a raw abscess that has not completed its digestion, except when it is near the anus, so that it does not putrefy deeply and prolong itself to the interior of the anus, and become a fistula, or remain at its end and never be healed.
Oportet ut scias horam perforationis apostematis, quod maturatum est secundum complementum: et est apud sedationem doloris, recessionem febris, et diminutionem rubedinis, et pulsationis, et acuitatem capitis apostematis: et reliqua signa.	It is necessary to know the hour of piercing an abscess that has matured according to its completion: and it is at the time of soothing pain, reducing fever, diminishing redness, pulse, and keenness of the abscess: and other signs.
Et oportet, ut facias eandem perforationem in inferiori loco apostematis, et uehementioris eminentiae: et sit perforatio uadens in longitudine corporis, si apostemata sunt in partibus manuum et pedum, et locis lacertorum, et chordarum, et neruorum, et arteriarum, et ad ultimum in omnibus locis aequalibus, quibus non est reflexio.	And it is necessary to make the same piercing in a lower part of the abscess and its most prominent elevation: and the perforation should go along the length of the body, if abscesses are in the parts of hands and feet, and places of elbows, tendons, nerves, arteries, and finally in all equal places where there is no reflex.
In illis autem quae reflectuntur, uade cum perforatione secundum illud membrum.	In those however that are reflected, proceed with piercing according to that member.
Quando uero apostema est in locis carnosis: tunc melius est ut dimittas perforationem eius, donec confirmetur eius digestio, sicut diximus secundum complementum.	When however an abscess is in fleshy places: then it is better to delay piercing it until its digestion is confirmed, as we said according to completion.
Quoniam si tu perforas ipsum ante illud, prolongatur cursus uirus ex eo, et est multae sordis et sordiciei, et fortasse indurantur labia eius, et profunditas eius.	Because if you pierce it before that, the course of the virus is prolonged from it, and there is much filth and corruption, and perhaps its lips are hardened, and its depth.
Et quaedam apostemata perforantur secundum latitudinem corporis apud necessitatem: aut secundum illud quo indiget membrum.	And certain abscesses are pierced according to the breadth of the body in necessity, or according to that which the member requires.
Et oportet, ut administres in apostematibus paruis perforationem paruam, et in apostematibus magnis perforationem amplam: aut sectiones multas per similitudinem magnitudinis apostematis.	And it is necessary to administer a small piercing for small abscesses, and a wide piercing for large abscesses: or multiple sections according to the similarity of the size of the abscess.
Et sunt ex apostematibus, in quibus oportet ut concauetur cutis: et incidatur quando iam facta est sicut pannus, et facta est in termino, quod iam mortua est: sicut illud quod accidit in multis, ut dubelet, et bubonibus.	And there are abscesses from which the skin needs to be blisters: and it should be incised when it has become like a cloth, and has reached its term, that is now dead: just as what happens in many cases, such as boils, and bubos.
Et ex eis sunt quae secantur sectione habente tres angulos.	And there are some that are cut with a section having three angles.
Et ex eis est, ex quo inciditur sicut figura folii myrti.	And there is one from which it is incised like the shape of a myrtle leaf.
Sicut apostema inguinum.	Such as an abscess of the groin.
Et ex eis sunt in quibus administratur sectio rotunda, et sectio lunaris: et similes eis ex sectionibus.	And there are some in which a round section and a lunar section are administered: and similar ones from sections.
Illud uero cui non est caput, sicut sunt apostemata lenia superficialia, oportet ut perfores ipsum perforatione superficiali, uel plana tantum.	That thing which does not have a head, such as mild and superficial abscesses, should be pierced with a superficial or flat piercing.
Et oportet, quando apostema est grossum, et iam collegit saniem multam, et perforas ipsum, ut non properes et extrahas pus totum in illa hora: imo extrahe ex ipso partem eius.	And it is necessary when the abscess is large and has already collected a great deal of pus, that you pierce it so as not to hasten and draw out all the pus at once, but rather extract some part of it from there.
Deinde opila apostema usque ad diem alium.	Then apply a poultice to the abscess until another day.
Deinde extrahe quiddam ex pus iterum.	Then extract something again from the pus.
Fac illud multotiens secundum gradationem, donec egrediatur: praecipue si infirmus est debilis uirtutis, aut mulier praegnans, aut puer paruus, aur senex decrepitus: spiritus enim animalis ab animali multotiens resoluitur cum egressione saniei: et fortasse moritur infirmus, et tu non percipis.	Perform that many times according to progression, until it departs; especially if the sick person is weak in vitality, or a pregnant woman, or a young child, or an old decrepit man: for the spirit of the animal is often resolved from the animal with departure of sickness: and perhaps the sick person dies, and you do not perceive.
Caue ergo hoc capitulum cautela magna.	Therefore beware this chapter with great caution.
Et post perforationem tuam, qua ista perforas apostemata, oportet ut abstergas uulnus: et considera.	And after your incision, by which you cut away the apostumes, it is necessary that you clean the wound: and take heed.
Si ergo est uulnus apostematis paruum, aut est sectio plana, tunc administra licinia ex lino, aut coto antiquo.	If then the wound of the apostume is small or is a flat incision, then apply linen cloth from flax, or old cotton.
Et si est apostema magnum, et fissurae perforationis multae sunt, oportet tunc ut intromittas in omnem fissuram licinium, donec perueniant adinuicem.	And if the apostume is great and there are many holes of perforation, then it is necessary to insert linen into every hole until they reach each other.
Et si in apostemate abscidisti partem cutis, aut in circumitu concauasti eam: tunc oportet ut impleas eam coto ueteri, aut sicut quando texitur pannus, aut raditur lanugine lini absque humiditate: et stringe ipsum usque ad tertium diem.	And if you have removed a part of the skin from the apostume, or hollowed it out around it: then it is necessary to fill it with old cotton, or as when cloth is sewn together, or cleansed with fine linen without moisture: and bind it tightly until the third day.
Deinde proiice ipsum, et cura illud cum eo quod oportet ex unguento, donec sanetur.	Then throw that away, and care for it as is necessary with an ointment, until it heals.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis in hora tuae operationis, tunc administra aquam frigidam, et acetum, postquam imbibitur in eis pannus: et ponis ipsum super locum fluxus sanguinis multotiens.	But if bleeding occurs at the time of your operation, then apply cold water and vinegar, after a cloth has been dipped in them: and place it over the place of bleeding many times.
Si autem perseuerat fluxus sanguinis, tunc oportet ut administres regimen, et curationem, et pulueres, quae narraui in locis multis huius nostri libri, et ex diuisione.	But if the bleeding persists, then it is necessary that you apply a treatment, and cure, and powders which I narrated in many places of this our book, and from the division.
Si autem est in tempore hyemis, et locus apostematis est multorum neruorum: tunc oportet ut infundas puluillos cum uino, et oleo calidis: et ponas eos super loca.	But if it is winter time, and the location of the apostume is near many nerves: then it is necessary that you mix powders with wine and hot oil: and place them over the places.
Et si fuerit in aestate, et loca sunt carnosa: tunc oportet ut ponas puluillos imbibitos in aqua, et oleo, aut eum uino et oleo, et totum illud frigidum.	And if it is in the summer and the areas are fleshy: then you should put poultices soaked in water and oil, or one with wine and oil, and the whole thing cold.
Donec quando erit dies tertius, sicut diximus, tunc oportet ut soluas apostema, et abstergas ipsum, et administres in curatione eius quod ei conuenit, donec sanetur.	Until the third day, as we said, then you should open the abscess, and wipe it clean, and apply to its cure what is suitable for it, until it heals.
Hoc est ergo quod necessarium est ex cognitione curationis apostematum uniuersaliter.	This is therefore what is necessary from the knowledge of the cure of abscesses universally.
Secundum semitam uero distinctionis, iam dixi de omni apostemate, qualiter est uia ad curationem eius capitulatim singulariter.	According to the true distinction, I have already said about every abscess, how is the way to its cure treated separately by chapter.
¶ De sectione apostematum quae accidunt in cute capitis.	Chapter on the Section of Abscesses that occur on the scalp of the head.
Caput XLI.	Book 41.
Accidunt in cute capitis apostemata parua, et sunt ex speciebus Nodorum, quos continent tunicae, quae sunt eis sacci: quasi ipsa sint hausolati gallinae.	Abscesses occur on the scalp of the head, small ones, and they are of the kinds called nodules, which are contained in pouches that are bags for them, as if they were hatched eggs of a hen.
Et ipsorum species sunt multae.	And their species are many.
Ex eis sunt pingues: et ex eis sunt quae continent humiditatem similem limo: et ex eis quae continent humiditatem similem frisatis et pultibus: et eis similibus, et ex eis sunt, quae sunt lapidea dura.	From these there are fatty ones: and from these there are those that contain moisture similar to mud: and from these those that contain moisture similar to bran and pulse: and those like them, and from these there are those which are hard as stone.
Et in sectione omnium, et ipsorum extractione non est timor, dum apud ipsorum sectionem non facit contrarietatem arteria.	And in the section of all and their extraction there is no fear, so long as in the section it does not make opposition to an artery.
Et operatio in sectione eorum est, ut experiaris ea cum instrumento, cuius forma uenit post haec, quod nominatur Intromissum, donec scias quid contineat.	And the operation in the section of these is, that you should experience them with an instrument, whose form comes after this, which is called the Intromittent, until you know what it contains.
Nam si est illud quod continet humiditas, tunc seca ipsum sectione secundum longitudinem sectione superficiali: secundum hanc formam.	For if it contains moisture, then cut it off by sectioning according to the length of the superficial section in this form.
Et incipe cum sectione ex linea b. ad lineam, g. Cum ergo euacuatur humiditas, tunc excoria kistin quae continet illam humiditatem, et non dimittas ex ea aliquid penitus.	And begin with the section from line b to line g. When the moisture is evacuated, then remove the scab that contains that moisture, and do not leave anything from it entirely.
Multotiens enim redit, si remanet ex ea aliquid.	Many times it returns, if something remains from it.
Deinde submerge cotum in unguento aegyptio, si est praesens: et si non, in aqua et sale: et imple cum eo uulnus, et dimitte ipsum usque ad diem alium.	Then dip the cloth in Egyptian ointment, if it is present; and if not, in water and salt: and fill the wound with it, and leave it until another day.
Ipsum enim corrodet quod remansit ex kisti.	For this eats away what remains from the gallbladder.
Deinde itera super ipsum cotum cum aegyptio secundo, et tertio, et si indiges illo, donec confidas quia non remanserit ex kisti aliquid, tunc enim cura uulnus cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then place the cloth on top of it with Egyptian ointment, second and third; and if you need to, do so until you are confident that nothing remains from the gallbladder; then treat the wound with ointment until it is healed.
Quod si apostema continet nodum pinguem: tunc seca ipsum secundum hanc formam, sectione habente formam crucis: et proiice uncinos inter duolabia sectionis, et excoria ipsum ab omni parte: et conare uirtutem tuam in extractione tunicae quae continet ipsum.	If the apostema contains a fatty knot, then cut it according to this shape, having the form of a cross: and place the probes between the divisions of the incision, and scrape away everything from all parts: and try your strength in extracting the skin that contains it.
Si autem contrarietatem facit tibi arteria, tunc fac illud quod narrabo tibi post.	But if an artery makes opposition to you, then do what I will tell you afterwards.
Et similiter fac in apostemate, si est lapideum, ex sectione, et curatione eadem, secundum quod diximus.	And similarly act on the apostema if it is stony, from the incision and same cure, according to what we said.
Et sectio super apostema lapideum est facilior: quoniam est pauci sanguinis et humiditatis.	And the incision above a stony apostema is easier: because it has little blood and moisture.
Et quandoque sunt quaedam horum apostematum quae sunt in capite in quibusdam hominibus, cum quibus penitus non est humiditas.	And sometimes there are certain of these apostemata that are on the head in some people, with which there is no moisture whatsoever.
Quod est: quia ego secui super apostema in capite mulieris uetulae, et inueni apostema sicut lapis solidus et durus, asper, albus, qui non poterat frangi: et si percuteretur cum eo aliquis proiiciendo, uulnerat ipsum.	Which is because I cut open the apostema on an old woman's head, and found a hard, solid, rough, white stone that could not be broken; and if someone were to strike it with a probe, throwing it away, it would wound him.
In aliis uero apostematibus accidentibus in capite, praeter haec scilicet apostemata quae accidunt in capitibus puerorum, et apud radices aurium, sectio eorum omnium sit sectio superficialis.	However, in other apostemata that occur on the head, except for those that occur on the heads of children and at the roots of the ears, all their sections should be superficial.
Vel pone perforationem eorum semper ab inferiori parte eorum, ut alleuietur cursus saniei ad inferiora.	Or make a perforation in them always from the lower part of them, so that the flow of pus may be eased downwards.
Deinde cura ea cum eo quod conuenit eis ex curatione.	Then the care is that which is suitable for them in terms of healing.
¶ De sectione Strophularum in collo.	On the cutting of abscesses on the neck.
Caput XLII.	Chapter 42.
Multotiens acccidunt ista apostemata in collo, et sub assellis, et inguinibus: et quandoque accidunt in reliquo corpore.	Many times these abscesses occur on the neck, and under the armpits, and in the groin; and sometimes they occur elsewhere in the body.
Et super illa quae ex eis accidunt in collo, sunt unum, et multa: et generantur ab inuicem: et omnis Strophula ex eis est intra tunicam propriam ei, sicut est in nodis et apostematibus capitis, sicut narrauimus.	And as for those that occur on the neck, there is one and many, and they are generated from each other; and every abscess of them is within its own tunica, just as it is with knots and abscesses of the head, as we have narrated.
Et species harum Strophularum sunt multae.	And there are many forms of these abscesses.
Et ex eis enim sunt lapideae: et ex eis sunt quae continent humiditates: et ex eis sunt malignae, quae non obediunt curationi.	And some of them are stony: and some contain humours: and some are malignant, which do not obey treatment.
In illa ergo quam ex eis uides bonae dispositionis in tactu, cuius manifestum est propinquum colori cutis, et mouetur ad omnem partem, et non est annexa cum neruis colli, neque cum guidegi, neque cum arteria, neque est profunda: oportet ut seces eam sectione superficiali a superiori parte ad inferiorem partem corporis ex linea, b. ad lineam, g. et excoria eam ab omni parte: et extende duo labia cutis cum uncino, aut cum uncinis multis, si indiges illo, sicut diximus in apostematibus capitis, et extrahe eam paulatim.	Therefore, if you see a good disposition of the abscess in touch, which is clearly close to the color of the skin, and it moves in every direction, and is not attached to the nerves of the neck, nor to the muscles, nor to the artery, nor is it deep: you must cut it with a superficial incision from the upper part of the body to the lower part, along the line b. to line g., and scrape it clean from all parts; and stretch out two flaps of skin with a hook or many hooks if you need them, as we said in abscesses of the head, and draw it out gradually.
Et est super cautelam, ut non incidatur uena, aut neruus.	And be careful not to cut the vein or nerve.
Et sit spatumile non acutum ualde: ut non addat tibi manum tuam cum incisione, aut inquietet infirmum, et incidas quod non est necesse.	And make sure the knife is not too sharp: so that you do not injure your own hand with the incision, or disturb the patient, and cut what is not necessary.
Si autem incidis uenam, aut arteriam, aut prohibet te ab operatione, tunc pone in uulnus zegi tritum, aut quosdam pulueres qui abscindunt sanguinem, et stringe uulnus, et dimitte ipsum, donec quiescat acuitas apostematis, et mollificetur uulnus: uel incipit et uult putrefieri.	But if you cut a vein or artery, it prevents you from continuing the operation; then place some powdered eggshell or certain powders that stop bleeding in the wound, and bind the wound tightly, and leave it until the swelling of the abscess subsides and the wound becomes soft; or else it begins to putrefy.
Nam sanguis abscinditur tuncia Redi ergo ad operationem tuam, donec compleas.	For blood is cut off; so proceed to your operation until you complete it.
Deinde inquire digito tuo indice, si remansit aliquid ex Strophulis aliis paruis: ergo incide eas, et munda eas.	Then investigate with your index finger if anything remains from the other small wounds; so cut them and clean them.
Quod si est in radice Strophulae uena magna: tunc oportet ut non incidas illam Strophulam ex radice sua: imo oportet ut liges eam cum filo duplato forti, et dimittas eam donec cadat per se absque nocumento.	But if it is a large vein at the root of the wound: then you should not cut that wound from its root; rather, you should tie it with a double strong thread and let it fall until it drops by itself without harm.
Deinde imple uulnus coto ueteri, quod iam submersisti in unguento aegyptio.	Then fill the wound with the old dressing, which you have already soaked in Egyptian ointment.
Deinde cura ipsum.	Then take care of it.
Si inciditur Strophula tota, tunc oportet ut aggreges labia duo uulneris: et suas ipsum statim, postquam uides quia prorsus non remansit superfluitas.	If the wound is cut entirely, then you should bring together the two lips of the wound; and stitch it immediately after you see that there is no longer any excess.
Si autem uides quod remansit superfluitas propter magnitudinem Strophulae, tunc oportet ut intendas ad incidendam radicem eius, et extrahendam eam: et administra suturam quam diximus.	But if you see that there is still excess due to the magnitude of the wound, then it is necessary for you to bend towards cutting off its root and removing it; and administer the stitch as we said.
Et quae ex Strophulis continet humiditates, perfora illam perforatione superficiali: ut appareat tibi locus maturitatis eius: et pone perforationem ab eo quod sequitur inferius corporis, sicut diximus.	And what contains moisture from the wounds, pierce it with a superficial puncture, so that you may see its maturation location; and place the puncture below the part of the body that follows, as we said.
Deinde administra post perforationem licinia cum unguento, et similia eis, ut corrodat quod remansit ex corruptione, donec quando uides uulnus iam mundatum esse: tunc cura ipsum cum unguento generatiuo carnis, donec sanetur.	Then administer licinia after the puncture, with ointment and similar substances, so that it may corrode what remains from corruption, until you see the wound is now clean; then take care of it with ointment for generated flesh, until it heals.
¶ De sectione Epiglotis ab apostemate intra guttur accidente.	Of the cutting off of the Epiglottis from an abscess occurring within the throat.
Caput XLIII.	Chapter 43.
Dixerunt antiqui hanc sectionem in Epigloti, et non uidi aliquem in terra nostra, qui eam fecerit: et haec est scriptura sermonis eorum.	The ancients said that this cutting off of the Epiglottis was done, and I have not seen anyone on our earth who has done it; and this is the writing of their speech.
In habentibus autem synanchiam, oportet ut deuitetur sectio Epiglotis: cum non fiat iuuamentum per illud: propterea, quod omnes uenae et pulmo sunt infirmi.	However, in those having synciesis, it is necessary to cut off the Epiglottis; since it does not provide benefit through that; therefore, because all veins and lung are weak.
In illis uero qui habent apostema calidum in ore, aut gutture, aut duabus amigdalis, quando non est aegritudo in cannali, oportet uti sectione Epiglotis, ad fugiendum ex perditione quae fit ex praefocatione.	In those who have a hot abscess in the mouth, or throat, or both tonsils, when there is no illness in the canal, it is necessary to use an epiglottotomy, in order to prevent loss from obstruction.
Oportet ergo quando uolumus illud, ut secemus Epiglotim sub tribus circulis Epiglotis, aut quatuor, sectione parua per latitudinem, in eo quod est inter duos circulos per quantitatem, quod sit sectio in sifac, non in cartilagine: et iste quidem locus est conueniens sectioni, quoniam est priuatus carne, et uasa sanguinis ab eo sunt longinqua.	Therefore, when we wish to do it, we should cut the Epiglottis under three or four Epiglottic circles, with a small incision by width, in what is between two circles by quantity, so that the section be in membrane, not in cartilage: and this place is suitable for the section, because it is free from flesh, and the vessels of blood are far away.
Quod si medicator est timidus, tunc oportet ut extendat cutem gutturis cum uncino.	If the surgeon is timid, then he should extend the gullet's cut with a hook.
Deinde findat cutem, donec quando peruenit ad cannalem: deuitet uas sanguinis, si uidet ex eis aliquid.	Then he should deepen the cut until it reaches the canal: he should remove the blood vessels if he sees anything.
Deinde secet sifac quod narrauimus: et significatur super sectionem cannalis ex phlegmate quod egreditur ex ea, cum eo quod disrumpitur, et abscisione uocis.	Then he should cut the membrane as we have described: and it is signified above the canal's section from the phlegm that flows out of it when it bursts, and with the vocal cord's division.
Et dimitte uulnus apertum tempore aliquo.	And let the wound be left open for a time.
Cum ergo remouetur hora in qua timetur praefocatio, aggrega duo labia uulneris cutis, et sue ipsam solam absque cartilagine.	When therefore the hour comes when one fears obstruction, gather together the two lips of the wound's skin, and close it up alone without cartilage.
Deinde administra medicinas quae faciunt nasci carnem, usquequo sanetur.	Then administer medicines that cause flesh to grow, until he is healed.
Inquit Albucasis.	Says Albucasis.
Summa huius sermonis quem narrauimus, expositio non est, nisi quando uident, quod aliquod horum apostematum iam opilauit guttur infirmi: et sublimatus est infirmus super mortem, et uult intersecari anhelitus eius: uadunt ad secandum Epiglotim, ut respiret infirmus super locum uulneris quadam respiratione, et saluetur a morte: et propter hoc praeceperunt dimittere uulnus apertum, donec consumatur malicia aegritudinis, et est malicia eius tribus diebus, et quasi ipsa: tunc ergo praecaeperunt suere uulnus, et curare ipsum, donec sanetur.	The sum of this discourse that we have narrated, is the explanation, except when they see that one of these abscesses has already blocked the patient's throat: and the patient is raised up to death, and wants to be cut open by his breathing: they go to cutting the Epiglottis, so that the patient may breathe above the place of the wound by some respiration, and be saved from death: and for this reason they have ordered to leave the wound open, until the malice of the disease is consumed, and it takes three days, and almost as much time: then therefore they have ordered to close the wound, and cure it, until he is healed.
Et illud quod uidi per me ipsum est, quod una ancilla accaepit cultellum, et misit cum in guttur suum, et incidit cum eo partem cannalis pulmonis.	And that which I saw by myself is, a servant girl received a knife and sent it with her into her own throat, and cut off with it part of the windpipe.
Et uocatus sum ad curationem eius, et inueni eam mugire, sicut est mugitus mortui.	And I was summoned to cure her, and I found her groaning, as is the groan of one dead.
Detexi ergo a uulnere, et inueni sanguinem qui egressus fuerat ex uulnere paruum.	I therefore removed the wound, and found a little blood that had issued from the wound.
Confisus ergo sum, quod ipsa non absciderat uenam, neque guidegi: et uentus egrediebatur ex uulnere.	I therefore became convinced that she herself had not severed the vein, nor had it been tied off; and air was issuing from the wound.
Properaui ergo, et sui uulnus, et curaui ipsum, donec sanum est: et non accidit ancillae aliquid, nisi raucedo in uoce: et rediit post dies ad meliorem dispositionum suarum.	I therefore hastened and cleaned the wound, and cured it until it was healthy; and nothing happened to the servant except that she spoke hoarsely: and she returned after a few days to her better condition.
Hinc ergo dico: quod in sectione Epiglotis non est timor.	Therefore I say: there is no fear in cutting off the epiglottis.
¶ De sectione Herniae gutturis.	Of the Cutting of a Throat Hernia.
Caput XLIIII.	Chapter 44.
Hoc Apostema nominatum Hernia gutturis, est apostema magnum, secundum colorem corporis: et est in mulieribus multum.	This hernia is called a "guttural" and it is a great swelling according to the color of the body, and it occurs much in women.
Et est secundum duos modos: aut enim est naturale: aut est accidentale.	And it occurs in two ways: either it is natural or accidental.
In naturali certe non est ingenium.	In the natural one, certainly there is no heredity.
Accidentale uero est secundum duos modos: quorum unus est similis nodis pinguibus.	The accidental one however occurs in two ways: one of which is similar to a knot like a bunch.
Et modus alter, est similis apostemati quod fit ex nodatione arteriae.	And the other way is similar to an apostema that arises from the constriction of an artery.
Et in ipso est timor, et non oportet ut praesumptio fiat ad ipsum cum ferro, nisi in eo quod est paruum: et tu proba ipsum, et inuestiga ipsum cum Intromisso.	And there is fear in this case, and one should not make a presumptive incision into it with iron, unless it be small; and you must test it and investigate it with a probe.
Si ergo inuenis ipsum simile nodo pingui, et non est suspensum cum aliqua uenarum: tunc seca ipsum, sicut secantur nodi: et extrahe ipsum cum eo quod continet ex kisti, si est in kisti: et si non, tunc perscrutare totum eius.	So if you find it similar to a fatty knot and it is not suspended with any veins: then cut it off, just as one cuts off knots; and extract it along with what contains it from the chest, if it is in the chest: and if not, then thoroughly examine its entire contents.
Deinde cura locum cum eo quod oportet ex curatione, donec sanetur.	Then care for the wound with what is necessary from the cure, until it heals.
¶ De sectione super species Nodorum.	Of the division above the nodules.
Caput XLV.	Chapter 45.
Nodorum multae sunt species, et ego iam dixi omnes species eorum in diuisione: et oportet ut narrem hic differentiam inter Nodum, et Exituram: cum sit dubitationem faciens.	There are many kinds of nodules, and I have already said all their kinds in a division. And it is necessary to tell here the difference between a nodule and an exitium, since it causes doubt.
Dico ergo, quod cum Exitura est caliditas, et febris, et dolores uehementes, donec sedatur ebullitio superfluitatis, et completur putrefactio: tunc enim quiescunt febris et calor.	I say therefore that when an exitium is, there is heat, and fever, and great pains, until the effusion of superfluity ceases, and putrefaction is complete: then indeed the fevers and heat cease.
Cum Nodo uero non est caliditas, neque febris, neque dolores, et continet eos kistis sifachin, qui est eis saccus proprius, et est secundum colorem corporis: et est incaeptio eorum sicut cicer, et fit sicut batecha, et maior et minor.	When a nodule is present, there is no heat, nor fever, nor pains, and it contains the knots of sifachin, which is their own sack, and it is according to the color of the body: and its inception is like chickpea, and it becomes like a pouch, greater and smaller.
Et sunt secundum duas species: aut pingues: aut continent humiditatem.	And they are according to two kinds: either fatty or containing moisture.
Et colores humiditatis sunt multi, secundum quod dixi in diuisione.	And the colors of moisture are many, according to what I said in a division.
Oportet ergo, quando peruenis ad curationem Nodi, ut experiaris eum, et inquiras ipsum in primis cum instrumento quod nominatur Intromissum, secundum quod ueniet forma eius in capitulo quod est post hoc.	Therefore, when you come to the cure of a nodule, it is necessary for you to test it and examine it first with an instrument called Intromissum, according to its form as will be shown in the chapter that follows.
Et modus inquisitionis apostematum, et Nodorum omnium est, ut accipias hoc instrumentum, et intromittas ipsum in humidiorem locum, quem inuenis in apostemate: et tu reuolue digitos tuos cum eo paulatim, donec scias quod instrumentum iam penetrauit cutem.	And the method of examination for ulcers and all nodules is this: take this instrument and insert it into a moister place which you find in the ulcer; and then turn your fingers with it slowly until you know that the instrument has already penetrated the skin.
Deinde ultima manum tuam secundum mensuram magnitudinis apostematis.	Then place your hand last, according to the measurement of the size of the ulcer.
Deinde extrahe Intromissum, et considera illud quod egrediur in uestigio eius.	Then withdraw the Intromissum and observe what comes out with it.
Si ergo egreditur humiditas currens, quicunque color sit: tunc seca ipsum sectione superficiali, secundum quod dixi in reliquis apostematibus.	If then moisture flowing out is observed, regardless of its color; then cut it off with a superficial section, as I said in the other ulcers.
Et si non egreditur humiditas in uestigio Intromissi, tunc scias quia est pinguis: seca ergo super ipsum sectione habente formam crucis, secundum formam hanc, sicut docui te: et suspende ipsum cum uncinis, et excoria cutem ab omni parte cum facilitate: et custodi kistin si potes super illud, ut extrahas ipsam sanam cum Nodo.	And if moisture does not issue from the wound after the insertion, then you will know it is fatty. Cut therefore above it with a section having the shape of a cross, as I showed you: and suspend it with hooks, and remove the skin from all parts with ease: and preserve the gauze if possible over it, so that you may take out the healthy part with a knot.
Si autem disrumpitur kistis apud operationem, et non est possibile extrahere ipsam sanam, multotiens enim accidit illud, tunc extrahe ipsam frustatim, donec non remaneat ex ea aliquid.	But if the gauze is torn during the operation and it is not possible to take out the healthy part, often such a thing happens, then take out the fragmentary part, until nothing remains of it.
Nam si remanet ex ea aliquid parum, aut multum, redit Nodus secundum plurimum.	For if something remains from it, either little or much, the Knot will return according to most.
Quod si uincit te, et remanet ex eo parum: tunc imple uulnus apud completionem tuam, quibusdam pulueribus corrosiuis acutis: et stringe uulnus, et pone supra ipsum quod sedet apostema calidum, et cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	But if it overpowers you and something remains from it: then fill the wound at your completion with some corrosive sharp powders; and tie the wound, and place above it what is seated as a warm abscess, and care for it along with the rest of the treatment, until it heals.
Si ergo est Nodus magnus, tunc sue duo labia eius, et cura ipsum cum eo quod incarnat.	So if the Knot is great, then take two lips from it, and care for it along with that which is being fleshed.
Si autem est tibi contraria uena pulsatilis, aut non pulsatilis: tunc propera, et imple locum zegi trito, et dimitte ipsum strictum duobus diebus, aut tribus, donec putrefiat uulnus, et quiescat ebullitio sanguinis: deinde redi ad incidendum illud quod remansit ex Nodo.	But if there is a contrary pulsating or non-pulsating vein to you: then hurry, and fill the place with ground zegy, and leave it tight for two days, or three, until the wound putrefies and the effusion of blood subsides: then return to cutting into what remains from the Knot.
¶ De foris instrumentorum pro sectione et perforatione.	About the external instruments for cutting and piercing.
Caput XLVI.	Chapter 46.
EX Eis sunt formae Intromissorum, et sunt trium specierum.	There are three forms of Intromissors, and they are of three kinds.
Ex eis enim est magnum, et ex eis est medium, et ex eis est paruum.	Of these there is a great one, and from these there is a middle-sized one, and from these there is a small one.
Fiant ex ferro alfulud quadratarum extremitatum decenter, ut festinent introitum in apostemate.	Let them be made of iron with flat surfaces, having four square extremities, so that they may facilitate entry into an abscess.
Et istae sunt formae Experientium, et no, id est, perforantia: et unum eorum nominatur beris, idest, peforans: et sunt trium specierum.	And these are the forms of Experience, and no, that is, perforating ones: and one of them is called beris, that is, perforator: and there are three species.
Ex eis enim est magnum, et medium, et paruum.	One of them is great, and middle-sized, and small.
Conueniunt, ut inuestigentur per ea apostemata, et exiturae, et fistulae, et bubones ab eo quod inter ea est ex ossibus.	They come together to be examined through those abscesses, and exits, and fistulas, and boils that are between them from the bones.
Et aliis fiunt rotunda, tersa, lenia, sicut acus magnae quibus subsellia suuntur, ex citrino scilicet, aut ex aere, aut ferro, aut argento.	And others are made round, smooth, and gentle, like great needles with which the seats are furnished, from citron, that is, copper, or air, or iron, or silver.
Et meliora eorum sunt quae fiunt ex citrino.	And better ones of them are made from citron.
Et fiunt Experientia etiam de plumbo nigro, quae conueniunt ut per ea experiantur fistulae, quarum concauitate sunt reflexiones, ut reflectantur cum lenitate sua cum illis reflexionibus.	And Experience is also made from black lead, which comes together to be examined through those fistulas, whose concavities are reflections, so that they may reflect with their gentleness on those reflections.
Et sunt iterum trium specierum.	And there are again three species.
Quoniam ex eis sunt longa, ex eis media, et ex eis breuia, secundum quantitatem amplitudinis fistulae et stricturae eius.	Because from them there are long ones, from them middle-sized ones, and from them short ones, according to the quantity of the amplitude of the fistula and its constriction.
Forma Vncinorum, et sunt multarum specierum.	The form of bandages, and there are many species.
Quoniam ex eis sunt simplices, scilicet quibus est curuitas una: et sunt trium specierum sicut uides, Magni, Medii, et Parui.	Because from them there are simple ones, that is, those with one curvature: and there are three species as you see, Great, Middle, and Small.
Et ex eis sunt Vncini caeci: et sunt trium specierum.	And from them there are bandages blind: and there are three species.
Et ex eis sunt uncini habentes duas curuaturas, et sunt trium specierum: et ex eis sunt uncini habentes tres curuaturas, et sunt trium specierum: et omnes isti sunt necessarii in loco suo.	And from them there are bandages having two curvatures, and there are three species: and from them there are bandages having three curvatures, and there are three species: and all these are necessary in their place.
Et istae sunt formae Scalpellorum, quibus secantur et excoriantur Nodi, et apostemata: et sunt trium specierum: quoniam ex eis est magnum, medium, et paruum.	And these are the forms of scalpels, with which knots and abscesses are cut and opened: and there are three species: because from them there is great, middle-sized, and small.
Eorum extremitates quibus fit sectio sunt acutae, extremitates aliae sunt non acutae: et non ponuntur taliter, nisi ut cum eis fiat iuuamentum in excoriatione Nodorum apud timorem incisionis uenae, aut nerui: et ut sanetur per ea infirmus, et inueniat tranquillitatem parumper ex adustione quam inuenit apud excoriationem apostematis.	Their extremities with which the cutting is done are sharp, other extremities are not sharp: and they are not placed thus except when with them there is benefit in opening knots at fear of incision of vein or nerve: and so that the sick may be healed through them and find tranquility for a short time from the inflammation which he finds upon opening an abscess.
Istae sunt Magda, et sunt specierum trium.	These are Magdahs and they are of three kinds.
Fiunt ex aere, et sunt similia Radio, cum quo fit alcohol: et in extremitate lata est puncta Spatumilis occultata: et in ea currit ad interiora, et ad exteriora quando uis, sicut uides.	They are made of air and are similar to Radium, with which alcohol is produced. And at the outermost point there is a hidden spot called Sputamile, where it flows inwardly and outwardly as you wish, just as you see.
Forma Spatumilium quae absconduntur inter digitos apud perforationem apostematum: et non percipiunt ea infirmi: et sunt trium specierum, magnum, medium, et paruum.	The form of Sputamile that is hidden between the fingers at the perforation of abscesses: and the weak do not perceive them. And they are of three kinds, great, middle, and small.
Fomae Ventosarum cum quibus abscinditur fluxus sanguinis: et sunt trium specierum, magnae, mediae, et paruae.	The forms of Ventosarums with which the flow of blood is cut off: and they are of three kinds, great, middle, and small.
Fiant ex aere, aut citrino, rotundae, ad longitudinem parumper, sicut uides: et sint ad subtilitatem.	They are made from air or citron, rounded, to a length somewhat, just as you see: and they are fine.
Et oportet ut sint istae species Ventosarum apud te magnae, et paruae: ut abscindas per eas sanguinem cum uelocitate apud necessitatem, et tunc quando non est tibi praesens medicina.	And it is necessary that these kinds of Ventosarums are present with you, great and small: so that you may cut off blood through them quickly in necessity, and then when medicine is not present to you.
Verumtamen non utaris eis in abscisione sanguinis in omni loco corporis, et non utaris nisi in locis carnosis: sicut lacertis cruris, et coxae, et lacertis brachiorum, et mammillarum, et uentris, et inguinum, et similibus eis, ex lacertis carnosis, humidis.	However, you should not use them for bleeding in every part of the body, and you should only use them in fleshy places: such as arms and legs, and thighs, and breasts, and belly, and groin, and similar parts from fleshy places, moist ones.
Et quandoque fiunt ex eis instrumenta parua alia similia corticibus fisticorum, secundum suam formam: quibus abscinditur sanguis quando fluit ex loco phlebotomiae, aut apud incisionem uenae, aut arteriae: et quandoque fiunt ex eis rotundae secundum hanc formam.	And sometimes they are made into small instruments similar to the rinds of figs, according to their shape: with which blood is cut off when it flows from a place of phlebotomy, or at an incision of a vein, or artery: and sometimes they are made into rounded ones according to this form.
¶ De cura Mammillarum hominum quae mammillis mulierum assimilantur.	About the care of human breasts which resemble those of women.
Caput XLVII.	Chapter 47.
Quandoque inflantur Mammillae quorundam hominum apud complementum somni (id est, cum incipiunt pollui in somno) donec similantur mammillis mulierum: et remanent apostemosae foede.	Sometimes the breasts of certain men inflate during sleep at the end of a dream (that is, when they begin to urinate in their sleep) until they resemble those of women: and remain swollen and foul.
Qui ergo abhorret illud, oportet ut secet super mammillas sectione lunari, secundum hanc formam ex linea, b. ad lineam, g. Deinde excoria pinguedinem totam.	Whoever then shuns it, let them cut above the nipples according to the lunar section, following this form from line b to line g. Then they should remove all fatty excrescence.
Postea imple uulnus ex medicamine incarnatiuo.	After that, fill the wound with medicinal ointment.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris cum sutura, et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then gather together the two lips of the wound with a suture, and care for it until it is healed.
Si autem declinat mammilla ad inferiora, et mollificatur propter magnitudinem suam, sicut accidit mulieribus: tunc oportet ut findatur in duobus lateribus suis superioribus duabus sectionibus similibus figurae lunari, quarum unaquaeque continetur cum altera apud fines utriusque, donec sit linea maior continens minorem, secundum hanc formam ex linea, b. ad lineam, g. Postea excoria cutem quae est inter duo labia, et aufer pinguedinem, et administra quod diximus de sutura et pulueribus, quod est necessarium ex curatione, donec sanetur.	But if the breast inclines downwards and becomes softened due to its magnitude, as happens with women: then it is necessary to cut along two upper sections of the sides similar in figure to the lunar one, each section containing another at its ends, until a greater line contains a smaller one, following this form from line b to line g. After that, remove the skin which is between the two lips and take away the fatty excrescence, and administer what we have said regarding suturing and powdering, which is necessary for healing, until it is healed.
Si autem non comples incisionem eius quod oportet te incidere, propter inquietudinem infirmi, aut propter fluxum sanguinis: tunc oportet ut impleas uulnus coto submerso unguento corrosiuo, et dimitte ipsum, donec corrodat illud quod remansit ex pinguedine.	But if you do not complete the incision as you should, due to the patient's restlessness or excessive bleeding: then it is necessary to fill the wound with a poultice soaked in corrosive ointment, and leave it alone until what remains of fatty excrescence has been consumed.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then care for it until it heals.
¶ De perforatione apostematis, quod accidit sub Titillico.	About the piercing of an abscess that occurs under the nipple.
Caput XLVIII.	Chapter 48.
Ista apostemata quae accidunt sub Titillico, sunt ex speciebus Strophularum dura, quae continet kistis, et ex eis sunt quae continent humiditates.	These abscesses that occur under the nipple are of a type called Strophulae, which contain pus, and there are those that contain humidity.
Quae ergo sunt ex eis quae continent humiditates, oportet ut secentur sectione lunari, secundum hanc formam, ex linea b. ad lineam, g. cum ergo euacuatur totum quod est in apostemate ex sanie, tunc imple ipsum coto ueteri, et dimitte ipsum usque ad diem alium.	Those that contain humidity, therefore, should be cut according to the lunar section, following this form from line b to line g. When then all that is in the abscess has been evacuated through pus, then fill it with old poultice and leave it until another day.
Deinde auferatur cotum, et curetur cum unguento conueniente ad illud, donec sanetur.	Then the swelling should be removed and treated with suitable ointment until it heals.
Quod si apostema fuerit ex specie nodorum Strophularum, tunc scinde super ipsum, sicut diximus in sectione super Strophulas aequaliter.	If the swelling is of the type of strophulae (lumps), then cut above it, as we said in our discussion on equal strophulae.
Si autem extenditur uulnus in hoc ut emittat pus, tunc administra in eo cauterium, secundum quod diximus in eo quod praemissum est.	But if the wound extends to this point so that it discharges pus, then apply a cautery to it, according to what we said earlier.
¶ De sectione apostematis quod accidit propter Arteriam et Venam.	A chapter on the cutting of swellings that occur due to the artery and vein.
Caput XLIX.	Chapter 49.
Quando disrumpitur Arteria, et consolidatur cutis quae est supra eam, tuno multotiens accidit inde apostema: et similiter accidit Venae etiam, ut accidat in ea apostema et inflatio.	When the artery is severed and the skin above it becomes consolidated, it often happens that a swelling occurs; similarly, when the vein is cut, a swelling and inflation occur.
Et signa quibus cognoscitur, quod apostema et inflatio sint propter Arteriam et Venam, sunt: quoniam, quando apostema est propter arteriam, est longum, aggregatum in profundo corporis: et quando impellis apostema digits tuis, sentis quasi sit ei stridor.	And the signs by which it is known that the swelling and inflation are due to the artery and vein are: because when the swelling is due to the artery, it is long and aggregated in the depths of the body; and when you push on the swelling with your fingers, you feel as if there is a hissing sound.
Et illud quod est propter Venam, est rotundum in manifesto corporis.	And that which is due to the vein is rounded in the visible part of the body.
Et sectio super hoc apostema est error, et praecipue quod est sub ascellis, et inguinibus, et collo, et in locis multis corporis: et est magnum ualde.	And the cutting above this swelling is a mistake, and especially when it is located under the armpits, groin, neck, and many parts of the body; and it is very great indeed.
Oportet ergo ut deuitetur eius cura cum ferro, et quod ex eis etiam est in extremitatibus, aut in capite, oportet ut deuitetur.	Therefore, the treatment of this should be abandoned with a razor, and what is also located at the extremities or head should also be abandoned.
Super illud ergo quod ex eis est ex inflatione orificii Arteriae, finde in cute sectione in longitudine.	So then, above that which arises from the inflation of the artery's opening, make a cut on the skin along its length.
Deinde aperi sectionem cum uncinis, postea Arteriam: et libera eam ex tunicis, donec detegatur.	Then open the incision with a hook, afterwards the artery: and free it from the tunics until it is exposed.
Deinde intromitte sub ea acum, et fac eam penetrare usque ad latus aliud, et stringe Arteriam cum filo duplo in duobus locis, secundum quod docui te in extractione duarum Arteriarum quae sunt in timporibus.	Then insert a subcutaneous needle under it and make it penetrate to the other side, and tie the artery with a double thread in two places, according to what I taught you about the extraction of the two arteries that are found in time.
Deinde punge locum, qui est inter duo ligamenta cum spatumili, donec egrediatur sanguis qui est in eo totus, et soluatur apostema.	Then puncture the spot that is between two ligaments with a spatula, until the blood that is entirely within it goes out and the abscess dissolves.
Deinde administra curationem quae generat pus, donec cadant ligamenta: postea cura illud cum unguentis conuenientibus ad illud, donec sanetur.	Then apply treatment that produces pus until the ligaments fall away; afterwards care for it with ointments suitable for it, until it heals.
Quod si fuerit apostema propter sectionem Venae, tunc oportet ut teneas manu tua quod tibi possibile est ex apostemate cum cute.	If the abscess is due to a venous section, then you should hold with your hand as much of the abscess as possible with the skin.
Deinde intromitte acum sub loco quem tenuisti manu tua, et fac eam penetrare: et sit in ea filum duplum, donec extrahas ipsum ex latere altero.	Then insert the point under the place you held with your hand, and make it penetrate; and let there be a thread twice as long, until you draw it out through another side.
Deinde liga cum ipso apostema ligamento bono: secundum quod dixi tibi in ligamento uuae, a duabus partibus cum duabus extremitatibus fili.	Then tie with the abscess and good ligament; according to what I told you about the ligament of the grape, from two parts with two ends of thread.
Si autem times quod extrahatur filum, tunc intromitte acum aliam cum filo alio sub apostemate toto apud incisionem acus: preme, et stringe fila tua in quatuor locis.	But if you fear that the thread will be pulled out, then insert another point with a different thread under the entire abscess at the incision of the point; press and tie your threads in four places.
Deinde seca apostema in medio sui, donec quando egreditur quod in eo est: tunc incide superfluitatem cutis, et dimitte quod ligatum est ex ea.	Then cut the abscess in half, until what is inside it comes out; then cut off the excess skin, and let go of what has been tied from it.
Deinde pone super ipsum puluillum quem submersisti in uino, et oleo.	Then place on top of it the poultice which you immersed in wine and oil.
Deinde administra curationem, quae fit cum liciniis et unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then apply treatment that is done with lyciums and ointments, until it heals.
¶ De apostemate quod accidit ex torsione Neruorum.	Of the abscess that occurs due to twisting of Nerves.
Caput L.	Chapter L.
Sicut accidit apostema in Arteria et Vena, similiter accidit apostema in Neruis: quod accidit in eis percussio, aut accidit a labore superfluo, et similibus: et fit plurimum illis in locis adiutoriorum, aut calcanei, et in omni loco in quo mouentur iuncturae: et est apostema graue.	Just as an abscess occurs in the Artery and Vein, similarly an abscess occurs in the Nerves: which occurs through blows or through excessive labor, and similar causes; and it happens mostly to those who are in auxiliary locations, or the heel, and in every place where joints move; and this is a serious abscess.
Similatur color eius reliquo corpori, et est in pluribus dispositionibus absque dolore: et quando stringitur cum uehementia, sentit in eo infirmus simile stupori.	Its color resembles that of the rest of the body, and it is found in many dispositions without pain; and when it is tightened with frenzy, the weak one feels like he is in a similar numbness.
Et non est apostema aggregatum in profundo corporis, imo est sub cute, et ipsum mouetur ad omnem partem, et non uadit ad anteriora, uel ante, neque retro ad posteriora.	And it is not a tumor that has gathered deeply within the body, rather it is beneath the skin, and it moves to every part, and does not move towards the front or before, nor behind to the rear.
Quod ergo ex eis est in iuncturis, non oportet ut inuadatur cum ferro.	Therefore, since what is from them is in joints, it should not be cut with iron.
Fortasse enim accidet contractio.	Perhaps indeed a contraction occurs.
In illo autem quod ex eis est in capite, aut in fronte, finde cutem cum spatumili.	However, since what is from them is in the head or in the forehead, make a cut with a sharp instrument.
Si ergo est apostema paruum, tunc tene ipsum cum forficibus, et abscinde ipsum a radice.	If therefore there is a small tumor, then hold it with forceps and cut it off at the root.
Et si est magnum, tunc suspende ipsum eum uncino, et excoria ipsum: deinde aufer ipsum, et aggrega uulnus cum sutura: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	And if it is great, then suspend it with a hook, and scrape it off; afterwards remove it, and sew up the wound with stitches: and care for it until it heals.
¶ De sectione apostematis, quod accidit in uentre.	On the cutting of tumors that occurs in the belly.
Caput LI.	Chapter 51.
Accidunt quibusdam hominibus multotiens in uentribus eorum, et in reliquis corporibus ipsorum, thelil, quae nominantur Fungalia, per similitudinem ipsorum cum fungis.	Some people are afflicted with these things in their bellies and in other parts of their bodies, which are called Fungalia, by similarity to fungi.
Quorum radix est subtilis, et ipsorum caput est grossum, et conuersa sunt labia eorum.	The root of which is fine, and the head of which is thick, and the lips thereof are turned.
Et est ex eis paruum: et est ex eis quod magnificatur ualde.	And there is a small one among them; and there is one that greatly increases.
Et ego quidem iam uidi uirum, et in uentre eius erant duo thelil, quae erant magis quam rebus aliis similia fungis: non erat differentia inter ea, alba, minutae radicis, et inuersabantur labia eorum, et findebantur, et humiditas currebat ex eis semper.	And indeed I have already seen a man, and in his belly there were two thelils, which were more like fungi than other things: there was no difference between them, white, of small roots, and their lips turned back, and they spread out, and moisture always flowed from them.
Incidi ergo ea, et inueni in pondere unius quasi X et VIII uncia et in altero quasi VI uncia Et operatio in incisione eorum est, ut consideres tunc, si infirmus est humidus, et color thelil est albus, humidum, subtilis radicis: tunc incide ipsum cum spatumili lato, et sint in praesentia tua cauteria in igne.	I therefore cut them open, and I found one weighing about 10 and a half pounds, and the other about 6 pounds. And the operation in cutting them is, that you should then consider whether the patient is moist, and if the color of the tumor is white, moist, fine root: then make an incision with a broad sharp instrument, and have cauteries present to your fire.
Multotiens enim expellitur apud sectionem eius sanguis multus: propera ergo si te uincit sanguis, tunc cauteriza ipsum.	Many times, however, much blood is expelled during the incision. Therefore, if blood overpowers you, then cauterize it at once.
Quod si uides infirmum pauidum et timidum ab incisione cum ferro, tunc accipe filum ex plumbo decenter factum, et stringe cum eo athelul: cuius modus est quem diximus, et dimitte ipsum duobus diebus.	But if you see a weak and fearful patient afraid of the incision with iron, then take a thread made of lead, well prepared, and tie it to his athel with this method which we have mentioned, and leave him for two days.
Deinde adde in strictura plumbi.	Then add the leaden binding.
Non ergo cesses stringere plumbum, quotiens imprimit in thelil, donec abscindatur, et cadat per se absque labore.	Therefore you should not cease to tighten the lead, as often as it may shrink in the swelling, until it is cut off and falls away of its own accord without any effort.
Si autem thelil grossae fuerit radicis, tunc in incisione eius est quiddam timoris et pauoris: praecipue quod est in uentre.	But if the swelling is large and from a root, then there is something to fear and dread in the incision itself, especially when it is in the abdomen.
Verumtamen possibile est, ut incidas medietatem eius.	However, it is possible for you to cut through its middle.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum, ut non redeat.	Then cauterize it so that it will not recur.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur uulnus.	Then take care of it until the wound is healed.
Et caue ne praesumas incidere thelil quod est fusci coloris, pauci sensus, foedi aspectus: ipsum enim est apostema cancerosum: et ego ueniam cum rememoratione Cancri post hoc.	And beware lest you presume to cut into a swelling that is of a dull color, little sensation, foul appearance: for it is a cancerous aposteme; and I will come with a reminder after this.
¶ De cura eminentiae Vmbilici.	Chapter on the Treatment of an Umbilical Hernia.
Caput LII.	Fifty-Second Chapter.
Fit eminentia Vmbilici ex caussis multis.	A hernia of the umbilicus arises from many causes.
Aut ex fissuris sifac, quod super uentrem est: et exit ex eo althub, aut intestinum, secundum quod accidit in reliquis rupturis.	Or from tears or fissures that are above the belly, and it exits through the allithube or intestine, according to what happens in other ruptures.
Aut ex sanguine qui fluit ex Vena, aut ex Arteria, secundum quod praemissum est.	Or from blood that flows from a vein or artery, according to what has been mentioned beforehand.
Aut ex uentositate coartata in eo.	Or from constriction of the ventricle within it.
Si autem est propter fissuram sifac, et exitum thirbi: tunc est color apostematis similis colori corporis: et est lene, absque dolore: et apparet diuersi situs.	If it is due to a tear or fissure, and the exit is through the allithube: then it has a color similar to that of the body, and it is soft, without pain, and appears in different situations.
Et si est propter egressionem intestini, tunc est situs eius, cum eo quod narrauimus, uehementioris diuersitatis.	And if it is due to the protrusion of the intestine, then its location is with that which we have narrated, of a more vehement diversity.
Cum ergo tu premis ipsum digitis tuis, occultatur: deinde redit, et fortasse est cum eo sonitus: et magnificatur multum apud introitum balnei, et laborem uehaementum.	When therefore you press it with your fingers, it is hidden: then it returns, and perhaps there is a sound with it: and it is greatly magnified at the entrance to the bath, and a violent effort.
Si uero est propter humiditatem, est lene, tunc non occultatur quando premis ipsum manu tua, neque constringium, neque additur.	If it is due to humidity, it is soft: then it does not hide when you press it with your hand, nor does it shrink, nor is anything added.
Quod si est propter sanguinem, tunc cum istis signis apparet apostema ad nigredinem de cliue.	Which if it is due to blood, then with these signs it appears as an abscess towards blackness from the swelling.
Si autem est propter carnem natam: tunc est apostema graue, grossum, durum, et figitur secundum quantitatem unam.	But if it is due to natural flesh: then it is a grave abscess, thick, hard, and settles according to one quantity.
Si uero est propter uentositatem, tunc tactus eius est lenis.	If it is due to inflammation, then its touch is soft.
Et operatio in illo est, ut consideres tunc, si eminentia umbilici est propter sanguinem Arteriae, aut Venae, aut uentositatem: tunc oportet ut prohibearis a curatione eius.	And the operation there is, that you should consider then, whether the prominence of the navel is due to blood from an artery, or vein, or inflammation: then it is necessary to refrain from curing it.
Nam in illo est timor et pauor, sicut docui te in capitulo, in quo dixi apostemata propter arteriam et uenam.	For in that case there is fear and dread, just as I taught you in the chapter where I said that abscesses due to artery and vein are.
Quod si eminentia umbilici est propter intestinum, aut zirbum: tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmo, quatenus teneat anhelitum suum, et stet stans extensus.	Which if the prominence of the navel is due to intestine or wind: then it is necessary to hasten the sick person, as much as he can hold his breath, and stand standing stretched out.
Deinde signa cum encaustro in circumitu umbilici totius.	Then signs with a seal or mark on the entire circumference of the navel.
Postea praecipe ei, ut resupinetur inter manus tuas super dorsum suum.	Then command him to be laid back between your hands upon his back.
Deinde circunda cum spatumili lato in circumitu umbilici super locum quem signasti cum encaustro.	Then encircle with a broad spatula around the circumference of the navel above the place which you marked with the seal.
Postea extende medium apostematis ad superiora, cum uncino magno.	Then extend the middle part of the abscess upwards with a large hook.
Deinde liga eum in circumitu forti cum filo, aut cum chorda de serico ligamento firmo: et sit nodus ligamenti alenxotati.	Then bind him around with a strong bandage, or with a cord from a linen cloth firmly knotted, and let the knot be not too loose.
Deinde aperi medium apostematis extensum supra ligamentum.	Then open up the middle of the swelling above the ligament.
Si ergo inueneris ipsum iam captum a ligamento: tunc extrahe alenxotati, et intromitte in ipsum digitum indicem, et impelle intestinum ad interiora uentris: et si inueneris zirbum, tunc accipe ipsum cum uncino, et incide superfluitatem eius.	If then you find it already caught by the ligament: then draw out the swelling, and introduce your index finger into it, and push the intestine towards the inner parts of the belly: and if you find a lump, then take it with forceps, and cut off its excess.
Si autem contraria est tibi arteria, aut uena: tunc circunda ipsum multum.	But if the artery or vein is against you: then surround it much.
Deinde redi ad operationem tuam.	Then return to your operation.
Et accipe duas acus, et intromitte in eis duo fila fortia: et intromitte duas acus in circumitu quem fecisti circa apostema in modum crucis, quas facis penetrare.	And take two needles, and introduce into them two strong threads: and introduce the two needles into the surrounding which you made around the swelling in the shape of a cross, making them penetrate.
Deinde stringe apostema in quatuor locis super acus: et si uis, aufer acus, et dimitte locum, donec putrefiat caro extensa: et cadat per se: aut incide ipsam quando subtiliatur et putrefit.	Then tie the swelling in four places over the needles: and if you wish, remove the needles and leave the place, until the extended flesh becomes putrid: and falls away by itself: or cut it when it becomes soft and putrid.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod oportet ex unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with whatever is necessary from ointments, until it heals.
Quod si eminentia umbilici est ex carne nara in eo, aut ex humiditate: tunc oportet ut concaues apostema, sicut diximus.	But if the protrusion of the navel is from raw flesh or moisture: then it is necessary to drain the swelling, as we said.
Et extrahas sanguinem, aut humiditatem, quam inuenis in eo.	And draw out the blood or moisture which you find in it.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod solidat locum.	Then care for it with whatever is necessary to harden the place.
¶ De cura CANCRI.	§ On the cure of a Crab.
Caput LIII.	Chapter 53.
Iam diximus in diuisione species Cancri, et qualiter est uia ad curationem eius cum medicinis: et cauendum ab eo cum curatione eius cum ferro, ut non ulceretur: et diximus Cancrum generatum in matrice, et cautelam a curatione eius.	We have already said in the division of the species of Crab, and how it is to be cured with medicines: and beware of it when being cured with iron, so that it does not ulcerate: and we said that Cancer is generated in the womb, and take caution from its cure.
Et dixerunt antiqui, quod quandoque Cancer est in loco, ubi possibilis est eius eradicatio: sicut Cancer qui est in mammillis, aut in coxa, et eis similibus, ex membris locatis ad extrahendum totum eius: praecipue quando est incipiens paruus.	And the ancients said that sometimes Cancer is in a place where its eradication is possible: such as Cancer which is in the breast or thigh, and similar ones, from located members for extracting it entirely: especially when it is beginning to be small.
Quando uero antiquatur, et est magnus, non oportet ut appropinques ei.	When it has become old and is large, one should not approach it.
Ego enim non potui sanare ex eo aliquem: neque uidi alium ante me qui peruenerit ad illud.	For I was unable to heal anyone from it; nor did I see another before me who had reached it.
Et operatio in eo, quando est locatus sicut diximus, est, ut praecedas, et soluas infirmum ex cholera nigra aliquotiens.	And the operation on it, when it is located as we said, is to precede and dissolve the patient from black cholera a few times.
Deinde phlebotoma ipsum si inuenis cum repletione manifesta.	Then, if you find bloodletting with a clear filling.
Deinde praepara infirmum praeparatione, in qua locetur cum operatione.	Then prepare the patient with preparation, where it will be located with the operation.
Deinde proiice in Cancrum uncinos qui conueniunt ei.	Then place on the cancerous ulcers those that agree with it.
Postea concaua ipsum ab omni parte cum cute, secundum perscrutationem, donec non remaneat aliquid ex radicibus eius: et dimitte sanguinem currere, et non abscindas ipsum uelociter, imo exprime loca, et absterge sanguinem grossum totum manu tua, aut cum quo possibile est ibi ex instrumentis.	Afterwards, hollow out the entire thing from all sides with a skin, according to investigation, until nothing remains of its roots: and let blood flow, and do not cut it quickly, but rather express the places and wash away thick blood entirely with your hand, or with whatever is possible there with instruments.
Si autem contrarietatem facit tibi fluxus sanguinis grossi ex incisione arteriae, aut uenae: tunc cauteriza uenam, donec abscindatur sanguis.	But if the flow of thick blood makes opposition to you from the incision of an artery or vein: then cauterize the vein until the bleeding is stopped.
Deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with the remaining cure, until it heals.
¶ De cura Hydropisis.	Paragraph on the treatment of Dropsy.
Caput LIIII.	Chapter 44.
Iam narrauimus in diuisione species Hydropisis, et qualiter fit aggregatio aquae: et signa omnis speciei, et curationem eius cum medicinis.	Now we have spoken about the division of types of Dropsy, and how water aggregation occurs: and signs of every type, and its cure with medicines.
Et illa quae curatur cum ferro, non est nisi species asclitis sola: et non approximatur cum ferro speciei timpanitis: neque speciei hyposarcae penitus: nam illud mortale est.	And that which is cured with iron is only the type of dropsy known as ascites, and it does not approach the type of tympanitis, nor the type of hydrothorax completely, for that is mortal.
Quando tu iam medicatus es hanc speciem Hydropisis timpanitis cum medicinis, et non contulit medicatio tua: tunc considera.	When you are already treated with medicines for this type of Dropsy, tympanitis, and your treatment has not taken effect: then consider.
Nam si infirmo iam consecuta est debilitas, aut est cum eo infirmitas alia praeter Hydropisim: sicut si sit cum eo tussis, aut uentris solutio, et similia illis: tunc caue ne mediceris ei cum ferro: quoniam est timor illud.	For if the patient has already been weakened by debility, or is suffering from another affliction besides Hydrops, such as coughing, loose bowels, and similar things: then beware of treating it with iron, for there is fear about that.
Si autem uides infirmum exuberantis uirtutis, neque est cum eo aegritudo praeter Hydropisim solam: et non est puer, neque senex: tunc modus operationis in eo est, ut tu eleues infirmum stantem inter manus tuas, et minister post ipsum exprimat uentrem eius manu sua impellendo aquam ad inferiorem partem pectinis.	If however you see a patient of exceptional vigor, nor is he troubled by any ailment except for hydrops alone: and he is neither a child nor an old man: then the manner of operation in him is, that you lift up the patient standing between your hands, and let someone else express his stomach with their hand pressing water downwards into the lower part of the breast.
Deinde accipe spatumile spinosum, secundum hanc formam.	Then take a thorny spoon, in this shape.
Sit duarum partium acutarum, longum, acutae extremitatis sicut Spatumile.	Between two sharp and pointed parts, long and having an acute extremity like the thorny spoon.
Verumtamen in eo sit quiddam breuitatis paulatim, ut non pertranseas cum eo apud operationem usque ad intestinum, et laedas ipsum.	However, there should be something brief and gradual in him, so that you do not pass through with it into the intestine and harm it.
Deinde considera.	Then consider.
Nam si est generatio Hydropisis ex parte intestinorum, tunc oportet ut elongeris cum sectione ab umbilico quantitate trium digitorum, ad inferiora in directo eius supra pectinem.	For if there is a generation of hydrops from the part of the intestines, then it is necessary that you extend with the incision from the navel as much as three fingers' length, downwards straight on above the breast.
Si uero generatio Hydropisis est propter aegritudinem epatis: tunc sit sectio tua sinistra ab umbilico tribus digitis.	If however the generation of hydrops is due to an illness of the liver, then let your incision be on the left side from the navel, three digits.
Et si generatio eius est propter splenem, tunc sit sectio in latere dextro: et non oportet etiam ut sit sectio in latere super quod uult iacere infirmus, ut non currant superfluitates ad illum locum debilem.	And if the generation is due to the spleen, then let the incision be on the right side: and it is not necessary that the incision also be in a place where the patient may lie as they wish, lest excess fluids flow to that weak location.
Deinde perfora cum instrumento cutem totam.	Then pierce through with an instrument, the whole skin.
Deinde intromitte in illam sectionem, et eleua manum tuam cum Spatumili inter cutem, et sifac, quasi tu excories ipsum: et sit quantitas quae excoriatur quantitas unguis, aut circiter ilud.	Then insert into that incision and lift your hand with the thorny spoon between the skin, and scrape, as if you were removing it: and let the amount that is removed be the amount of a fingernail, or around that.
Deinde perfora sifac, donec perueniat Spatumile ad locum uacuum: et est locus aquae.	Then pierce and scrape until the thorny spoon reaches the empty place: and it is a place for water.
Deinde extrahe ipsum, et intromitte in foramen instrumentum, cuius haec est forma.	Then withdraw it and insert into the orifice the instrument which has this shape.
Et est simile cannulae: fit ex argento, aut aere, aut aurichalco, lene, tersum: cui in inferiori parte sui est foramen paruum, et in lateribus eius sunt tria foramina, duo ab una parte, et unum a parte altera: et facia est extremitas eius incisa, secundum modum incisionis calami, sicut uides: in extremitate eius superiore est armilla.	And it is similar to a cannula: made of silver, or copper, or bronze, thin and smooth: which has a small hole at the lower part of itself, and three holes on its sides, two on one side and one on the other: and the end of it is cut off, according to the manner of cutting a reed, as you see: at the upper end of it there is a band.
Nam quando instrumentum peruenit ad aquam, tunc ipsa descendit statim super instrumentum, ergo euacua ex aqua in hora quantitatem mediam.	When the instrument reaches water, then it immediately falls on top of the instrument; therefore, it drains from the water a middle quantity in an hour.
Quoniam si tu euacuas ex ea plus quam oportet, in hora fortasse moritur infirmus per resolutionem spiritus sui animalis: aut accidit ei syncopis quae appropinquat morti.	Because if you drain from it more than necessary, perhaps the sick person may die within an hour due to the resolution of his animal spirit; or a syncope approaches which is close to death.
Verum euacua ex ea secundum quantitatem uirtutis eius, et secundum quod significant tibi dispositiones infirmi ex uirtute pulsus eius, et ex bonitate eius.	But drain from it according to the quantity of its power, and according to how the patient's dispositions signify to you through its pulse and good condition.
Deinde extrahe instrumentum, et retine aquam.	Then remove the instrument and retain the water.
Quod est, quia retinetur statim propter cutem quae retinet foramen quod est super sifac: de quo narraui, ut perfores ipsum secundum illum modum.	That is because it is retained immediately due to the skin which retains the opening that is above the siphon; of which I have spoken, so that you may pierce it in that way.
Deinde itera instrumentum die altero, si uides infirmum tolerare illud: et extrahe etiam ex aqua quantitatem paruam.	Then repeat the instrument on the next day, if you see the patient can tolerate it; and drain also a small quantity from the water.
Fac illud diebus aliquot sine timore, et custodi te ab errore: donec non remaneat ex aqua nisi parum.	Do that for several days without fear, and keep yourself free from error: until there remains little or none of the water.
Si autem times super infirmum, et dimittis ex aqua rem multam: tunc cura ipsum cum sepultura in harena calida, et sudore multo in balneo et sole, et expectet super sitim: et cura ipsum cum medicinis exiccatiuis, donec sanetur: et cauteriza super stomachum, et epar, et splenem, post extractionem aquae: secundum quod narraui in eo quod praecessit.	But if you fear for the patient and let out a great deal of water: then care for him with burial in hot sand, and much sweating in a bath and sun, and wait until he has an appetite: and care for him with dried medicines, until he is healed: and cauterize above the stomach, spleen, and liver, after draining the water: according to what I have said previously.
¶ De cura infantium qui nascuntur locis urinae eorum non perforatis.	On the care of infants born with unperforated urethral openings.
Caput LV.	Ch 55.
Quando egreditur aliquis infantium ex uentre matris suae, et caput mutonis eius est non perforatum, aut est foramen strictum, aut in non suo loco.	When someone exits from the womb of his mother and his urethral orifice is not perforated, or it is a narrow opening, or it is in an unusual place.
Oportet ergo succurrere cum perforatione eius statim cum nascitur cum Spatumili subtili ualde, secundum hanc formam.	Therefore, one must help by perforating it immediately at birth with a very fine spatula, according to this shape.
Deinde pone in foramine clauum subtilem ex plumbo, et liga ipsum: et tene ipsum tribus diebus, aut quatuor.	Then place a thin metal clamp on the opening and tie it; and keep it so for three days or four.
Quando ergo uult urinam emittere, remoueatur, et mingat.	When he wants to emit urine, let it be removed and he will urinate.
Deinde reduc ipsum.	Then let him be put back.
Et si tu non ponis plumbum, iam possibile est, ut urina quae incedit super locum, non permittat ipsum claudi.	And if you do not place a lead weight, it is now possible that the urine which flows onto the area will prevent him from closing.
Ille autem cuius foramen est strictum, medicatur cum plumbo, sicut diximus, diebus multis, donec amplificetur.	But he whose opening is constricted is treated with a lead weight, as we said, for many days until it becomes larger.
Illi autem in quibus est foramen in non suo loco, laeduntur.	Those, however, who have an opening in the wrong place, are hurt.
Quod est, quia ex eis qui nascitur, foramen est apud finem capitis uirgae: quare non potest mingere ad anteriora, donec eleuat uirgam manu sua ad superiora.	This is because the opening is at the end of the foreskin: wherefore he cannot urinate in front, unless he raises his foreskin with his hand to the top.
Neque est ei generatio, propterea, quod sperma non potest peruenire ad matricem secundum rectitudinem: et est aegritudo foeda ualde.	Nor is there generation in him, because sperm cannot reach the womb according to rightness; and it is a very foul affliction.
Et modus operationis in illo est, ut resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum.	And the method of treatment for him is, that the patient be placed on his back.
Deinde extende caput uirgae eius manu tua sinistra extensione uehementi, et incide caput capitis uirgae ex loco priapi, cum acumine, aut spatumili acuto: sicut est incisio calami, aut sicut tu radis aliquid, ut medium eius ueniat simile capiti uirgae: et ut cadat foramen in medio secundum quod oportet.	Then extend his foreskin with your left hand using great force, and cut off the head of his foreskin from its previous location with a sharp point or a very fine awl, just as you would cut a reed or something similar, so that the middle part may resemble the head of his foreskin: and let the opening fall in the middle as it should.
Et caue tibi apud operationem tuam a fluxu sanguinis.	And beware of blood flow during your operation.
Multotiens enim accidit illud.	For indeed it often happens that way.
Oppone ergo ei cum eo quod abscindit sanguinem, et cura uulnus, donec sanetur.	Therefore, apply to him the substance that stops blood flow and take care of the wound until it heals.
¶ De Albather quae accidunt in praeputio et capite uigae, et corruptione, nigredine, et adhaerentia.	Chapter on the matters that occur in the foreskin and head of the penis, and their corruption, blackening, and sticking together.
Caput LVI.	Chapter 56.
Multotiens accidunt istae Albather in uirga, et est eminentia carnis foedae.	Such Albarths often occur on the penis, and it is a notable sign of flesh corruption.
Et ex ea alia est maligna, et alia non maligna.	And from these others are malignant, and others not malignant.
Non malignam ergo oportet ut suspendas cum uncino subtili, et abscindas eam, donec mundes eam totam.	Therefore one should not let a non-malignant tumor hang suspended with a thin hook, and cut it off until you have cleansed the entire thing.
Deinde pone super eam cotum submersum in unguento aegyptio.	Then place a poultice soaked in Egyptian ointment over it.
Deinde cura ipsum post illud cum unguento dyafinicon, donec sanetur.	Then care for the wound with diaphanous ointment until it heals.
Quod si Albather est maligna, foedi coloris, tunc oportet ut administres in ea cauterium post incisionem eius et ipsius rasionem.	What if it is a malignant Albugo, of foul color; then one should apply a cautery to it after making an incision and cutting off its roots.
Si autem Albather est in praeputio captiui, non circumcisi, et est pars Albather inter praeputium, et pars eius extra: tunc oportet ut auferas Albather, quae est intus in primis, donec quando consolidatur, tunc cura ipsum exterius: quoniam quando tu curas eam simul, non securatur praeputium quin preforetur.	But if the Albugo is in the foreskin of an uncircumcised captive, and it is a part of the Albugo between the foreskin and its outer part; then one should remove the Albugo that is inside first, until it consolidates, then care for the outside: because when you treat it at the same time, the foreskin does not secure itself but rather protrudes forth.
Et iam accidunt etiam in testiculis, et praeputio nigredo et corruptio.	And now also it occurs in the testicles, with blackening and corruption.
Oportet ergo, ut tu concaues totum quod iam denigratum est, et quod uult corrumpi, aut iam corruptum est.	Therefore you should cauterize the entire thing that is already blackened, and what wants to be corrupted, or has already been corrupted.
Deinde line super ipsum post illud cum melle quod iam concussum est cum farina corticum granatorum, et herbi tritorum cribellatorum.	Then apply a poultice over it afterwards with honey that has been mixed with the flour of ground almonds and the leaves of the crumble-leafed herb.
Deinde cura illud cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with the remaining treatment until it heals.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis, tunc administra cauterium cum cauterio lunari, secundum hanc formam.	But if bleeding occurs, then apply a cautery with lunar caustic, in this form.
Cauterium enim est iuuatiuum ad duas dispositiones simul, scilicet ad fluxum sanguinis, et uulnus quando corrumpitur.	For the cautery is beneficial in two ways at once, namely for stopping bleeding and healing a wound when it becomes corrupted.
Quod si corroditur caput uirgae, et destruitur totum in hora: tunc oportet ut intromittas in meatum priapi cannulam ex plumbo, ut mingat infirmus super eam.	What if the head of the penis is corrupted and destroyed entirely within an hour: then it is necessary to insert a lead tube into the urethra of the phallus so that the sick man may urinate over it.
In adhaerentia uero praeputii cum capite uirgae, et haec quidem adhaerentia non accidit, nisi in eo cuius praeputium est sanum, et non exigitur super ipsum circumcisio: et quandoque accidit adhaerentia propter uulnus, aut apostema: oportet ergo ut excories eam cum Spatumili obtuso, donec soluatur ligamentum, et liberetur caput uirgae ab omni parte.	In the case of an adhesion between the foreskin and the head of the penis, which indeed does not occur unless in one whose foreskin is healthy and no circumcision is required; and sometimes this adhesion occurs due to a wound or aposteme: therefore you should scrape it off with a blunt Spatumili until the ligament breaks and the head of the penis is freed from all parts.
Quod si est difficile discernere ea exquisite, tunc oportet ut excories aliquid ex capite uirgae, et ex praeputio.	If it is difficult to distinguish these things precisely, then you must scrape something off the head of the whip and from the foreskin.
Quod est, quia praeputium quando est subtile, fortasse perforatur propter subtilitatem suam uelociter.	What is this because when the foreskin is thin, it may perhaps be pierced quickly on account of its own subtlety.
Deinde separa inter praeputium, et caput uirgae cum panno lini subtili, qui iam madefactus est in aqua frigida, ut non adhereant iterum.	Then separate the foreskin from the head of the whip with a piece of fine linen cloth that has already been soaked in cold water, so that they do not stick together again.
Deinde curetur cum uino stiptico, donec consolidetur.	Then treat it with wine and apply it, until it is consolidated.
¶ De mundificatione infantium, et curatione ex errore eis accidente.	On the purification of infants, and on curing any mistake that may have happened to them.
Caput LVII.	Chapter 57.
Circumcisio non est solutio continuitatis, sicut reliqua uulnera: uerumtamen cum sit ex operatione nostra, uoluntate nostra, et usus eius sit in pueris proprie, est necesse ut signemus in ea operationem meliorem, et uiam leuiorem perducentem ad salutem.	Circumcision is not a breaking of continuity, like other wounds: yet since it is from our operation, our will, and its use is proper in children, it is necessary that we mark in this operation something better, and a way leading to salvation.
Dico ergo, quod antiqui non dixerunt circumcisionem in aliquo suorum librorum: quoniam non utuntur in legibus suis, et non est nisi quod acquisiuimus per experimentum.	I say therefore that the ancients did not write about circumcision in any of their books: because they do not use it in their laws, and we have learned it only through experience.
Quod est, quia ego inueni maiorem partem artificum, et phlebotomatorum uti mundificatione, circumcidendo cum nouacula, et cum forficibus: et utuntur alfecati, et ligaudo cum filo, et incisione cum ungula.	This is because I have found that most practitioners and bleeding specialists use purification by circumcision with a scalpel, and with forceps: and they bind the wounded, and tie them up with thread, and make an incision with a nail.
Et ego quidem iam probaui omnes istos modos, et non inueni meliorem mundificatione cum forficibus, et ligamento cum filo.	And I myself have already tried all these methods and did not find any better purification with forceps, and tying up with thread.
Quoniam in mundificatione cum nouacula, multotiens effugit cutis.	Because in purification with a scalpel, the skin often escapes many times.
Quoniam cutis praeputii duas habet tunicas: ergo forsitan inciditur cutis superior, et temanet tunica inferior: cogitur ergo ad incisionem ad incidendum alteram, et dolorem futurum.	Because the skin of the foreskin has two layers: therefore it may happen that the upper layer is cut and the lower layer remains intact: thus one is forced to make another incision, and future pain.
Et cum mundificatione quae fit per alfecati, id est, digitalis, quo utuntur sutores, non securatur incisio extremitatis uirilis membri: quoniam fortasse ingreditur in foramen eius.	And with the purification that is done by tying up, namely, with the finger, which surgeons use, the incision of the end of the male member is not secure: because perhaps it may enter into its opening.
In mundificatione autem cum ungula, fortasse euadit ferrum, et corrumpit operationem tuam: et cutis quidem pueri est breuis natura, et multotiens nascuntur taliter, quod non indigent mundificatione: et iam uidi illud.	In the process of cleaning with a finger, perhaps iron will escape and ruin your operation: and indeed the skin of children is brief in nature, and many times are born thus, that they do not need cleaning; and I have already seen this.
Mundificationis autem cum forficibus, et ligamento cum filo, bonum experimentum detexit mihi: quoniam forfices sunt proportionalis incisionis: propterea, quod acuitas quae est superius, est sicut acuitas quae est inferius.	However, in the process of cleaning with forceps and tying with thread, I have found a good experiment: because the forceps are proportionate to the incision: therefore, since the sharpness that is above is like the sharpness that is below.
Cum ergo premis manum tuam, proportionantur duae acuitates, et incidunt secundum operationem unam in tempore uno: et fit compressio simili figura, continens cutem uirgae ab omni parte, cum qua non cadit error omnino.	When therefore you press your hand, the two sharpnesses are proportioned and cut according to the operation at one time; and a compression is made similar in figure, containing the skin of the thread from every part, with which there falls no error whatsoever.
Et modus operationis propriae est, ut facias extimare, puerum praecipue, si est ex eis qui intelligunt parumper, quod tu non facis, nisi quod ligas filum in uirga sua tantum: et dimittas ipsum usque ad diem alium.	And the proper method of operation is, that you make him realize, especially a boy, if he is one of those who understands for a little while, what you do not do, unless you tie the thread to his own cord only: and leave it until another day.
Deinde fac eum gaudere et laetari omnimodo quo possibile est tibi illud, ex eo quod recipit intelligentia sua.	Then make him rejoice and be happy in every way that is possible to you, because he receives his own understanding.
Deinde fac eum stare inter manus tuas praeparatae staturae, et non sit sedens: et occulta forfices in manica tua, aut sub pede tuo, ne uideat eos puer omnino, neque aliquid ex instrumentis.	Then make him stand between your prepared hands, and let him not be sitting; and hide the forceps in your sleeve or under your foot, lest the boy see them at all, nor anything from the instruments.
Deinde intromitte manum tuam ad uirgam eius, et suffla in cutem, et trahe eam sursum, donec egrediatur caput uirgae.	Then insert your hand into his cord and puff on the skin, and pull it up until the head of the cord emerges.
Deinde mundifica ipsam ex eo quod aggregatur in ea sordicie.	Then clean it from any dirt that accumulates in it.
Deinde liga locum signatum cum filo duplo.	Then tie the marked place with a double thread.
Postea liga inferius eo parumper ligamentum secundum.	After that, tie below it another piece of bandage in the same way.
Deinde tene cum indice tuo, et pollice locum ligamenti inferioris retentione bona, et incide inter duo ligamenta.	Then hold with your index finger and thumb, and press the place where the lower bandage is tied to retain it well, and cut between the two bandages.
Deinde eleua cutem sursum uelociter, et extrahe caput uirgae.	Then lift up the skin quickly and pull out the head of the cord.
Deinde dimitte sanguinem currere paulatim (est enim melius) et pone puluerem desuper: et super puluerem pannum in quo expansus est uitellus oui decocti in aqua rosata, concussum cum oleo ros.	Then let blood flow gradually (for it is better) and place dust on top: and above the dust a cloth which has been spread with the yolk of an egg boiled in rose water, beaten with oil of roses.
Recenti bono: et dimitte eum super ipsum usque ad diem alium: et cura ipsum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	To recent good flesh: and let it be on top until another day: and care for it with the rest of the treatment, until it heals.
Forma autem forficis ad mundificationem haec est.	However, the shape of the forceps for cleansing is this.
Sint hebetes duae extremitates, et sint incidentes: ne egrediatur in eis ramus claui: et sit longitudo duarum acuitatum, sicut longitudo duorum manubriorum aequaliter.	Let the two ends be blunt and let them be bent: so that no branch of a key may go out of them: and let the length of the two sharp parts be equal to the length of two equally proportioned armlets.
Error uero cadens in mundificatione est: quoniam fortasse effugit cutis intrinseca tota, aut pars eius apud incisionem.	However, a mistake occurs in cleansing because perhaps the inner skin altogether or part of it escapes through the incision.
Ergo oportet, ut extendas eam ex hora tua cum ungue tuo ante apostemationem loci: et incidas eam secundum aequalitatem.	Therefore, you should stretch it forth from your hour with your finger before the inflammation of the place: and cut it according to equality.
Quod si non potes tenere eam cum ungue tuo, tunc extrahe eam cum uncino, et incide eam.	What if you cannot hold it with your finger, then pull it out with a hook, and cut it.
Si autem praeterierint ei tres dies, et remanet quod est sub uirga inflatum, apostematum: tunc dimitte illud, donec sedetur apostema calidum, et excoria illud cum facilitate, et incide illud secundum quod praeparatur tibi: et caue tibi a capite uirgae.	But if three days have passed and what remains under the inflamed area is still swollen with apostema, then let that be, until the apostema cools down, and scrape it off easily, and cut it according to how it has been prepared for you: and beware of the head of the stalk.
Non enim nocebit ei illud.	For it will not harm him.
Cura ergo illud cum eo quod consolidat uulnus ex pulueribus, quos narrauimus in tractatu de pulueribus: et si inciditur ex cute supra mensuram, et euadit ad superiora, non nocet ei illud etiam.	So care for it with what consolidates the wound from the powders which we mentioned in the treatise on powders: and if it is cut above the skin's measure, and goes to the upper parts, it will not harm him either.
Cura ergo illud cum eo quod diximus, donec sanetur.	So care for it with what we said, until it heals.
¶ De extractione Vrinae retentae in uesica.	Of the Extraction of Vryna retained in the Vesicle.
Caput LVIII.	Chapter 58.
Urinae retentio in uesica, fit ab opilatione facta ex lapide, aut sanguine congelato, aut pus, aut carne nata, et similibus illis ex eis quae diximus ex modis curationis in diuisione.	Retention of urine in the bladder is caused by a concretion formed from stone, or frozen blood, or pus, or new flesh, and similar things to those which we mentioned in the ways of cure in division.
Et si non soluitur Vrina, et uides retentionem eius esse propter Lapidem, qui iam est in collo uesicae: tunc oportet ut sit infirmus super genua sua curuatus.	And if it does not heal, and you see the obstruction to be due to a stone that is already in the neck of the bladder: then it is necessary for him to be weakly bent over his knees.
Deinde componantur pedes eius super dorsum eius, et extendat uentrem suum ex superiori parte dorsi eius, et stringat infirmus anhelitum suum quantum possibile est ei.	Then have him place his feet on his back and stretch out his belly from the upper part of his back, and let the sick person take deep breaths as much as is possible for him.
Cogitur ergo cum collo uesicae ad expulsionem Lapidis ad posteriora: quare absoluitur Vrina.	Therefore, he is compelled to bend his neck of the bladder towards the expulsion of the stone to the rear, whereupon the Vrina is absolved.
Quod si non soluitur cum eo quod diximus, et uehemens sit res super infirmum: tunc oportet ut administres extractionem eius cum instrumento, quod nominatur siringa, cuius haec est forma Sit ex argento, et sit subtile, lene, concauum sicut cannula pennae auis in subtilitate radii, longum in similitudine palmi unius et medii: cui sit cannula subtilis in capite eius.	And if it does not come out with him as we said, and the matter is a pressing one for the sick person: then it is necessary to administer an extraction of it with an instrument which is called a syringe, whose shape is this. It is made of silver, fine, soft, concave like the quill of a bird in subtlety of radius, long in similarity to the palm of one and a half hands: and its fine tube shall be at the head of it.
Et modus exitus Vrinae per ipsum est, ut accipias filum duplicatum, et liges in extremitate eius lanam, aut cotum, ligatura bona: et intromittas extremitatem fili in inferiori parte Siringae: et incide cum forficibus si superfluit aliquid ex lana, uerum intromitte in cannulam cum uehementia, sicut alzer.	And the method of extracting Vrina through it is this. You take a double thread, and tie a good knot at its end with a piece of wool or cotton; and you insert the end of the thread into the lower part of the syringe: and if there is anything superfluous from the wool, cut it off with scissors; but then insert it gently into the tube like an arrow.
Deinde inunge siringam cum oleo, aut cum butyro, et albugine oui: et fac sedere infirmum super sedem, et embroca uesicam, et ipsius uirgam cum oleis humidis, et oleo oliuae, et aqua tepida.	Then anoint the syringe with oil or butter, and a white egg; and make the sick person sit on a seat, and have him lean forward, and take hold of his bladder with wet oils and olive oil, and warm water.
Deinde intromitte siringam in uirgam cum facilitate, donec perueniat ad radicem uirgae.	Then insert the syringe into the bladder with ease until it reaches the root of the bladder.
Deinde dupla ipsam superius a parte umbilici.	Then double it back over itself above from the navel side.
Deinde impelle siringam intra ipsam, donec perueniat ad Vesicam, et sentiat eam infirmus iam peruenisse ad rem uacuam: et non fit hoc secundum hunc ordinem, nisi quoniam meatus, in quo uadit, est in quo est tortuositas.	Then push the syringe inside it until it reaches the bladder, and let the sick person feel that it has reached the empty part: and this is not done in this order unless there is a winding passage through which it passes.
Deinde extende filum cum lana paulatim.	Then stretch the thread with wool gradually.
Vrina enim sequetur lanam.	The vein will then follow the wool.
Deinde extrahe eam, et fac currere Vrinam per uiam urinae: et itera siringam, et non cesses facere illud, donec euacuetur uesica, et inueniat infirmus alleuiationem.	Then draw it out and make the vein run through the path of the urine; and continue to do this, until the bladder is emptied and the patient finds relief.
¶ De qualitate clisterizationis uesicae cum Clepshydra.	On the quality of cathartic cleansing of the bladder with a Clepsydra.
Caput LIX.	Chapter 59.
Quando accidit in uesica ulcus, aut sanguis in ea congelatur, aut coartatur in ea pus, et uis distillare in eam aquas et medicinas: tunc fiat cum instrumento quod nominatur Clepshydra, et haec est forma eius.	When an ulcer occurs in the bladder, or blood congeals in it, or pus is compressed in it, and there is a desire to distill waters and medicines into it: then do it with the instrument which is called Clepsydra, and this is its shape.
Est enim surda, id est, clausa.	For it is mute, that is, closed.
Et in eo sunt tria foramina, duo ex parte una, et unum ex parte altera, sicut uides.	And on this instrument there are three openings, two from one side and one from the other, as you see.
Et locus concauus, in quo est illud quod impellit, sit secundum quantitatem quod opilet ipsum sine additione, donec quando trahitur cum eo aliquid, ex humiditatibus attrahatur: et quando impellitur, cum eo expellatur ad longinquum: secundum quod facit clepshydra, qua proiicitur naphta, id est, ignis graecus in praeliis martis.	And the hollowed-out place where that which propels is situated should be according to the quantity that it needs without addition, until when something is drawn out with it, it attracts humidities: and when propelled, it pushes back far away: just as the Clepsydra does, which pours forth naphta, that is, Greek fire in the battles of Mars.
Cum ergo uis proiicere humiditates in uesicam, intromitte extremitatem clepshydrae in humiditatem, et trahe cum eo quod impellit ad superiora, humiditas enim trahitur in concauitatem clepshydrae.	When therefore you wish to pour out humidities into the bladder, insert the extremity of the Clepsydra into the humidity, and draw it along with that which propels towards the top, for the humidity is drawn into the hollowed-out part of the Clepsydra.
Deinde intromitte extremitatem eius in uirgam, secundum quod narrauimus in siringa.	Then insert its extremity into the catheter, according to what we have narrated about the syringe.
Deinde impelle humiditatem cum eo quod impellit illa namque humiditas peruenit ad uesicam statim, ita quod sentit eam infirmus.	Then propel the humidity with that which propels it; for indeed that humidity immediately reaches the bladder so that the patient feels it.
Forma clisteris subtilis quo clisterizatur uesica.	The form of a subtle cathartic by which the bladder is cleansed.
Fiat ex argento, aut auricalco: cuius caput altius sit simile alcama paruo, et sub eo sinus inter quem cadat ligamentum.	Make it from silver or gold alloy: whose head should be higher like a small almond, and under it a recess where a ligament will fall.
Deinde accipe uesicam arietis, et pone in ea humiditatem, qua uis clisterizare uesicam.	Then take the udder of a goat and put in it moisture as you wish to catheterize the udder.
Deinde liga eam inter duos sinus ligatura forti cum filo duplo: et calefac illam humiditatem parumper super ignem.	Then bind it between two sinewy folds with a strong thread, and warm that moisture a little above the fire.
Deinde intromitte extremitatem clisteris in uirgam, postea stringe manum tuam super uesicam cum humiditate strictura decenti, donec sentiat infirmus, quod illa humiditas iam peruenit ad uesicam.	Then insert the extremity of the catheter into the penis, afterwards bind your hand over the udder with a binding decent enough, until the patient feels that moisture has already reached the udder.
Si autem non est tibi praesens uesica, tunc accipe frustum pergameni, et fac ex eo circulum, et perfora ipsum ab omni rotunditate sua.	But if there is no udder present, then take a piece of parchment and make from it a circle, and pierce it through its entire roundness.
Deinde intromitte filum forte in illis foraminibus, sicut reuoluuntur.	Then insert a strong thread into those holes as they are turned around.
Deinde aggrega circulum, sicut aggregatur alsofratu: postquam tu ponis in eo illud quod uis ex humiditatibus, et oleis, et aquis.	Then gather the circle together like a bunch of grapes: after you put into it that which you wish from moist substances, and oils, and waters.
Deinde liga ipsum in instrumento: et fac cum eo sicut fecisti cum uesica ex expressione cum manu tua, donec perueniat humiditas ad uesicam.	Then bind it into the instrument, and do with it as you did with the udder by expression with your hand, until the moisture reaches the udder.
¶ De extractione Lapidis.	¶ On the Extraction of a Stone.
Caput LX.	Chapter 60.
Iam diximus in diuisione species Lapidis, et curationem eius cum medicinis: et dixi differentiam inter Lapidem generatum in renibus, et uesica, et signa illius totius: et dixi Lapidem in quo cadit operatio cum manu et sectio: et est Lapis generatus in uesica proprie: et ille qui figitur in uirga: et ego sum narrans illud cum expositione manifesta et abbreuiatione.	We have already spoken about the kinds of stones and their treatment with medicines, and said what is different between a stone generated in the kidneys and one in the bladder, and the signs of all this. And we spoke about the stone in which the operation takes place with hand and cutting: and it is the stone generated in the bladder properly: and that which is lodged in the penis: and I am recounting this with manifest explanation and abridgement.
Dico ergo, quod Lapis generatus in uesica, plurimum accidit pueris.	I say therefore, that a stone generated in the bladder, happens most often to boys.
Et ex signis eius est, quod urina egreditur ex uesica similis aquae in subtilitate sua: et apparet in ea harena alba, et fricat infirmus uirgam suam, et laborat cum ea, et multotiens pendet.	And one of its signs is that urine flows from the bladder like water in its subtlety: and there appears in it white sand, and the patient scratches his penis and labors with it, and often hangs down.
Deinde erigitur, et egreditur cum eo anus in multis eorum.	Then it is raised and exits with him an anus of many of them.
Et est facilis sanatio puerorum, ex eo usquequo consequuntur quatuordecim annos.	And the healing of children is easy as long as they follow this until they are fourteen years old.
Et est difficilis in senibus.	And it is difficult in old men.
In iuuenibus autem est media, in eo quod est inter illud: et eius cuius Lapis est maior, curatio facilior: et si paruus, est econuerso illius cura.	However, it is midway in young men, since it is between that and that which has a larger stone, healing is easier; and if small, the treatment is conversely with that.
Cum ergo peruenimus ad curationem, oportet in primis, ut mundificemus infirmum cum clisteri, quod extrahat totum stercus quod est in intestinis suis: ipsum enim quandoque prohibet inuentionem Lapidis apud inquisitionem.	So when we arrive at the cure, it is first necessary to cleanse the sick person with a purgative, which will remove all the feces that are in their intestines; for it sometimes prevents the discovery of the Stone during the investigation.
Deinde accipiatur infirmus cum pedibus suis, et concutiatur, et moueatur ad inferiora: ut descendat Lapis ad profundum uesicae, aut saliat de loco alto aliquotiens.	Then let the sick person be taken with their feet and shaken, and moved downwards to the lower part; so that the Stone may go down to the depth of the bladder or flow out from a high place several times.
Deinde fac eum sedere inter manus tuas praeparatum, et manus eius sint sub coxis ipsius, ut fiat uesica tota decliuis ad inferiora.	Then make him sit between your hands prepared, and his hands be under the tailbone of himself, so that the bladder may become entirely downward-oriented towards the lower part.
Deinde perquire eum, et tange eum extrinsecus.	Then search for it, and touch it from outside.
Si ergo sentis Lapidem in spacio, tunc propera statim cum sectione super ipsum.	If then you feel the Stone in place, then hurry immediately with an incision above it.
Quod si non cadat sub tactu tuo omnino, tunc oportet ut abstergas digitum indicem cum oleo manus sinistrae, si infirmus est puer: aut digitum medium si est iuuenis completus: et intromittas ipsum in anum suum, et perquire de Lapide, donec stat sub digito tuo: et conuerte eum paulatim ad collum uesicae.	And if it does not fall entirely under your touch, then it is necessary that you wipe the pointing finger with oil from the left hand of yours, if the patient is a child; or the middle finger if he is a young man who has reached full growth: and insert it into his anus, and search for the Stone until it stands under your finger; and turn it gradually towards the neck of the bladder.
Deinde preme super ipsum cum digito tuo, et impelle ipsum ad exteriora aduersus locus, cuius sectionem uis: et praecipe ministro, ut premat uesicam manu sua, et praecipe alii ministro, ut extendat testiculos manu sua dextra ad superiora: et alia manu sua, ut remoueat cutem, quae est sub testiculis in parte a loco in quo est sectio.	Then press upon it with your finger and push it outwards against the place where you made the incision; and command your assistant to press on the bladder with his hand, and command another assistant to stretch out the testicles with his right hand upwards: and with the other hand, to remove the skin which is under the testicles in the part from where the section is.
Deinde intromitte Spatumile incidens, cuius forma haec est.	Then insert a spathula which cuts, whose form is this.
Et finde in eo quod est inter anum et testiculos, et non in medio, ad latus natis sinistrae: et sit sectio super ipsum lapidem, et digitus tuus sit in ano: et fiat sectio transuersa, ut sit sectio exterius ampla, et interius stricta, secundum quantitatem quod sit possibile egressio Lapidis ex ea non maior.	And find it in the area between the anus and testicles, not in the middle, towards the left side of the nativity: and let the incision be above a stone, and your finger be in the anus: and make the incision transverse, so that the outer cut is wide and the inner one narrow, according to the size necessary for the stone's egress from there not to be greater.
Fortasse enim comprimit digitus, qui est in ano Lapidem apud sectionem, et egreditur absque difficultate.	Perhaps indeed the finger which is in the anus compresses the Stone at the time of the incision, and it emerges without difficulty.
Et scias, quod ex Lapide est cui sunt anguli et margines, quare fit difficilis exitus eius propter illud.	And know that from the Stone there are angles and edges, which is why its egress is difficult because of that.
Et ex eo est lenis, similis glandulae, et rotundus: et fit facilis egressus eius.	And from this it is soft, like a gland, and rounded: and its egress is easy.
Ei ergo cui sunt anguli, et margines, adde in fissura.	So to that which has angles and edges, add a fissure.
Quod si non egreditur ita, tunc oportet ut ingenies super ipsum: aut stringas super eum cum gesti decenter, cuius extremitas sit sicut Luna, quae stringat super Lapidem, et non euadat ab ea: aut ut intromittas sub eo instrumentum subtile, curuatae extremitatis.	But if it does not emerge thus, then you must use force upon it: or tie a cord around it with gentle movement, whose end is like the Moon which ties around the Stone and does not slip away from it: or insert a slender instrument with a curved tip under it.
Si autem non potes super cum, tunc amplifica foramen parumper.	If however you cannot force it through, then enlarge the opening a little.
Quod si uincit te aliquid ex sanguine, abscinde ipsum cum zegi.	What if something from blood overcomes you, cut it off with a saw.
Si uero lapis est plus quam unus, tunc impelle in primis magnum ad os uesicae.	If however the Stone is more than one, then push the first large one into the mouth of the bladder.
Deinde incide super ipsum.	Then cut above it.
Postea impelle paruum post illud: et similiter fac si sunt plures duobus.	Then push a small one after that, and similarly do so if there are more than two.
Quod si magnus est ualde, tunc ignorantia est ut seces super ipsum sectione magna.	What if the great one is very large, then it is unknown to cut above it with a great incision.
Quoniam accidit infirmo una duarum rerum, aut ut moriatur, aut accidit ei distillatio urinae assidua: proptera, quia non consolidatur locus omnino.	Because it happens to the sick person either to die or to suffer from constant dripping of urine: therefore, because the place is not completely consolidated.
Verum administra expulsionem eius, donec egrediatur: aut ingenia in fractura eius cum forficibus, donec extrahas eum frustatim.	True is to administer the evacuation of it until it goes out. Or by instruments with forceps in its fracture, until you extract it piecemeal.
Cum ergo compleueris operationem tuam, tunc imple uulnus thure, et aloe, et sanguine draconis: et stringe ipsum, et pone super ipsum pannum infusum oleo et uino, aut oleo rosato, et aqua frigida: ut sedetur apostema calidum.	When therefore you have completed your operation, then fill the wound with gallnut, and aloe, and dragon's blood: and bind it tightly, and place upon it a cloth steeped in oil and wine, or rose-oil, and cold water: that a hot apostema may be soothed.
Deinde resupina infirmum super collum suum, et non soluas ligamentum, usque ad diem tertium.	Then place the patient on their back, supporting his neck, and do not loosen the bandage until the third day.
Cum ergo solueris ipsum, embroca locum cum aqua, et oleo multo.	When therefore you have loosed it, apply a poultice to the place with water and much oil.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento dyafinicon, et unguento basilicon, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with diaphanatic ointment and basilicon ointment, until it is healed.
Si autem accidit in uulnere apostema calidum additum, et corrosi, et illi similia: sicut si congeletur sanguis in uesica, et prohibeatur ex eo urina: et cognoscitur illud ex egressione sanguinis cum urina.	But if a hot apostema is added to the wound, and it becomes corrupted, and similar things occur; just as if blood should congeal in the stomach, and be prevented from flowing out through urine: and this can be known by the egress of blood with urine.
Intromitte ergo digitum tuum in uulnus, et extrahe illum sanguinem.	Insert your finger into the wound and extract that blood.
Nam si remanet, prouocat ad corruptionem uesicae, et putrefactionem eius.	For if it remains, it provokes to the corruption of the stomach and its putrefaction.
Deinde ablue uulnus cum aceto, et aqua, et sale: et oppone omni speciei cum eo quod conuenit ex curatione, usquequo sanetur.	Then wash the wound with vinegar, and water, and salt: and apply to it every kind of remedy that is suitable for its cure, until it is healed.
Et oportet in horis curationis totius, ut liges duas coxas, et aggreges, caussa medicinarum quae ponuntur super locum.	And it is necessary throughout the entire period of healing that you bind two hipbones together and compress them, because of the medicines that are placed on the place.
Quod si lapis est paruus, et sit in meatu uirgae, et figitur in eo, et prohibetur urinae exitus: tunc cura ipsum cum eo quod narro antequam peruenias ad sectionem.	And if a stone is small and situated in the urethra, and is fixed there, and prevents urine from flowing out: then care for it with what I narrate before you reach the point of cutting.
Multotiens enim a sectione excusaris per hanc curationem, iam enim probaui illud.	For many times you will be excused from cutting through this treatment, as I have already proven it.
Et est, ut accipias Perforatorium ex ferro alferico, cuius haec est forma, triangulatae extremitatis, acutum, fixum in ligno.	And it is, that you take a perforator made of iron from Al-Feriq, whose form is, a three-sided extremity, sharp, fixed in wood.
Deinde accipe filum, et liga cum eo uirgam sub lapide ut non redeat ad uesicam.	Then take a thread and tie it with him to a stick under a stone so that it does not go back into the wound.
Deinde intromitte ferrum perforans in uirgam cum facilitate, donec perueniat Perforatorium ad ipsum lapidem: et reuolue Perforatorium manu tua in ipso lapide paulatim: et coneris perforationem eius, donec facias ipsum penetrare a parte altera.	Then insert the piercing instrument into the stick with ease, until it reaches the perforator at the stone; and turn the perforator by your hand on the stone gradually: and compress its perforation until you make it penetrate from the other side.
Urina namque absoluitur statim.	For urine is immediately released.
Deinde preme manum tuam super illud quod remansit ex lapide ab exteriori parte uirgae.	Then press your hand on what remains of the stone from the outer part of the stick.
Ipse enim frangitur, et egreditur cum urina, et sanatur infirmus.	For it breaks apart and emerges with urine, and the sick person is healed.
Si autem non praeparatur tibi haec curatio, propter aliquid quod prohibet ab illo: tunc liga filum sub lapide, et filum aliud supra lapidem.	But if this treatment is not prepared for you, because of something that hinders it from happening: then tie the thread under the stone, and another thread above the stone.
Deinde seca super lapidem in ipsa uirga inter duas ligaturas.	Then cut above the stone on the stick between the two ties.
Deinde extrahe ipsum.	Then pull it out.
Postea solue ligamentum, et mundifica sanguinem congelatum, qui fit in uulnere.	Later loosen the tie and clean up the frozen blood that forms in the wound.
Et non est necessarium ligamentum fili sub lapide, nisi ut non redeat ad uesicam: et ligamentum aliud desuper, nisi ut quando soluitur filum post egressionem lapidis, redeat cutis ad locum suum, et cooperiat uulnus: et propter illud necesse est tibi illud quando ligas filum superius, ut eleues cutem ad superiora, ut redeat apud complementum tuum, et cooperiat uulnus, sicut diximus.	And it is not necessary to tie the thread under the stone, unless it is so that the wound does not go back into the opening: and another tie above, unless it is so that when you loosen the thread after the stone has come out, the skin will return to its place and cover the wound: and because of this it is necessary for you to do that when you tie the thread above, so that you raise the skin upwards, so that it returns to your complement and covers the wound, as we said.
¶ De extractione Lapidis mulierum.	Of the Extraction of the Stone in Women.
Caput LXI.	Chapter 61.
Parum generatur Lapis in mulieribus.	The Stone is formed in women to a small degree.
Si autem accidat alicui earum lapis, tunc difficilis est curatio, et prohibetur propter modos multos.	But if it happens to any of them that the stone forms, then the cure is difficult and is hindered by many methods.
Vnus eorum est: quod mulier fortasse est uirgo.	One of them is: that perhaps a woman is a virgin.
Et secundus est, quia tu non inuenis mulierem quae detegat seipsam medico, quando est casta, aut ex habentibus maritos.	And the second reason is, because you do not find a woman who will uncover herself to a physician when she is chaste, or from those having husbands.
Tertius est, quia tu non inuenis mulierem bene scientem hanc artem, praecipue operationem cum manu.	The third reason is, because you do not find a woman well-informed about this art, especially the operation with the hand.
Et quartus est longinquitas a loco lapidis: quare indiget sectione profunda, et in illo est timor.	And the fourth reason is, because of the distance from the stone's location; wherefore it requires a deep incision, and there is fear.
Quod si necessitas prouocat ad illud, tunc oportet ut accipias mulierem medicam, bene scientem: et parum inuenitur.	For if necessity demands that, then it is necessary to take a female physician, well-informed; and one is hardly found.
Si uero priuaris ea, tunc quaere medicum castum, subtilem, et praesenta mulierem obstetricem bene doctam in re mulierum, aut mulierem quae in hac arte innuit partem artis: fac ergo eam praesentem, et praecipue ei, ut faciat totum quod praecipis ei ex inquisitione super lapidem.	If you have these, then look for a chaste physician, subtle and present, a well-informed woman obstetrician regarding women's matters, or a woman who is familiar with this art: make her present, and especially instruct her to do everything that you order her to do from the investigation about the stone.
In primis quod est, ut aspiciat si mulier est uirgo: tunc oportet ut intromittat digitum in anum eius, et quaerat lapidem.	Firstly, that which is, to see if the woman is a virgin: then it is necessary for her to insert your finger into her anus, and search for the stone.
Si ergo inuenit ipsum, coartet eum sub digito suo, et tunc praecipe obstetrici, ut intromittat digitum suum in uuluam infirmae, et inquirat super lapidem, postquam ponit manum suam sinistram super uesicam, et comprimit eam compressione bona.	If she finds it, then constrict it under her finger, and then instruct the obstetrician to insert her finger into the weak womb, and inquire about the stone, after she puts her left hand on the bladder and compresses it with a good compression.
Si ergo inuenit lapidem, tunc oportet ut gradatim moueat eum ab orificio uesicae ad inferiora cum summa uirtutis suae, donec perueniat cum eo ad radicem coxae.	If she finds the stone, then it is necessary for her to gradually move it from the opening of the bladder to the lower parts with all her strength, until she reaches its root in the hip socket.
Deinde secet super eum apud oppositionem medietatis uuluae apud radicem coxae, ex quacunque parte praeparatur ei, et sentit lapidem in illa parte: et digitus eius non remoueatur a lapide, coartans sub eo: et sit sectio parua in primis.	Then cut above it at the opposite part of the womb at the root of the hip socket, from whichever side is prepared for her, and feel the stone in that part: and her finger not be removed from the stone, constricting under it: and let the incision be small at first.
Deinde intromittat radium super illam sectionem.	Then he should insert the rod above that incision.
Si ergo sentit lapidem, tunc addat in sectionem secundum quantitatem proportionatam quod lapis egreditur ab ea.	So if he feels a stone, then let him add to the incision as much as is proportionate to the size of the stone that emerges from it.
Et scias, quod species lapidis sunt multae.	And know that there are many kinds of stones.
Ex his enim est paruus, et magnus, lenis et asper, longus, et rotundus habens ramos.	From these [kinds] is small and great, smooth and rough, long and rounded with branches.
Scias ergo species eius, ut significetur tibi per hoc super illud quod uis.	Know therefore its kinds, so that it may be signified to you through this above what you desire.
Si ergo uincit te sanguis, tunc adde in loco zegi tritum, et tene ipsum hora una, donec abscindatur sanguis.	So if blood overcomes you, then add to the place a crushed eggshell and hold it for one hour, until the bleeding subsides.
Deinde redi ad operationem tuam, donec egrediatur lapis: et fac, ut praepares tecum ex instrumentis, quae dixi in extractione lapidis in uiris, ut adiuueris per ea in operatione tua.	Then return to your operation, until the stone comes out; and make sure to prepare with you from the instruments I mentioned in extracting stones from men, so that you may assist through them in your operation.
Quod si uincit te fluxus sanguinis, et scis quod expulsio sanguinis est ex arteria quae incisa est: tunc pone puluerem super locum, et stringe eum cum puluillis strictura decenti: et non mutes illud: et dimitte lapidem, et non extrahas ipsum.	What if the flow of blood overcomes you, and you know that the bleeding is from an artery that has been cut: then place powder on top, and bind it with a cloth wrapping decently tight: and do not stop this; and let the stone go, and do not pull it out.
Fortasse enim morietur mulier infirma.	Perhaps indeed the weak woman will die.
Deinde cura uulnus.	Then care for the wound.
Cum ergo sedatur acuitas sanguinis post dies, et putrefit locus, tune redi ad operationem tuam, donec egrediatur lapis.	When therefore the sharpness of blood is tempered after days, and the place has become putrid, then return to your operation, until the stone comes out.
¶ De sectione suiper Herniam aquosam.	About cutting above a hydatid water sac.
Caput LXII.	Chapter 62.
Ramex aquosa non est, nisi aggregatio humiditatis in sifac albo, quod est sub cute testiculi continente ouum: et nominatur sifac.	The water sac is not a thing, except an accumulation of moisture in the white scrotal sac, which is under the containing skin of the scrotum containing the ovum: and it is called hydatid.
Et quandoque est in panniculo proprio sibi, quem praeparauit ei natura in parte oui, donec putetur: quod est ouum aliud, et est cutis testiculi inter sifac album, quod diximus: et non fit illud nisi raro.	And sometimes it is found in a sac of its own, which nature has prepared for it in the part of the ovum, until it rots away; which is another ovum, and it is the skin of the scrotum between the white sac, which we mentioned: and it does not happen unless rarely.
Et generatio quidem huius ramicis, est ex debilitate quae accidit testiculis: quare effunditur ad eos haec materia.	And indeed the generation of this root is from weakness that occurs in the testicles: wherefore it flows to them this material.
Et quandoque accidit ex percussione super testiculos.	And sometimes it happens through a blow struck upon the testicles.
Et haec humiditas est habens colores multos.	And this moisture is having many colors.
Aut enim est color eius decliuis ad citrinitatem, aut est sanguineus rubeus, aut faeculentus, niger, aut est aquosus albus, et est illud quod est plus.	For either its color inclines towards yellowness, or it is reddish-ruby, or excrementitious-black, or watery-white, and that which is more.
Et signa quibus scitur ubi sit aggregatio aquae, sunt ista.	And the signs by which one knows where water gathering is, are these.
Nam si est in sifac albo quod diximus, tunc apostema est rotundum ad longitudinem parumper sicut figura oui: et non apparet testiculus, quoniam humiditas continet eum ab omni parte.	For if it is in the white scrotum which we mentioned, then the abscess is rounded to a length somewhat like an egg shape: and the testicle does not appear, because moisture contains it from all sides.
Et si est humiditas in panniculo proprio sibi, tunc apostema est rotundum cum parte oui, et propter hoc extimat homo quia est ouum aliud.	And if there is moisture in the scrotal sac proper to itself, then the abscess is rounded with a part like an egg, and because of this man thinks it is another egg.
Et si humiditas est inter cutem testiculorum et sifac album, tunc cadit sub sensu.	And if the moisture is between the skin of the testicles and the white scrotum, then it falls under the sense.
Quando ergo uis cognitionem coloris humiditatis, tunc experire colorem humiditatis in apostemate cum Intromisso quadrato, cuius forma praecessit.	When therefore you wish to know the color of the moisture, then experience the color of the moisture in the abscess with a square linen cloth, whose shape has preceded.
Secundum illud ergo quod egreditur in uestigio Intromissi, iudica de illo quod est inter ipsum.	Accordingly then, judge about that which is between it, according to what emerges in the track of the linen cloth.
Cum ergo uenimus ad curationem cum ferro, tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmo, ut phlebotometur si possibile est ei illud, et uides corpus eius plenum.	When therefore we come to the cure with iron, then it is necessary that you order the patient to be bled if possible for him, and that you see his body filled.
Deinde resupinetur super dorsum suum super rem altam parum, et pone sub eo pannos multos.	Then let it be placed on top of his back above a somewhat high surface, and place many cloths underneath it.
Deinde sede tu super sinistram eius, et praecipe ministro, ut sedeat a dextra eius, qui extendat uirgam eius ad unum duorum laterum cutis testiculorum, et ad partem mirach uentris.	Then sit you on the left side of him, and order his servant to sit on the right side of him, who will stretch out his rod to one or both sides of the skin of the testicles, and to the part of the navel of the belly.
Deinde accipe spatumile latum, et seca cutem testiculorum ex medio per longitudinem, usque prope pectinem: et fiat sectio secundum rectitudinem aequedistantis lineae quae diuidit cutem testiculorum, donec perueniat ad sifac album comprehendens: et excoria ipsum et obserua, uel caue ex hoc, ut seces ipsum: et sit excoriatio tua qua ipsum excorias, ex parte quae suspenditur cum ouo plus: et subtiliter scrutare cum excoriatione secundum quantitatem quod tibi possibile est.	Here is the translation:
Deinde perfora sifac plenum aqua perforatione ampla, et extrahe totam aquam.	Then pierce a full bladder with a wide piercing and draw out all the water.
Deinde separa inter duo labia sectionis cum uncinis, et extende sifac ad superiora, et non tangas cutem testiculorum comprehendentem: et incide sifac qualitercunque est possibile tibi incidere ipsum, aut cum totalitate sua, aut frustatim, praecipue latus eius subtile.	Then separate the space between two labial sections with a hook, and stretch the bladder upwards, not touching the skin that surrounds the testicles: and cut the bladder as is possible for you to cut it, either entirely or in fragments, especially the delicate part of it.
Nam si tu non exquisite perscrutaris, in incisione eius non fit securitas, quin aqua redeat.	For if you do not examine it carefully, there is no security in the cut, and the water will flow back.
Si autem procedit ouum exterius a cute sua in hora operationis tuae: tunc quando compleueris sectionem sifac, reduc ipsum.	But if the stone has proceeded externally from its own wound during your operation hour: then when you have finished the section of the bladder, bring it back.
Deinde aggrega duo labia cutis testiculorum cum sutura.	Then gather together the two folds of skin of the testicles with a suture.
Deinde cura ipsum sicut reliqua uulnera, donec sanetur.	Then care for it as you would other wounds, until it heals.
Quod si inuenis ouum corruptum ex nigredine alia, tunc oportet ut liges uasa, quae sunt suspensorium, timens fluxum sanguinis.	But if you find a corrupted stone from other blackness, then it is necessary to bind the vessels that are the suspension, fearing blood flow.
Deinde abscinde testiculum cum suspensorio, et extrahe ouum: postea cura illud cum eo quod diximus.	Then cut off the testicle with the suspension and draw out the stone: afterwards care for it as we have said.
Si uero aqua est aggregata in duabus partibus, tunc scias quia sunt duae ramices: seca ergo partem aliam secundum quod fecisti in altera aequaliter.	But if water is gathered in two parts, then you will know that there are two branches: therefore cut the other part equally as you did in the first.
Et si aequatur tibi, ut sit operatio una, tunc fac: deinde absterge sanguinem.	And if it seems fair to you that it be one operation, then do so: afterwards wipe away the blood.
Et intromitte in sectiones lanam submersam in oleo, aut in oleo rosato: et pone deforis lanam aliam quam submersisti in uino et oleo, et expande eam super duos testiculos, et mirach uentris: et pone desuper pannos duplicatos, et sunt puluilli: et liga eos desuper cum ligamento, quod est habens sex secundum hanc formam.	And introduce a soaked cloth into the incisions, or in rose oil: and place another cloth which you had submerged in wine and oil on the outside, and spread it over the two testicles and the belly: and place above it double cloths, and are napkins: and bind them above with a bandage, which has six according to this form.
Deinde sumantur duo panni, et suantur, et impleantur la na carminata, secundum hanc similitudinem: et fiant extremitates quibus premitur ex coto, aut lana humida: et aggregentur cum strictura in lumbari bracharum: et una extremitatum accipiat super anum usque ad dorsum, et secunda accipiat ad partem pectinis: et duae extremitates super duas coxas inferius, et duae extremitates aliae super duo inguina, et aggregetur strictura tota in lumbari bracharum.	Then two cloths are taken and moistened, and filled with the woolen thread, according to this similarity: and they will be made into extremities which press out from the cote, or damp fleece: and they will be gathered together with a bandage in the lumbar region of the arms: and one extremity will take over above the anus up to the back, and the second will take over at the part of the chest: and two other extremities on the two lower thighs, and two other extremities on the two groin areas, and the whole bandage will be gathered together in the lumbar region.
Et, quandoque artificialiter medicatur haec ramex cum cauterio loco sectionis cum ferro: et est, ut accipias cauterium cultellare subtile, et seces cum eo cutem testiculorum: et est ignitum, secundum quod narrauimus: donec quando detegitur sifac album continens aquam: tunc accipe cauterium, secundum hanc formam.	And when the ramus is artificially treated with a cauterizer in place of sectioning with iron; and it is to take a cauterizing knife that is very fine and cut along with it the skin of the testicles: and it is ignited, according to what we have narrated: until such time as the white sifac containing water is uncovered; then take the cauterizer in this form.
Assimilatur literae graecae.	Are assimilated Greek letters.
Deinde perfora cum eo illud sifac, et est ignitum, donec egrediatur humiditas tota.	Then pierce with it that sifac, and it is ignited, until all moisture comes out.
Deinde extende sifac cum uncinis, et excoria cum cauterio subtili ignito, et incide ipsum secundum quod possibile est tibi, donec eradices totum eius.	Then stretch the sifac with a hook, and scrape off with a fine ignited cauterizer, and cut it as much as you can, until you eradicate the entire thing.
Et caue ex ouo, ne tangat ipsum ignis.	And beware of the oil, so that fire does not touch it.
Et scias, quod haec operatio est saluior, et longinquior a fluxu sanguinis, et melior quam operatio cum sectione.	And know that this operation is more beneficial, and longer-lasting in preventing bleeding, and better than the operation with cutting.
Si uero contrarietatem tibi facit in hora sectionis, aut in hora cauterii apostema calidum, aut fluxus sanguinis, aut aliquid aliud: tunc oportet ut cures quod contrarietatem tibi facit ex illo cum curatione quae conuenit ei, secundum quod praemissum est.	If, however, something contrary to what is desired occurs in the hour of cutting or cauterizing, such as an apostema that is warm, or bleeding, or something else: then it is necessary to cure the contrary thing with a cure that is suitable for it, according to what has been previously stated.
Si autem infirmus est timidus, et non expectat super hanc operationem, propter horribilitatem suam: tunc administra perforationem secundum quod ego narro illud: et est.	If, however, the patient is timid and does not expect this operation because of its gruesomeness: then administer a piercing according to what I narrate it: and it is.
Quando certificatur tibi apud te per illud quod diximus de significationibus, quod ramex est aquosa: tunc oportet quod facias sedere infirmum super sedem eleuatam.	When you are certain of it to yourself through what we have said about the signs, that the ramus is watery: then it is necessary for you to make the patient sit on a raised seat.
Deinde perfora apostema in inferiori parte sui cum spatumili lato: et pone perforationem secundum longitudinem corporis, et sit apertio ampla, donec currat aqua tota.	Then pierce the apostema on its lower part with a broad spatula: and place the perforation according to the length of the body, and make the opening wide, until all the water flows.
Deinde pone super locum cotum, et liga ipsum, et dimitte ipsum ut currat residuum aquae: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur uulnus.	Then place a dressing on the wound and bind it, and let the remainder of the water flow; then care for it until the wound is healed.
Si autem contrarietas sit egressioni aquae in hora qua perforas ipsam: et non sit illud nisi propterea, quia panniculus albus contrarietatem facit in orificio uulneris, et prohibet exitum aquae: tunc oportet ut intromittas pennam in uulnus, aut instrumentum cum quo extrahitur aqua hydropicorum, cuius forma praecessit: aut adde in operatione uulneris parumper.	If however a contradiction occurs with the flow of water at the time you are piercing it; and this is not so except because a white cloth makes a contradiction in the wound's orifice, and prevents the exit of water: then it is necessary to insert a feather into the wound, or an instrument used for extracting water of those suffering from dropsy, whose form precedes: or add this to the operation of the wound briefly.
Et scias, quod aqua redit, et aggregatur post sex menses, aut circiter eos.	And know that the water returns and accumulates after six months, or around those.
Cum ergo aggregatur, tunc pertoretur secundum eundem modum, et pertransibit infirmus dies suos.	When it accumulates, then it is drained off in the same manner, and the patient passes his days.
¶ De cura Ramicis carnosae.	On the Treatment of Fleshy Tumors.
Caput LXIII.	Chapter 63.
Scias, quod in sectione super hanc Ramicem, est ex timore perducente ad perniciem in pluribus dispositionibus.	Know that in the incision for this tumor, there is a leading fear that leads to ruin in many dispositions.
Quapropter uidetur mihi eius dimissio saluari ex ea.	Therefore it seems to me that its removal would be beneficial from it.
Et ego sum rememorans operationem in ea, et species apostematis.	And I am remembering the procedure for it and the appearance of an abscess.
Dico ergo, quod accidunt apostemata multa in corporibus, ex quibus componuntur testiculi: et fit illud ex caussis multis, scilicet.	I say therefore that many abscesses occur in bodies from which the testicles are composed; and it is caused by many reasons, namely.
Aut ex superfluitate acuta, uel acri, quae effunditur ad testiculos.	Or from excessive or acute superfluity that flows to the testicles.
Aut ex percussione.	Or from striking.
Et est color apostematis secundum colorem corporis, et non inuenitur ei dolor: et est apostema graue.	And the appearance of the abscess is according to the color of the body, and there is no pain found in it; and it is a serious abscess.
Et fortasse est apostema lapideum, cuius color est fuscus, et non est sensus ei.	And perhaps it is a stone abscess, whose color is dark and there is no sensation to it.
Et quandoque fit ex nodatione arteriarum, et inflatione earum: sicut iam praecessit eius rememoratio: aut ex inflatione uenarum.	And sometimes it arises from the constriction of arteries and their inflation, as has been already mentioned before: or from the inflation of veins.
Quod ergo est ex eis ex inflatione arteriarum, cognoscitur per dispositionem apostematis, quando comprimis ipsum digitis tuis.	What then arises from the constriction of arteries, is known by the appearance of the abscess, when you compress it with your fingers.
Et non oportet ut tangas ipsum prorsus.	And it is not necessary to touch it at all.
Illud uero quod fit ex inflatione uenarum, non dispergitur ex eo aliquid apud compressionem cum digitis.	That which occurs from the inflation of veins is not scattered about during compression with fingers.
Et iam possibile est, quod super hanc speciem fiat sectio, et super reliquas carnes: et est, ut seces cutem testiculorum.	And it is also possible to make an incision above this type and above the other flesh; and it is to excise the skin of the testicles.
Deinde extende ouum ad sursum, et extrahe ipsum cum sifach albo: et libera suspensorium ex uasis, et liga uasa: et incide suspensorium postquam tu liberas ipsum ab omni parte ex partibus oui.	Then stretch the scrotum upwards and extract it with a white suture; and free the suspensory ligament from the vas deferens, and tie the vas: and cut the suspensory ligament after you have freed it from every part of the scrotum.
Si ergo ouum consolidatum est cum illis carnibus natis, tunc oportet ut attrahas ouum, et incidas ipsum.	If therefore the scrotum is constricted with those natural flesh bands, then it is necessary that you grasp the scrotum and cut it.
Et si adhaerentia est inter aliquid ex siphaket, aut in eo quod est inter uasa: tunc oportet ut liberes totam illam adhaerentiam, et incidas eam incisione rotunda.	And if there is an adhesion between something from the peritoneum, or in that which is between the vas deferens: then it is necessary to free all that adhesion and cut it with a round incision.
Si autem est natiuitas carnis in loco adhaerentiae quae est retro: tunc oportet ut incidas totum eius, et extrahas ouum, sicut diximus.	But if there is a birth of flesh in the place of the adhesion which is behind: then it is necessary to cut all of that and extract the scrotum, as we said.
Cum ergo completur operatio tua, tnnc imple uulnus in lana infusa in oleo rosato, et uino: deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	When therefore your operation is complete, then fill the wound with wool soaked in rose oil and wine: afterwards care for it with the remaining cure, until it heals.
¶ De cura Ramicis, quae est cum Vite.	About the care of Testicles which are with Vine.
Caput LXIIII.	Chapter 64.
Uitis est apostema inuolutum quadam inuolutione, simile botro, cum mollificatione testiculorum: et fit difficilis super infirmum motus et exercitium, et deambulatio.	Vine is a boil wrapped in some wrapping, similar to a boil, with the softening of the testicles; and it causes difficult movement and exercise, and walking.
Et in curatione huius aegritudinis est ex timore, propter illud cuius praecessit rememoratio.	And in the cure of this illness is by fear, on account of what was previously mentioned.
Verum oportet, ut dicamus operationem in ea secundum quod fecerunt primi.	Truly it behooves us to say how one should operate in that according to how the first ones did.
Dico ergo, quod oportet ut facias sedere infirmum super sedem eleuatam.	I say therefore, that it is necessary for you to make the patient sit on an elevated seat.
Deinde impelle suspensorium testiculorum ad inferiora.	Then push the suspensory ligament of the testicles downwards.
Deinde tene cutem testiculorum cum digitis tuis, cum uasis quae sunt propinqua uirgae: et teneat ea minister alius, et extendat ea extensione uehementi.	Then grasp the skin of the testicles with your fingers and the veins that are near the penis; and let another servant hold them and stretch them with a strong stretching.
Deinde incide cum spatumili lato acuto sectione transuersa in directo uasorum, donec detegantur uasa.	Then cut with a broad and sharp spatula section across the urethra in a straight line until the veins are uncovered.
Deinde excoria ab omni parte, sicut diximus tibi in extractione Arteriarum quae sunt in timporibus.	Then strip away from all parts, as we have told you to do in extracting arteries that are in limbs.
Postea fige in eis acum in qua sit filum duplum, et liga ipsum in primo locorum quibus accidunt Vites: et liga ipsum iterum in ultimo eorum.	Then put a needle into them where there is a thread doubled, and tie it first at the places where the arteries are situated: and tie it again at their last.
Deinde seca ea in media sectione recta secundum longitudinem corporis, et extrahe quod aggregatur ex humiditatibus faeculentis corruptis.	Then cut them in a straight line through the middle of the body according to its length, and extract what is gathered from corrupted moist substances.
Deinde cura uulnus cum curatione reliquorum uulnerum, in quibus uis generari saniem, ut cadant uasa quae nutriunt unum testiculorum.	Then care for the wound with the treatment of other wounds in which pus is to be generated, so that the veins that nourish one testicle may fall.
Non est enim malum per illud.	For it is not evil through this.
Si autem accidat Vitis omnibus uasis, tunc oportet ut extrahantur propter hoc testiculi cum uasis: ut non priuetur ouum nutrimento, propter incisionem, et tabescat, uel arescat, et non sit iuuamentum cum eis.	But if the arteries of all veins are injured, then it is necessary to extract the testicles with the veins: so that the sperm may not be deprived of nourishment because of the incision, and waste away or dry up, and not be beneficial with them.
¶ De cura Ramicis intestinalis.	Note: This appears to be a paragraph title, rather than a translation of the text itself. The title is "On the Treatment of Intestinal Strangulations".
Caput LXV.	Note: This appears to be a chapter title or heading, specifically Chapter 65 (LXV being the Roman numeral for 65).
Euentus huius Ramicis est ex sectione, quae accidit in sifach extenso super uentrem in parte inguinum ex mirach uentris.	The exit of this strangulation is from a section that occurs on the expanded sigmoid colon above the belly in the groin part of the intestines.
Quare descendunt intestina ex illa Ruptura ad unum testiculorum.	Therefore, the intestines descend through that rupture to one testicle.
Et haec Ruptura est aut ex sifach, aut extensione eius.	And this rupture is either from the sigmoid colon or its extension.
Et accidunt istae duae species ex caussis multis.	And these two kinds of cases occur from many causes.
Aut ex percussione.	Or from a blow.
Aut saltu.	Or by falling.
Aut clamore.	By shouting.
Aut eleuatione rei grauis, et similibus.	Or by elevation of a heavy thing and similar ones.
Et signum, quando est ex extensione sifach.	And a sign that is from an extended siphac.
Est quod accidit paulatim in tempore longo, et non accidit subito: et est apostema aequale uersus profundum: propterea, quod sifach comprimit intestinum.	It is something that occurs gradually over a long period of time and does not occur suddenly: it is an equal-sized abscess turning towards the depth, because the siphac compresses the intestine.
Et signum eius quando est ex sectione sifach, quia facit accidere ex principio sui dolorem uehementem subito: et est apostema diuersum, apparens sub cute propinque: et illud est propter exitum intestini, et cursus eius ad exteriora sifach.	And its sign is when it occurs from the section of the siphac, because it makes a sudden and intense pain occur at the beginning of itself: and it is a different abscess, appearing near the skin: and that is due to the exit of the intestine and its course to the outside through the siphac.
Et quandoque egreditur cum intestino zirbum: et nominatur haec Ramex intestinalis, et zirbia: et quandoque fit cum uentositate.	And sometimes it emerges with the intestine torn: and this is called the Intestinal Ramus and Torn intestine: and sometimes it occurs with wind.
Et quandoque currit in intestinum stercus, et retinetur illic: et est cum eo pernicies infirmi: quoniam facit accidere dolorem prauum, et praecipue quando premitur.	And sometimes it runs into the intestine with dung, and is retained there: and it is with that a harm to the weak: because it makes a bad pain occur, and especially when it is pressed.
Et in curatione specierum aegritudinis huius cum ferro est timor: quare oportet ut caueatur casus in ea.	And in the cure of this disease's species with iron there is danger: therefore it is necessary to beware of the cases in them.
Et modus operationis est, ut praecipias infirmo, ut reducat intestinum manu sua ad interiora concauitatis suae, si obedit reditui.	And the method of the operation is to order the sick person to reduce their intestine by hand to the inner recesses of their own concavity, if it returns.
Deinde resupinetur super collum suum inter manus tuas: et eleua crura eius.	Then he will be raised up over his own neck between your hands: and lift up his legs.
Deinde extende cutem quae sequitur cutem ad superiora, et seca cutem testiculorum totam per longitudinem.	Then stretch the skin that follows the skin upwards and cauterize the skin of the testicles entirely along its length.
Deinde fige in duobus labiis sectionis uncinos, secundum quod indiges ad aperiendum sectionem cum eis: et sectio sit secundum quantitatem, quod sit possibile, ut egrediatur ex ea ouum.	Then insert into the two lips of the incision two hooks, according to your need to open the incision with them: and the incision should be so that it is possible for an egg to come out from it.
Deinde excoria siphak, et quae sunt sub cute testiculorum, donec quando detegitur sifach album, durum ab omni parte: tunc intromitte digitum tuum indicem in eo quod sequitur testiculum, in eo quod est inter siphach album, quod est sub cute oui, et inter sifach secundum, et absolue cum eo adhaerentiam quae est in posteriori parte oui.	Then scrape away the siphac and what is under the skin of the testicles, until when the white siphac is revealed, hard on all sides: then insert your index finger into it that follows the testicle, in between the white siphac that is under the skin of the egg yolk, and also with the adhesion that is in the posterior part of the yolk.
Deinde moue cum manu dextra ad interiora cutem testiculorum: et cum hoc extende sifach album ad sursum, cum manu sinistra: et eleua ouum cum sifach ad partem sectionis: et praecipe ministro, ut extendat ouum ad sursum: et tu solue adhaerentiam, quae est retro solutione completa.	Then move with your right hand to the inner skin of the testicles. And when this is done, stretch a white linen cloth upwards with your left hand; and raise the egg white with the cloth to the part of the section; and instruct your assistant to extend the egg white upwards: and you dissolve the adhesion that remains behind after the complete solution.
Et quaere digitis tuis, ut non sit aliquid illic ex intestino inuoluto in sifach albo duro.	And search with your fingers to see that nothing from the intestine is wrapped around the hard white cloth.
Si autem inuenis ex eo aliquid: tunc impelle ipsum ad uentrem inferius.	But if you find something of it, then push it towards the lower belly.
Deinde accipe acum, in qua sit filum grossum, factum licinium ex decem filis: et intromitte ipsam apud postremum sifach, id est, tunicae, quod est sub cute testiculorum quae sequitur sectionem: deinde incide extremitates quae eminent ex filo, donec sint quatuor fila.	Then take a needle with a thick thread made from ten threads, and insert it into the back part of the cloth, that is, the tunica which is under the skin of the testicles that follows the section: then cut off the ends that protrude from the thread until there are four threads.
Deinde compone quaedam eorum super quaedam cum figura quae sit in modo crucis: et liga cum eis alsifach, de quo diximus, quia est sub cute testiculorum ligamento uehementi, donec non possit aliquod ex uasis, quae nutriunt eos mittere ad eos aliquid: ut non accidat inde apostema calidum.	Then arrange some of them above the others with a figure that resembles a cross; and tie with them the cloth, about which we have spoken, since it is under the skin of the testicles bound tightly by a ligament, until nothing from the vessels that nourish them can pass through to them: so that no hot abscess may arise from there.
Et pone iterum ligamentum secundum extra ligamentum primum, longinquum ab eo minus duobus digitis.	And place a second ligament outside the first ligament, two fingers away from it.
Et post ista duo ligamenta dimitte ex sifach, quod est sub cute testiculorum, quantitatem magnitudinis digiti: et incide reliquum totum secundum rotunditatem, et aufer ex eo ouum.	And after these two ligaments, let go from the cloth, which is under the skin of the testicles, an amount equal in size to a finger; and cut off the remaining part entirely round and remove the yolk.
Deinde seca in inferiori parte cutis testiculorum sectione, ex qua currit sanguis, et sanies: sicut narrauimus in eo quod praemissum est.	Then cut in the lower part of the skin of the testicles with a sectioning, from which blood and pus flow: as we previously narrated.
Deinde administra lanam submersam in oleo, et pone in uulnus: et administra ligamentum quod narrauimus.	Then apply a linen cloth soaked in oil to the wound and place it there: and apply the ligament which we previously described.
Et quandoque cauterizatur sifach album quod diximus, post incisionem eius timendo de fluxu sanguinis.	And sometimes the white cloth which we mentioned is cauterized after its incision, in order to prevent bleeding.
Multotiens enim accidit illud.	Many times indeed it happens.
Et dimitte ligamentum, donec cadat per se.	And let go of the ligament until it falls by itself.
Si autem tardatur casus eius, tunc embrocetur cum aqua calida: et pone super ipsum illud quod diximus, donec cadat.	But if its case is delayed, then let it be anointed with hot water; and place on top of it what we said, until it falls.
Deinde cura uulnus cum reliqua curatione uulnerum, donec curetur.	Then care for the wound along with the rest of the wound treatment, until it is healed.
¶ De Ramice uentosa.	About broken arrows.
Caput LXVI.	Chapter 66.
IN Hac Ramice non uidi aliquem qui ausus fuerit super curationem eius cum ferro.	In this case, I did not see anyone who dared to attempt its cure with iron.
Et primi quidem dixerunt, quod fit sicut narrauimus in Ramice quae est cum Vite.	And indeed the first ones said that it happens just as we have described in the case of the arrow that is stuck with a vine.
Quod est, ut liges uasa post sectionem super ea cum facilitate inferius: deinde seca in medio, et cura postremo cum eo quod aperit ipsum, donec cadant uasa: et cura uulnus, secundum quod diximus, donec sanetur.	Which is to tie the bowels below after cutting above with ease; then cut in the middle, and cure finally with what opens it up, until the bowels fall: and care for the wound, as we said, until it heals.
¶ De disruptione quae fit in inguinibus.	About the disruption that occurs in the groin.
Caput LXVII.	Chapter 67.
Quando accidit Ruptura in inguinibus, sicut diximus, et eminet locus, et non descendit ad testiculos aliquid ex intestinis: et si descendit, est illud parum, et redit in omnibus horis: uerum si prolongatur cum ea tempus, additur fissura in sifach, donec descendunt intestina in sifach.	When a rupture occurs in the groin, as we said, and the swelling appears and does not go down to the testicles anything from the intestines: and if it does go down, it is slightly so, and returns to all its hours; but if prolonged with that time, an opening forms in the scrotum, until the intestines descend into the scrotum.
Et accidit illud ex extensione sifach, quod est in inguinibus, sicut diximus.	And it happens because of the stretching of the scrotum, which is in the groin, as we said.
Quod est, quia extenditur sifach: deinde mollificatur, et apostematur locus, et eminet.	Which is because the scrotum stretches; then it becomes soft and a swelling forms and appears.
Et cura eius est cum cauterio, sicut praecessit eius narratio.	And its cure is with cautery, just as its previous narrative proceeded.
Et quandoque curatur cum ferro, secundum hunc modum: et est, ut iaceat infirmus super dorsum suum inter manus tuas.	And sometimes it is cured with iron, according to this method: and it is, that the patient lies on his back between your hands.
Deinde seca locum Rupturae apostematum et eminentem, sectione per latitudinem, secundum quantitatem trium digitorum.	Then cut the place of the ruptured swelling and prominence, by making a section across its width, according to the size of three fingers.
Deinde stringe alsifak et, quae sunt sub cute, donec quando detegitur sifach album, quod est sub cute quae sequitur ipsum.	Then tie the abscess and, those which are under the skin, until when the white abscess is uncovered, which is under the skin that follows it.
Tunc accipe radium, et pone ipsum super locum eminentem ex sifach, et preme ipsum ad profundum uentris.	Then take a probe and place it on top of the prominent part from the abscess, and press it to the depth of the abdomen.
Deinde sue duo loca eminentia super extremitatem radii ex sifach, et annecte cum sutura unum eorum cum altero: deinde extrahe extremitatem radii.	Then take two prominent parts from the abscess and connect one to another with a suture; then pull out the extremity of the probe.
Et non incidas alsifach omnino, neque tendas ouum, neque aliud, sicut feci te scire in curatione ramicis intestinalis.	And do not cut off the abscess entirely, nor stretch it out, nor anything else, as I taught you in the treatment of intestinal hernias.
Deinde cura illud curatione uulnerum.	Then care for that wound with a wound cure.
Cum ergo incidis fila, mundifica illud, et restaura uulnus, donec consolidetur.	When therefore you cut the threads, cleanse it and restore the wound until it is consolidated.
Sisach enim contrahitur, et non additur eminentia Rupturae.	For a suture is contracted, and no additional prominence of rupture occurs.
Et cauterium est melius in hoc loco: quoniam est propinquius ad salutem.	And cauterization is better in this place, because it is closer to the point of salvation.
¶ De mollificatione cutis testiculorum.	¶ On the softening of the skin of the testicles.
Caput LXVIII.	68
Multotiens mollificatur cutis testiculorum in quibusdam hominibus, propter quod mollificantur carnes quae sunt inter ea, et foedatur aspectus eius.	The skin of the testicles is often softened in some people, because of which the flesh between them becomes soft and its appearance is spoiled.
Ergo necesse est ei qui rogatur in curatione eius, ut faciat iacere infirmum super dorsum suum, et incidat totam cutem quae mollificata est super cutem naturalem.	Therefore it is necessary for the one who is asked to cure it, that he make the patient lie on his back, and cut off the entire soft skin above the natural skin.
Deinde aggreget duo labia cum sutura: et si uis, sue in primis superfluitatem cutis mollificatae tribus suturis, aut quatuor, et firma suturam.	Then gather together the two edges with a suture: and if you wish, take off the excess of the soft skin that has been softened away by three or four stitches, and make the stitch firm.
Deinde incide inter sututuras.	Then cut between the stitches.
Deinde cura curatione reliquorum uulnerum, usquequo sanetur, et cadant fila.	Then care for the cure of the remaining wounds until it heals, and the stitches fall away.
¶ De Castratione.	¶ On Castration.
Caput LXIX.	69
Scias, quod Castratio in lege nostra excommunicata est: et propter illud liceret mihi, ut non rememorarer eius in libro meo isto: et non est necessaria rememoratio eius, nisi propter duos modos.	You should know that castration is excommunicated by our law: and because of this it would be allowed to me not to remember it in my book: and it is not necessary for its remembrance, except for two methods.
Quorum unus est, ut sit illud in scientia medici quando interrogatur de ea: et ut sciat curationem eius cui accidit.	One of them is, that it should be in the science of medicine when one is questioned about it: and so he may know its cure, who suffers from it.
Et modus alter est, quod nos multotiens indigemus castratione quorundam animalium, propter iuuamenta nostra per illud, sicut arietum, hyrcorum, et gattorum, et similium ex animalibus.	And another method is, that we often have need of castrating certain animals for our own benefit through them, such as rams, mares, and male cats, and similar beasts.
Dico ergo, quod Castratio fit secundum duos modos.	I say therefore that castration is done in two ways.
Aut per attritionem.	Or by cauterization.
Aut per fissuram, et sectionem.	Or by incision and cutting.
In illa autem quae fit per attritionem, uia operationis est: quod nos faciamus sedere animal in aqua calida, donec mollificentur testiculi eius, et leniantur, et pendeant: deinde attere eos manu tua, donec resoluantur et non appareant sub tactu.	In the one that is done by cauterization, the method of operation is: to make the animal sit in hot water until its testicles become soft and relaxed, and then to remove them with your hand until they dissolve and do not appear under the touch.
In castratione autem per fissuram et sectionem, oportet ut teneas animal, et premas cutem testiculorum eius cum manu sinistra.	In castration by incision and cutting, it is necessary to hold the animal and press with your left hand the skin over its testicles.
Deinde liga suspensorium, et seca super omne ouum sectione una, donec quando procedunt duo oua: tunc incide ea postquam excoriaueris utrumque, et non dimittas super ea ex sifaket aliquid praeter sifac subtile, quod est super uasa.	Then tie the spermatic cord and cut above all of it in one stroke, until when two testicles emerge: then cut them after you have peeled both, and do not leave anything on top of them except for a small piece of membrane that is over the vas.
Et iste modus castrationis est melior eo qui fit per attritonem: quoniam attritio fortasse relinquit aliquid ex testiculis, quare desiderat animal coitum.	And this method of castration is better than the one done by cauterization: because cauterization perhaps leaves something behind in the testicles, so that the animal desires coitus.
Deinde cura uulnus, donec sanetur.	Then take care of the wound until it heals.
¶ De cura Hermafroditae duorum modorum.	Chapter on the cure of a Hermaphrodite in two ways.
Caput LXX.	Head 70.
Hermafrodita ex uiris est secundum duos modos.	A hermaphrodite from males is according to two modes.
Vnus eorum est, quia apparet in eo quod sequitur spacium, aut in cute testiculorum, in eo quod est inter duos testiculos, figura quasi uulua mulieris, in qua sunt pili: et quandoque currit urina ex eo quod est in cute testiculorum.	One of them is, because it appears in him that follows a space, or in the skin of the testicles, in which is between two testicles, a figure like that of a woman's vulva, with hair: and sometimes urine flows from what is in the skin of the testicles.
In mulieribus autem est species una, et est uulua mulieris super pectinem sicut testiculi uiri parui omnino, eminentes ad exteriora: quorum unus est sicut priapus uiri, et duo sicut duo testiculi.	In women, however, there is one kind, and it is the vulva of a woman above her breastbone just like the small testicles of a man, protruding to the outside: one of which is like the penis of a man, and two are like two testicles.
Et curatio trium specierum, duarum ex uiris, et speciei unius ex mulieribus, est: quia oportet ut incidas carnes additas, donec effugiat impressio earum.	And the treatment of three kinds, two from men and one from women, is: because it is necessary to cut away excess flesh until the impression of these things disappears.
Deinde cura eas curatione reliquorum uulnerum.	Then the care for them should be by the same cure as for other wounds.
In specie autem secunda uirorum, ex qua egreditur urina, quae est in cute testiculorum, non est operatio, neque est eius curatio omnino.	However, in the second kind of men's species from which urine emerges, which is on the skin of the testicles, there is no operation nor its complete cure.
¶ De incisione Tentiginis, et carnis eminentis in uuluis mulierum.	On the cutting of the tentigines and the flesh protruding in the vulva of women.
Caput LXXI.	Chapter 71.
Tentigo fortasse additur super rem naturalem, donec foedatur et turpis fit aspectus eius: et quandoque magnificatur in quibusdam mulieribus adeo, donec expanditur sicut in uiris, et peruenit usque ad coitum.	A tentigo perhaps is added to the natural parts until it becomes foul and ugly to look at: and sometimes it grows so much in some women that it expands like those of men and reaches as far as copulation.
Oportet ergo ut teneas superfluitatem Tentiginis manu, aut cum uncino, et incidas: et non ultimes in incisione, praecipue in profundo radicis: ut non accidat fluxus sanguinis.	Therefore, you should grasp the excess tentigo with your hand or a forceps, and cut it away; and do not stop cutting until you reach the depth of the root, so that bleeding does not occur.
Deinde cura ipsam curatione uulnerum, donec sanetur.	Then care for it by the same cure as for wounds, until it heals.
Caro autem orta, est caro quae nascitur in orificio matricis, donec impleat ipsum: et fortasse egreditur ad exteriora secundum similitudinem caudae: et propter illud quidam primi nominant aegritudinem caudatam.	But the flesh that grows is the flesh that is born in the maternal orifice, until it fills it: and perhaps it emerges to the outside according to the likeness of a tail: and because of that some people call the disease "caudata".
Oportet ergo ut incidamus eam sicut incidimus Tentiginem, et curemus eam, donec sanetur.	Therefore, it is necessary to cut it away like we cut away the tentigo, and care for it until it heals.
¶ De cura Alratica, quae est uulua mulieris non perforata.	On the cure of an Alratica, which is an unbroken vulva of a woman.
Caput LXXII.	Chapter 72.
Alratica est, ut sit uulua mulieris non perforata, aut sit foramen paruum.	An Alratica is when the vulva of a woman is not perforated or has a small opening.
Et est aut naturalis, aut accidentalis.	And it is either natural, or accidental.
Accidentalis est ex aegritudine quae praecessit: et ipsa quidem fit aut ex carne nata addita, aut sifach subtili, aut spisso: et fit aut in profundo matricis, aut in lateribus eius, aut in superiore ipsius, aut inferiori eius: et prohibet a coitu et impregnatione, et partu, et fortasse prohibet menstrua.	Accidental is that which preceded the illness; and it indeed occurs either from a natural defect added to the flesh, or if it be subtle and fine, or thick and dense. And it occurs either in the depth of the womb, or in its sides, or on top of it, or below it; and it prevents coitus and impregnation, and childbirth, and perhaps menstruation as well.
Et cognitio illius fit per aspectum obstetricis, si opilatio est apparens propinqua.	And knowledge of that is gained through the midwife's inspection, if a bulge appears nearby.
Si autem non est apparens, tunc quaere eam digitis tuis, aut cum radio.	But if it is not apparent, then search for it with your fingers or with a stick.
Si autem opilatio est ex sifach subtili, et est propinqua duobus labiis: tunc propera, et disrumpe ipsam.	But if the bulge is from a subtle membranous sac and is near to both lips: then hasten and tear it apart.
Et est, ut ponas super duo labia puluillos.	And you should place two wool pads on top of the two lips.
Deinde pone indices tuos duarum manuum simul, et mulier sit super dorsum suum expansis cruribus suis.	Then place your fingers from both hands simultaneously and have the woman lie on her back with her legs spread apart.
Deinde extende duo labia cum fortitudine, donec disrumpatur sifach subtile, et aperiatur opilatio.	Then stretch out the two lips with force until the subtle membranous sac is torn and the bulge opens up.
Deinde accipe lanam, et imbibe eam in oleo, et pone ipsam super locum: et coeat mulier omni die, ut non consolidetur locus uice alia.	Then take a cloth, soak it in oil, and place it on the spot; and let the woman apply it every day so that the place does not become hardened by something else.
Si autem sifach est grossum, spissum: tunc oportet ut seces ipsum cum spatumili lato simili folio myrti.	But if the membranous sac is thick and dense, then it is necessary to cut it with a broad, flat leaf similar to a myrtle leaf.
Si autem opilatio est ex carne nata, tunc suspende eam cum uncinis, et incide eam: et sint tecum medicinae quae fluxum sedant sanguinis absque mordicatione, sicut acacia, et sanguis draconis, et thus aggregatum cum albugine oui.	But if the bulge is from a natural growth of flesh, then suspend it with a hook and cut it; and have with you medicines that will stop bleeding without biting, such as acacia, dragon's blood, and the aggregation of turtle shell with egg white.
Deinde administra cannulam ex plumbo amplam, ut non consolidetur uulnus uelociter, teneat eam diebus aliquot: et administra licinium ex lino sicco, deinde curetur reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then administer a bronze cannula, broad and wide, so that the wound does not quickly become hardened; keep it for several days and then apply linen cloth, and then complete the remaining treatment until healing occurs.
Et quandoque nasciur in matrice natiuitas carnium aliarum: oportet ergo ut incidantur secundum hunc modum: dum non est apostema cancerosum apostemati enim canceroso quod est in matrice, non fiat contrarietas cum ferro omnino.	And whenever birth occurs of other flesh in the womb: it is necessary therefore that they be cut according to this manner: while there is no cancerous aposteme, for an aposteme that is cancerous in the womb should not at all be contrary to iron.
¶ De cura hemorroidarum, Athehelil, et Bothor rubeae in uuluis mulierum.	On the treatment of hemorrhoids, Athenail, and red boils on women's vulvae.
Caput LXXIII.	Chapter 73.
Hemorroides quidem sunt apertio orificiorum uenarum, donec currit ex eis sanguis multus assidue.	Hemorrhoids indeed are the opening of venous orifices, until a great deal of blood continuously flows from them.
Cum ergo antiquantur hemorroides, fiunt thelil: et iam dixi in diuisione species earum, et signa ipsarum: et dicam hic quae ex eis recipiunt curationem, et quae non.	Therefore, when hemorrhoids become old, they become hardened: and I said earlier in the division of their kinds and signs: and I will say here which of them receive cure and which do not.
Dico ergo, quod hemorroides quae sunt in orificio matricis, et non apparent sensui: tunc non est ei curatio cum ferro.	I say therefore that hemorrhoids which are in the maternal orifice and do not appear to the sense: then there is no cure for them with iron.
Quae autem ex eis sunt in orificio matricis super quas cadit sensus, sunt quae curantur.	Those however which are in the maternal orifice and over which sensation falls, are those that can be cured.
Oportet ergo ut intromittas mulierem in domum frigidam.	It is necessary therefore that you should introduce a woman into a cold house.
Deinde extende athehelil cum forficibus, aut cum panno aspero, et incide eas ex radicibus suis.	Then extend Athenail with forceps or with a rough cloth, and cut them from their roots.
Deinde pulueriza super eas apud fluxum sanguinis ex uno puluerum incisiuorum absque mordificatione: sicut acacia, et sanguis draconis, et thus, et similia eis.	Then sprinkle powder on them at the flow of blood from one cut powder without rubbing: like acacia, and dragon's blood, and thyme, and similar things.
Deinde impellat pedes eius ad parietem hora una.	Then drive her feet against the wall for an hour.
Postea depone eam in aquam frigidam.	After that, place her in cold water.
Quod si perseuerat fluxus sanguinis: tunc fac eam sedere in decoctione sumach, et corticum granatorum, et gallarum, et similium.	What if the flow of blood persists: then make her sit in a decoction of sumach, and pomegranate bark, and gall, and similar things.
Deinde accipe farinam hordei, et confice eam cum melle et aceto, et fac emplastrum cum eo super dorsum eius.	Then take barley flour, and mix it with honey and vinegar, and make a poultice with it on her back.
Si ergo abscinditur sanguis cum eo, bonum est: et si non, fac adhaerere dorso uentosas, et mammillis, absque scarificatione.	If therefore the blood is cut off with that, it is good; and if not, make it adhere to her back, and breasts, without scarifying.
Deinde accipe lanam, et submerge in succo tarathit, aut succo arnoglossae, aut succo ramorum alaulat, id est, aglanter, uino pontico, et fac adhaerere loeo.	Then take wool and immerse it in tartrate sap, or sap of the ox's tongue, or sap of the willow tree, that is, galantine, Pontic wine, and make it stick to the place.
Cum ergo quiescit apostema, tunc cura locum cum unguentis, donec sanetur.	When therefore an abscess has subsided, then care for the place with ointments until it is healed.
Albarth uero rubeum est simile capitibus alhaasse, et est asperi aspectus.	The albarrus however is red and resembles the heads of eelgrass, and has a rough appearance.
Oportet ergo ut incidas quod apparet ex eo, secundum quod dixi in thelil aequaliter: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Therefore you should cut what appears on it, according to what I said in equal parts; and care for it until it is healed.
¶ De perforatione Exiturae quae accidit in matrice.	About the perforation of the placenta which occurs in the uterus.
Caput LXXIIII.	Chapter 74.
Accidunt in matrice species multae apostematum, sicut cancer, et apostema lapideum, et ulcera, et adubelati, et alekilati, id est, herpes, aestiomemus, et fistulae, et hemorroides, et ragadiae, et thelil, et apostema calidum.	Many kinds of abscesses occur in the uterus, such as cancer, stony abscess, ulcers, and those that are abraded, or licked away, that is, herpes, or inflammation, or fistulas, or hemorrhoids, or excrescences, or thelids, or hot abscess.
Et ego quidem iam dixi omnes has aegritudines et species earum, et signa ipsarum, et earum curationes in diuisione: necesse est ut dicam in hoc tractatu apostema calidum quod accidit in matrice, quando est ex apostematibus quae colligunt saniem, et uis scire qualiter fit eius apertio cum ferro.	And I have already said all these diseases and their kinds, and the signs of each, and their cures in a division; it is necessary for me to say about hot abscess which occurs in the uterus when it is from abscesses that gather pus, and I wish to know how its opening is made with iron.
Oportet ergo ut consideres.	Therefore you should consider.
Tunc si dolor apostematis in incaeptione sua est acutus cum percussione sua, et flamma, et febre: et uides ipsum rubere: si cadit super ipsum sensus, tunc non properes cum perforatione eius: et cura ipsum cum eo eo quod iuuat super maturationem, donec quando quiescat acuitas accidentium.	Then if the pain of the abscess in its beginning is sharp with percussion and heat and fever: and you see it becoming red: if sensation falls on it, then do not hurry to open it; and care for it along with it as is fitting for maturation, until the sharpness of the accident subsides.
Tunc oportet ut facias sedere mulierem super sedem quae labeat duo sedilia, et reclinetur, uel appodietur super dorsum suum, et aggreget pedes suos ad partem inferiorem uentris: et sint coxae eius expansae, et ponat brachia sua sub genibus suis, et liget utraque ligamento conueniente ad illud.	Then it is necessary to make the woman sit on a seat that has two armrests, and recline or lean back against her back, and gather her feet to the lower part of the abdomen: and let her hips be spread apart, and place her arms under her knees, and bind each one with suitable ligaments to it.
Deinde sedeat obstetrix a latere dextro, et administra instrumentum quo aperitur orificium matricis.	Then the midwife should sit on the right side and administer the instrument with which the opening of the womb is made.
Cuius forma uenit in eis quae sunt post.	Whose form comes to those things that are behind.
Et oportet quando uis administrare hoc instrumentum, ut figas cum Radio profundum matricis mulieris: ut non sit illud quod ingreditur ex instrumento plus, quam profundum matricis, et laedat infirmam.	And it is necessary when you wish to administer this instrument that you place the radio with a deep probe of the woman's womb: so that what enters from the instrument will not be more than the depth of the womb and harm the patient.
Si autem fuerit instrumentum magis quam profundum, tunc oportet ut ponas puluillos super tecturam profundi matricis: ut prohibeatur introitus instrumenti totius in profundum matricis: et oportet ut ponat uertiginem, quae currit in instrumento, ex latere superiore: et ut teneat instrumentum, et ut reuoluat minister uertiginem, donec aperiatur profundum matricis.	But if the instrument is longer than the depth of the womb, then it is necessary to place poults on the cover of the deep part of the womb: so that the entrance of the entire instrument into the deep part of the womb may be prevented. And it is necessary to place a whirlpool which runs in the instrument above the upper side and to hold the instrument and to have the minister turn back the whirlpool, until the depth of the womb is opened.
Cum ergo apparet Exitura, et tangitur manu, et est lenis et mollis: tunc oportet ut seces ipsam apud caput suum cum spatumili lato.	When therefore the Exitura appears and is touched with the hand and is soft and gentle: then it is necessary to cut off that part at its head with a spatula.
Cum ergo euacuatur sanies, tunc oportet ut ponas in uulnus licinium submersum in oleo rosaceo: aut oleo uiridi, in quo sit quaedam stipticitas: et pone licinium, et extrahe sectionem in profundo matricis.	When therefore the discharge of blood is stopped, then it is necessary to put a linen cloth soaked in rose oil or green oil, which has some astringent quality, into the wound and place the cloth and remove the section from the deep part of the womb.
Et pone exterius super matricem, et super pectinem lanam mundam submersam in aqua, in qua bullitae sunt maluae.	And put something outside over the uterus and over the flank a clean wool cloth soaked in water in which mulberries have boiled.
Deinde curetur post duos dies cum unguento quod conuenit ad illud, donec sanetur.	Then it should be cared for after two days with an ointment that is suitable for this, until it heals.
Et quandoque abluitur matrix et uulnus, ita quod clisterizatur cum aqua et melle: deinde cum aqua in qua bullita est radix lilii, aut aristolochia longa: deinde redeat ad unguentum.	And when the uterus and wound are washed, so that they are cleansed with water and honey: then with water in which the root of lily has been boiled, or Aristolochia longa: then it should return to the ointment.
Quod si uulnus absconditum fuerit interius in matrice, tunc oportet ut prohibearis ex curatione eius cum ferro, imo cura ipsum cum eo quod diximus in diuisione.	Which if the wound is hidden inside the womb, then it is necessary to prevent its cure with iron, rather to treat it with what we said in the division.
¶ Doctrinae Obstetricum, qualiter medicentur embriones uiui, secundum figuram non naturalem egressi.	Doctrines of Childbirth: how midwives should treat living embryos that have not naturally issued according to form.
Caput Lxxu.	Chapter 70.
Necesse est Obstetrici, ut cognoscat in primis figuram partus naturalis.	It is necessary for the midwife to know first of all the natural shape of birth.
Ex signis ergo eius est, quod quando uides mulierem comprimi ad inferiora, et desiderat odorare aerem, et alleuiatur super eam quod super ipsam est de partu, et festinat exitus embrionis: tunc scias quod iste partus est secundum figuram naturalem, et est exitus eius super caput suum, et secundina cum eo: aut suspensa, uel pendens ex umbilico.	Therefore it is a sign of hers, that when you see the woman compressed downwards, and she desires to breathe in the air, and is relieved above her by what is above her in labor, and hastens the exit of the embryo: then you will know that this birth is natural, and its exit is over its head, and with it the umbilical cord is either suspended or hanging from the navel.
Cum ergo uides haec signa, tunc oportet ut comprimatur uenter eius, ut descendat embrio uelociter.	When therefore you see these signs, then it is necessary that her belly be compressed so that the embryo may descend quickly.
Nam quando descendit super caput suum, descendit secundina cum eo, et mundatur ex illis superfluitatibus mundificatione bona.	For when it descends over its head, the umbilical cord also descends with it, and is cleansed from those superfluities by a good cleansing.
Qui autem est praeter hunc partum, est innaturalis, illaudabilis.	But he who is outside of this birth is unnatural, unpraiseworthy.
Quoniam quandoque egreditur foetus super pedes suos, et egreditur corpus eius ante caput ipsius, et pedes eius, et manus eius una, aut pes eius unus: aut egreditur caput eius et manus eius: aut egreditur uentrinus: et fortasse conuertitur super collum suum, et similia ex figuris illaudabilibus.	Because sometimes the fetus emerges over its feet, and the body emerges before its head, and its feet and hands together, or one foot alone: or it emerges with its head and hands: or it emerges with the ventral part: and perhaps it turns over onto its neck, and similar things from unpraiseworthy forms.
Necesse est ergo Obstetrici, ut sit prudens, subtilis in istis rebus omnibus, et caueat sibi ab errore et decaeptione: et ego sum ostendens omnem figuram ex eis, et qualiter est ingenium in ea, et significetur per illud, et stetur super ipsum.	It is necessary therefore for the midwife to be prudent, subtle in all these things, and beware of error and deception: and I am showing you every form from them, and how it is shaped in each one, and what it signifies by that, and let it stand over it.
Quando egreditur foetus super caput suum egressione sua naturali, et uehemens fit illud super mulierem, et difficilis fit ei partus, et uides uirtutem eius iam debilitatam: tunc fac eam sedere super sedem, aut mulieres teneant eam: et uapora uuluam eius cum foenugraeco decocto, et cum oleis humidis.	When the fetus emerges over its head in its natural emergence, and it becomes violent over the woman, and labor is difficult for her, and you see that her strength is already weakened: then make her sit on a stool or have women hold her: and fumigate her vulva with foenugraecum decocted, and with moist oils.
Deinde intromittat Obstetrix inter digitos suos Spatumile paruum, et findat cum eo secundinam, et secet eam ungue suo, donec currat quod est in ea ex humiditate: et preme uentrem mulieris, donec descendat foetus.	Then the midwife should insert a small spoon-like instrument between her fingers and scrape with it along the second joint, and cut off what is in it by moistness; and press on the woman's womb until the fetus descends.
Si autem non descendit, tunc oportet ut clisterizetur mulier ex mucillagine foenugraeci, cum oleo sisamino.	But if it does not descend, then it is necessary that the woman be cleansed with a mixture of fenugreek and oil of sycamore.
Deinde praecipe ei post clistere, ut comprimatur: et fac eam sternutare cum condisi, et tene os eius et nasum ipsius hora una.	Then instruct her to compress after cleansing; and make her sneeze when you apply it, and hold her mouth and nose for one hour.
Foetus enim egredietur statim.	For the fetus will immediately emerge.
Quod si egrediantur duae manus foetus in primis, iunc oportet ut reducas eas cum facilitate paulatim.	And if two hands of the fetus emerge first, it is necessary to reduce them with gentle ease.
Si autem non obedit in introitu, tunc pone mulierem super sedem, et eleua pedes eius sursum: deinde concute sedem super terram: et mulier teneatur, ut non cadat apud concussionem.	But if it does not obey on entering, then place the woman on a chair and lift her feet up; afterwards strike the chair against the ground: and the woman should be held so that she may not fall during the shock.
Si ergo non egrediuntur manus, et moritur foetus: tunc incide eas, et extrahe residuum foetus: et liga manum eius cum panno, et extrahe ipsum cum aequalitate: nam ipse egredietur.	Therefore if the hands do not emerge and the fetus dies: then cut them off and extract any remaining part of the fetus; and bind his hand with a cloth and extract it with ease: for he will come out.
¶ Exitus embrionis super pedes suo.	Exit of the embryo onto its feet.
Quando egreditur foetus super pedes suos, tunc oportet ut impellat eos sursum: deinde conuertat foetum paulatim: postea aequet ipsum.	When the fetus emerges over its feet, then it is necessary to push them up; afterwards turn the fetus gradually; and finally straighten it.
Deinde accipiat unum pedum eius, et extendat eum paulatim.	Then take one of its feet and stretch it out gradually.
Cum ergo egrediuntur usque ad coxas, tunc praecipe ei, ut comprimatur, et fac eam sternutare cum condisi: egredietur enim, si Deus uoluerit.	When they emerge up to the hips, then instruct her to compress and make her sneeze when you apply it: for it will come out, if God wills.
Et si non egreditur cum eo quod narrauimus, tunc reduc foetum paulatim, donec ponas eum secundum figuram naturalem.	And if it does not emerge as we have described, then reduce the fetus gradually until you place it in its natural form.
Nam ipse egredietur tunc egressu facili.	For it will come out then with easy delivery.
Quod si prohibeatur cum eo toto quod narrauimus: tunc accipe ex mucillagine alteae, et oleo sisamino, et gummi soluto: et percute totum in mortario percussione bona: deinde line cum eo uuluam mulieris, et inferius uentris eius.	And if it is hindered with all that we have described: then take from the mixture of aloes, and oil of sycamore, and dissolved gum; and strike the whole in a mortar with good percussion: afterwards bind it to her woman's cloth, and lower part of her abdomen.
Deinde fac eam sedere in aqua tepida, donec consequatur hypocundria.	Then make it sit in warm water until hypothermia occurs.
Cum ergo uides quod iam calefacta sunt inferiora eius, tunc fac ei sief de myrrha: et suppone ipsum.	When you see that the lower parts of his body are already warmed up, then make him take myrrh: and put it on him.
Quando ergo tenet sief hora una, tunc fac eam sedere super sedem.	When he has held the myrrh for an hour, then make him sit on a stool.
Deinde fac eam sternutare: et stringe ipsius os et nasum: et preme inferiorem partem uentris compressione facili.	Then make him sneeze: and tie his mouth and nose: and press the lower part of his abdomen with easy compression.
Nam foeus egredietur statim.	For fire will immediately come out.
¶ Exitus foetus super genua et manus.	The outcome is that the fetus comes out over the knee and hand.
Quando egreditur secundum hanc formam, tunc ingeniet in intromittendo manus suas paulatim.	When it comes out in this way, then he should gradually put his hands in.
Deinde resupinetur mulier super collum suum, et pendeant pedes eius ad inferiora: et ipsa sit iacens super lectum, et complicet manus suas.	Then the woman will be laid back on her pillow, and her feet will dangle downwards; and she herself should lie on the bed, and wrap up her hands.
Deinde preme supra uentrem eius paulatim.	Then press gently upon her womb.
Deinde extrahe quod est sub pedibus eius ex puluinaribus, donec sit praeparata in inferiori parte.	Then remove what is under her feet from the bedclothes, until it is prepared at the lower part.
Quod si non egreditur foetus, tunc accipe pedes eius, et moue eos motu uehementi.	If the fetus does not come out, then take her feet and move them with a violent motion.
Deinde preme quod est supra hypocundria paulatim, donec ascendat foetus ad superiora.	Then press gently upon what is above hypothermia, until the fetus ascends to the higher parts.
Deinde intromittat manus suas, et aequet foetum paulatim: et praecipe mulieri, ut comprimatur, donec egrediatur foetus.	Then insert her hands and equalize the fetus gradually; and instruct the woman to compress herself until the fetus comes out.
¶ Exitus foetus latitudinaliter pendens ex manibus.	The outcome is that the fetus hangs sideways from her hands.
Ingenietur in reductione manus eius.	He should assist in lowering her hands.
Si autem non potest reducere eam, tunc eleua mulierem, et fac eam ambulare.	If she cannot be lowered, then raise the woman and make her walk.
Si uero ambulare non potest, tunc fac eam iacere super lectum: et concute crura eius concussione uehementi.	If she cannot walk, then make her lie on the bed: and strike her legs with violent shaking.
Deinde administra linimentum quod praeparasti ex mucillaginibus.	Then administer the ointment that you prepared from mucus.
Quod si accipit eam partus, tunc fac eam sedere super sedem.	If she takes a breath, then make her sit on a stool.
Deinde stude in reductione manus, et aequa foetum secundum figuram naturalem: et fac sternutare mulierem, et praecipe ei, ut comprimat se, donec egrediatur.	Then strive to reduce the hand and form a swelling equal to its natural shape. And cause the woman to cough and instruct her to compress herself until it goes out.
¶ Exitus foetus super collum suum, expansis manibus, et est facies eius ad dorsum matris suae.	The exit of the fetus above its mother's neck, with arms extended, and its face turned to the back of its mother.
Oportet ut teneat Obstetrix manum foetus, deinde reuoluat eum paulatim, et aequet eum cum facilitate.	The midwife should hold the fetus's hand, then slowly turn it around and equalize it with ease.
Cum ergo aequatur, tunc pone super uuluam eius quod narrauimus ex oleo et mucillaginibus.	When it is equalized, then place over its mouth what we mentioned earlier made from oil and slimy substances.
Deinde praecipe ei, ut moueatur paulatim.	Then instruct her to move slowly.
Cum ergo feceris illud, tunc fac eam sedere super sedem, et praecipe ei ut inclinetur ad latus dextrum.	When you do that, then make her sit on a seat and instruct her to lean towards the right side.
Deinde praecipe ei, ut comprimatur: et fac eam sternutare cum condisi.	Then instruct her to compress herself; and cause her to cough with condensation.
¶ Exitus foetus praeparati super latus.	The exit of the prepared fetus onto the side.
Quando descendit ad orificium matricis secundum hunc modum cum secundina, tunc scinde secundinam cum ungue tuo, donec euacuetur ex humiditate.	When it descends to the mother's opening in this way with a cord, then cut the cord with your own nail until it is drained of moisture.
Si ergo suspenditur super faciem foetus, et collum eius, tunc incide eam ex umbilico: ut non retineatur, et moriatur.	If it is suspended above the face and neck of the fetus, then cut it from the navel, so that it will not remain and die.
Deinde impelle foetum ad interiora, donec ponas eam secundum quod oportet: et praecipe mulieri, ut comprimat se aliquotiens: ipse enim egredietur exitu leui.	Then push the fetus towards the inside until you place it as needed; and instruct the woman to compress herself several times: for it will emerge with a light exit.
¶ Exitus Geminorum, aut foetuum multorum.	The exit of twins, or multiple fetuses.
Scias, quod Gemini multotiens nascuntur: et quandoque nascuntur tres, et quatuor.	You should know that twins are often born; and sometimes three, and four, are born.
Verumtamen illud extraneum est, et raro contingit.	However, that is an abnormal case, and it rarely occurs.
Quinque uero est res extra naturam, et non uiuunt penitus: et continet eos, quamuis multiplicentur, secundina una: et separantur per sifach, distinguens inter eos ligatum in umbilico cuiusque eorum.	Five is a thing outside nature, and they do not live at all; and it contains them, although they multiply, with one cord: and they are separated by the si-fac, distinguishing between them, tied to each of their navels.
Et quandoque egrediuntur sicut egreditur foetus unus exitu naturali, facili: et egrediuntur exitu illaudabili, sicut narrauimus.	And sometimes they go out as one fetus goes out naturally and easily; and they go out in an unworthy manner, just as we have narrated.
Quod si difficiles fuerint quidam eorum apud partum, et perueniunt ad illud quod diximus ex figuris innaturalibus, tunc cura eos sicut narrauimus: et sit ob stetrix subtilis, et faciat quod facit cum facilitate et tarditate, et ingenietur secundum omnem figuram cum eo quod praeparatur ei ex ingenio ducente ad salutem.	But if some of them are difficult during birth and reach what we mentioned in unnatural shapes, then care for them as we have narrated: and let there be a skilled accoucheuse, and do what she does with ease and slowness, and shape him according to every figure with that which is prepared for him from the guiding ingenuity leading to salvation.
¶ Rememoratio eius quod formatur in matrice ex embrionibus, et abortiuntur.	A reminder of what forms in the womb from embryos and are aborted.
Quandoque formatur in matrice unus, et duo, et tres, et quatuor, et quinque, et sex, et septem, et plures decem: et iam uerificatum est apud me, quod mulier abortiendo emisit septem, et alia quindecim, omnes formatos.	Sometimes one forms in the womb, and two, and three, and four, and five, and six, and seven, and many ten: and now it has been verified with me, that a woman aborting has emitted seven, and fifteen others, all formed.
Quod factum est mensuratione gloriosi sapientis.	What was done by the measurement of a glorious sage.
Hoc ergo totum oportet ut sit in scientia Obstetricis.	Therefore, this whole thing is necessary to be in the knowledge of an obstetrician.
Fortasse enim perueniet ad eam simile illius: opponat ergo ei cum illo quod oportet	Perhaps it will come to resemble that one: let him then compare it with that which is fitting.
¶ De extractione foetus mortui.	A treatise on the extraction of a dead fetus.
Caput LXXVI.	Chapter 76.
Quando curas foetum mortuum cum eo quod dixi in diuisione ex medicatione, et non egreditur, et cogeris uti operatione cum manu, tunc oportet ut consideres.	When you care for a dead fetus as I said in the division of medicine, and it does not go out, and you are forced to use an operation with your hand, then it is necessary that you take into account.
Si ergo mulier est sanae uirtutis, et non est cum aliquo ex accidentibus, ex quibus timetur super eam perditio: tunc oportet ut resupinetur mulier super lectum, super dorsum suum, et sit caput eius inclinatum inferius, et crura eius eleuata: et ministra teneat eam a duabus partibus, aut ligetur ad lectum, ut non extrahatur corpus eius apud extractionem foetus.	If then the woman is of sound virtue and is not affected by any of the accidents from which one fears destruction over her: then it is necessary that the woman be placed on a bed, upon her back, and let her head be inclined downward, and her legs be raised; and a servant should hold her from both sides, or tie her to the bed, so that her body may not be pulled apart during the extraction of the fetus.
Deinde humecta os matricis ex oleis humidis cum mucillagine alteae, et foenugraeci, et seminis lini.	Then the mouth of the uterus should be moistened with oily liquids mixed with high-quality mucus, and fenugreek, and linseed.
Deinde inungat Obstetrix manum suam cum istis oleis et mucillaginibus: deinde intromittat eam in matricem cum facilitate.	Then the midwife should grease her hand with these oils and mucilages; then she should insert it into the womb with ease.
Deinde quaerat cum ea locum in quo figat uncinos ex foetu, et loca conuenientia ad illud.	Then she should search for a place where she can grasp the hooked part of the fetus and suitable places to it.
Considera ergo tunc, si foetus est praeparatus ut descendat super caput suum: tunc fige uncinos in oculos eius, aut in collo eius, aut in ore eius, aut in palato ipsius, aut sub barba eius, aut in furcula ipsius, aut in locis propinquis costis, et sub hypocundriis.	Therefore consider then whether the fetus is prepared to descend on its head: then grasp the hooked part with the eyes, or throat, or mouth, or palate of the fetus, or beneath the chin, or at the fork of the neck, or in nearby places of the ribs, and under the hyoid bones.
Si autem descensus est super pedes eius, tunc in pectine, et costis eius mediis.	But if the descent is on its feet, then grasp the sternum and middle ribs.
Et oportet, ut teneat uncinum cum manu dextra: et ponat curuitatem eius in eo quod est inter digitos sinistrae manus: et intromittat cum manu cum facilitate, et figat uncinum in aliquo illorum locorum quae diximus, donec perueniat ad rem uacuam.	And it is necessary that she hold the hooked part with her right hand; and place the curvature of it between the fingers of her left hand: and insert it with ease, and grasp the hooked part in one of those places which we mentioned, until it reaches the empty space.
Deinde figat in oppositione eius uncinum alium, aut tertium, si indiges: ut sit contractio aequalis, et non declinet ad partem.	Then she should grasp another hooked part, or a third one if necessary, so that there is equal contraction and it does not incline to the side.
Deinde extendatur extensione aequali, et non sit extensio secundum rectitudinem tantum, imo moueatur ad omnem partem, ut alleuietur exitus eius: sicut fit cum dente apud eradicationem eius.	Then it should be extended with equal extension and not only straight ahead, but rather moved to all sides, so that the exit is facilitated: just as happens when a tooth is being extracted.
Et oportet in eo quod est inter illud, ut mollificetur extensio.	And it should be softened in the middle of it.
Quod si retineatur ex eo pars, tunc oportet ut inungat Obstetrix quosdam digitos cum oleo, et intromittat eos ex parte, ut reuoluat cum eis quod retinetur.	And if a part remains caught, then the midwife should grease some fingers with oil and insert them there to release what is caught.
Si ergo egreditur pars foetus, tunc permutentur uncini ad locum alium qui sit altior: fac hoc donec egrediatur foetus totus.	And if a part of the fetus emerges, then the hooked parts should be moved to another higher place; do this until the entire fetus has emerged.
Si ergo egreditur manus ante alia, et non est possibile reducere eam, propter coartationem eius: tunc oportet, ut inuoluatur super eam pannus.	And if a hand emerges before the others and it is not possible to reduce it due to its contraction: then it is necessary that a cloth be wrapped over it.
Deinde extrahe eam donec quando egreditur tota, incide eam aut in iunctura plantae, aut in cubito: et ita oportet ut facias in manu altera, et in duobus pedibus.	Then pull out the ligament until it is completely loose, cut it either at the joint of the foot or at the elbow; and so you should do on the other hand, and on both feet.
Si autem caput foetus est magnum, aut accidit ei coartatio in exitu, aut est in capite eius aqua aggregata: tunc oportet ut intromittat inter digitos Spatumile spinosum, et findat cum eo caput, et extrahat aquam: aut disrumpat ipsum cum instrumento quod nominatur Almisdac: cuius forma uenit cum formis reliquorum instrumentorum in capitulo quod est post hoc.	But if the head of the foetus is large, or there is a constriction at the exit, or water has collected on its head: then it will be necessary to insert a thorny spatula between the fingers and cut off the head with it, and remove the water; or burst it open with an instrument called Almisdac, whose shape comes with the shapes of the other instruments in the chapter that follows.
Similiter faciat si foetus est magni capitis natura, tunc oportet ut seces algengematu: aut extrahas ipsum cum misdach, sicut diximus.	Similarly do this if the foetus has a large head by nature, then it will be necessary to cut off the afterbirth; or remove it with Almisdac, as we said.
Deinde attrahas ossa cum forcipibus.	Then take out the bones with forceps.
Quod si egrediatur caput, et coartetur apud furculam: tunc findatur, donec effundatur humiditas quae est in pectore.	But if the head emerges and is constricted at the fork; then cut it, until the moisture that is in the chest is drained out.
Si autem non complicatur, neque obedit ad exitum: tunc incide caput frustatim, secundum quod possibile est tibi.	But if it does not complicate and will not obey at the exit; then cut off the head in pieces, as much as you can.
Quod si inferius uentris est apostematum, aut est in eo hydropisis: tunc oportet ut perfores ipsum, donec currat humiditas ex eo.	But if the lower part of the intestines is inflamed or there is dropsy in it; then it will be necessary to perforate it until the moisture flows out of it.
Si uero foetus est super pedes suos, tunc attractio eius est facilis, et directio eius ad os matricis est leuis.	But if the foetus is above its feet, then its extraction is easy and its direction towards the mother's mouth is light.
Si autem coartatur apud uentrem, aut pectus: tunc oportet ut extrahas ipsum cum panno quem inuoluisti super manum tuam: et findat uentrem, aut pectus, donec currat quod est in eis.	But if it is constricted at the abdomen or chest; then it will be necessary to pull it out with the cloth you wrapped around your hand: and cut open the abdomen or chest until what is inside them comes out.
Si autem auferuntur reliqua membra, et redit caput: tunc intromittat Obstetrix manum sinistram.	But if the remaining limbs are removed and the head returns; then the midwife should insert her left hand.
Si ergo os matricis est apertum, tunc intromittat manum in profundum matricis, et quaerat cum ea caput, et attrahat ipsum cum digitis usque ad os matricis: deinde intromittat in eo uncinum unum, aut uncinos duos, et attrahat ipsum cum eo.	If then the mother's mouth is open, then insert your hand into the depth of the womb and search with it for the head, and pull it out with your fingers up to the mother's mouth: then insert one or two hooks into it, and pull it out with them.
Quod si os matricis coartatur, propter apostema calidum quod accidit ei: tunc non oportet ut laboretur super ipsum, imo oportet tunc administrare effusionem rerum humidarum, pinguium: et administra emplastra: et sedeat in aquis quae mollificant et humectant.	If the womb is constricted due to a hot abscess that has occurred in it; then one should not trouble oneself over it, but rather it is necessary at that time to administer a flow of moist and fatty substances: and apply poultices: and sit in waters that soften and moisten.
Quod si foetus est super latus suum, tunc possibile est ut aequetur: tunc administretur quod diximus in foetu uiuo.	If the fetus is lying on its side; then it is possible to equalize it; then what we said should be administered to a living fetus.
Quod si non est possibile illud, tunc incidatur frustatim, et extrahatur.	If that is not possible, then cut it into pieces and extract it.
Et oportet ut non dimittas aliquid ex secundina intus omnino.	And one must not leave anything of the residue entirely within.
Cum ergo compleueris operationem tuam, tunc administra quod diximus in apostematibus calidis quae accidunt in matricibus.	When you have completed your operation, then administer what we said for hot abscesses that occur in wombs.
Quod si accidat fluxus sanguinis, tunc descendat in aquis stipticis, et administra reliquam curationem.	If bleeding occurs, then let it flow into cooling waters, and administer the remaining treatment.
Et ego quidem iam uidi mulierem, in cuius uentre mortuus erat foetus: deinde impregnata est super ipsum uice alia, postea mortuus est foetus alius etiam.	And I myself have already seen a woman whose womb contained a dead fetus; then she became pregnant again with another child in its place, and the other fetus also died.
Accidit ergo ei post tempus longum apostema in umbilico suo, et inflatum est, donec apertum est: et coepit emittere pus.	Apostema then occurred to her after a long time in her navel, and it became inflamed until it was opened; and it began to discharge pus.
Vocatus sum ergo ad curationem eius, et medicatus sum ei tempore longo: et non consolidatum est uulnus.	I was therefore called to her cure, and I treated her for a long time; and the wound did not consolidate.
Posui ergo super ipsum ex quibusdam emplastris fortis attractionis: et exiuit ex loco os.	So I placed over it some poultices of strong attraction, and it came out from its place, that is, the bone.
Deinde praeterierunt ei dies aliquot, et exiuit os aliud.	Then a few days passed for her, and another bone came out.
Miratus sum ergo inde, cum in uentre non sit os.	So I was amazed on this account, since there is no bone in the womb.
Cogitaui ergo, quia erant ex ossibus foetus mortui.	I thought therefore that they were from the bones of a dead fetus.
Inquisiui ergo uulnus, et extraxi ossa multa, muliere existente in melioribus dispositionibus suis: et iam uixit taliter tempore longo, et mittit ex loco pus parum.	I therefore examined the wound and extracted many bones from the woman, who was in good physical condition; and now she has lived in this way for a long time, and is discharging pus little by little.
Et ego non firmaui hic hoc extraneum, nisi quoniam in eo est scientia, et adiutorium ad illud, quod administrat medicus artifex cum manu ex curatione.	And I did not strengthen this external thing here, except that there is knowledge and aid in it for the skillful healer to use his hand in the cure.
¶ De formis Instrumentorum necessariorum in extractione foetus.	Of the shapes of necessary instruments in extracting a fetus.
Caput LXXVII.	Chapter 77.
Hic inferius est forma Strictorii, quo aequantur libri, cui aequaliter sunt duae uertigines in duabus extremitatibus duorum lignorum.	Here is the form of the Strictor, by which books are equalized; it has two handles at both ends of two wooden bars.
Verumtamen haec Vertigo oportet ut sit subtilior strictorio: et ut fiat, aut ex ebano, aut ex ligno bussi.	However, this handle should be more slender than the Strictor; and in order that it may be so, it is to be made either of ebony or of boxwood.
Et sit latitudo omnis ligni quasi duo digiti: et margo cuiusque amborum est quasi digitus unus, et longitudo cuiusque eorum est palmus et medietas: et in medio duorum lignorum sunt duo additamenta ex genere eiusdem ligni, quae iam firmata sunt in utrisque, quorum longitudo est medietas palmi et plus parum: et latitudo utriusque est quasi duo digiti, aut plus parum.	And the width of each wooden bar should be almost two fingers; and the edge of each of them is almost one finger, and its length is a palm and a half: and in the middle of the two wooden bars are two additions made of the same kind of wood, which have already been firmly attached to both, whose length is a little more than half a palm, and width almost two fingers, or a little more.
Et ista duo additamenta intromittuntur in os matricis, ut aperiatur cum eis quando tu reuoluis duas Vertigines.	And these two additions are introduced into the maternal opening, so that it may be opened when you revolve both Handles.
Forma Vertiginis qua aperitur matrix.	The shape of the Handle by which the womb is opened.
Forma alia ad simile illius, subtilior, et leuior.	Another form similar to that one, more slender and lighter.
Fiat ex ligno ebani, aut bussi, secundum similitudinem forcipum.	It is to be made of ebony or boxwood, according to the shape of forceps.
Verumtamen in extremitate eius sint duo additamenta, sicut uides hic supra: et longitudo omnis additamenti ex eis est quasi palmus: et latitudo utriusque est, duo digiti.	However, at its end it should have two additions, as you see here above; and the length of each addition is almost a palm: and the width of each is two fingers.
Cum ergo uis aperire matricem cum eo, tunc fac sedere mulierem super lectum, pendentibus pedibus eius, aperto quod est inter crura eius.	When therefore you wish to open the womb with this, then make the woman sit on a bed, with her feet hanging down, and the opening that is between her thighs.
Deinde intromitte ista duo additamenta coniuncta in matricem: et tu es tenens extremitatem instrumenti inferius inter coxas eius.	Then introduce these two additions joined together into the womb: and you are holding the end of the instrument below between her thighs.
Deinde aperi manum tuam cum instrumento, sicut facis cum forficibus, aequaliter secundum quantitatem quam uis ex apertione oris matricis, donec faciat Obstetrix quod uult.	Then open your hand with the instrument, as you do with forceps, equally according to the quantity which you wish from the opening of the maternal mouth, until it makes what the midwife wills.
Forma Vertiginis alterius quam dixerunt antiqui Forma Impellentis quo impellitur foetus.	The shape of one vertigo is other than that which the ancients said was the driving shape by which the fetus is driven.
Forma Almisdac, qua conteritur caput magnum: et assimilatur forcipi, cui sunt dentes in extremitate, sicut uides.	The form of Almisdac, whereby the great head is crushed: and it resembles a forceps with teeth at the extremity, as you see.
Et quandoque fit oblungum, sicut forcipes secundum hanc formam, sicut uides, cui sunt dentes sicut dentes serrae, quo inciditur et conteritur.	And sometimes it is made oblong, like a forceps according to this shape, as you see, with teeth like the teeth of a saw, whereby it is cut and crushed.
Forma Almisdac quo conteritur caput paruum.	The form of Almisdac by which the small head is crushed.
Forma Vncini habentis spinam unam.	The shape of a clasp having one spike.
Forma Vncini habentis spinas duas.	The shape of a clasp having two spikes.
Forma forcipis cui sunt dentes serrae, cum quo conteritur caput foetus.	The shape of forceps with saw-like teeth, by which the head of the fetus is crushed.
Forma Spatumilis habentis duas extremitates ad abscindendum caput.	The shape of a spatula having two extremities for cutting off the head.
Forma duorum Spatumilium etiam latorum.	The shape of two broad spatulas.
Ista instrumenta omnia exercentur, et quanto plus multiplicantur species eorum, et praeparata sunt apud artificem, est uelocior ad operationem suam, et altior apud homines, propter quantitatem suam.	These instruments are all exercised and the more their kinds multiply, and they are prepared with an artist, it is quicker for its own operation, and higher among humans, due to its quantity.
Non ergo despicies ex eis instrumentum, quin sit apud te praeparatum.	Therefore do not despise any of these instruments, but let it be prepared with you.
Inexcusabilis est enim necessitas eorum.	For indeed there is an inexcusable necessity for them.
¶ De extractione Secundinae.	Paragraph: On the Extraction of the Secondines.
Caput LXXVIII.	Chapter 78.
Quando retinetur Secundina apud partum, tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmae, ut retineat anhelitum suum.	When the secondines are retained during childbirth, then it is necessary to hasten the weak one, so that it retains its breathing.
Deinde fac eam sternutare cum condisi: et stringe manum tuam super os eius, et nares ipsius.	Then make her sneeze with a gentle blow: and hold your hand over her mouth, and nostrils.
Si ergo egreditur per hoc, bonum est.	If it comes out through this, it is good.
Si non: tunc accipe ollam, et perfora in coopertorio foramen: et pone in ea herbas aperientes os matricis, sicut calamentum, rutam, et anetum, et camomillam, et sseham, et cassiam ligneam, et centauream: accipe omnes istas herbas, aut quasdam earum, et submerge eas cum aqua, et pone eas super ignem.	If not: then take a vessel and perforate a hole in the cover; and place inside it opening herbs of the mother's mouth, such as calamentum, ruta, anethum, camomilla, sseham, cassis lignea, and centaurea. Take all these herbs or some of them and submerge them with water, and put them on fire.
Deinde pone embulam arundinis super foramen coopertorii ollae, et extremitatem aliam in os matricis: et teneat eam donec perueniat uapor ad concauitatem matricis.	Then place the reed's pith on top of the hole in the vessel's cover, and put another end into the mother's mouth; and let it be until the steam reaches the mother's mouth's dryness.
Deinde fac eam sternutare, sicut diximus.	Then make her cough as we said.
Secundina enim egredietur cum facilitate.	For then the Secundina will come out with ease.
Si autem remaneat post hanc curationem, et non egrediatur: tunc praecipe Obstetrici, ut submergat manum suam in oleo sisamino, aut mucillagine alteae.	But if it remains after this treatment and does not come out: then instruct the midwife to dip her hand in sesame oil or with a high-quality mucilage.
Deinde intromittat in uuluam, et quaerat cum ea Secundinam.	Then insert her hand into the womb, and search for the Secundina with it.
Cum ergo inuenerit eam, tunc accipiat eam, et extendat ipsam paulatim.	When she has found it, then take it and pull it out gradually.
Si autem fuerit annexa in profundo matricis, tunc intromittat manum, secundum quod narrauimus, donec quando inuenerit Secundinam, et extrahat eam paulatim secundum rectitudinem, ut non cadat matrix apud attractionem uehementem: imo oportet, ut permutetur cum facilitate ad latera dextra et sinistra: deinde addatur in quantitatem attractionis.	But if it is attached deep within the womb, then insert your hand, as we have described, until you find the Secundina, and pull it out gradually according to its straightness, so that the matrix does not fall due to strong attraction. Rather, it should be adjusted with ease to the right and left sides: afterwards add to the amount of attraction.
Ipsa enim obedit tunc, et seruatur, et euadit ab adhaerentia.	Then it will obey, and be saved, and escape from its attachment.
Quod si os matricis est coartatum, sicut nos iam narrauimus: cura eam cum sternutatione, et ex medicatione ollae cum herbis.	But if the mother's mouth is constricted, as we have already described: cure it with coughing and by medication of the vessel with herbs.
Si autem non egreditur cum omnibus quae narrauimus, tunc caue ne fatigeris super eam in iteratione extractionis.	But if it does not come out with all that we have described, then beware of exhausting yourself over it in the repetition of extractions.
Verum oportet, ut quod egreditur ad os matricis ex ea, liges ad coxam mulieris.	Indeed, it is necessary to tie what comes out towards the mother's mouth from her to the woman's hip.
Deinde clisteriza eam cum unguento tetrapharmacon.	Then poultice her with the balm of four drugs.
Ipsum enim putrefaciet eam post dies, et dissoluetur, et egredietur.	For it will rot and dissolve that thing after a day, and will come out.
Verumtamen quando putrefit, eleuatur ex ea odor malus ad stomachum et caput, et laedit illud infirmam.	However, when it rots, a bad smell is raised from it to the stomach and head, and harms that sick person.
Oportet ergo ut administrentur suffumigationes conuenientes ad illud.	Therefore, suitable fumigations must be administered for it.
Quidam autem antiquorum iam experti sunt suffumigationem nasturtii, et ficuum siccarum.	However, some ancient people have already experienced the fumigation of watercress and dried figs.
Forma instrumenti quo suffumigatur mulier apud retentionem Secundinae et menstruorum.	The shape of the instrument with which a woman is fumigated in the case of retained menses and Second-day bleeding.
Fiat ex uitro simile alcama, aut ex zere: et ponatur extremitas ampla super ignem: et suffumigatio sit posita super prunas: teneat eam, donec consumatur illa suffumigatio: et itera aliam.	Let it be made from a glass like alcama, or from zircon: and let the broad end be placed over the fire: and the fumigation be situated above the embers: hold it until that fumigation is consumed: and then repeat another.
¶ De curatione Ani non perforati.	On the cure of an unperforated hernia.
Caput LXXIX.	Chapter 79.
Nascuntur multi puerorum, et Ani eorum sunt non perforati, quos iam opilauit sifac subtile.	Many boys are born and their hernias are not perforated, which have already been bandaged by a fine silk cloth.
Oportet ergo, ut obstetrix perforet illud sifac digito suo: et si non, perforet ipsum cum Spatumili acuto: et caueat lacertum, ne tangat eum.	Therefore, it is necessary for the midwife to pierce that bandage with her finger: and if not, to pierce it with a sharp spatula: and beware the arm, lest she touch him.
Deinde pone super ipsum lanam infusam in uino et oleo.	Then place over it a woolen cloth soaked in wine and oil.
Deinde cura ipsum cum ungentis, donec sanetur.	Then cure it with ointments until it heals.
Si autem times quod opiletur, tunc pone in foramine cannulam de plumbo diebus multis, et auferatur quando puer uult egerere.	But if you fear that it will swell, then place a leaden cannula in the opening for many days, and remove it when the boy wants to urinate.
Et iam accidit opilatio Ani etiam ex consolidatione uulneris, aut apostematis.	And indeed it happens that an obstruction of the hernia also occurs from the consolidation of a wound or aposteme.
Oportet ergo ut secetur illa consolidatio, deinde curetur cum eo quod diximus ex curatione et plumbo.	Therefore, it is necessary to cut open that consolidation, then it should be cured with what we said about the cure and lead.
¶ De curatione Fistularum quae accidunt in inferiori parte.	On the cure of fistulas that occur in the lower part.
Caput LXXX.	Here is the translation:
Fistulae quae accidunt in inferiori, sunt Nodatio, et Grossitudo quae accidunt prope anum deforis: aut in spacio unius partium: et est Fistula una, aut plures.	Fistulas that occur in the lower region are called Nodation and Swelling which occur near the external opening of the anus or in a space of one part, and it is a single fistula or multiple.
Cum ergo antiquatur illa Nodatio, aperitur, et currit ex ea humiditas aquosa alba, aut pus subtile.	When therefore that Nodation becomes old, it opens up, and watery white fluid or subtle pus flows out of it.
Et quandoque sunt ex istis Fistulis penetrantes.	And sometimes they are penetrating from these fistulas.
Ergo penetrantes cognoscuntur per illud quod egreditur ex egestione, et uentositate, quando utitur infirmus egestione: et fortasse egreditur ex eis uermis.	Therefore they are known by what comes out from the evacuation and windiness when an infirm person uses evacuation, and perhaps a worm comes out of them.
Et sunt ex eis Fistulae quando sunt in spacio penetrantes usque ad uesicam, et usque ad meatum uirgae.	And they are fistulas from these when they penetrate into space up to the bladder and up to the meatus of the male organ.
Et sunt ex eis penetrantes usque ad iuncturam coxae, et usque ad nodum caudae.	And they are penetrating from these up to the joint of the hip and up to the knot of the tail.
Ex eo autem quo cognoscitur Fistula penetrans usque ad anum, etiam a non penetrante, est, ut intromittas digitum tuum indicem in anum: et intromittas tentam subtilem in Fistulam ex aere, aut ferro: quando non est tortuositas.	From this however by which one knows that the fistula is penetrating up to the anus, whether it does or does not penetrate, is to insert your index finger into the anus and to insert a thin thread made of air or iron into the fistula when there is no twisting.
Quod si in ea est tortuositas, tunc intromitte in eam tentam ex plumbo subtilem, aut pilum ex pilis equarum, donec sentias tentam, aut pilum in digito tuo.	But if there is twisting in it, then insert into it a thin thread made of lead or a hair from the mane of horses until you feel the thread or hair on your finger.
Quod si non sentis ipsam penitus, neque procedit ex foramine aliquid ex egestione, neque uentositas, neque uermis sicut dixi: tunc scias, quia est non penetrans: propera ergo ad curationem.	But if you don't feel it all the way and nothing comes out from the opening through evacuation or windiness or worm as I said: then you will know that it is not penetrating; therefore hasten to the cure.
Et quando Fistula est penetrans usque ad uesicam, aut ad meatum urinae: tunc significatio eius est exitus urinae ex ea, et prohibitio eius ab hoc ut consolidetur locus cum medicinis.	And when a fistula is penetrating up to the bladder or to the urinary meatus: then its significance is the flow of urine from it and prohibition of this in order that the place may be consolidated with medicines.
Si uero est penetrans usque ad iuncturam coxae, aut ad os coxae: tunc signum eius est, quod perueniat tenta usque illuc, si non est in ea tortuositas usque ad os: et inuentio doloris in circumitu partis, et quod egreditur pus ex ea semper: et quod non ualeat in ea medicatio, neque consolidatur cum unguento.	If however it is penetrating up to the joint of the hip or to the socket of the pelvis: then its sign is that the thread reaches that far if there is no twisting until the opening; and finding pain in the surrounding part, and that pus always comes out from it, and that medicine does not work in it nor is consolidated with ointment.
Et in istis Fistulis omnibus penetrantibus non est curatio omnino: et curatio earum est labor et uanitas ei, ex stultis medicis, super quem formatur.	And in these fistulas that penetrate everywhere there is no cure at all; and the cure of them is toil and futility for foolish doctors, who are brought low.
In illa autem quae non est penetrans, et non antiqua, speratur sanatio cum serro: secundum quod ego narro tibi, et ego iam probaui: et est, ut iaceat infirmus inter manus tuas super dorsum suum: et eleua crura eius usque supra coxas ipsius, et coxae eius sint inclinatae ad uentrem ipsius.	But in those that do not penetrate and are not old, there is hope for healing with a probe; as I shall tell you, and I have already tried it: and it is, that the patient lies between your hands on his back: and raise his legs up to above his hips, and his hips should be inclined towards his belly.
Deinde intromittetentam plumbi, aut aeris, si est in Fistula tortuositas, donec scias ubi peruenit tenta.	Then introduce a lead or air probe into the fistula, if there is tortuosity, until you know where it reaches.
Si autem sentit eam infirmus circa anum, tunc oportet ut intromittas digitum tuum indicem in anum.	But if the patient feels the probe near the anus, then it is necessary for you to insert your index finger into the anus.
Si ergo sentis in digito tuo tentam iam penetrasse per seipsam detectam, praeter quod sentias inter digitum tuum, et inter ipsum sifac, aut carnem: tunc ergo scias certe, quia est penetrans: non ergo labores in ea, quoniam non est eius sanatio, sicut diximus.	So if you feel with your finger that the probe has already pierced through on its own and detected, besides what you feel between your finger and the skin or flesh: then you are certain to know that it is penetrating; therefore do not trouble yourself about it, since there is no cure for it, as we have said.
Dixerunt tamen, quia sanatur in quibusdam hominibus caro, et ex medicatione qua ei speratur iuuamentum, est, ut ignias cauterium subtile secundum amplitudinem Fistulae, sicut praecessit, et intromittas ipsum ignitum in Fistulam, donec perueniat circa anum.	They say, however, that the flesh is healed in some people through medication and that the benefit expected from it comes from this: that you should apply a thin cauterizing iron according to the width of the fistula, as before, and insert the burning iron into the fistula until it reaches around the anus.
Deinde itera illud bis, aut ter, donec scias, quia iam adustae sunt omnes illae carnes additae filtratae, quae sunt similes cannulae pennae auis.	Then repeat this process twice or three times until you know that all those added and filtered skin tissues are now burnt like the feathers of a bird's wing.
Deinde cura illud cum liciniis inuolutis in butyro, donec egrediantur illae carnes, quae adustae sunt: deinde cura illud cum unguentis generantibus carnem et consolidantibus.	Then treat the area with bandages wrapped in butter until those burnt skin tissues emerge; then treat it with ointments that promote flesh growth and consolidation.
Si ergo sanatur, bonum est.	If it heals, it is good.
Et si non, tunc non sanatur cum alia curatione unquam.	And if not, then it will never be healed with any other treatment.
Et si egreditur tenta, et non peruenerit usque ad digitum tuum, qui est in ano, et est inter ipsum et tentam uelamen spissum ex carne, aut sifac: et uides Fistulam in eo quod sequitur superficiem cutis, tunc seca cutem ab initio Fistulae, et tu uadis secando cum tenta quod est in fistula, donec perueniat secatio ubi peruenit tentae extremitas, et liberatur tenta et cadit.	And if the abscess breaks and does not reach as far as your finger which is in the anus, and is between it and the abscess a thick membrane of flesh or skin: and you see a fistula on what follows the surface of the skin, then cut the skin from the beginning of the fistula, and you go cutting with the tent [or probe] that is in the fistula, until the incision reaches where the end of the tent comes out, and the tent is released and falls.
Deinde mundifica illas carnes filtratas, quae assimilantur cannulae pennae auis, ut non remaneat ex eis aliquid.	Then cleanse those filtered meats which are similar to the bird's wing feathers, so that nothing remains of them.
Si autem uincit te sanguis, et soluit inter te et inter operationem tuam ut seces illas carnes: tunc melius quod fit, et uelocioris iuuamenti, cauterizare eam cum igne, aut cum medicina acuta.	But if blood overcomes you and separates between you and your surgical procedure so that you must cut away those meats; then what is done is better, and provides quicker relief, either by burning it with fire or by using a sharp medicine.
Quoniam cauterium cum igne aggregat habitudines bonas, adustionem illarum carnium additarum, et abscisionem sanguinis, et exiccationem humiditatum.	Because the cautery with fire brings together good conditions, adding to the burning of those added flesh parts, and the drying up of blood, and the desiccation of moisture.
Deinde cura illud cum liciniis inuolutis in butyro, aut caulibus tritis, donec locus emittat pus, et egrediantur illae carnes adustae in pus.	Then take care to wrap it with linen cloths soaked in butter or crushed calves, until the place discharges pus, and those burned flesh parts emerge into the pus.
Deinde cura tunc uulnus cum unguentis consolidatiuis, generantibus carnem duram: et sunt medicinae in quibus sunt stipticitas et exiccatio.	Then take care to dress the wound with consolidated ointments that generate hard flesh, and there are medicines that have astringency and desiccation.
Nam quando restaurantur, tunc iam sanatur: et non times iterationem.	For when it is restored, then it is already healed: and you do not fear further recurrence.
Si autem Fistula iam peruenit usque ad profundum ani, et elongatur a superfluitate corporis: tunc intromitte digitum tuum in anum, et inquire cum eo.	But if the fistula has reached the depth of the anus and is separated from the surplus of the body: then insert your finger into the anus and explore with it.
Si ergo sentis tentam, et inter te, et inter eam est uelamen ex sifac, aut carne, et est propinqua penetrationi: tunc non est operatio in illo, nisi secundum uiam fiduciae et spei.	So if you feel the probe and between it and that is a membrane of skin or flesh, and it is close to penetration: then there is no operation necessary unless according to the way of faith and hope.
Quod est, quia administratur in eo unus trium modorum: aut ut cauterizes ipsam, sicut diximus: aut seces eam, donec consequaris concauitatem eius, ut sit possibile tibi intromittere licinia, et curationem ex proximo.	Which is because it is administered according to one of three methods: or as we said, you burn it with a cautery; or you cut it away until you achieve its concavity, so that it may be possible for you to insert linen and effect cure from nearby.
Et non procedas multum cum sectione, ut non incidas lacertum continentem anum, et accidat super infirmum exitus egestionis absque uoluntate.	And do not proceed much with cutting, lest you cut off a vein containing an artery, and there be on the weak a departure from waste without will.
Deinde cura illud cum eo quod diximus.	Then care for that which we mentioned.
Fortasse enim sanabitur: aut elonges ipsum uelamen, et mundes ipsum postquam secas ipsum usque prope anum, sicut diximus, aut cum tenta, aut cum instrumento alio acutae extremitatis.	Perhaps it will heal: or you may stretch it out and cleanse it after you have cut it close to the artery, as we said, with a sponge or with another sharp instrument.
Deinde mundifica illas carnes filtratas quae sunt in sectione, usque ubi potes cum perscrutatione.	Then clean those filtered fleshings that are in the cut, until you can with probing.
Deinde conare restaurationem uulneris totius cum sectione, et orificio superiore ubi consolidatur: et remanet Fistula aperta in interiore parte anus, et erit leuius super infirmum.	Then strive for the restoration of the wound as a whole with the cut, and at the upper opening where it is consolidated: and there will remain an open fistula in the inner part of the anus, and it will be easier on the weak.
Et quandoque suitur Fistula secundum hunc modum: et est, quando intromittis tentam in Fistulam: et est in latere ani circa superficiem corporis cum cute et margine ani: tunc accipe tentam perforatae extremitatis, quae est sicut acus aleskef, id est, praeparantium coria, secundum hanc formam.	And sometimes the fistula suits according to this mode: and it is when you introduce a sponge into the fistula: and it is on the side of the anus, about the surface of the body with the skin and the margin of the anus: then take the perforated extremity of the sponge which is like an awl, that is, preparing skins, according to this form.
Et intromitte in eam filum inuolutum ex quinque filis, et circiter ea.	And introduce into it a thread wrapped around five threads, and about the same size.
Deinde intromitte tentam cum filo in Fistulam, donec consequatur concauitatem eius.	Then introduce the sponge with the thread into the fistula, until you reach its concavity.
Si ergo est penetrans in margine ani interius prope, tunc extrahe filum ex illo foramine: ita ut intromittas digitum tuum in anum, et extrahas extremitatem fili, et aggreges duas extremitates simul: et stringe utramque, et dimitte illud die uno, aut duobus diebus: et quanto plus incidit filum in carne, stringe ipsum bene, donec incidantur illae carnes quae sunt inter duas extremitates fili, et cadant: deinde cura uulnus, donec consolidetur, et sanetur.	If then it is penetrating inside the margin of the anus near by, then withdraw the thread from that opening: thus insert your finger into the anus and withdraw the end of the thread, and gather both ends together: and tie both tightly, and leave it for one or two days: and as much as the thread goes into the flesh, tie it well, until the flesh between the two ends of the thread becomes inflamed and falls off: then care for the wound until it consolidates and heals.
Si autem orificium Fistulae non est penetrans: tunc fac ipsum penetrare quocunque modo praeparatur tibi, nisi sit in profundo multum.	If however the opening of the fistula is not penetrating: then make it penetrate in whatever way is prepared for you, unless it be very deep.
Non enim inest tibi, ut facias illud propter lacertum, ut non incidas ipsum.	You are not capable of doing that because of your arm, so you should not cut it.
Deinde fac cum ea sicut diximus, donec sanetur.	Then do with her as we said, until she is healed.
Forma Spatumilis spinosi quo finditur Fistula, cuius curuitas est acuta ualde, et pars altera est non acuta, ut non incidat illud quod non est necesse, sicut uides.	The shape of the hollow reed-like instrument for cutting a boil, which has an acute curvature very much, and one half is not acute, so that you do not cut what is not necessary, as you see.
¶ De sutura Hemorroidarum, ex quibus currit sanguis ex incisione earum: et cura fissurarum.	On the stitching of hemorrhoids, from which blood flows after an incision in them: and on the treatment of their fissures.
Caput LXXXI.	Chapter 81.
Sunt Hemorroides secundum duos modos.	There are hemorrhoids in two ways.
Aut enim sunt intra anum, similes uesicis carbonum, uel prunarum: aut quasi ipsae sint grana uuae.	Either they are inside the anus, similar to carbon soot or prunes, or as if they were grape seeds.
Et ex eis sunt paruae, et magnae: et sanguis currit ex eis semper, et est una, et sunt multae.	And from them are small ones and large ones; and blood flows from them always, and it is one, and there are many.
Et sunt extra anum, et in extremitatibus eius.	And they are outside the anus, and at its extremities.
Verumtamen istae quae sunt extra anum, sunt secundum plurimum paucae humiditatis, ex quibus currit aqua citrina, aut parum sanguinis cursu assiduo: et sunt secundum colorem corporis.	However, those that are outside the anus are for the most part few in moisture, from which flows yellow water, or a little blood with an uninterrupted flow; and they are according to the color of the body.
Et curatio eius quae est intra anum, est, ut praecipias infirmo ut assellet: et exprimatur, donec egrediatur anus, et appareant athelil tibi.	And the treatment for that which is inside the anus is, to cause the patient to sit down and strain, until it comes out of the anus, and appears clearly to you.
Propterea ergo et suspende cum uncinis: aut tene eos cum ungue tuo.	Therefore, hang them up with a hook; or hold them with your own fingernail.
Deinde incide eos apud radices suas.	Then cut them at their roots.
Si autem non retinentur in eis uncini, propter humiditatem eorum et ipsorum mollificationem: tunc cape eos cum panno aspero, aut cum coto ex diploide lanea, et extrahe eos cum digitis tuis.	But if they are not retained by hooks, due to their moisture and softness: then take them with a rough cloth, or with a comb made from doubled wool, and pull them out with your own fingers.
Deinde incide eos, et pulueriza super eos post incisionem quosdam pulueres calidos, ut stent eis loco cauterii.	Then cut them, and powder some hot powders over them after the cutting, so that they may take the place of a cauterization.
Aut cauteriza eos secundum quod praecessit in capitulo cauterizandi.	Or cauterize them according to what was mentioned earlier in the chapter on cauterizing.
Deinde cura eos cum reliqua curatione, donec sanentur.	Then take care of them with the rest of the treatment until they are healed.
Quod si non obedit anus egressioni, tunc clisteriza infirmum clisteri in quo sit mordicatio parua, ut lauetur cum eo quod est in ano, et obediat egressioni uelociter, quando exprimit se infirmus.	But if the anus does not obey the urge to evacuate, then fumigate the patient with a poultice that has a small amount of biting quality, so that he may be cleansed by what is in his rectum and quickly obey the urge when he expresses himself.
Si autem athelil sunt extrinseci ab ano, tunc res eorum est leuis, facilis: et est ut capias eos cum ungue tuo, aut capias eos cum uncino, et incidas eos.	But if they are external hemorrhoids around the anus, then their case is light and easy; it is as if you were to grasp them with your finger, or grasp them with a forceps, and cut them.
Deinde cura eos cum eo quod diximus, donec sanentur.	Then take care of them with what we said, until they are healed.
Et qui abhorret incisionem cum ferro, tunc oportet ut administres suturam eorum secundum hunc modum.	And whoever shudders at the cutting with iron, then it is necessary to apply their stitches in this way.
Accipe filum inuolutum, et intromitte ipsum in acum.	Take a wrapped thread and insert it into the needle.
Deinde extrahe athelil ad superiora, et fac ipsum penetrare cum acu in radice eius ex parte altera: et inuolue duas extremitates fili, in inferiori parte acus, et sint latitudinaliter: et stringe athelil strictura forti.	Then pull the thread out to the top, and make it pass through the needle into the root of the other side; and wrap the two ends of the thread around the lower part of the needle, so that they are parallel; and tie off the hemorrhoids tightly with a strong twist.
Deinde noda filum, et extrahe acum.	Then knot the thread and pull out the needle.
Fac illud cum omnibus athelil, et dimitte ex eis unum: nec suas ipsum, ut currat ex eo superfluitas sanguinis.	Do this with all the hemorrhoids, except for one; do not tie it off, so that excess blood may flow out from it.
Deinde pone super anum pannum infusum in oleo rosato, aut caeroto, et pone ipsum super anum: et praecipe infirmo, ut quiescat.	Then place a cloth dipped in rose oil or safflower oil over the anus and apply it to the anus; and instruct the patient to rest.
Deinde dimitte ipsum, donec cadat.	Then let him go, until he passes.
Cum ergo cadunt athelil, cura eos cum unguentis, et reliqua curatione, donec sanentur.	When the hemorrhoids fall out, take care of them with ointments and the rest of the treatment, until they are healed.
¶ De cura Fissurarum.	About the Treatment of Fissures.
Multotiens enim accidunt ex exiccatione stercoris, et constrictione naturae.	For indeed many times fissures occur as a result of constipation and natural constriction.
Cum ergo antiquantur, et non ualet in eis medicina: tunc oportet ut radas cum puncta Spatumilis, aut cum ungue tuo, donec fiant humidae, et auferatur ab eis cortex superior qui prohibet eas a consolidatione.	When they become old and medicine is of no use in them: then it is necessary to rasp with the point of a spathula or with your finger until they are moist and the upper crust that prevents their consolidation is removed.
Deinde cura eas, donec consolidentur secundum quod oportet.	Then take care of them until they are consoled according to what is necessary.
Si autem non consolidantur: tunc itera eas cum rasione uehementiori quam prima, donec sanguinentur multum, et excorientur deinde cura eas, donec sanentur.	But if they do not congeal: then take them with a more severe reasoning than the first, until they are drained of much blood, and thereafter take care of them until they heal.
¶ De curatione Almirmar inuersorum, et non inuersorum: et Athelil siccorum, et Formicae.	Of the cure of those with inverted limbs, and not inverted; and of scrofulous things, and ants.
Caput LXXXII.	Chapter 82.
Scias quod Almirmar non est nisi nodus rotundus secundum colorem corporis, similis capiti claui: et fit in toto corpore, praecipue in inferioribus partibus pedum, et digitis: et accidit ex eis dolor apud ambulationem.	Know that Almirmar is nothing but a round knot according to the color of the body, similar to the head of a hinge; and it occurs throughout the whole body, particularly in the lower parts of the feet and toes: and it happens with pain at walking.
Oportet ergo ut secetur quod est in circumitu claui, et teneatur cum forficibus, aut cum uncino, et eradicetur ex radice sua.	Therefore, it is necessary to cut what is around the head of the hinge, and hold with forceps or a hook, and tear out from its root.
Deinde cura illud: et si uis cauteriza illud secundum quod praecessit in capitulo suo.	Then take care of that thing; and if you wish, cauterize it as was preceded in its own chapter.
Ex athelil autem siccis unus est eminentia parua, aspera, filtrata, rotunda supra superficiem corporis.	From scrofulous things dried up, there is one small, rough, filtered, rounded prominence above the surface of the body.
Et multotiens accidunt in manibus puerorum.	And it often occurs on the hands of boys.
Et curatio eius est, ut extendas athelil, et incidas ipsum: aut stringas ipsum cum filo de serico: aut cum pilo, donec cadat.	And its cure is that you stretch out the scrofulous thing, and cut it off: or tie it with a silk thread: or with a hair, until it falls.
Et si uis, cauteriza ipsum secundum quod praemissum est cum igne, aut cum medicina acuta: et iam eradicantur athelil inuersi, et non inuersi cum instrumento quod ego dicam.	And if you wish, cauterize it as was mentioned before with fire or with sharp medicine: and now the scrofulous things will be eradicated, both inverted and not inverted, with the instrument that I shall say.
Formica autem est etiam eminentia parua filtrata, grossa, super superficiem corporis, uadens in profundum ualde: et quando inuenit eam frigus, sentitur in ea simile mordicationi formicae, et fit in corpore toto: et plurimum eius fit in manibus.	Ants are also a small, filtered, coarse prominence above the surface of the body, going deep into it very much: and when cold finds it, one feels a sensation similar to ant bites, and it occurs throughout the whole body: and most of it occurs in the hands.
Et curatio eius est, ut accipias cannulam ex penna anseris, aut penna uulturis forti: et pone illam cannulam super Formicam, donec contineat circulus cannulae ex partibus eius.	And its cure is that you take a reed from a goose's feather, or a strong hawk's feather: and place that reed above the Ants, until it holds a circle of the reed parts.
Deinde reuolue manum tuam cum cannula, donec seces quod est in circumitu Formicae: et ponas eam in profundo carnis, et eradices Formicam ex radice eius.	Then revolve your hand with a catheter until you cut out what is in the circumference of a formica; and place it in the deep flesh, and root out the formica from its root.
Et si uis, fac illud cum cannula aeris, aut ferri, secundum hanc formam.	And if you wish, do that with a bronze or iron catheter, according to this shape.
Sit superius cannulae ad sublimitatem trahens surdum inuolutum, ut alleuietur super digitum apprehensio eius et ipsius reuolutio.	Sit the catheter above, drawing out the swollen swelling, so that it may be eased over the grasped finger and its own revolution.
Et si uis cauteriza Formicam secundum quod praemissum est in cauterizatione Athelil in capitulo de cauterio.	And if you wish, cauterize the formica according to what was said previously in the cauterization of Athelil in the chapter on cauterizing.
¶ De formis Instrumentorum quae administrantur ad Clisteria in aegritudinibus Ani, et solutionis uentris, et colicae.	¶ On the forms of instruments which are administered for enemas in illnesses of the anus, and for dissolution of the bowels, and for colic.
Caput LXXXIII.	Chapter 83.
Quandoque Clistere fit ex argento, aut ex aurichalco, aut ex aere fuso, aut malleato.	Sometimes an enema is made from silver, or from golden brass, or from woven air, or hammered metal.
Et quandoque fit ex istis Instrumentis paruum, et magnum, secundum illos in quibus administrantur.	And sometimes it is made from these instruments, small and great, according to those in which they are administered.
Illud ergo quod administratur in curatione puerorum paruorum, sit paruum: et quorum ani sunt debiles, aut dolorosi, sic et clisteria eorum.	Therefore what is administered in the cure of small children should be small; and for those whose anus is weak or painful, so should their enemas.
Clistere magnum.	Large Enema.
Cistere paruum.	Small Enema.
Canna eius, id est, caput superius in quo ligatur uter, sit amplum secundum hunc modum: et sit ei distinctio ut ligetur uter sicut uides, et extremitas eius inferior quae intromittitur in anum, sit surda, id est, non aperta, lenis, ualde, trahens ad subtilitatem: et in uno laterum eius sint duo foramina, et in latere altero foramen unum.	The tube of it, that is, the upper part where the womb is tied, should be broad according to this form; and there should be a distinction so that the womb may be tied as you see, and the lower extremity which is inserted into the anus, should be mute, that is, not open, gentle, very, drawing towards subtlety: and on one side of it should be two holes, and on the other side one hole.
Et sit amplitudo foraminis secundum grossitudinem radiorum, et grossius parum, et sit uter in quo ponuntur medicinae ex uesica animalis: aut ex charta ouis, quae sit secundum formam asofrati paruae: cuius radix sit palmus unus.	And the width of the hole should be according to the thickness of the rays, and a little thick, and it should be so that the womb in which medicines are placed from animal bladder or from sheep's parchment, which is according to the form of a small asphodel: whose root is one palm.
Et perforetur foraminibus multis sicut reuoluitur, et sit spacium quod est inter omne foramen grossitudo digiti.	And it will be perforated with many holes as it is turned over, and let there be space which is between every hole the thickness of a finger.
Deinde intromitte in illa foramina filum forte ex filo crudo, quod sit ex decem filis, aut circiter ea, et aggrega cum eo utrem sicut asofrati.	Then insert into those holes a strong thread of raw thread, which is made from ten threads, or roughly that, and tie it with him like an asafetida.
Cum ergo ponitur in eo uter, stringatur in capite clisteris inter duo distinguentia constrictione forti.	When it is placed in the uterus, let it be tied at the head of the catheter with two distinguishing constrictions by a strong constriction.
Deinde clisteriza cum eo.	Then cleanse with him.
Et haec est forma circuli utris hic depicta, et foraminum.	And this is the form of the catheter depicted here, and of the holes.
Qualitas autem clisterizandi cum eo, est: ut impleas utrem, aut uesicam ex medicina, quae sit calefacta secundum quantitatem tolerantiae infirmi: et caue ne sit calida ualde, aut frigida ualde.	However, the quality of cleansing with it is: that you fill the uterus or bladder from medicine, which is warmed according to the tolerance of the patient; and beware lest it be very hot or very cold.
Deinde resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum, et eleuet crura sua ad superiora: et pone sub eo inthaan, id est, corium super quod iacent homines, aut linteamen.	Then the patient will be raised up over his own back, and lift his legs to the upper parts: and place beneath him an inthan, that is, a skin or linen cloth, on which men lie.
Deinde inunge extremitatem Clisteris cum oleo, aut cum albugine oui, aut cum mucillagine foenugraeci, aut similium.	Then grease the extremity of the catheter with oil, or with the white of an egg, or with fenugreek mucilage, or similar things.
Deinde intromitte ipsum in anum cum facilitate.	Then insert it into the anus with ease.
Deinde accipiat minister utrem cum duabus manibus suis simul, et exprimat ipsum cum uehementia, donec euacuet totum quod est in Clisteri in intestinum.	Then let the attendant take hold of the catheter with both his hands simultaneously, and express it with vehemence, until all that is in the catheter is evacuated into the intestine.
Deinde extrahe Clistere, et eleuet infirmus crura sua ad parietem.	Then draw out the catheter, and let the patient lift his legs to the wall.
Quod si medicina cogit eum ad exitum, tunc teneat quantum potest.	Which if medicine urges him towards departure, then hold on as long as possible.
Et si dormit cum ea nocte tota, est magis ultimum in iuuamento.	And if he sleeps with it all night, it is more a final aid in helping.
Si autem clisterizas eum in aegritudinibus solutionis uentris, et festinat exitus eius: tunc itera clistere, donec sanetur.	But if you cleanse him with dysenteric troubles and his departure is hastened: then repeat the catheter until he is healed.
Quod si in ano sunt hemorroides, aut apostemata laedentia, tunc sit clistere subtile ualde, lene, ex clisteribus quibus clisterizantur pueri.	Which if there are hemorrhoids or painful ulcers in the anus: then let the catheter be very fine, soft, from those catheters with which children are cleansed.
Et haec sit forma clisteris subtilis super quod sit stricta cutis.	And this is the shape of a subtle enema above which is tight skin.
¶ De curatione Vulnerum capitis sine fractura ossis.	On the treatment of head wounds without bone fracture.
Caput LXXXIIII.	Chapter 44 of the Head.
Iam dixi in diuisione de curatione uulnerum quod conueniebat libro, et ego dicam hic curationem eorum cum manu, et cum medicinis secundum complementum.	Now I have spoken in the division of wound treatment, as it was fitting for the book, and I will speak here about the treatment of these wounds with hand and with medicines according to what is needed.
Dico ergo, quod uulnera diuersificantur secundum illud quo fiunt uulnera, et secundum locum super quem cadit uulnus.	I say that wounds are differentiated according to the cause by which they are made and according to the place upon which the wound falls.
Res ergo quibus fiunt uulnera multotiens, sunt sicut iactus lapidis: aut incisio ensis, aut cultelli: aut percussio cum lancea, aut ligno, aut sagitta: et similibus illis ex rebus multis.	Therefore, the things by which wounds are made many times are like a thrown stone: or cutting with a sword, or knife; or striking with a lance, or wood, or arrow; and similar to these from many other things.
Vulnera autem quae fiunt secundum loca corporis sunt, sicut uulnus quod cadit super caput, aut collum, aut pectus, aut uentrem, aut epar: et similia ex eis membris.	However, wounds that are made according to the places of the body are like a wound that falls on the head, or the neck, or the chest, or the belly, or the hip: and similar from these members.
Et ego sum narrans curationes quorundam uulnerum, ut ponam eam ratiocinationem et regulam super reliqua uulnera.	And I am recounting the treatments of some wounds, in order to place a reason and rule over the remaining wounds.
Et ego incipiam a uulneribus capitis simplicibus: quoniam rememoratio compositorum ueniet in principio capituli tertii.	And I will begin with simple head wounds, since the recollection of compositors will come at the beginning of chapter three.
Dico ergo.	I say therefore.
Quando accidit in capite uulnus simplex, et non est fractura ossis: considera tunc, si est ex iactu lapidis, aut ei similibus, et iam fregit cutem tantum: et est uulnus magnum, et times super infirmum euentum apostematis calidi: tunc propera, et phlebotoma cephalicam statim: et non tardes illud: et extrahe ei ex sanguine secundum quantitatem uirtutis eius: si non fuerit prohibens aliquid a phlebotomia, praecipue si fuerit sanguis qui egreditur ex uulnere paucus.	I say therefore. When a simple wound occurs in the head and there is no bone fracture: consider then if it was caused by a thrown stone or similar thing, and only broke the skin: and it is a big wound, and you fear a bad outcome from hot apostemes: then hurry and perform phlebotomy of the cephalic vein immediately: and do not delay it: and take out some blood from him according to the quantity of his virtues: if nothing prevents phlebotomy, especially if the blood that exits from the wound is little.
Et sit phlebotomia ex contrario partis uulneratae.	And let the phlebotomy be on the opposite side of the wounded area.
Et caueat infirmus sibi a repletione, et uino, et cibis grossis.	And let the sick person beware of filling, and wine, and coarse foods.
Si autem minutionem prohibet aliquid, tunc minoretur ex cibo, et non appropinquet carnibus, neque uinis.	But if something prevents digestion, then let it be reduced from food, and not approach flesh or wine.
Et pone super uulnus si accidit ei apostema calidum, cotum infusum in oleo rosato solo, aut cum uino in quo est stipticitas.	And place over the wound if a warm abscess occurs to him, one infused in rose oil alone, or with wine that has purgative properties.
Si autem securus fueris ab apostemate calido, tunc pone super uulnus, si est recens cum sanguine suo, et non mutauit ipsum aer, puluerem quem ego narrabo post paululum: et si iam mutauit ipsum aer, tunc pone super ipsum quaedam unguenta, donec sanetur.	But if you are sure of the warm abscess, then place over the wound, if it is fresh with its own blood, and has not changed air, the powder that I will tell you shortly: and if it has already changed air, then place over it certain ointments until it heals.
Si autem uulnus est magnum, aut est ex incisione ensis, et similium: et non aggregantur labia eius per puluillos, tunc aggrega ipsa cum sutura, secundum quod ego narrabo in uulneribus uentris de sutura eorum.	But if the wound is large, or it is from a cut with a sword, and similar: and its lips do not stick together with flies, then gather them up with stitching, according to what I will tell you about the stitches of abdominal wounds.
Si autem uulnus iam detectum est ab osse, et pendet, et non est retentio eius, nisi in suspensorio paruo: tunc incide ipsum.	But if the wound is already detected by bone and hangs down, and there is no holding it back except with a small suspensory: then cut into it.
Deinde cura uulnus cum medicinis, et restaura in eo carnem duram loco cutis, et praecipe infirmo, ut alatur cibis in quibus est grossitudo, sicut sunt capita, et triticum coctum, donec sit ut puls: et eis similia.	Then care for the wound with medicines and restore hard flesh to its place under the cut skin. And instruct the sick person to eat foods that are nourishing, such as heads and cooked wheat, until their pulse is normal; and similar things.
Quod si inuenis in cute putrefactionem, et non adhaeret ossi: tunc incide putrefactum totum, et proiice ipsum: deinde cura illud.	And if you find putrefaction in the skin and it does not adhere to the bone: then cut out the entire putrefaction and throw it away. Then care for it afterwards.
Si autem in his uulneribus est arteria, aut uena ex qua fluit sanguis: et non abscinditur per medicinas, tunc inquire super arteriam.	But if there is an artery or vein in these wounds from which blood flows and it does not cease through medications, then probe the artery.
Si ergo inuenis eam non sectam, tunc seca eam cum Spatumili, aut liga eam.	So if you find it unbroken, then cut it with a saw or tie it.
Quod si necessitas prouocat quando non confert illud quod diximus, tunc cauteriza eam, donec abscindatur sanguis.	And if necessity demands when what we said does not help, then cauterize it until the blood is cut off.
Si autem uulnera ista sunt parua, simplicia, tunc res eorum est facilis, leuis: ita ut puluerizes super ea hunc puluerem: quoniam consolidat ea antequam mutet ea aer.	If these wounds are small and simple, then the remedy for them is easy and light: thus you should cover them with this powder, because it consolidates them before air changes them.
¶ Modus Pulueris incarnatiui.	The Method of the Powder of Flesh.
Recipe olibani partem unam, et sanguinis draconis partes duas, et calcis non extinctae partes tres: teratur totum multum, et cribelletur: et impleatur ex eo uulnus, et constringatur constrictione bona, donec adhaereat super ipsum bene, et coaguletur cum sanguine.	Recipe one part of galangal, two parts of dragon's blood, and three parts of unextinguished lime: grind the whole well, and sift it: and fill the wound with this powder, and bind it tightly until it adheres well on top, and coagulates with blood.
Deinde stringe ipsum desuper cum puluillis, et dimitte ipsum, neque soluas ipsum dum permanet, ita quod non apostemetur.	Then bind the wound above with linen, and leave it, nor loosen it until it remains so, lest it become inflamed.
Nam non eradicatur ab eo medicina, donec sanatur.	For the medicine is not removed from it until it is healed.
Et quandoque facit illud calx sola, quando non sunt tibi in praesenti olibanum, et sanguis draconis etiam facit eandem operationem in multis ex uulneribus magnis, quando conuenit ut ponatur super ea et stringantur, et sunt uulnera recentia cum sanguine suo, quae non alterauit aer.	And sometimes the lime alone accomplishes this, when you do not have galangal and dragon's blood available; and dragon's blood also performs the same operation in many large wounds, when it is put on top of them and bound, and they are recent with their own blood, which has not been changed by air.
Quod si iam alterauit ea aer quadam alteratione, praecipue quando est in tempore aestatis, tunc non est in positione huius pulueris intentio: cura ergo ipsum cum eo quod diximus, ita ut ponas super ea quaedam unguenta digestiua: aut ponas super ea pultes ex farina hordei, factas cum aqua et melle, donec emittant pus.	But if the air has already altered them in some way, especially when it is summer time, then there is no intention of using this powder: therefore care for it with what we have said, so that you put some digested ointments on top of them: or put on top of them poultices made from barley flour mixed with water and honey, until they discharge pus.
Deinde cura ea reliqua curatione, donec sanentur.	Then care for the rest of the cure, until they are healed.
Si uero accidat cum uulnere fractura in osse, et est parua, tunc extrahe illud cum Gesti: et ego iam dicam curationem fracturarum capitis in eo quod futurum est.	But if a fracture occurs with the wound in bone and it is small, then remove that with Gestes: and I will now say the cure for head fractures in what is to come.
¶ De uulneribus Colli.	The Wounds of the Neck.
Caput LXXXV.	Chapter 85.
SI Autem uulnus accidat in Collo, tunc non est inter ipsum differentia in medicatione, et inter uulnus capitis quando est simplex.	If a wound occurs on the neck, then there is no difference between it and a head wound in terms of treatment, when it is simple.
Si autem iam incisus est neruus Colli, aut arteria: tunc si est neruus, non est in eo ingenium, nisi ut deuitetur curatio eius cum eo quod facit stipticitatem uehementem, sicut ziniar, et zegi, et eis similia.	If however the nerve of the neck has already been cut or the artery: then if it is a nerve, there is no skill in treating it except by means of a strong poultice, such as that made with zinar, and zegi, and similar things.
Quoniam nocent neruis, et contrahunt eos.	Because nerves are hurtful and contract them.
Et non ponas super uulnus aliquid frigidum omnino: quoniam substantia neruorum est frigida, et continuatio eius est cum cerebro, quod est sublimius membrorum: et sit illud quo curatur ex medicinis lene, sicut calx lota cum aqua dulci aliquotiens infusa cum oleo, aut cum oleo rosato, et tuthia, quando abluitur etiam cum aqua dulci: et reliqui lapides minerales, secundum hunc modum, et unguenta humida.	And you should not place anything cold whatsoever over the wound: because the substance of nerves is cold and its continuity is with the brain, which is higher than the limbs. And that which cures it should be gentle medicines, such as lime washed with sweet water infused with oil, or with rose oil, and tuthia, when it is also washed with sweet water; and other mineral stones, according to this method, and moist ointments.
Si autem uulnus est magnum, tunc administra suturam: aut coarta labia eius cum puluillis.	If however the wound is great, then apply a suture; or bind its lips with lint.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then care for it until it heals.
Si uero uulneri est profunditas, aut accidit in eo sinus in inferiori parte eius, in quo iam aggregatur pus, tunc perfora ipsum in magis depresso loco in eo.	If the wound has a deepness or happens to have a cavity on the lower part of it, in which pus has already accumulated, then make an incision in it in a more depressed location.
Quod si iam incisa est in uulnere arteria, et consecutus est sanguinem eius fluxus: tunc separa, uel seca eam, et liga ipsam: aut cauteriza eam, si prouocat necessitas ad illud.	But if the artery has already been cut in the wound and its flow of blood has followed; then stop it, or cut it off, and tie it up: or cauterize it, if necessity demands it.
Si autem iam incidit spondiles gutturis, aut totum, et saluatae sunt alhaudegi: tunc aggrega labia cutis cum sutura super cannam gutturis, et non tangas guttur, imo aequa ipsum, et reduc ipsum super figuram naturalem.	But if the vertebra of the throat has already been split, or all of it, and the ligaments are saved: then bring together the edges of the skin with a suture over the reed of the throat, and do not touch the throat itself, but rather level it out and restore it to its natural shape.
Deinde stringe ipsum strictura decenti, et dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot.	Then bind it with a bandage fittingly and leave it for several days.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguentis in quibus est stipticitas et exiccatio, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with ointments that have astringency and drying properties until it heals.
Si autem uulnus iam fecit impressionem in osse, tunc perquire ipsum: tunc si in ipso sunt fragmenta ossis, extrahe ea omnia, aut quae potes ex eis: et quod non praeparatur, dimitte illud, donec putrescat uulnus, et separetur et alleuietur egressio eius.	But if the wound has already made an impression in the bone; then explore it. Then, if there are fragments of bone within it, remove all of them, or as many as you can: and what is not prepared, leave it until the wound putrefies and the discharge separates and ceases.
Quod si uulnus fuerit recens, tunc pulueriza super ipsum puluerem quem narraui.	If the wound is recent, then apply powdered alum on top of it, which I have mentioned.
Si autem uidetur in uulnere os, et fit Fistula: tunc cura ipsam cum eo cuius rememoratio uenit in capitulo suo.	But if a bone seems to be showing in the wound and a fistula forms; then treat it with what I have mentioned in its own chapter.
¶ De uulnere in Spatulis.	About a wound on the spatulas.
Caput LXXXVI.	Chapter 86.
SI Est percussio lanceae, aut cultelli: et uides eius profunditatem, tunc considera.	If there is a piercing by a lance or knife: and you see its depth; then consider it.
Si ergo ex uulnere egreditur uentositas, quando anhelat ex eo infirmus, tunc scias, quia uulnus est mortale.	So if a discharge of pus comes out from the wound, when the sick person pants weakly because of it; then you will know that the wound is mortal.
Quod si non fuerit ei profunditas, et est recens cum sanguine suo: tunc non ponas in eo a prima hora puluerem, neque stringas ipsum, ut non retineatur sanguis in profunditate eius, et reuertatur ad cor, et interficiat infirmum: sed pone in ipso unguentum attractiuum, et solue ipsum in die bis.	But if it's not deep and is recent with its own blood: then don't put powder on it at the first hour nor bind it, so that the blood isn't retained in its depth and returns to the heart and kills the sick person; but put a attracting ointment on it and dissolve it twice a day.
Si uero unguentum non est tibi praesens, tunc pone in orificio uulneris cotum uetustum, ut sugat illud quod egreditur de eo ex humiditatibus: et fac ut dormiat infirmus super uulnus, ut currat quod aggregatur in eo.	But if you don't have ointment, then put an old linen cloth into the opening of the wound and let it suck up what comes out of it from moistures: and make the sick person sleep on top of the wound, so that what accumulates in it may flow away.
Si uero iam praeterierint uulneri tres dies, aut plures, et non accidit infirmo spasmus, neque tremor cordis malus, neque strictura in anhelitu, et uides reliquas dispositiones eius bonas: tunc scias, quia uulnus est saluum.	But if already three days or more have passed since the wound and the sick person does not experience convulsion, nor bad palpitations of the heart, nor constriction in their breathing, and you see his remaining conditions are good: then you will know that the wound is sound.
Cura ergo ipsum et cum liciniis, et reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	So therefore treat it with lyciums and other remedies until he is healed.
Si uero excusatur sanatio eius, et iam aperitur semper, tunc scias, quia iam factum est Fistula.	But if his healing is delayed and an opening always appears, then you will know that already a fistula has formed.
Cura ergo ipsam ex capitulo suo.	So therefore treat it as mentioned in its own chapter.
Et si uulnus est ex incisione ensis, aut cultelli, et est simplex in superficie pectoris, aut dorsi: tunc cura ipsum cum eo quod praecessit ex sutura, si est magnum: aut cum puluere, si est paruum.	And if the wound is from an incision by a sword or knife and is simple on the surface of the chest or back; then treat it with what preceded for suturing, if it's great: or with powder, if it's small.
Si autem iam fecit impressionem in osse, et incidit ex eo frusta: tunc inquire uulnus, et propera ad extrahendum illa frusta, si sunt separata.	If however he has already made an impression on a bone and pieces have fallen off from it: then examine the wound and hasten to remove those pieces if they are separated.
Si uero non sunt separata, tunc dimitte ea, donec putrefiat uulnus, alleuiatur enim extractio eorum.	But if they are not separated, then leave them alone until the wound putsrefies, for an extraction would only make things worse.
Reliquorum autem uulnerum accidentium in reliquis membris iudicium in curatione, est iudicium eius quod diximus.	However, as for the remaining accidents of wounds on other limbs, the judgment in their treatment is that which we mentioned.
¶ De uulneribus Ventris, et exitu intestini, et exitura eorum.	¶ On Wounds of the Belly and Exit of Intestines and Their Issues.
Caput LXXXVII.	Chapter 87.
Disruptio quae accidit uentri, est magna, et media, et parua.	The disruption that occurs in the belly is great, moderate, and small.
Ex magna igitur quandoque egreditur intestinum, aut numerus intestinorum.	Therefore, from a great disruption, sometimes the intestine issues forth or multiple intestines issue forth.
Quare fit intromissio eorum, et eorum sutura uehementior et difficilior.	Therefore, their introduction and subsequent stitching are more violent and difficult.
Et disruptio parua etiam fit difficilis ex modo alio.	And a small disruption also becomes difficult in another way.
Sequitur ergo, ut sit reductio eorum difficilior, si non properas in intromissione sua ad locum suum statim: quoniam inflatur, aperitur, et ingrossatur: quare fit difficilis introitus eius.	Therefore, it follows that their reduction becomes more difficult if you do not hasten to introduce them into their place immediately, since they are inflated, opened up, and enlarged; therefore, their entrance becomes difficult.
Propter hoc ergo fit melior disruptionum disruptio media: quoniam cum ea non fit difficilis reductio intestini, sicut fit dissicilis in his duabus speciebus.	Therefore, for this reason, a moderate disruption is better than a great one: because when it occurs, the reduction of the intestine does not become difficult, as it does in these two forms.
Scias, quod sutura uenris est secundum quatuor modos.	Know that the stitching of the belly is done in four ways.
Duae suturae communes conueniunt in sutura uentris, et in sutura reliquorum uulnerum corporis: et duae suturae aliae proprie communicant reliquis uulneribus.	Two common stitches meet in the stitching of the belly and in the stitching of other wounds of the body; and two other stitches specifically communicate with each other in relation to other wounds.
Verumtamen sunt magis propriae cum sutura uentris: et ego narro tibi unamquamque cum expositione, et declaratione.	However, they are more proper for the stitching of the belly; and I will tell you each one with its explanation and declaration.
Dico ergo, quia quando uulnus est paruum, et egreditur ex eo aliquid ex intestino, et fit difficile reducere ipsum: tunc illud est propter unum duorum modorum.	I say therefore, because when the wound is small and something from the intestine issues forth from it, and it becomes difficult to reduce it; then that is due to one of two methods.
Aut propter paruitatem disruptionis, sicut diximus: Aut quoniam in intestino est inflatio propter frigus aeris.	Because of the shortage of disruption, as we said. Or because there is inflation in the intestine due to cold air.
Quando ergo illud est ita, tunc oportet ut calefacias ipsum, ita ut submergas spongiam, aut pannum humidum in aqua tepida sola.	So when this is the case, then you should heat it so that you would immerse a sponge or a wet cloth in warm water only.
Aut decoquas in aqua squinantum, et cyperum, et spicam, et embroces cum ea intestinum, donec resoluatur inflatio.	Or you should boil the following in water: squinat, and cyperus, and asafoetida, and cypress with it, until the inflation is resolved.
Quandoque facit illud uinum in quo est stipticitas: et est melius quam aqua sola in resolutione inflationis.	Sometimes that wine does which has bitterness: and it is better than water alone for resolving an inflation.
Cum ergo uides inflationem iam resolui, tunc humecta intestinum cum aqua in qua decocta est altea, aut malua.	When therefore you see the inflation already resolved, then moisten the intestine with water in which has been cooked asafoetida or mulberry.
Nam per illud alleuiatur introitus eius cum re parua.	For through that it is alleviated its entry with a small amount.
Si autem excusatur reditus eius post hanc curationem, tunc finde in disruptione parum, cum instrumento quo secantur hemorrhoides.	But if its return is hindered after this treatment, then find a little disruption with the instrument with which hemorrhoids are cut.
Et curatio prima est melior quando praeparatur, quam sectio: et non fit coactio ad secandum post necessitatem et defectum instrumenti.	And the first cure is better when prepared than cutting: and there is no constraint to cut after necessity and deficiency of the instrument.
Sit pars eius una quae est torta, acuta, et pars eius altera non acuta, et extremitas subtilis non sit cum subtilitate Spatumilis, imo sit obtusior parumper: et est illa quae similatur caiada, sicut uides.	Be one part of it which is twisted, sharp, and the other part not sharp, and its tip should not be as fine as a sputum, but rather blunt for a little while; and that is what resembles a caul, just as you see.
Cum ergo amplificatur uulnus, et ingreditur intestinum, tunc oportet, ut sit reductio eius secundum formam suam naturalem in loco suo sibi proprio, si possibile est super illud: quoniam est melius.	So when the wound is enlarged and enters the intestine, then it is necessary that it be reduced to its natural shape in its own place, if possible above it; for it is better.
Quando uero disruptio est ampla in inferiori parte uentris: tunc oportet ut facias iacere infirmum super dorsum suum, et pone crura sua altiora capite suo.	When however the disruption is wide in the lower part of the belly: then it is necessary that you make the patient lie on their back and place their legs higher than their head.
Et si est in superiore parte uentris, tunc pone caput eius, et pectus ipsius altiora quam eius inferiora.	And if it is in the upper part of the belly, then place their head and chest higher than their lower parts.
Et similiter si est disruptio in una duarum partium uentris, tunc pone intentionem tuam, et tuam considerationem semper in hoc, ut pars in qua est uulnus sit altior parte altera.	And similarly if there is a disruption in one of the two parts of the belly, then place your intention and consideration always so that the part where the wound is will be higher than the other part.
Et ita oportet, ut admimistres illud in uulneribus magnis, et in uulneribus mediis.	And thus it is necessary to administer that in large wounds and in middle-sized wounds.
In uulneribus autem paruis, pone illud secundum quod praeparatur tibi.	However, in small wounds, place it according to how it is prepared for you.
Deinde fac ut sit praesens inter manus tuas minister pius, qui teneat disruptionem totam manu sua: et aggrega labia eius.	Then have a pious servant present between your hands, who holds the entire wound with his hand and gathers up its lips.
Deinde detege ex ea ei qui sequitur suturam aliquid post aliquid: et iste est modus suturae communis unius.	Then scrape out from it something for the one who is to follow with a suture, and this is the common method of a single suture.
Et est, ut accipias acum, aut numerum acuum secundum quantitatem amplitudinis uulneris.	And it is, that you take an awl or the number of awls according to the size of the wound's width.
Deinde dimitte ab extremitate disruptionis quantitatem digiti anularis, id est, medici: et fige acum unam praeter quod intromittas in eam filum in duabus extremitatibuis cutis, cum duabus extremitatibus sifac quod est sub cute ab interioribus, donec facias eam penetrare ab alia parte, et tu iam aggregasti duas extremitates cutis, et duas extremitates sifac: et fiunt quatuor ordines.	Then release a quantity of the awl from the outer edge of the wound, namely, the width of the ring finger, that is, the doctor's; and fix one awl on one side, except you insert it into the skin on both sides with two threads that are under the skin from within, until you make it penetrate from the other part, and now you have gathered together the two ends of the skin and the two ends of the sifac, and there are four orders.
Deinde stringe cum filo duplo in circumitu acus aliquotiens a duabus partibus simul, quousque sint aggregata duo labia uulneris aggregatione decenti.	Then tie with double thread around the awl several times from both sides simultaneously, until the two lips of the wound are gathered together in a decent gathering.
Deinde dimitte grossitudinem digiti etiam, et fige in eis acum aliam: postea reta eam cum filo, sicut fecisti cum acu prima.	Then release the thickness of the finger as well, and fix another awl in them; afterwards tie it with thread, just as you did with the first awl.
Non ergo cesses facere illud cum eo quo indiges ex acubus, donec compleas constrictionem uulneris totius.	Therefore do not cease to do that with him who supplies your needs from the awls, until you complete the constriction of the entire wound.
Et sint acus mediae inter grossitudinem et subtilitatem: quoniam acus subtiles ualde uelociter incidunt carnem: et grossae sunt difficilis introitus in cutem: propter illud oportet ut sint mediae in subtilitate, et grossitudine.	And the awls should be of medium size between thickness and thinness: because very fine awls quickly pierce flesh: and thick ones are difficult to insert into the skin: therefore they must be of medium thickness and coarseness.
Et non oportet, ut figatur acus in duabus extremitatibus cutis propinquae multum: ut non incidatur caro uelociter, et aperiatur uulnus ante consolidationem sui, et non elongentur etiam cum sutura, ut non prohibeatur uulnus a consolidatione.	And it is not necessary for the awl to be placed in the two ends of the skin that are very close: lest the flesh be quickly pierced and the wound be opened before its own consolidation, and also lengthen with the suture, so that the wound may not be prevented from consolidating.
Deinde incide extremitatem acuum, ut non laedant infirmum apud somnum suum: et pone eis puluillos ex pannis ab omni parte, qui teneant extremitates acuum: et dimitte eos, donec scias quod uulnus iam consolidatum est.	Then cut off the ends of the stitches, so that they do not hurt the patient while he is sleeping: and place on them poultices from cloths on every side, which hold the ends of the stitches: and let them be, until you know that the wound is already consolidated.
Et haec quidem species suturae cum acubus taliter est conuenientior in uulneribus paruis.	And this kind of stitching with pins is indeed more suitable for small wounds.
Quoniam sufficit in sutura eorum acus una, aut duae, aut circiter eas.	Because one, or two, or about that many needles suffice for their stitches.
Sutura autem secunda communis est, ut aggreges cum sutura extremitates quatuor: extremitates, duas cutis, et extremitates duas sifac in uice una, cum acu in qua sit filum inuolutum aequale in subtilitate, et grossitudine.	But the second stitch is common, that you gather with the first stitch four ends: two of skin and two of silk in one place, with a needle where there is a thread wrapped evenly in subtlety and thickness.
Deinde quando penetraueris cum acu has extremitates quatuor, reduc acum a parte a qua incaepisti eadem, ut cadat filum retatum a superiori parte uulneris: ut sit sutura, sicut sutura panni quo stringuntur panni, et pone inter omnem suturam quantitatem grossitudinis digiti minoris.	Then, when you have penetrated with the needle these four ends, draw back the needle from the part where you began, so that the thread falls back from the upper part of the wound: so that it is a stitch, like a stitch in cloth which binds cloth together, and place between every stitch the thickness of a small finger.
Hanc autem suturam sciunt homines.	People know this kind of stitch.
Et cum hac sutura ego sui uulnus quod acciderat uiro in uentre suo, qui fuerat uulneratus cum cultello, et erat disruptio uulneris maior palmo uno: et exierat ex intestinis circiter duos palmos ex intestino medio, et erat disruptio in medio uentris.	And with this stitch I treated the wound that had happened to a man in his belly, who had been wounded with a knife and had a disruption of the wound larger than one hand: and something had come out from the intestines about two hands' breadth from the middle of the intestine, and there was a disruption in the middle of the belly.
Reduxi ergo illud postquam stetit intestinum eius extra uulnus xxiiii horis.	So I reduced it after his intestine had protruded outside the wound for 24 hours.
Consolidatum est ergo uulnus in spacio quod fuit circiter XV dies: et curaui ipsum, et sanatus est: et uixit post illud annis multis, conuersatus in suis dispositionibus.	And therefore the wound was consolidated after about 15 days' time; and I cared for it, and he recovered; and he lived afterwards many years, living according to his habits.
Et medici iudicauerant, quod non sanaretur.	And the doctors had judged that it would not heal.
Et ex miraculo fuit, quod non curaui illud cum unguento.	And it was by a miracle, since I did not treat it with an ointment.
Quoniam fui in loco in quo non inueniebatur unguentum, neque aliquid ex medicinis.	Because I was in a place where I could not find any ointment, nor anything from medicines.
Posui ergo super uulnus cotum uetustum bis in die, et assiduaui ablutionem eius cum aqua mellis, donec sanatum est.	I place therefore a old bandage twice a day upon the wound and make frequent washing of it with honeyed water until it is healed.
Duas autem species suturae proprias dicam secundum narrationem sermonis.	However, I will describe two proper kinds of suturing according to the narrative of speech.
Et est, ut incipias cum sutura acuta: et intromittas acum ab exteriori ad interiorem partem.	And it is, that you should begin with acute suturing: and insert the needle from the outside to the inside part.
Cum ergo penetrat acus in cutem, et in lacertum euntem secundum longitudinem et latitudinem totius corporis: dimitte extremitatem sifac in latere in quo intromisisti acum, et fac penetrare in extremitatem aliam ab interiori parte ad exteriorem in extremitate altera mirach.	When therefore the needle enters the skin and goes through the limb according to its length and width throughout the body: let go the extremity where you inserted the needle, and make it pass through another extremity from the inside part to the outside on the other side.
Cum ergo feceris eam penetrare, tunc fac eam penetrare secundum hoc in eadem hac extremitate mirach ab exteriori parte ad interiorem: et dimitte extremitatem sifac, quae est in hoc latere, et fac penetrare acum in extremitatem alteram ab interiori parte ad exteriorem: et fac penetrare cum penetratione tua qua facis eam penetrare in sifac extremitate mirach, quae est in parte eius, donec penetret in ipsum totum.	When therefore you make it penetrate, then make it penetrate so in the same extremity on the other side from outside to inside: and let go the extremity which is in this part, and make the needle enter into another extremity from the inside part to the outside: and make it penetrate with your penetration as you make it penetrate in the suture of the extremity on the other side, which is in its part, until it penetrates into the whole.
Deinde incipe etiam ab hoc eodem latere, et sue ipsum cum extremitate, quae est ex sifac in latere alio, et extrahe acum ex cute quam penetrauit.	Then begin also from this same side, and tie the knot with the extremity which is on the other side, and pull out the needle from the skin which it has penetrated.
Deinde reduc eam in illam cutem, et sue extremitatem sifac, quae est in latere alio, cum hac extremitate mirach: et extrahe eam ex cute quae est ex parte eius, et fac illud uice una, et alia: et fac illud uice post uicem, usquequo suas extrinsecum totum secundum illud exemplum.	Then bring it back into that skin and tie the extremity of the suture which is on the other side with this extremity on the other side: and pull out the needle from the skin which is on its part, and do it once and twice and three times: and do it again in turn, until you have secured the outside completely according to that example.
Et summa huius suturae, est ut suas sutura pellipariorum qua suunt pelles: ita ut suas sifac uice una ex parte una extremitate cutis: et ut dimittas eam uice alia ex parte alia, donec compleas.	And the sum of this suturing is that you should suture like the pellipariorum who sew pelts: so that you tie the sifac once from one part of the skin and then let it go on another part, until you are finished.
Secunda species suturae propriae, quam dixit Gale nus.	The second kind of proper suture which Galeonus said.
Iste eius sermo narratus est, ut suas eam secundum similitudinem, qua suunt eas quidam medicantium, ita quod aggregant omnem partem ad comparem suam conuenientem per naturam: et applicant extremitatem sifac ad eius aliam extremitatem, et extremitatem mirach ad extremitatem eius aliam.	This is what he said, namely that he compares it to the way certain physicians tie them together in such a manner that they bring all parts to a corresponding part according to nature: and he applies one end of the suture to the other end, and the end of the mirocha to the other end of the same.
Et illud fit secundum quod narro tibi.	And this is done just as I am telling you.
Oportet ut figas acum in extremitatem mirach propinquam tibi ab exteriori parte, et facias eam penetrare ad interiorem in eo solo: et dimittas duas extremitates sifac.	You must fix the needle point in the end of the mirocha nearest to you from the outer part, and make it pierce into the inner one only; and let go the two ends of the sifac.
Deinde reuolue acum, et fac eam penetrare ab exteriori parte ad interiorem in duas extremitates sifac, scilicet utrinque.	Then turn back the needle and make it pierce from the outer part into the inner one at both ends of the sifac, that is, on both sides.
Deinde reuolue utrasque, etiam fac penetrare utrasque ab interiori usque ad exteriorem, in duas extremitates mirach alias, quae sunt in latere opposito.	Then turn back both [ends] and also make them pierce from the inner one to the outer one at both ends of the other mirocha on the opposite side.
Et iste modus suturae est melior sutura communi facili, et est sutura cuius praecessit rememoratio.	And this method of suture is a better and more common suture, and it is the suture which was previously described.
Iste est ergo sermo Galeni etiam.	This then is also the speech of Galen.
Et dixerunt quidam.	And certain people said.
Retificatur sutura uentris cum duabus acubus.	The suture of the belly is rectified with two needles.
Quod est, ut intromittas in eis utrisque filum unum: et incipe cum intromissione acus, ex eo quod est apud te, et fac eam penetrare usque ad latus aliud, secundum suturam eorum qui suunt coria aequaliter.	That is, to introduce one thread into both of them: and begin with the introduction of the needle from that which is at your side, and make it pierce until the other side, according to the suture of those who equalize skins.
Et scias, quod quando disruptio est in medio uentris: tunc sutura eius est difficilior quam reliquorum locorum uentris.	And know that when there is a disruption in the middle of the belly: then its suture is more difficult than those of other places in the belly.
Iudicium uero medicationis uulneris, est iudicium reliquorum uulnerum.	The judgment of wound treatment is the judgment of other wounds.
Quod est, quia quando tu consequeris uulnus recens cum sanguine suo, antequam alteret ipsum aer: et reducis intestinum, et suis ipsum, et aptas ipsum: tunc pone super puluerem incarnatiuum.	That is, because when you follow a recent wound with its blood before it changes due to air; and reduce the intestine, and apply it, and prepare it: then put it on top of a poultice.
Quod si aer iam alterauit uulnus: tunc pone super ipsum quaedam unguenta, quae sunt tibi praesentia, donec faciant pus: et cadant fila, et consolidentur sifac, et mirach.	If the air has already changed the wound: then place on top of it some ointments that are present to you, until they produce pus; and let the fibers fall, and let them consolidate with ifac and mirach.
Deinde cura illud sicut est curatio reliquorum uulnerum, donec sanetur.	Then take care of it just as is the care for other wounds, until it heals.
Si autem non sunt tibi praesentes medicinae, tunc pone super ipsum statim, exquo incipit emittere pus, cotum uetus: et permuta ipsum bis in die, sicut docui te, donec sanetur.	But if you do not have medicines present to you, then place on top of it at once, from which it begins to emit pus, old gauze: and change it twice a day, as I taught you, until it heals.
Nam tu non indiges medicatione alia in pluribus dispositionibus, quando uulnera sunt simplicia.	For you do not need other medicines in many dispositions when wounds are simple.
Si autem times, quod communicet uulnus membris principalibus in laesione, tunc oportet ut submergas lanam lenem in oleo temperatae caliditatis, aut in oleo rosato: et pone ipsam in circumitu locorum quae sunt inter inguina, et sub ascellas.	But if you fear that the wound will spread to the principal members with an injury, then it is necessary to immerse a piece of wool cloth in oil tempered by warmth, or in rose oil: and place it in the area between the groin and underarms.
Quod si sentit dolorem, aut punctiones, aut putrefactionem in intestinis suis (nam multotiens accidit illud) tunc clisteriza ipsum cum uino stiptico, nigro, tepido: praecipue si putredo iam peruenit in intestino, et facta est exitura penetrans usque ad concauitatem eius.	If it feels pain, or punctures, or putrefaction in its bowels (for this often happens) then purge it with a stiptic wine, black and warm: especially if the putrefaction has already reached the intestine and made an exit that penetrates to its concavity.
Et scias, quod illud quod est ex intestino grosso, est facilioris sanationis: et quod ex eis est ex subtili, difficilioris sanationis.	And know that what comes from the large intestine is easier to heal; and what comes from those of finer substance is more difficult to heal.
Intestinum autem quod nominatur Ieiunum, non suscipit sanationem ex uulnere quod accidit in eo omnino: et illud est propter multitudinem eius, quod est ex uenis, et magnitudine earum, et propter subtilitatem corporis eius, et propinquitatem ipsius naturae neruorum.	However, the intestine that is called Ieiunum does not accept healing from a wound that occurs in it at all: and this is because of its multitude, which is from veins, and their magnitude, and because of the subtlety of its body, and its proximity to the nature of nerves.
Si autem illud quod procedit ex uulnere est zirbum, et consequeris ipsum recens: reduc ipsum secundum reductionem tuam, qua reducis intestina aequaliter.	But if what proceeds from the wound is phlegm, and you follow it immediately: reduce it according to your own reduction, by which you reduce the intestines evenly.
Si uero praeteriit ei spacium, et iam factum est uiride, aut nigrum: tunc oportet ut stringas ipsum cum filo supra locum qui denigratus est ex eo, ut non accidat fluxus sanguinis.	But if it has passed by and already turned green or black: then it is necessary to tie it with a thread above the place that was discolored from it, so that bleeding may not occur.
In zirbo enim sunt uenae et arteriae.	In the groin there are veins and arteries.
Deinde incide quod est praeter illud ligamentum, et pone duas extremitates fili pendentes ex inferiori parte uulneris extra ipsum: ut alleuietur super te attractio eius, et extractio ipsius apud casum zirbi, et emissionem pus uulneris.	Then cut what is on the other side of that ligament, and place two ends of a thread hanging from the lower part of the wound outside it: so that its attraction to you may be alleviated, and the extraction of the same thing at the case of the groin, and the emission of pus from the wound.
¶ Rememoratio uulneris quod accidit in Intestino.	Remembering the wound which occurs in the intestine.
Quando accidit disruptio in Intestino, et est parua: tunc possibile est, ut restauretur in quibusdam hominibus: propterea, quia ego uidi qui fuit uulneratus in uentre suo cum percussione lanceae, et erat uulnus a dextra stomachi, et antiquatum est uulnus: et factum Fistula, et exiuit ex eo egestio, et uentositas.	When a disruption occurs in the intestine and is small: then it is possible for some people to be restored: therefore, because I have seen one who was wounded in his stomach with a blow from a lance, and the wound was on the right side of the stomach, and the old wound had become corrupted: and a fistula was formed, and a discharge and windiness resulted.
Posui ergo curationem, usque quod ego non fui confisus in sanatione eius: neque cessaui subtiliare ipsum, donec sanatus est, et consolidatus est locus.	Therefore I applied treatment until I was not confident about his recovery: nor did I cease to dress him, until he was healed and the location consolidated.
Postquam ego uidi locum iam consolidatum, timui super infirmum, quod accideret super infirmum accidens malum in uentre suo: et non accidit ei ex illo accidens malum.	After I saw the place was consolidated, I feared for the weak one, that another misfortune might occur to him in his stomach: and no misfortune occurred to him from then on.
Et remansit in melioribus dispositionibus suis, comedens et bibens, et futuens, et intrauit balneum, et exercitatus est in dietis suis.	And he remained in better bodily conditions, eating and drinking, and copulating, and entered the bath, and exercised himself in his habits.
Et iam dixerunt quidam experimentatorum, quia quando accidit in Intestino uulnus, et est paruum: tunc oportet ut ligetur secundum hunc modum.	And some experimenters have said that when a wound occurs in the intestine and is small: then it should be bound according to this method.
Et est, ut accipias formicas magnorum capitum.	And it is as if you were taking ants of great heads.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris, et pone formicam unam ex eis quae habeant os apertum super duo labia uulneris.	Then gather two edges of the wound and place one ant on top of them that has an open mouth over the two edges of the wound.
Cum ergo capit super ea, et stringit os suum, abscinde caput eius, adhaeret enim, et non soluitur.	When therefore it takes hold of them and closes its mouth, cut off its head, for it sticks and does not come loose.
Deinde pone formicam aliam prope primam, et non cesses facere illud cum formica post formicam secundum quantitatem uulneris totius.	Then place another ant near the first one, and do not cease to do that with each ant after the second one according to the size of the entire wound.
Deinde reduc ipsum, et sue uulnus.	Then reduce it [the limb] and bind the wound.
Illa enim capita remanent annexa in Intestino, donec cibetur Intestinum, et sanetur, et non accidat infirmo nocumentum penitus.	For indeed those heads remain attached to the intestine until it is fed to the intestine and healed, and no harm occurs to the injured person entirely.
Et iam possibile est, ut ligetur Intestinum etiam cum filo subtili: quod abstersum est ex intestino animalis, annexo cum eo postquam intromittitur in acum.	And now it is also possible to suture the intestine with a fine thread: which has been cleared from an animal's intestine and attached to it after being inserted into the needle.
Et est, ut accipias extremitatem huius fili ex intestino, et excarnetur multum.	And you should take the end of this thread from the intestine and scrape off a great deal.
Deinde liga in extremitate eius filum lini subtile inuolutum.	Then tie the fine linen thread at its end.
Deinde intromitte illud filum in acum, et sue cum eo intestinum.	Then insert that thread into the needle and tie it to the intestine.
Deinde reduc ipsum in disruptionem.	Then reduce it [the intestine] back into its place.
Et iste modus suturae cum formicis et intestino, non est nisi secundum uiam fiduciae et spei.	And this method of suturing with ants and intestine is not other than according to the way of trust and hope.
Scias, uulnus quod est magnum, amplum, praecipue si est in uno intestinorum gracilium: tunc non est ingenium nisi subtiliatio, neque est eius sanatio omnino.	Know that a wound which is great and wide, especially if it is in one of the thin intestines, then there is no skill but to make it finer, nor is its healing entirely.
¶ De cura Zuchemen, et Fistularum.	About the care of abscesses and fistulas.
Caput LXXXVIII.	Chapter 88.
Scias, quod omne uulnus, aut apostema quando ueterascit et antiquatur, et fit ulcus, et non consolidatur, et emittit pus semper, et non abscinditur: tunc nominatur uniuersaliter in quocunque membro fuerit Fistula, et nos nominamus ipsum Zuchemen.	Know that every wound or apostema when it becomes old and withered, and forms a sore, and does not consolidate, and always discharges pus, and is not excised: then it is called universally in whatever member it may be Fistula, and we call it Zuchemen.
Et Fistula quidem est secundum ueritatem nodatio filtrata, dura, alba: cum qua non est dolor, cui est concauitas pennae auis: et propter illud nominant eam quidam Risati, id est, pennam.	And Fistula indeed is a true fleshy fistula, hard, white, and smooth: with which there is no pain, like the concavity of a bird's feather; and for that reason some people call it Risati, that is, the feather.
Et est in quibusdam horis humida, quae emittit pus.	And it is humid in certain hours, which discharges pus.
Et fortasse scinditur humiditas in quibusdam horis.	And perhaps the humidity breaks open in certain hours.
Et quandoque est haec humiditas multa, et est pauca: et est grossa, et est subtilis.	And sometimes this moisture is much, and sometimes it is little; and it is thick, and it is thin.
Et ego iam praemisi in diuisione, tunc cum dixi uulnera, quod omne ulcus quod non sanatur, neque nascitur in eo caro, non est illud nisi propter unam nouem caussarum.	And I have already spoken of division, then when I said wounds, that every ulcer which does not heal nor is born from it flesh, is not that except for one reason of nine causes.
Quarum una est, aut propter paucitatem sanguinis in corpore: aut propter maliciam eius: aut quoniam inter ipsum, et super labia eius est caro dura, prohibens natiuitatem carnis: aut quia est multae sordis et sordiciei: aut quoniam ulcus in seipso est putridum, et materia quae mittitur ei est malae qualitatis: aut quoniam medicina est inconueniens in curatione eius: aut quoniam corruptio cadens in regione est genus pestilentiae, aut per proprietatem in regione, sicut accidit in Caesaraugusta: in qua fit difficilis digestio aegritudinum, et tardatur in ea sanatio apostematum per naturam: aut quoniam in eo est os unum, aut numerus ossium.	One of them is because there is too little blood in the body; or because of its evil nature; or because between it and the surrounding flesh is hard flesh that prevents the birth of new flesh; or because there are many impurities and filth; or because the wound itself is putrid, and the material sent to it has bad quality; or because the medicine used is unsuitable for curing it; or because a corruption falling in the region is a kind of pestilence, or due to the property of the region, as happens in Caesaraugusta, where digestion of diseases is difficult and healing of abscesses is delayed by nature; or because there is one bone, or a certain number of bones.
Et ego iam ostendi omnes istas caussas et signa earum, et curationes ipsarum cum medicinis in diuisione: et oportet hic ut faciam te scire curationem Fistulae et Zuken, quae fit per uiam operationis cum manu.	And I have now shown all these causes and signs of them, and their cures with medicines in division; and it is necessary here for me to make you know the cure of fistula and zuken, which is done through the way of operation with one's hand.
Scias ergo, quod Fistula accidit in omnibus membris corporis.	You should therefore know that a fistula occurs in all members of the body.
Nam ex eis sunt Fistulae quae perueniunt ad uenas magnas et arterias, aut neruos, aut sifac: aut ad intestinum, aut ad uesicam, aut ad aliquam ex costis: aut ad aliquam ex spondilibus dorsi, aut ad aliquam iuncturarum compositarum compositione: sicut manus, et pedis: et ex eis sunt quae uadunt ad propinquitatem membri principalis, et similium.	For some of them are fistulas that reach the major veins and arteries, or nerves, or sifac, or to the intestines, or bladder, or to one of the ribs: or to one of the vertebrae of the back, or to a joint composed of several parts: such as hands and feet; and some of them go to the proximity of the principal member and similar ones.
Quae ergo ex his Fistulis est secundum hunc modum, est ex aegritudinibus difficilis sanationis, et non recipit curationem, et occupatio cum ea est labor et ignorantia.	What then of these fistulas is difficult to heal according to this method, does not receive its cure, and occupation with it is labor and ignorance.
Quod si est ex Fistulis aliqua cuius profunditas non peruenit ad haec loca quae dixi: et speras, et confidis in curatione eius, et uis peruenire ad cognitionem illius, tunc accipe tentam ex aere, aut ferro, si Fistula tendit secundum rectitudinem, et perquire eam cum ipsa.	That if there is some fistula whose depth does not reach to the places I said: and you hope and trust in its cure, and wish to reach understanding of it, then take a test from air or iron, if the fistula tends straightly, and explore it with itself.
Si autem in Fistula est tortuositas, tunc inuestiga eam cum tenta de plumbo subtili.	If however there is tortuousness in a fistula, then investigate it with a thin leaden probe.
Quoniam plumbum cum lenitate sui corporis alleuiatur, et curuatur circa tortuositatem.	Because lead is tempered by its own softness and curves around the tortuousness.
Quod si Fistula est habens orificia multa, non est tibi possibile ut significes super eam cum tenta.	For if a fistula has many openings, it is not possible for you to signify over it with a probe.
Clisteriza ergo ex eis orificium ex orificiis suis.	Therefore, cleanse one of its openings from among its own openings.
Nam humiditas qua clisterizas ipsum, uadit uersus orificia alia, et currit ex eis.	For the moisture with which you cleanse it flows towards other openings and runs out from them.
Deinde exquisite inquire secundum quem modum est tibi possibile: ut cognoscas quod illic est os, aut neruus, et est Fistulae concauitas longinqua, aut propinqua: aut est Fistula una cui sunt orificia multa, et sta super totum illud, cum summa fortitudinis tuae: cum interrogatione tua, qua interrogas infirmum, et inuentione doloris apud compressionem cum manu tua super locum, et similibus ex significationibus et caussis accidentibus apostemati.	Then carefully inquire about the matter in accordance with what is possible for you: to know whether it is a mouth, or nerve, and whether the fistula is distant or near; or if there is only one fistula with many openings, and it lies above all that, with your utmost strength, along with questioning the patient, and finding pain when compressing with your hand on the spot, and similar signs and causes of abscesses.
Cum ergo steteris super omnia illa statione uera, tunc uade ad curationem secundum confidentiam: et est, ut consideres tunc, si est Fistula propinqua apparens, aut in loco saluo longinquo a iunctura, aut a neruo, aut arteria, aut uena, aut uno locorum quae dixi tibi: tunc seca Fistulam secundum quod praemissum est ex narratione mea, et aufer quod est in ea ex filtratione, et carnibus corruptis, quod nascitur in orificio eius ex carne, aut thelul, et similibus: et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	When therefore you have arrived at a true understanding of all these things, then proceed to the cure according to your confidence; and consider this now, whether the fistula appears near or in a safe location far from the junction, or from a nerve, or artery, or vein, or one of the places I told you: then cut the fistula according to what has been said in my narration, and remove what is inside it from filtration, and corrupted flesh, which arises in its opening from the flesh, or fat, and similar things: and cure it until it heals.
Si autem Fistula est longinquae profunditatis, et est secundum rectitudinem: tunc oportet ut seces eam in profundo quantum est tibi possibile.	If however the fistula is of great depth and is straight, then it is necessary for you to cut it as deep as possible.
Deinde mundifica ipsam ex omnibus carnibus eius corruptis.	Then cleanse it from all the corrupted flesh of its own.
Deinde administra licinia inuoluta in medicinis acutis: et intromitte ea usque ad concauitatem Fistulae quam comprehendisti cum ferro: fac cum ea illud aliquotiens, donec corrodat medicina acuta totum quod remansit in concauitate Fistulae ex corruptione.	Then administer linen wrapped in sharp medicines and insert it into the depth of the fistula as far as you were able to reach with a iron; do that several times, until the sharp medicine eats away all that remained in the depth of the fistula from corruption.
Deinde restaura ipsam cum unguentis quae generant carnem sanam, donec sanetur.	Then restore it with ointments that produce healthy flesh, until it is healed.
Si uero non sanatur per illud, tunc cauteriza ipsam secundum quod narrauimus.	But if it does not heal through that, then cauterize it according to what we have narrated.
Si ergo caussa Fistulae est os, et certificatur apud te illud: tunc inquire ipsum, et seca ipsum secundum quod narraui tibi: si non prohibet te aliquid ex uena, aut neruo, aut membro principali, sicut diximus.	So if the cause of the fistula is a bone, and you are certain about it in your own judgment: then examine it, and cut it off according to what I told you; unless something prevents you from doing so, such as a vein, nerve, or main limb, just as we said.
Si ergo detegitur tibi os, et est in eo quiddam corruptionis, et nigredinis: tunc rade ipsum, donec auferatur corruptio eius tota.	So if you uncover a bone and there is something in it that is decayed and discolored: then scrape it off until the entire decay is removed.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod incarnat ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with whatever closes it up, until it heals.
Quod si non sanatur, et emittat pus sicut faciebat: tunc scias, quod tu non peruenisti ad totam eradicationem corruptionis.	What if it does not heal and discharges pus as before: then you will know that you have not reached the complete eradication of the corruption.
Detege ergo super illud secundo, et exquisite fac rasionem eius, et mundificationem ipsius cum ultima fortitudine tua.	Therefore, uncover it again, and thoroughly make an incision in it, and purify it with your utmost strength.
Deinde restaura ipsum.	Then restore it.
Si ergo sanatur, bonum est: et si non, tunc scias quod illa corruptio est in profunditate longinqua corporis, quam non es consecutus.	So if it heals, that is good; and if not, then you will know that the corruption is deep within the body, which you did not reach.
Non est ergo tibi in ea ingenium, nisi dimittere ipsam naturae.	You do not have the skill for it unless you leave it to nature.
Quod si corruptum est os paruum, et est possibile tibi, attrahe ipsum cum forficibus subtilibus quae conueniunt ad illud.	What if the small bone is corrupted and it's possible for you, then draw it out with fine forceps that are suitable for it.
Si autem sunt ossa multa, tunc exquisite fac attractionem eorum omnium, neque dimittas ex eis aliquid cum tua fortitudine.	But if there are many bones, then thoroughly make an attempt to draw out all of them, and do not leave anything behind with your strength.
Si uero contrarietatem facit tibi aliquid ex humiditatibus, et non est in incisione eorum timor, uel error: tunc incide illas humiditates et carnes, si sunt illic, et libera ossa.	But if something from the humors causes opposition to you, and there is no fear or error in making an incision into them: then cut through those humors and flesh, if it's present, and free the bones.
Si uero non est tibi praeparatio auferendi ossa ex hora tua, tunc pone super uulnus quod putrefaciat ipsum: et dimitte ipsum, donec putrefiat quod est in circumitu illorum ossium ex carnibus et humiditatibus.	But if you do not have the preparation to remove the bones from your own hour, then place over the wound that would cause it to decay: and leave it until it decays what is in the surrounding flesh and humors.
Et custodi uulnus ut non consolidetur.	And guard the wound so that it may not consolidate.
Et constringatur sectio quam tu secuisti in operatione tua.	And be tightened the incision which you made in your operation.
Imo pone super ipsum, si times, cotum submersum sulfure trito cum oleo: aut cotum submersum in unguento aegyptio, aut aliquo unguentorum uiridium.	Then place over it, if you fear, a poultice submerged in bruised sulphur with oil; or a poultice submerged in Egyptian ointment, or some green ointments.
Nam quando putrefient illae scilicet humiditates, et separantur ex eis ossa, alleuiatur ablatio eorum, et ipsorum attractio.	For when those humors decay, and the bones are separated from them, the removal of these things is alleviated and their attraction.
Si autem est os unum magnum, sicut os cruris, aut os coxae, et similia illis, et quod ex eo corruptum est, est pars magna: tunc rade ipsum rasione ultima, donec auferatur illa nigredo et corruptio.	But if it is a large bone, such as the tibia or hip bone, and what has decayed from it is a great part; then scrape away its last layer until that blackness and corruption are removed.
Deinde restaura uulnus.	Then repair the wound.
Si uero quod est in eo corruptum, est pars magna, et corruptio iam consecuta est medullam ossis, tunc necesse est serrare ipsum, et incidere ipsum totum usque ad locum, ubi peruenit corruptio: tunc cura ipsum, donec consolidetur.	But if what is corrupted in it is a great part, and corruption has already reached the bone marrow, then it is necessary to cut away the whole thing up to the point where the corruption has reached: then care for it until it consolidates.
Et ego narro tibi zuken, quae accidit uiro in crure suo: ut ponas ipsam exemplum et adiutorium super operationem tuam.	And I narrate to you a story about what happened to a man in his leg: that you may put it as an example and aid for your operation.
Fuit uir iuuenis aetate circiter triginta annos, cui accidit dolor in crure suo, a caussa quae mota est super ipsum intra corpus, id est, ab interioribus, donec peruenerunt materiae ad crus, et apostematum est apostemate magno: et non fuit ei caussa extrinseca.	There was a young man of around thirty years old who suffered from pain in his leg, caused by something that had moved within him, that is, from the inside, until it reached his leg and became a large abscess; and he did not have an external cause.
Extensum est ergo cum eo tempus cum errore medicorum, donec apertum est apostema, et concurrerunt cum eo materiae multae.	Therefore, with him, a long time passed with the mistake of doctors, until the abscess was opened and many materials converged on it.
Et postposita est curatio eius, donec fistulatum est crus, et facta sunt in eo orificia multa: quae omnia emittebant pus, et humiditates corporis.	And his treatment was delayed until his leg became ulcerated and many openings were made; which all discharged pus and bodily humors.
Curauit ergo ipsum multitudo medicorum circiter duos annos, et non fuit in eo sapiens in arte manus, donec uocatus sum, et uidi crus eius, et materias quae currebant ex illis orificiis cursu magno: etiam omne uiri corpus iam tabuerat, et color eius citrinus erat.	So a multitude of doctors treated him for about two years, and there was no one skilled in the art with him, until I was called, and I saw his leg and the materials flowing from those openings in a great current; also his whole body had already become emaciated, and his color was yellow.
Intromisi ergo tentam in uno locorum orificiorum, et peruenit tenta ad os.	I therefore inserted a probe into one of the openings of the place, and the probe reached the mouth.
Deinde perscrutatus sum orificia omnia: et inueni ea peruenire ad se inuicem ex omnibus partibus cruris.	Then I examined all the openings: and I found them to reach each other from all parts of the leg.
Properaui ergo, et secui super unum illorum orificiorum, donec detexi partem ossis: et inueni ipsum corruptum: quod iam corrosum erat, et denigratum, et putruerat, et perforatum erat, donec penetrauerat usque ad medullam.	I therefore proceeded and cut above one of those openings until I exposed a part of the bone: and I found it to be corrupted: which was already gnawed away, and denigrated, and putrid, and perforated until it had penetrated as far as the marrow.
Serraui ergo quod detectum est mihi, et praeparatum ex osse corrupto.	I therefore sawed what was discovered to me and prepared from the corrupted bone.
Et deputaui, quod non esset in osse nisi illa corruptio, quam abscidi, et serraui.	And I cut off that which was not in the bone except for that corruption, which I excised and sawed.
Et ego iam eradicaueram eam.	And I had already removed it.
Deinde posui restaurationem uulneris cum medicinis consolidatiuis spacio longo.	Then I applied the restoration of the wound with consolidating medicines over a long space.
Et non est consolidatum.	And it is not consolidated.
Deinde tentaui, et detexi super os secundo supra detectionem primam: et inueni corruptionem continuam cum osse: et serraui quod apparuit mihi etiam ex illa corruptione.	Then I probed and exposed above the bone a second time after the first discovery: and I found continuous corruption with the bone: and I sawed what appeared to me even from that corruption.
Deinde conatus sum restaurationem eius.	Then I tried to restore it.
Et non est restauratum.	And it is not restored.
Detexi ergo super ipsum iterum, et non cessaui incidere os particulatim, et conari restaurationem eius: et non est restauratum, donec incidi ex osse circiter palmum unum, et extraxi illud cum medulla sua.	I therefore exposed it again on top and did not cease to cut the bone bit by bit, and tried to restore it: and it is not restored until I cut away about a palm's width of bone, and extracted it with its marrow.
Deinde restauraui ipsum cum medicinis, et consolidatum est uelociter, et sanatum: et non fuit necessaria haec iteratio in operatione eius, et sectione ipsius, nisi propter dispositionem debilitatis infirmi, et paucitatem tolerantiae eius, et timorem meum super ipsum de morte: quoniam accidebat ei in omnibus horis ex superfluitate euacuationis syncopis mala.	Then I restored it with medicines and it was consolidated quickly and healed: and this iteration was not necessary for the operation and section of it, except on account of the debilitation of the sick person, and his lack of tolerance, and my fear for him in regard to death: because he was threatened by a bad syncopes at every hour from excessive evacuation.
Sanatus est ergo sanatione integra: et nata est in loco ossis caro dura, et bona facta est dispositio in corpore suo, et rediit uirtus eius: et conuersatus est in dispositionibus suis: et non fecit ei contrarietatem in ambulatione nocumentum omnino.	He was therefore restored by complete healing: and a hard, good flesh grew in the place of the bone, and a good arrangement was made in his body, and his strength returned: and he regained his normal disposition: and there was no harm to him at all in his walking.
Si autem os eminens in loco corporis iam fractum est: tunc oportet ut serres ipsum, secundum hunc modum: et est: ut accipias ligamentum, et stringe ipsum in extremitate ossis eminentis: et praecipe alicui, qui extendat ipsum ad sursum: et pone ligamentum aliud ex lana grossius ligamento primo.	If however the prominent bone is already broken in the body's location: then it is necessary to stitch it up, in this way: and this is: take a bandage, and tie it at the end of the prominent bone: and appoint someone to stretch it upwards: and place another bandage of coarse wool over the first bandage.
Deinde liga ipsum super carne, quae est suh osse: et extende extremitatem eius, ut trahas carnem ad inferiora: et tu detegis carnem super locum quem uis serrare, ut non laedat Serra carnem.	Then bind the bandage over the flesh that is near the bone: and stretch out its end so as to pull the flesh down towards the lower part: and you shall uncover the flesh above the place which you wish to suture, so that the suture does not harm the flesh.
Pone lignum, aut tabulam sub osse inferius decenter: quoniam quando facis illud, non prohibetur quin secet carnem corruptam.	Place a stick or board under the bone below decently: because when you do that, it is not prevented from cutting corrupted flesh.
Et oportet ut sit Serratura super locum corruptum parumper, ut non sit in concauitate ossis corruptio: et non appareat in apparitione sua sensui, et cogat ad Serraturam sui uice alia.	And it is necessary that the suture be placed above the corrupted area for a little while, so that there is not corruption of the bone in its concavity: and does not appear to the sense, and causes another suture to take its place.
Quod si os est corruptum, et non est eminens, imo continuatur pars eius cum parte: et corruptio est in medio eius, aut in parte ipsius: tunc detege carnem ab omnibus partibus totam.	What if the bone is corrupted and not prominent, but is continuous with another part of it; and the corruption is in its middle or in one of its parts: then remove the flesh from all its parts altogether.
Deinde pone lignum inferius.	Then place a stick below.
Postea serra illud ex parte prima, ubi est corruptio, donec continuetur Serratura ex parte altera: et sit Serratura secundum longitudinem a corruptione parumper, secundum quod diximus.	Afterwards, cut that from the first part where there is corruption, until the suture is continuous from the other side; and let the suture be according to the length, a little bit away from the corruption, as we said.
Quod si corruptio est in iunctura, incide ipsam iuncturam corruptam, et serra os ubi continuatur ex parte altera.	What if the corruption is at the joint, cut out the corrupted joint and then cut the bone where it continues on the other side.
Si uero corruptio est in continuatione duarum iuncturarum, tunc non est in ea ingenium nisi abrasio.	If however the corruption is in the continuation of two joints, then there is no skill needed except for scraping away.
Quod si corruptio est in pectine manus, aut in pectine pedis: tunc res in eo est difficilis ualde.	What if the corruption is in the breastbone of the hand or in the breastbone of the foot: then there is great difficulty in it.
Verum oportet, ut inquiras corruptionem qualiter appareat tibi.	But it is necessary that you investigate how the corruption appears to you.
Et abradas eam, et mundes ipsam secundum quamcunque dispositionem tibi possibile est, et cum quocunque ingenio rectificatur tibi: quando non facit tibi contrarietatem Vena, aut Neruus.	And scrape it clean, and purify it according to any arrangement possible for you, and with whatever skill is available to you; when it does not make a contradiction in the Vein, or Nerve.
Et scias quod incisoria, et Serrae ad incidendum ista ossa sunt multa, secundum situm ossium, et praparationem eorum, et ipsorum grossitudinem, et subtilitatem eorum, et magnitudinem, et paruitatem ipsorum, et duriciem ipsorum, et eorum raritatem.	And know that incisors and saws for cutting those bones are many, according to the location of the bones, and their preparation, and their thickness, and subtlety, and magnitude, and smallness, and hardness, and rarity.
Quapropter oportet, ut praepares omni speciei operationis instrumentum conueniens ad illam operationem.	Therefore, it is necessary to prepare the suitable instrument for every kind of operation.
Et scias, quod operationes istae significant tibi super speciem instrumenti quo indiges, quando tecum est studium longum.	And know that these operations signify to you according to the type of instrument which you need, when with you is a long study.
Et cognitio modorum huius artis, testimonium modorum aegritudinum: tunc enim iam inuenies per teipsum illud quod conuenit ei ex instrumentis ad omnem infirmitatem.	And the knowledge of the methods of this art is a testimony to the methods of diseases: then indeed you will find within yourself what suits each infirmity from the instruments.
Et ego sum firmans tibi in ultimo huius capituli numerum instrumentorum, quae pones exempla super quae incides, et probationem qua experiaris super alia.	And I am setting forth for you at the end of this chapter the number of instruments which you will put examples on to cut into, and a proof by which you will test other things.
Forma Serrae.	Saw form.
Forma alterius Serrae.	Form of another saw.
Forma Serrae alterius.	Form of another saw.
Forma Serrae alterius.	Form of yet another saw.
Haec forma Serrae depicta, sit decenter facta.	This form of the saw is depicted, made with precision.
Fiat arcus eius superior, acuitas eius ex ferro: et manubrium eius ex buxo, et sit pyramidale decenter factum.	Let its upper curve be made of a bow, its edge sharp from iron; and let its handle be made of boxwood, and let it be well-proportioned in the shape of a pyramid.
Forma Rasorii iuncturarum.	Razor form for joints.
Sit caput huius Rasorii, secundum formam capitis claui stellati: et puncta eius sint secundum formam punctorum elischetfegi.	Let the head of this razor be shaped like the head of a star-shaped awl; and let its points be shaped like those of an engraver's tool.
Et non conuenit, nisi ut fricentur cum eo capita iuncturarum, quando corrumpuntur, aut os amplum, et magnum est.	And it is not suitable, unless the heads of joints are rubbed with it when they are corrupted, or a large and great bone.
Forma maioris Rasorii.	Greater Razor form.
Forma medii Rasorii.	The form of the middle razor.
Forma Rasorii lati.	The form of the broad razor.
Forma Rasorii in quo est concauitas.	The form of the razor in which there is concavity.
Forma Rasorii alterius subtilis.	The form of the other subtle razor.
Forma Rasorii alterius curuatae extremitatis.	The form of the other curved extremity razor.
Forma Rasorii parui, subtilis tentae.	The form of the small subtle probe.
Forma Rasorii cum quo inciduntur ossa.	The form of the razor with which bones are cut.
Forma etiam Rasorii magni.	The form also of the great razor.
Hoc similatur Radio, et extremitas est sicut Serra: exhibetur in locis multis ex rasione ossium.	This resembles a saw, and its extremity is like a file: it is shown in many places for the removal of bones.
Forma Rasorii quod conuenit ad rasionem eius quod perforatum est ex ossibus.	The form of the razor which is suitable for the removal of that which has been perforated from bones.
Extremitas eius triangula, acutarum est extremitatum.	Its extremity is triangular, and sharp at its edges.
Fit ex Indi.	It comes from India.
Et similiter oportet, ut fiant omnia quae diximus ex Rasoriis, et Incisoriis, et Serris.	And similarly all the things we have said should be made of Razors, and Knives, and Files.
¶ De incisione extremitatum, et Serratura ossium.	On the cutting off of extremities, and on the sawing of bones.
Caput LXXXIX.	Chapter 89.
Putrefiunt extremitates, aut ex caussa extrinseca, aut intrinseca.	They putrefy due to an external or internal cause.
Cum ergo medicatus fueris illam corruptionem curatione medicinarum, et non confert curatio: et uides corruptionem incidere in membrum, quam non repercutit aliquid: tunc oportet ut incidas illud membrum usque ubi consequitu corruptio, ut euadat infirmus per illud a morte, aut a malicia quae est maior defectu membri.	Therefore, when you have treated the corruption with medical remedies and the cure does not take effect: and you see the corruption occurring in a member which does not respond to anything; then it is necessary that you cut off that member as far as the corruption extends, so that the sick person may escape through that member from death or from a greater defect of the member.
Et signum cui accidit illud est, quod denigratur membrum, donec putetur: quod ignis combussit ipsum, aut putrefit post nigredinem: donec inciditur illa putredo usque ad illud quod sequitur illud membrum, et serpit in totum corpus.	And the sign that this happens is that the member becomes blackened until it rots: or if fire has consumed it, or it has putrefied after blackening: until the putridity reaches as far as the following bone and spreads throughout the entire body.
Propera ergo cum incisione eius, et similiter si caussa corruptionis est a percussione quorundam uenenosorum: sicut scorpionis marini, et uiperae, et rutellae, et similium.	Therefore, proceed with the incision of it, and similarly if the cause of corruption is due to the striking of certain veneneous things, such as the sea scorpion, viper, adder, and similar.
Si ergo corruptio, aut percussio est in extremitate digiti, tunc incide digitum, et non des spacium corruptioni, ut incedat usque ad reliquam manum.	If therefore a corruption or percussion is at the end of the finger, then cut off the finger and do not leave space for the corruption to spread, until it reaches the rest of the hand.
Et similiter si accidit in manu, tunc incide eam ex radice focilis, et non des spacium corruptioni, donec capiat in focili brachii.	And similarly if it happens in the hand, then cut it off from the wrist and do not leave space for the corruption, until it reaches the armpit of the arm.
Et si inuadit in eo, tunc incide brachium apud cubitum in iunctura sua.	And if it spreads into that, then cut off the arm at the elbow joint.
Si autem pertransit corruptio, et uides eum circiter cubitum: tunc in illo est mors infirmi.	But if corruption passes through and you see him about the elbow: then it is the death of the infirm person.
Et administrare praeter illud ex curatione, est quantitas uirtus.	And to apply something beyond that from a cure, is a quantity of power.
Et similiter fac de pede, quando inuadit corruptio in digito, tunc incide ipsum apud unum nodorum: et si capit in pectine pedis, tunc incide pedem totum.	And similarly do the same for the foot, when corruption spreads into a toe, then cut it off at one of the joints; and if it reaches to the shinbone, then cut off the whole foot.
Si autem ascendit ad genu, tunc incide crus apud iuncturam genu.	But if it ascends to the knee, then cut off the leg at the knee joint.
Quod si corruptio iam peruenit supra genu, tunc non est in ea ingenium, nisi dimissio, et relinquere infirmum morti.	What if corruption has already reached above the knee, then there is no remedy for it except death, and to leave the sick person to die.
Et modus incidendi membrum, aut serrandi ipsum est, ut stringas ligamentum in inferiori, quem uis incidere: et stringe ligamentum aliud supra locum.	And the method of cutting off a limb or sawing it is to tie the ligament at the lower part which you wish to cut off: and tie another ligament above that place.
Et extendat minister ligamentum unum ad inferiora: et extendat minister aliud ligamentum superius ad sursum.	And have one assistant stretch out a ligament down below: and have another assistant stretch out the other ligament up above.
Et tu separa carnem quae est inter duo ligamenta, cum Spatumili lato, donec detegatur caro tota.	And you separate the flesh that is between the two ligaments, with a broad spatula, until the whole flesh is uncovered.
Deinde incidatur, aut serretur.	Then it should be cut or sawed.
Et oportet, ut ponas ab omnibus partibus pannum lini, et non tangat Serra locum sanum: et accidat infirmo laesio addita, et apostema calidum.	And it is necessary to place a linen cloth around all parts, and not have the saw touch a healthy area; lest an additional injury befall the sick person, and a hot abscess occur.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis interius dum operaris, tunc cauteriza locum uelociter: aut pone super ipsum quosdam pulueres abscindentes sanguinem.	But if bleeding occurs internally while you are operating, then cauterize the area quickly or place some powder above it that absorbs blood.
Deinde redi ad medicationem tuam, donec compleatur.	Then return to your treatment until it is complete.
Deinde liga membrum uulneratum cum ligamento conueniente ei, et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then bind the wounded member with a suitable bandage and care for it until it heals.
Et ego narro tibi quod accidit uiro in pede suo, hoc idem accidens quod narro tibi.	And I will tell you what happened to a man on his foot, the same thing that is happening to him.
Quod est, quia accidit in pede suo nigredo, cum adustione quae assimilatur combustioni ignis: et corruptio illa in primis accidit in digito suo, donec coepit pedem totum.	What is this? Because a blackening occurred on his foot, with a burning that resembles the combustion of fire: and that corruption first occurred on his toe, until it spread to his entire foot.
Properauit ergo uir ex seipso, postquam uidit corruptionem incidere in membro cum uehementia eius, quod inuenit ex dolore, et adustione eius: et incidit ipsum apud iuncturam, et sanatus est.	Therefore the man took care of himself after he saw corruption spreading on his member with its swelling, which he found to be caused by pain and burning; and it happened that he was healed at the joint.
Et postquam praeteriit ei tempus longum, accidit ei illa eadem corruptio in digito manus suae indice.	And after a long time had passed, the same corruption occurred on his index finger of his hand.
Venit ergo ad me, et conatus sum recuperare illam superfluitatem cum eo quod posui super manum ex medicinis post mundificationem corporis eius: et non repercussa est superfluitas, et coepit incedere in digitum alium: donec coepit coruptio in manum.	So he came to me and I tried to remove the excess with him after applying medicines on his body once it was cleansed; and the excess did not recur, but began to spread to another finger, until corruption began to spread throughout his hand.
Vocauit ergo me, ad incidendum manum eius: et nolui illud, sperans ex me super repercussionem illius superfluitatis: et timui etiam super ipsum apud incisionem manus eius mortem.	So he called on me to cut open his hand: and I refused, hoping that the excess would recur spontaneously; and I was also afraid of death at the point of incision in his hand.
Quoniam uirtus uiri erat super casum.	Because the man's strength was greater than the accident.
Postquam ergo desperauit de me, reuersus est ad terram suam: et peruenit ad me de eo, quia properauit, et incidit manum suam totam: et sanatus est.	Afterward, since he had given up on me, he returned to his land and came back to me about it, because he was in a hurry and cut open his entire hand; and he was healed.
Et non attuli hanc narrationem, nisi ut sit adiutorium super illud quod cadit de genere huius aegritudinis: et ut sit significatio qua significetur, et secundum quam agatur.	And I did not narrate this story, unless it is to be a help for that which falls under the category of this illness; and to signify what should be signified, and according to how one should act.
¶ De cura Sinuum, et qualitate clisterizationis cum medicinis.	Of the treatment of wounds, and the quality of cleansing with medicines.
Caput XC.	Chapter 90.
Quando accidit apostema in quibusdam membris carnosis, et prolongatur spacium apostematis, donec collectionem facit saniei: deinde rumpitur, aut perforatur, et egreditur quod in eo est ex sanie, et remanet locus uacuus quasi sit uas: et cutis quae est super ipsum sicut pannus qui iam subtiliatus est: et non peruenit ad ultimum in corruptione sua, neque imprimit in os, neque in neruum, neque in ligamentum: meretur ut nominetur Sinus: et non nominatur Fistula: uerumtamen si prolongatur spacium eius, donec imprimat corruptio in aliquid horum membrorum, tunc nominatur Fistula, aut zuken.	Here is the translation:
Et cura eius est, ut incidas illam cutem totam sicut reuoluitur: et praecipue quando subtiliata est, et facta sicut pannus: et confidis quia non aaehaeret cum loco, propter corruptionem suam.	And the treatment for this is to cut off that skin entirely as it has rolled back: and especially when it has been thinned out and become like a cloth: and you can trust that it will not reunite with its location due to its own corruption.
Si autem speras quod adhaereat cutis, et non consequitur ex eo corruptio illa ultima consecutione: et si in cute est spissitudo ex carne, tunc cura ipsum cum Clisteri: et est, ut consideres ad Sinum.	But if you hope that the skin will stick together and it does not result from that last corruption; and if there is a thickness of flesh under the skin, then treat it with a poultice and is, to consider the navel.
Tunc si est magnus, et pus quod emittitur ex eo est foetidi odoris: tunc clisteriza ipsum cum medicamine aegyptio, quod est aceti, et olei, et ziniar, partes recipiens aequales, aggregentur in uase: et decoquantur super ignem, donec rubeat medicamen: et ueniat in spissitudinem mellis.	Then if it is large and the pus that is discharged from it has a foul odor: then treat it with a poultice made of Egyptian medicine, which is vinegar, oil, and zinar, taking equal parts, mixed together in a vessel: and let them simmer over fire until the medicine becomes thick like honey.
Deinde accipe ex eo quod tibi necesse est: et dissolue ipsum cum aqua et melle, et clisteriza cum eo Sinum: et stringe orificium eius, et dimitte medicinam in eo ad quantitatem duarum horarum.	Then take from it what is necessary for you: and dissolve it with water and honey, and treat the navel with it: and close up its opening, and leave the medicine in it for a period of two hours.
Deinde extrahe ipsum cum expressione: fac illud diebus tot, donec mundificetur Sinus, et remoueatur foetor.	Then draw out what remains with expression: make this happen every day until the navel is purified and the foul odor is removed.
Et quandoque clisterizatur cum aqua cineris, quando non est tibi praesens hoc medicamen: et est, ut accipias cinerem lignorum uitis, aut cinerem ex lignis ilicis: et proiicias super eam aquam.	And sometimes treat it with ash water when this medicine is not available to you: and take the ash of vine wood or ash from ilex trees: and pour water over it.
Deinde cola eam, et clisteriza cum ea, donec confidas quod Sinus iam ablutus est.	Then soak it in that, and treat with it, until you are confident that the navel is already cleansed.
Quod si infirmo non est tolerantia super medicamen aegyptium, neque aquam cineris, tunc clisteriza ipsum cum aqua et melle, cui iam permixtum est aliquid ex ziniar contrito.	And if the patient is not tolerant of Egyptian medicine or ash water, then treat it with water and honey to which something from crushed zinar has been mixed.
Aut clisteriza ipsum cum melle et uino permixtis, quoniam de proprietate mellis est, ut mundificet, et abluat: et uinum facit adhaerere Sinum, praecipue quando in uino est superfluitas stipticitatis et siccitatis.	Or treat it with honey and wine mixed together, because of the property of honey that it cleanses and washes: and wine makes the navel stick together, especially when there is an excess of astringency and dryness in the wine.
Cum facis illud aliquotiens, et confidis quod Sinus corruptio iam remota est: tunc clisteriza ipsum cum eo quod facit nasci carnem in eo.	When you do that thing many times and trust that corruption of the sinus is now removed: then cleanse it with what makes flesh grow in it.
Et est, ut accipias ex emplastro dyafinicon: et dissoluas ipsum cum oleo rosato, et uino stiptico: aut clisteriza ipsum cum quibusdam medicinis, et unguentis aliis, quorum proprietates scripsi in tractatu unguentorum.	And it is, that you take from diaphrenic plaster: and dissolve it with rose oil, and astringent wine: or cleanse it with certain medicines, and other ointments, the properties of which I wrote in the treatise on ointments.
Quod si orificium Sinus est strictum, in quo non capit cannula clisteris: tunc amplifica ipsum cum ferro parumper: aut pone in ipso licinium inuolutum in unguento aegyptio, aut in unguento basilicon, donec amplificetur.	But if the orifice of the sinus is narrow, into which the cannula of the cleanse does not fit: then dilate it with a small iron instrument: or put a linen cloth wrapped in Egyptian ointment, or Basilikon ointment, until it is dilated.
Et similiter si est orificium etiam amplum, tunc aggrega labia eius cum sutura: et dimitte ex eo quantitatem in quam ingrediatur clistere sine additione.	And similarly if the orifice is also wide, then bring together its lips with a suture: and let it be free from that amount which the cleanse can enter without addition.
Et similiter si orificium eius ex quo currit pus, est eleuatum ad superiora: tunc seca ipsum in depressiori loco qui est in ipso, ut currat ex eo pus usque inferius: quoniam pus quando coartatur in profunditate Sinus, prohibet carnem generari in eo.	And similarly if the orifice from which pus runs is elevated to above: then cut it in a lower place that is in it, so that pus may flow out of it downwards: for pus when constricted in the depth of the sinus prevents flesh from being generated in it.
Quod si non est tibi possibile secare Sinum circiter inferius eius secundum quod uis: tunc conare, ut praepares membrum praeparatione qua currat ex eo pus cum facilitate secundum quod praeparatur tibi.	And if it is not possible for you to cut the sinus around its lower part as you wish: then try to prepare the member with a preparation by which pus may flow out of it easily as it is prepared for you.
Conare, ut non retineatur in eo aliquid ex pus omnino: et accipe medicinas consolidatiuas quae ponuntur super signum, conuenientes ad illud quod uis.	Try to make sure that nothing at all of the pus is retained in it: and take consolidating medicines which are placed on a sign, corresponding to what you wish.
Et extende eas super pannum lini.	And spread them over a linen cloth.
Et sit pannus tantae quantitatis, qua fiat communicatio totius Sinus.	And let the cloth be of such a size that it may be in contact with the whole sinus.
Deinde incide cum forficibus in directo orificii Sinus foramen, amplius orificio Sinus parumper.	Then cut with forceps into the straight orifice of the sinus, making the opening a little wider than the orifice of the sinus.
Deinde extende ex unguentis lenibus super pannum alium, secundum quantitatem foraminis: et pone eum super ipsum positione longinqua ab orificio Sinus, ut alleuietur exitus pus ex eo: et non auferas pannum magnum, nisi post dies aliquos uice una.	Then spread a layer of soft ointment over another cloth, according to the size of the opening; and place it on top in a distant position from the orifice of the sinus, so that the exit of pus may be eased out: and do not remove the cloth until several days have passed.
Ille autem qui est super orificium Sinus, est ille quem remoues in omni hora, ut egrediatur quod aggregatur in eo ex pus: et ut scias, an illud quod currit ex eo uirus, est multum, aut parum: aut digestum, aut indigestum.	He who is above the opening of the sinus, is he whom you remove every hour, so that what gathers in it from pus may go out: and to know whether that which flows out of it is much or little, or digested or undigested.
Et cum hoc iterum considera locum Sinus ipsius, an in ipso sentiat dominus eius dolorem, aut non sit in eo dolor, et an sit in eo apostema, aut non sit in eo apostema.	And when you have considered this again, look at the place of the sinus itself: whether its lord feels pain in it or does not feel pain in it; and whether there is an apostema in it or not.
Cum ergo protenditur medicatio tua taliter, et uides materiam quae egreditur super orificium Sinus, tunc scias, quod Sinus iam adhaeret, aut approximat adhaerentiae: tunc ergo solue ipsum in mane, aut in tertio die: et quando soluis uulnus, tunc permuta pannum alium, et renoua unguentum.	So when your treatment is proceeding thus and you see the matter that flows out above the opening of the sinus, then you will know that the sinus has already adhered or approaches adhesion: then therefore dissolve it in the morning or on the third day; and when you dissolve the wound, then change the cloth for another one, and renew the ointment.
Si autem egreditur ex Sinu post spacium longum uirus subtile, tunc non desperes de adhaerentia eius, nam sanatio eius appropinquat, quoniam ex hominibus sunt qui tardant generationem carnis in uulneribus suis, et ex eis sunt qui agunt econtrario illius.	But if there flows from the sinus after a long time a subtle pus, then do not despair of its adhesion, for its healing is approaching, because among men are those who slow down the formation of flesh in their wounds and among them are those who act contrary to it.
Si autem egreditur ex Sinu post dies multos pus indigestum, tunc scias quod sinus non adhaeret.	But if there flows from the sinus after many days an undigested pus, then you will know that the sinus is not adhering.
Si ergo tardatur adhaerentia Sinus, et prolongatur res eius: tunc adde in exiccatione medicinarum, uerum faciant medici, ut sint medicinae in substantia sua humidae, et in uirtute sua siccae: sicut unguentum dyafinicon, quando additur in eo superfluitas additionis ex zegi.	So if the adhesion of the sinus is delayed and its process prolonged: then add to the drying remedy, let the physicians truly do so, that the medicine be in its substance humid and in its virtue dry: just as diaphrenic ointment, when something in excess is added to it from zegi.
Et ex magis ultimo quo curatur, est, ut accipias unguentum dyafinicon, et soluatur cum oleo rosato, et roretur super ipsum uinum antiquum aequale in substantia sua.	And from the last remedy used for healing, it is to take diaphrenic ointment and dissolve it with rose oil, and sprinkle over it ancient wine equal in its substance.
Deinde confice ipsum cum eo, et utere ipso.	Then compress it with that, and use it.
Et iam facit simile huic actioni, quando non est tibi praesens unguentum dyafinicon, mel, quando decoquis ipsum, donec ingrossetur, et uteris eo.	And now it does the same thing when you do not have diaphrenic ointment available, use honey instead, when you cook it until it thickens, and use it.
Aut accipe myrrham, et aloen, et olibanum: tere totum, et pulueriza illud super mel dum est super ignem.	Take myrrh, and aloes, and frankincense: grind the whole, and powderize that over honey while it is above the fire.
Deinde line super ipsum pannum, et stringe ipsum super Sinum: et line cum melle quod decoquisti, donec ingrossatum est: et pulueriza super ipsum species, et pone super ipsum pannum, et stringe eum.	Then pour the mixture over the cloth, and bind it on the breast; and pour with honey that you have cooked, until it has thickened; and powderize over the surface, and put it on the cloth, and bind it.
Et quandoque administratur in illo aristolochia longa, et radices lilii coelestis, et est lilium: et farina herbi, et centaurea.	And sometimes it is administered with Aristolochia longa, and roots of the heavenly lily, which is lily; and farina of herbs, and Centaurea.
Utere eis simplicibus, aut aggregatis, tere ea, et cribella ipsa: et pulueriza super mel quod narraui, et utere eo.	Use them in simples or compound remedies, grind those, and sift them out; and powderize over the honey that I mentioned, and use it.
Quod si prolongatur res Sinus, et non sanatur hac curatione: tunc scias, quod in profundo eius est corruptio: aut iam facit impressionem in ossibus, aut in reliquis membris duris, aut ligamentis: tunc cura ipsum curatione Fistularum, secundum quod praemissum est.	But if the breast abscess prolongs and is not healed by this treatment: then you will know that there is corruption deep within it; or it is already making an impression on the bones, or in other hard parts of the body, or ligaments; then treat it with the cure for fistulas, as was previously mentioned.
¶ De cura Panaritii et unguis attritae, et incisione digiti additi, et sectione.	Of the treatment of paronychia and the attrition of the nail, with addition of finger incision and section.
Caput XCI.	Page 91.
Panaritium est apostema quod nascitur sub ungue pollicis manus, aut pedis: et fortasse nascitur in reliquis digitis.	Paronychia is an abscess that arises under the nail of the thumb or foot, or perhaps in other fingers.
Cum ergo prolongatur res eius, et negligitur curato eius, et apostematur apostemate calido: aut corrumpitur, et emittit pus, donec corrodit radicem unguis: et fortasse corrumpit eam totam, et fortasse peruenit corruptio ad os, donec est ei odor foetidus: et fit extremitas digiti lata, et fit color eius fuscus.	When therefore the abscess prolongs and is neglected and not cured, and becomes a hot apostema: or it corrupts and discharges pus, until it eats away the root of the nail; and perhaps it corrupts the whole of it, and perhaps corruption reaches to the bone, until it has a foul odor: and the end of the finger becomes wide, and its color becomes dark.
Quando ergo tu curas ipsum, cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio tua: tunc oportet ut incidas cum ferro totam superfluitatem quae remansit ex ungue.	When therefore you cure it with what we said in the division, and your treatment does not help: then it is necessary that you cut off the whole excess that remains from the nail.
Deinde cauteriza uulnus post illud.	Then cauterize the wound after that.
Cauterium enim iuuatiuum est ualde.	A cauterizing instrument is very helpful.
Si uero os est sanum, et est unguis etiam sana, et additiones uacuae unguis iam comprimunt carnem ad interiora, et incipiunt pungere ipsam, et laedunt eam: tunc oportet ut ponas Radium subtilem sub angulo unguis quae pungit carnem, et impelle eam sursum: et incide eam carnem cum facilitate, et pone super illud quod remanet de carne ex medicinis comburentibus, corrosiuis, donec remoueatur totum eius.	If the bone is sound and the nail also sound, and the additions of the nail are pressing upon the flesh to the inside, and begin to pierce it, and hurt it: then you must place a thin Radiatum under the angle of the nail that is piercing the flesh, and push it upwards: and cut through the flesh with ease, and place above what remains of the flesh from medicines burning, corrosive, until all is removed.
Deinde cura illud cum unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then care for that wound with ointments, until it heals.
Si autem corruptio iam imprimit in os, tunc oportet ut incidas illud os, et extrahas ipsum: non enim sanatur unquam dum permanet in eo os corruptum.	But if corruption has already taken hold in the bone, then it is necessary to cut out that bone and remove it: for it will never heal as long as the corrupted bone remains.
Quod si uides corrosionem et corruptionem incedere in digitum, tunc incide eum in uno nodorum, secundum quod praemissa est eius rememoratio.	If you see corrosion and corruption spreading in a finger, then cut it off at one of the joints, according to what has been previously mentioned about its recollection.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then care for that part, until it heals.
Si autem accidat ungui attritio, aut percussio: et contingit in ea dolor uehemens, tunc oportet ut phlebotomes infirmum in primis.	If however a finger is bruised or struck: and there occurs in it a vehement pain, then it is necessary to bleed the patient first.
Deinde seca unguem cum Spatumili acuto sectione transuersa de sursum ad uisum.	Then cut off the finger with a sharp razor blade, making a transverse incision from above to below.
Et custodi, ne sectio perueniat ad carnem quae est sub ungue, nam tu facies accidere per illud super infirmum dolorem uehementem, et erit caussa ad natiuitatem carnis additae in loco.	And take care not to cut through the flesh that is under the nail, for you will bring about a severe pain upon the patient, and it will be a cause of added flesh growth in that place.
Deinde cura locum cum eo quod sedat dolores.	Then care for the place with what soothes pains.
Digitus uero additus qui nascitur in quibusdam manibus hominum, fortasse est carnosus totus: et fortasse sunt in quibusdam eorum ossa, et fortasse est in eo unguis: et quidam eorum nascitur in radice iuncturae, aut est natiuitas eius in quibusdam nodis digiti.	The added finger that grows on some people's hands is perhaps entirely fleshy: and perhaps there are bones in some of them, and perhaps there is a nail in it: and some of them grow from the root of the joint or at one of the finger joints.
Ille ergo qui nascitur in quibusdam nodis digiti, non mouetur: et ille qui nascitur apud iuncturam digiti, fortasse mouetur.	Therefore, that which grows from some of the finger joints does not move: and that which grows at the joint of the finger, perhaps moves.
Eius ergo qui ex eis est carnosus, sectio eius facilis est.	Therefore, the one who is fleshy among them has an easy incision.
Quod est, ut incidas ipsum apud radicem suam cum Spatumili lato.	What there is to cut it at its root with a broad spatula.
Eius autem cuius natiuitas est in radice iuncturae curatio, est difficilis.	However, the one whose birth is in the joint's union is difficult to cure.
Abstine ergo ab incisione eius.	So then abstain from cutting it.
In illo uero qui nascitur in digito apud ultimum nodorum, tunc oportet ut incidas in primis carnem eius incisione rotunda usque ad os.	In that one who is born on the finger at the last joints, then it is necessary to cut through its first flesh with a round incision up to the bone.
Deinde serra os cum una illarum Serrarum conuenientium ad illud.	Then file the bone with one of those files that are suitable for it.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then take care of it until it heals.
Consolidatio autem quae accidit digitis adinuicem, multotiens accidit aut ex natiuitate hominis, id est, nascitur cum eo, aut a consolidatione uulneris, aut combustione ignis, et similibus.	However, the consolidation that occurs on fingers one by one often happens either because of a person's birth, that is, it is born with him, or from the consolidation of a wound, or burning by fire, and similar things.
Oportet ergo ut seces illam consolidationem, donec redeant digiti secundum formam suam naturalem.	It is necessary then to cut off that consolidation until the fingers return to their natural shape.
Deinde pone inter eos licinia, aut pannos infusos in oleo rosato: ut non consolidentur uelociter, et separa inter eos: aut pone inter eos laminam plumbi subtilem, donec consolidetur locus secundum quod oportet.	Then place between them linen or cloth soaked in rose oil: so that they do not consolidate quickly, and separate between them: or place between them a thin lead plate, until the location consolidates as it should.
Et similiter si accidat consolidatio quibusdam digitis cum palma, tunc seca illam consolidationem, secundum quod praeparatur et conuenit figurae membri.	And similarly if a consolidation occurs on some fingers with the palm, then cut off that consolidation according to how it is prepared and fits the figure of the member.

Caput XCII.	Caput XCII.
Uites sunt Venae inuolutae, grossae, plenae superfluitatibus melancholicis quae accidunt in pluribus membris corporis: et plurimum euentus earum est in cruribus, praecipue in cruribus iter agentium et laborantium, et portantium.	There are veins that are twisted, thick, and full of superfluous melancholic substances which occur in many parts of the body: and most of them happen in legs, particularly in legs of travelers and workers, and those who carry loads.
Oportet ergo ut administres excussionem corporis ex cholera nigra aliquotiens excussione forti.	Therefore it is necessary to apply a purgation of the body with black cholera several times using strong cleansing.
Deinde phlebotoma patientis eas basilicam.	Then perform venesection on the patient's basilica vein.
Curatio uero earum cum ferro, est secundum duos modos.	The cure of those things with iron is according to two methods.
Vnus eorum est, ut secentur, et extrahatur sanguis niger.	One of them is that they are cauterized and black blood is removed.
Et modus alter est, ut eleuetur Vena, et extrahatur tota.	And the other method is that a vein is raised up and all [of it] is removed.
Sectio uero eius est secundum hunc modum.	The section of it is according to this method.
Embroca crus in primis cum aqua calida multum, donec resoluatur sanguis grossus faeculentus.	He binds the leg first with hot water a great deal, until the thick, bloody pus is dissolved.
Deinde stringe crus infirmi a superiori parte coxae eius, usque ad inferiorem partem genu cum uitta.	Then bind the weak leg from the upper part of his hip down to the lower part of the knee with a bandage.
Deinde seca uenam in loco uno, aut duobus, aut tribus sectione ampla.	Then cut the vein in one place, or two, or three, making a wide incision.
Deinde eleua, id est, extrahe sanguinem in manu tua ab inferiori parte cruris, usque ad sursum, et a superiori oportet ut phlebotomes infirmum in primis.	Then lift it, that is, remove the blood from your hand from the lower part of the leg up to above, and you should bleed the patient first.
Deinde seca unguem cum usque inferius: donec egrediatur ex sanguine quantitas quam uides sufficere, et quam tolerat uirtus infirmi.	Then cut the fingernail down to the bottom: until a quantity of blood emerges that you see is sufficient and which the patient's strength can tolerate.
Postea liga eam: et praecipe ei, ut abstineat a cibis generantibus choleram nigram: et itera euacuationem et phlebotomiam, quando implentur Venae, et nocet illud infirmo.	Afterwards bind it up and tell him to refrain from foods that cause black bile: and repeat the evacuation and bloodletting when the veins are full and it causes harm to the patient.
Eleuatio autem eius est secundum hunc modum.	The elevation of it is according to this method.
Rade crus infirmi, si in ea sunt pili multi.	Shave the weak leg, if there are many hairs on it.
Deinde intromitte ipsum in balneum: aut embroca ipsum in crure eius cum aqua calida, donec rubeat, et exuberentur Venae: aut exercitetur exercitio forti, si non est ei praesens balneum, donec calefiat membrum.	Then introduce him into a bath or bind him with warm water on his leg until it becomes red and the veins swell: or exercise himself vigorously if there is no bath available, until the member warms up.
Deinde seca cutem in directo uenae sectione per longitudinem: aut in ultimo eius apud genu, aut in inferiori parte eius apud calcaneum.	Then cut the skin along the direction of the vein's incision by its length: or at the end of it near the knee, or at the lower part of it near the heel.
Deinde aperi cutem cum uncinis, et excoria uenam ab omni parte, donec appareat sensui: et est apud apparitionem eius, quod uides eam rubeam ad nigredinem decliuem.	Then open the cut with a hook and remove the vein from every part until it appears to the sense: and it is at its appearance when you see it turn red to black.
Cum ergo uadit ex cute, uides eam albam quasi sit chorda.	When therefore it goes out from the skin, you see it as white as if it were a string.
Deinde intromitte sub ea Radium, donec quando eleuatur et egreditur de cute: suspende eam cum uncino caeco, leni.	Then insert under it the needle until it is elevated and goes out of the skin: suspend it with a blind hook, gently.
Deinde seca sectionem aliam prope illam sectionem tribus digitis.	Then cut off another section near that section, three fingers away.
Deinde excoria cutem a superiori parte uenae, donec appareat.	Then scrape the skin from the upper part of the vein until it appears.
Deinde eleua eam cum Radiis sicut fecisti, et suspende eam cum uncino alio, sicut fecisti in primis.	Then lift it up with the needle as you did, and suspend it with another hook, just as you did at first.
Deinde seca sectionem aliam, aut sectiones plures, si indiges illo.	Then cut off another section, or several sections if needed.
Deinde eleua, et incide ipsam ultima sectione apud calcaneum.	Then lift it up and cut the last section at the heelbone.
Deinde extrahe eam ad sectionem quae est supra eam.	Then pull it out to the section that is above it.
Et fac illud, donec extrahas eam ex sectione quae est superior, uel altior sectionibus omnibus, donec quando egreditur tota: tunc incide eam.	And do that until you pull it out from the upper or higher sections, until when it is entirely gone; then cut it.
Si autem non obedit tibi ad extrahendum, et eleuandum: tunc intromitte acum cum filo forti duplo, et liga eam, et extrahe ipsam: aut intromitte sub ea Radium: et reuolue manum tuam ad omnem partem, donec egrediatur.	But if it does not comply with you to pull out and lift up: then insert a strong double thread needle into it, and tie it, and pull it out; or insert under it the needle, and turn your hand around all sides until it comes out.
Et caue, ne incidatur.	And beware, lest it be cut.
Nam si incidatur, fit difficile tibi eleuare eam ualde, et ingreditur super infirmum ex ea nocumentum.	For if it is cut, it becomes difficult for you to lift it up very much, and harm comes from it to the patient.
Cum ergo extraxeris eam totam: tunc pone super locum uulnerum lanam submersam in uino et oleo rosato, aut oleo: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	When therefore you have pulled it out entirely: then place over the wound a soaked cloth in wine and rose oil, or oil: and care for it until it is healed.
Quod si Vitis est contracta, habens tortuositatem cui sit inuolutio ad partes, et non est sicut diximus secundum rectitudinem: tunc oportet ut findas super eam ad omnem partem tortuositatis eius, et loca inuolutionis ipsius.	If the vein is contracted and twisted, having a curvature that wraps around to the parts, and it is not as we said according to straightness: then you must cut above it on all sides of its twisting and wrapping.
Deinde suspende eam cum uncinis, donec eleues eam totam: et caue apud sectionem tuam super eam ne incidas uenam, aut uulneres: nam difficile fiet super te eleuare, uel extrahere eam.	Then suspend it with hooks, until you lift it up entirely: and beware at your section above it not to cut the vein or wound; for it will be difficult for you to lift or pull it out.
Conserua ergo prudentiam tuam.	Therefore preserve your prudence.
Forma Incidentis quo sanatur Vitis.	The manner in which a wound is healed.
Forma Vncini caeci.	The form of binding the blind eye.
Non est ei curuitas sicut reliquis Vncinis, neque est acutae extremitatis, ut non uulneret uenam: et est grossae flectuositatis, lenis: quoniam si esset subtilis, incideret uenam subtilitate sua: imo sit ei superflua grossitudo, sicut diximus.	There is no curvature to it like the other bandages, nor is it sharp-edged so as not to wound the vein; and it has a thickened flexuousness, gentle. For if it were thin, it would cut through the vein because of its own subtlety. Indeed, there is excessive thickness to it, as we have said.
De extractione Venae cruris.	On the removal of the vein in the leg.
Caput XCIII.	Chapter 93.
Haec Vena generatur in cruribus in terris calidis, sicut Alizegi, et terra Arabum, et in terris aridis, calidis, paucae teneritatis, id est, in quibus non nascitur herba, neque arbor.	This vein is generated in the legs on hot earth, such as in Alysus and Arabian land, and in dry, hot lands of little fertility, that is to say, where no herb nor tree grows.
Et fortasse generatur in locis aliis corporis praeter crura.	And perhaps it is generated in other parts of the body besides the legs.
Et generatio quidem eius est a putrefactione quae accidit sub cute, sicut accidunt intra corpora serpentes et uermes ascarides, et uermes generati inter cutem et carnem.	And its generation indeed is from the putrefaction that occurs beneath the skin, just as it happens within the bodies of serpents and ascarid worms, and worms generated between the skin and flesh.
Et signum incaeptionis euentus huius Venae est, quod accidit in crure inflammatio uehemens.	And the sign of its beginning is that which occurs in the leg, namely a violent inflammation.
Deinde uesicatur locus.	Then the place is swollen.
Deinde incipit Vena exire ex loco illius uesicationis, quasi sit radix plantae, aut animal.	Then the vein begins to emerge from that swollen place, as if it were the root of a plant or an animal.
Cum ergo apparet ex ea extremitas eius, tunc oportet ut inuoluas super ipsam frustum plumbi, cuius pondus sit ex drachma keil, usque ad drachmas II et noda ipsam: et dimitte plumbum suspensum ex crure.	When then the end of it appears from that vein, then you must wrap a piece of lead around it, weighing one and a half drachmas keil, up to two and a half drachmas, and suspend the lead from the leg.
Quotiens ergo egreditur ex ea aliquid ad exteriora, inuolue illud in plumbo, et noda illud.	Whenever then something emerges from it into the outside, wrap that thing in lead and bind it.
Quod si prolongatur multum, tunc incide partem eius, et inuolue residuum.	If it is prolonged too much, then cut off a part of it and wrap up the remainder.
Et non incidas eam radicitus antequam egrediatur tota.	And do not cut it at its root until it has emerged entirely.
Quoniam si incidis, contrahitur, et ingreditur in carnem: et facit accidere apostema, et putredinem in loco, et ulcus malum.	Since it is cut, it constricts and enters into flesh: and makes a pustule to occur, and putridity in the place, and an evil ulcer.
Quapropter oportet, ut suauiter tractetur, et extrahatur paulatim, donec egrediatur ex ultimo sui, et non remaneat ex ea aliquid in corpore: et ex hac quidem Vena egreditur in quibusdam hominibus quod est in longitudine sua quinque palmorum et decem.	Therefore it is necessary that it be treated gently and drawn out gradually, until it emerges from the last part of itself and nothing remains from it in the body: and from this very vein, in some people, there emerges something which is five palms long and ten in length.
Et iam peruenit ad me, quia exiuit uiro ex XX palmis.	And now it has reached me, because it emerged from a man who was twenty palms tall.
Si autem inciditur tibi in hora medicationis tuae: tunc intromitte radium in foramine eius, et perfora eam foramine longo, cum corpore, donec euacuetur totum quod est in ea ex materia: et administra putrefactionem loci cum medicinis diebus aliquot.	But if it happens to you during the time of your medication: then insert a thread into its opening and pierce it with a long drill, along with the body, until what is inside it is emptied out from the material: and administer putrefaction to the place with medicines for several days.
Deinde cura ipsum curatione apostematum.	Then care for it by treating pustules.
Et haec quidem Vena quandoque habet ramos multos, praecipue quando apparet in iunctura pedis, aut in pede ipso: et accidunt ei orificia multa, et egreditur ex omni orificio ramus.	And this vein sometimes has many branches, especially when it appears at the junction of the foot or in the foot itself: and openings occur many times, and a branch emerges from every opening.
Cura ergo ipsam, sicut diximus in diuisione, et cum eo quod praemissum est.	So cure it as we said in the division, and along with what was previously mentioned.
¶ De sectione super Vermes generatos sub cute, et dicitur Aegritudo bouina.	Chapter on cutting off worms generated under the skin, and is called Bovine Distress.
Caput XCIIII.	Book 94.
Haec Aegritudo nominatur in quadam terra apud nos Aegritudo bouina: propterea, quia multotiens accidit bouibus, et est uermis paruus unus, qui nascitur inter cutem et carnem.	This Distress is called Bovine Distress in a certain land among us, because it often happens to oxen, and there is one small worm that is born between the skin and flesh.
Et uadit in corpore toto, ascendendo et descendendo: et ostenditur sensui apud ambulationem eius de membro ad membrum, donec disrumpit ubicumque disrumpit in cute locum, et egreditur.	And it moves through the entire body, ascending and descending: and is shown to the sense by its walking from member to member, until it bursts wherever it bursts through the skin at a place, and emerges.
Et generatio eius est ex putredine quorundam humorum.	And its generation is from the putrefaction of certain humors.
Sicut accidunt uermes et serpentes, id est, lumbrici, et ascarides in uentre.	Just as worms and serpents, that is, lice and ascarids, occur in the belly.
Et timetur ex malicia eius.	And beware of his wickedness.
Quia quando ipse uadit in corpore, et eleuatur ad caput, et peruenit ad locum: tunc fortasse aperit in eo, et egreditur, et destruit oculum: et accidit illud multotiens.	Because when he goes into the body and is elevated to the head and reaches a place; then perhaps he opens up in it, and emerges, and destroys the eye: and that happens many times.
Cum ergo uis curare eum, et extrahere ipsum, tunc non fit illud nisi apud ambulationem eius, et apparitionem ipsius sensui.	So when you wish to cure him and extract it, then that is not done except by his movement and appearance to the sense.
Oportet ergo, ut stringas quod est supra eum, et quod est sub eo cum ligamento constrictione forti.	Therefore, you must tighten what is above him, and what is below him with a strong binding ligament.
Deinde seca super ipsum, et extrahe eum.	Then cut above him, and extract him.
Quod si profundatur in carne, et non inuenis ipsum: tunc pone super locum cauterium cum igne, donec moriatur.	And if it penetrates into the flesh and you do not find it: then place a cautery with fire above the spot until it dies.
Et maius quod timetur, est corruptio eius, qua corrumpit oculum, sicut diximus.	And even greater than that which is to be feared, is its corruption, by which it corrupts the eye, as we said.
Si autem uides eum iam peruenisse in capite prope oculum, tunc stringe sub eo supercilium strictura bona.	But if you see him having reached the head near the eye, then bind the eyebrow above it with a good tightening.
Deinde seca super ipsum, et extrahe eum.	Then cut above him, and extract him.
Et oportet ut utatur infirmus mundificatione sui corporis, cum medicinis soluentibus humores putridos malos.	And it is necessary for the patient to use a purification of his body with medicines that dissolve bad, putrid humors.
Et caueat sibi a cibis generantibus putrefactionem.	And beware of foods that cause putrefaction.
¶ De sectione super aegritudinem Nakir.	About the section for Nakir's sickness.
Caput XCV.	Head 95.
Haec aegritudo nominatur in terra nostra Nakir: et est dolor qui accidit in quibusdam membris: deinde permutatur de membro ad membrum.	This sickness is called Nakir on our earth, and it is a pain that occurs in certain members, then changes from member to member.
Et ego quidem iam uidi ipsum, secundum quod narro tibi.	And I myself have already seen him, according to what I tell you.
Vocatus sum ad mulierem infirmam in quibusdam uillis.	I was called to a sick woman in some villages.
Et detexit brachium suum, et uidi inflationem paruam in uena funis brachii.	And she showed me her arm and I saw a small swelling in the vein of the arm.
Et postquam remansi hora una, uidi unam inflationem incedere cum focili, sicut incedit uermis, ascendendo ad humerum eius uelocius quam esse potest: ut sit sicut argentum uiuum, quando currit de loco ad locum.	And after I stayed for one hour, I saw one swelling walking with a pustule, like a worm, ascending to her shoulder faster than it can be, so that it is like quicksilver when it runs from place to place.
Recessit ergo dolor ex illo loco, et fixus est in humero.	Therefore the pain departed from that place and was fixed on the shoulder.
Deinde sedi hora una, et cucurrit in reliquum corpus, donec perueniret in brachium aliud.	Then one hour passed and it ran through the rest of the body until it reached another arm.
Deinde narrauit mihi, quia reuoluebatur in toto corpore suo, secundum quod uidi.	Then he told me that his whole body was revolving according to what I saw.
Miratus sum ergo de uelocitate permutationis eius de membro ad membrum.	I therefore gazed in amazement at the speed of its change from member to member.
Et ego quidem ante illud non uideram hanc aegritudinem oculis meis taliter secundum hunc modum.	And I myself had not seen this illness with my own eyes in such a manner before that.
Verumtamen uidi multos, qui inueniunt dolorem permutari de membro ad membrum: et non uidi ipsum oculis, sicut uidi eum in muliere.	But I have seen many others who find pain being transferred from member to member; and I did not see him with my own eyes as I saw him in the woman.
Et ego non cogito illud esse, nisi quod est propterea, quod mulier fuit ex illis qui sunt ex uillis sicci corporis detectarum uenarum: hinc ergo apparet sensui illa uentositas permutata.	And I do not think it is otherwise, except that the woman was one of those who are found to be from dry bodies detected through veins; therefore this apparent windiness appears to sense as having been changed.
Et est necesse, ut non appareant secundum hanc rationem in illis qui sunt deliciosi, et corporibus humidis, occultarum uenarum.	And it is necessary that they do not appear according to this reason in those who are luxurious and have bodies that are moist with hidden veins.
Cum ergo uis curationem eius, et sentit patiens illud dolorem: tunc si est apparens tibi oculo, sicut diximus, tunc stringe supra ipsum, et sub ipso uelociter: et seca supra ipsum, donec egrediatur illa uentositas coartata: et cauteriza locum.	When therefore you wish to cure him and the patient feels that pain: then if it appears to your eye as we said, then tie above him quickly and below him quickly: and cut above him until that windiness is choked out: and cauterize the place.
Si autem non uides ipsum oculis tuis: tunc cura ipsum cum excussione corporis, et cum eo quod expellit uentositates, et carminat eas cum pillulis foetidis, et pillulis de serapino, et similibus.	But if you do not see it with your own eyes: then cure him by excision of the body and with that which drives out windiness, and purge them with pungent pills and pills of asarum and similar things.
¶ De extractione Sagittarum.	Of the Extraction of Arrows.
Caput XCVI.	Chapter 96.
Sagittae diuersificantur secundum species suas, et secundum loca in quibus cadunt ex corpore.	Arrows are differentiated according to their own kinds and according to the places where they fall from the body.
Earum uero diuersitas est: quoniam ex eis sunt quae habent cuspides magnos, et paruos: et concauae, et surdae.	And their variety is this: because some of them have large points and small ones: and concave and convex ones.
Et ex eis sunt quae habent tres angulos.	And among them are those that have three angles.
Et ex eis quibus sunt linguae.	And among them are tongues.
Et ex eis quibus sunt astellae.	And among them are stars.
Illae uero quae sunt secundum membra in quibus cadunt, est secundum duos modos.	However, those that fall according to limbs are two ways.
Aut enim membra sunt ex membris principalibus concauis, sicut cerebrum, et cor, et epar, et pulmo, et renes, et intestina, et uesica, et eis similia.	For either limbs are from primary concave members, such as the brain, and heart, and liver, and lung, and kidneys, and intestines, and bladder, and like things.
Quando ergo cadit in aliquo horum membrorum, et apparent tibi signa mortis, quae ego narro tibi post, tunc oportet ut deuites extractionem illius sagittae ex eis, nam mors consequitur illum in quo est, in pluribus dispositionibus.	So when it falls into one of these limbs and signs of death appear to you, which I will tell you after, then it is necessary to remove the arrow from them, for death follows that in which it is, in many dispositions.
Et quando non apparent tibi ista signa mala, et sagitta non est absconsa in profunditate membri, tunc extrahe ipsam, et cura uulnus.	And when these bad signs do not appear to you, and the arrow is not hidden in the depth of a member, then remove it and care for the wound.
Ex signis enim cerebri quando cadit in eo sagitta, et penetrat os, et egreditur siphac quod est super cerebrum, est: quoniam accidunt ex illo soda uehemens, et scotomia, et uertigo, et rubedo in oculis, et inflatio, et rubedo linguae, et spasmus, et permixtio intellectus, et uomitus cholerae.	From the signs of the brain when an arrow falls into it and penetrates to the skull and exits above the brain, there are: a swelling or inflammation, blindness, vertigo, redness in the eyes, puffing up, redness of the tongue, spasms, and confusion of intellect, and vomiting with cholera.
Et fortasse egreditur sanguis ex naribus, aut auribus.	And perhaps blood will exit through the nose or ears.
Et fortasse abscinditur sermo, et destruitur uox.	And perhaps speech is cut off, and the voice is destroyed.
Et egreditur ex loco uulneris humiditas alba similis pulti.	And a white liquid similar to pus exits from the wound location.
Et exit ex eo simile aquositati carnis.	And it exits like a fluid of flesh.
Si ergo apparent tibi ista signa, tunc abstine a curatione, et extrahe sagittam si non egreditur.	If then these signs appear to you, then refrain from treatment and remove the arrow if it does not exit.
Signa autem sagittae quando cadit in corde, sunt: quod ipsa est prope mammillam sinistram: et sentit cum ea quasi ipsa sit fixa in re dura, non in re uacua.	The signs of the arrow when it falls into the heart are: that it is near the left breast; and one feels with it as if it were fixed in a hard substance, not in an empty space.
Et fortasse sagittae est motus similis motui pulsus: et currit ex uulnere sanguis niger.	And perhaps the arrow's motion is similar to the pulse's motion: and blood flows black from the wound.
Et sequitur illud frigus extremitatum, et sudor frigidus, et syncopis.	And it follows coldness of extremities, and cold sweat, and congestion.
Scias ergo, quod mors descendit procul dubio.	You should therefore know that death certainly approaches.
Et signum sagittae quando uulnerat pulmonem, est exitus sanguinis spumosi ex uulnere: et uasa quae sequuntur collum, apostematur, et mutatur color infirmi.	And the sign of an arrow wound that wounds the lung is when bloody frothy discharge flows from the wound. And the veins which follow the neck become inflamed and change the complexion of the patient.
Et expirat spiritum magnum, altum: et quaerit attractionem aeris frigidi.	And he breathes out a great, high-sounding sigh: and seeks to draw in cold air.
Quod si cadat sagitta in uelamen, quod est in pectore: tunc est prope costas paruas: et fit anhelitus magnus cum dolore uehementi, cum suspirio: et mouentur omnia membra humerorum.	For if the arrow falls into the vellum that is in the chest: then it is near to small ribs: and a great panting occurs with severe pain, with sighing: and all the limbs of the shoulders are moved.
Et si cadat sagitta in stomachum, tunc fortasse egreditur ex uulnere ex cibo aliquid indigestum.	And if the arrow falls into the stomach, then perhaps something undigested from food will come out of the wound.
Et si cadit sagitta in Ventrem, et figitur in eo: egreditur aliquid stercoris ex uulnere, aut zirbum, aut intestinum quod iam disruptum est.	And if the arrow falls into the belly and sticks in it: something of dung will come out of the wound, or pus, or an intestine that is already broken.
Non est ergo spes in curatione eius, neque in extractione sagittae.	Therefore there is no hope for his cure, nor for extracting the arrow.
Quod si sagitta cadat in Vesicam, et egrediatur urina: et procedit ex ea aliquid ad exteriora, et fortior sit dolor super infirmum: tunc scias, quia est mortale.	For if the arrow falls into the bladder and urine flows out: and something proceeds from it to the outside, and the pain is much greater over the patient: then you should know that it is mortal.
Reliqua autem membra, sicut facies, et collum, et guttur, et spatula, et adiutorium, et spondiles dorsi, et furcula, et coxa, et crus, et eis similia ex membris saluantur secundum plures dispositiones: quando non inuenit sagitta arteriam, aut neruum: et non est sagitta uenenosa.	The remaining limbs, such as the face, neck, throat, palate, and shoulder-girdle, and similar parts of the members, are saluted according to many dispositions when the arrow does not find an artery or nerve, and the arrow is not poisonous.
Et ego narro tibi quod uidi de esse harum sagittarum, ut significes per illud super curationem tuam.	And I tell you what I have seen to be of these arrows, so that you may signify through it above your own cure.
Quod est, quia cuidam uiro cecidit sagitta in lachrymali oculi eius, in radice nasi.	Which is this: for to a certain man an arrow fell into the tear duct of his eye, at the root of his nose.
Extraxi ergo eam ipsi ex parte altera, sub adipe auris eius: et sanatus est, et non accidit ei in oculo eius nocumentum.	So I extracted it from the other side, under the fat of his ear; and he was healed, and no harm came to his eye.
Et extraxi sagittam aliam Iudaeo, quae cecidit ei in adipe oculi sui sub palpebra inferiori: et sagitta iam occultata erat, et non consecutus sum ex ea nisi extremitatem paruam eius, cum qua adhaeret in ligno suo: et erat sagitta magna ex sagittis arcuum Turcorum, cum ferro leni, in qua non sunt aures.	And I extracted another arrow from the Jew, which had fallen upon his eyelid under the lower eyelid; and the arrow was already hidden, and I could not obtain more than its small tip with which it adhered to the wood: and it was a large arrow of the Turkish bows, with a soft iron point, without ears.
Sanatus est ergo Iudaeus, et non accidit in oculo eius accidens malum.	The Jew was therefore healed, and the evil occurrence did not happen to his eye.
Et extraxi sagittam aliam ex gutture Christiani.	And I extracted another arrow from the throat of a Christian.
Et erat sagitta arabica, et est illa cui sunt aures.	And it was an Arab arrow, and it is that one which has ears.
Secui ergo super ipsam inter duas guidegi: et iam submersa erat in gutture eius.	I then fastened a cloth over her between two strips of linen: and now she had already sunk into his throat.
Subtiliatus sum ergo cum ea, donec extraxi eam: et sanatus est Christianus.	I therefore carefully pulled on it until I extracted it: and the Christian was healed.
Et extraxi sagittam aliam uiro quae ceciderat in uentre eius: et cogitauimus, quia moreretur ex ea.	And I extracted another arrow from a man which had fallen into his belly: and we thought that he would die from it.
Postquam ergo praeterierunt ei triginta dies, et non mutatum est super eum aliquid ex dispositionibus eius, secui super sagittam: et ingeniaui super eam, et extraxi eam: et sanatus est, et non accidit ei accidens malum.	Afterwards, then, thirty days had passed over him and nothing in his condition had changed, I covered the arrow with a cloth; and I pulled on it, and extracted it: and he was healed, and no evil occurrence happened to him.
Et uidi uirum cui cecidit sagitta in dorso eius, et consolidatum est uulnus super eam.	And I saw a man upon whom an arrow had fallen on his back, and the wound was set over it.
Postquam ergo fuit post septem annos, exiuit sagitta in radice coxae eius.	Afterwards, then, seven years had passed, the arrow came out through the root of his hip.
Et uidi mulierem cui cecidit in uentre suo sagitta, et consolidatum est uulnus super eam, et remansit sagitta intra ipsam: et non mutata est ex dispositionibus eius aliqua, et mulier non inuenit ei nocumentum in aliqua ex operationibus suis naturalibus.	And I saw a woman upon whom an arrow had fallen into her womb, and the wound was set over it, and the arrow remained within her: and nothing in her condition changed, and the woman did not find any harm from her natural bodily functions.
Et uidi uirum alium, cui cecidit sagitta in facie sua: et consolidatum est uulnus, et remansit, non inueniens ei multum dolorem: et similia istis multa.	And I saw another man upon whom an arrow had fallen on his face: and the wound was set, and remained, not finding much pain for him: and similar things to these many.
Et extraxi sagittam uiro ex principibus Regis, quae ceciderat ei in medio nasi sui, et iam declinauerat ad partem dextram parumper: et occultata erat sagitta tota.	And I extracted an arrow from the king's most trusted servants, which had fallen into his nose and was now leaning slightly to the right side; and the arrow was entirely hidden.
Vocatus sum ergo ad curationem eius post casum sagittae usque ad tres dies.	I was called therefore to cure him after the fall of the arrow for three days.
Inueni ergo uulnus sagittae strictum ualde.	I found then the wound from the arrow to be very tightly constricted.
Inquisiui ergo eam cum tenta subtili, et non sensi eam: et ipse quidem inueniebat punctionem et dolorem sub aure sua ex parte dextra.	I then probed it with a fine probe and did not find it; but he himself found the puncture and pain under his ear on the right side.
Speraui ergo, quod erat illa punctio ex extremitate sagittae.	I therefore expected that the puncture was from the end of the arrow.
Emplastraui ergo locum cum emplastro in quo erat uirtus attractiua, et digestiua, confidens apud me, quod apostemaretur locus, et appareret mihi signum sagittae, ut secarem super eam: et non accidit in loco accidens significans quod sagitta consecuta sit locum.	I then applied a poultice to the place with a poultice that had attractive and digestive power, trusting in myself, since I believed the spot would suppurate and a sign of the arrow would appear for me to cut above it: and no accident occurred in the place indicating that the arrow had reached the location.
Assiduaui ergo cum emplastro super eum diebus multis: et non accidit accidens, et consolidatum est uulnus interim: et remansit infirmus de extractione eius spacio dierum, donec sensit sagittam die quodam intra nasum suum.	I therefore applied the poultice to him daily for many days: and no accident occurred, and the wound was consolidated in the meantime: and he remained weak from its removal until he felt the arrow on a certain day inside his nose.
Et narrauit mihi illud.	And he told me that.
Posui ergo super illud uulnus medicinam acutam, corrosiuam diebus multis, donec apertum est: et cum tenta tentaui ipsum, et sensi extremitatem sagittae subtilem quae adhaeret in ligno.	I then applied sharp and corroding medicine to that wound daily for many days, until it was opened: and when I probed him with a probe, I felt the subtle end of the arrow which adhered to the wood.
Deinde addidi in apertione uulneris per illam medicinam acutam, donec apparuit nobis uisibiliter extremitas sagittae: et praeteriit mihi cum eo spacium temporis circiter quatuor menses.	Then I added to the opening of the wound through that sharp medicine until the end of the arrow appeared visibly before us; and after it had passed with him, a period of about four months elapsed.
Deinde postquam amplificatum est uulnus, et possible fuit mihi intromittere forcipes in ipsam, et mouere ipsam, et non obediuit ad exitum: tunc non cessaui subtiliare, et ingeniare super eam cum modis ingeniorum, donec coepi super eam die quodam cum forcipibus decenter factis, secundum quod ueniet forma eorum in fine capituli, donec extraxi eam.	Then after the wound had been enlarged and it was possible for me to insert forceps into it, and move it, but it did not yield to exit: then I did not cease to file and shape it above it with various techniques, until on a certain day I began to work on it with well-made forceps, according to the form they would take at the end of the chapter, until I extracted it.
Deinde restauraui uulnus.	Then I restored the wound.
Et medici quidem iudicant, quod cartilago nasi non restauratur.	And indeed doctors judge that the nasal cartilage is not restored.
Restauraui ergo ipsam, et consolidatum est uulnus, et sanatus est infirmas sanitate integra: nec nocuit ei aliquid omnino.	I therefore restored it and the wound was consolidated and the patient was healed with a complete and unbroken recovery; nor did anything harm him at all.
Et ego narro tibi qualitatem extractionis quarundam sagittarum: ut ponas illud regulam et significationem super illud quod non dixi.	And I will tell you the quality of extracting certain arrows: so that you put it to the rule and significance over what I did not say.
Quoniam partes huius artis et distinctiones earum non comprehenduntur cum narratione: neque comprehendit illud liber, et artifex prudens comparat cum pauco super multum: et cum eo quod est paesens, super illud quod est absens: et inuenit operationem nouam, et instrumentum nouum apud descensus rerum extranearum huius artis quando accidunt.	Because the parts of this art and their distinctions are not comprehended with narration: nor does that book comprehend it; a wise craftsman compares what is little to much: and with what is present, over what is absent: and he finds a new operation and a new instrument among external events of this art when they happen.
Dico ergo, quod sagittae non egrediuntur ex membris quibus sunt fixae, nisi secundum duos modos.	I say, that arrows do not emerge from the members to which they are fixed, unless according to two modes.
Aut per attractionem ex loco ex quo intrauit.	Or through attraction from the place from which it entered.
Aut contrario partis alterius.	Or contrary to the other part of the opposite side.
Et illa quae egreditur unde intrauit, aut est sagitta procedens in loco carnoso: et attrahitur, et egreditur.	And that which emerges from where it entered is either an arrow proceeding into a fleshy place and is attracted and emerges.
Quod si non obedit ad exitum ex hora in qua cadit: tunc oportet ut dimittas ipsam aliquot diebus, donec putrefiat caro quae est in circumitu eius: et alleuietur attractio eius, et eius egressio.	What if it does not obey the exit from the hour when it falls: then you must let it go for some days until the flesh that is around it putrefies: and its attraction and emergence will be alleviated.
Et similiter si figitur in osse, et non obedit tibi ad exitum, tunc dimitte ipsam etiam aliquot diebus: et itera eam cum attractione et motione omni die, donec egreditur.	And similarly if it is fixed in bone and does not obey you to exit, then let it go again for some days: and bring it back with attraction and motion every day until it emerges.
Quod si non obedit tibi ad exitum post dies, tunc oportet ut perfores in circumitu sagittae in ipso osse ab omni parte cum terebro subtili, donec amplificentur sagittae.	What if it does not obey you to exit after days, then it is necessary that you pierce the surrounding area of the arrow in the bone from all sides with a fine chisel until the arrows are widened.
Deinde attrahe eam, et extrahe ipsam.	Then attract it and pull it out.
Si autem sagitta est fixa in capitis osse, et iam processit in uno uentrium cerebri, et apparent ex infirmo quaedam illorum accidentium quae dixi: tunc abstine ab attractione sagittae, et dimitte eam, donec aequetur esse eius post dies.	If however the arrow is fixed in the bone of the skull and has already progressed into one of the ventricles of the brain, and certain of those symptoms which I mentioned appear from the patient: then abstain from attracting the arrow and let it go until its state is equal after days.
Nam si sagitta peruenit ad sifach, tunc mors non prolongatur ei.	If an arrow reaches the sifach, then death is not prolonged for him.
Et si sagitta non est fixa, nisi in corpore ossis tantum, et non penetrat usque ad sifach: et remanet infirmus aliquot diebus, et non accidit ei ex illis accidentibus aliquid: tunc ingenia in attractione sagittae et extractione eius.	And if the arrow is not fixed except in the body of a bone only and does not penetrate to the sifach, and he remains infirm for several days, and nothing happens to him from those accidents: then one must attend to drawing out the arrow and extracting it.
Si autem est fixa ualde, et non obedit tibi ad attractionem: tunc administra terebella in circumitu sagittae, sicut narraui tibl: deinde cura locum, donec sanetur.	But if it is firmly fixed and does not yield to your attempts at extraction: then apply terebinthine around the arrow, as I have told you: afterwards take care of the wound until it heals.
Si autem Sagitta iam absconsa est in loco corporis, et occultatur et absconditur a sensu: tunc inquire eam cum tenta.	But if the arrow is already concealed in the body and hidden from sense: then seek it out with probes.
Si autem sentis eam, tunc attrahe eam cum quibusdam instrumentis quae conueniunt attractioni eius.	But if you feel it, then draw it out with some instruments that are suitable for its extraction.
Si autem non potes super eam, propter constrictionem uulneris, et propter longitudinem sagittae in profundo: et non est illic os, neque neruus, neque uena: tunc finde super eam, donec amplificetur uulnus, et sit possibile extrahere sagittam.	But if you are unable to draw it out because of the constriction of the wound and the length of the arrow in deep tissue, and there is no bone, nerve, or vein: then find a way to enlarge the wound until it becomes possible to extract the arrow.
Quod si sunt ei aures quibus teneatur, tunc libera carnem fixam in eis ab omni parte, omni ingenio quo potes illud, et ingenia, si non potest super euasionem carnis in fractura aurium, et contorsione earum, donec euadat.	But if there are ears which hold it fast: then free the fixed flesh from all parts, by any means you can, and use instruments, if it cannot be removed by cutting through the ears, or by their fracture and twisting, until it comes out.
Et tu quando administras extractionem Sagittae, in quocumque loco est, tunc utere contorsione manus tuae, cum forficibus ad partes omnes, donec facias eam euadere: et subtilia ultima subtilitate, ut non frangatur Sagita, et fiat difficilis tibi attractio eius, et ipsius extractio.	And when you are administering the extraction of the arrow, wherever it is, then use the twisting motion of your hand, with forceps on all parts, until you make it come out: and with the finest subtlety, so that the arrow does not break and its extraction becomes difficult for you.
Quod si non potes super eam ex hora una, tunc dimitte eam diebus aliquot, donec putrefiant quae sunt in circumitu eius.	But if you are unable to extract it at one hour, then leave it for several days, until the things that surround it have putrified.
Deinde itera eam: alleuietur enim tuncia Si uero contrarietatem tibi facit fluxus sanguinis, tunc administra quod diximus ex curatione in capitulo suo: et custodi uirtutem tuam ab incisione uenae, aut nerui, aut chordae.	Then retry to extract it: for it will be eased. If however, opposition is made by a flow of blood, then administer what we said in its own chapter on cure: and take care to preserve your strength from cutting the vein, or nerve, or cord.
Et administra ingenium omni modo quo tibi possibile est euasionis Sagittae: et sit illud cum facilitate, et tranquillitate, uel tarditate, et firmitate, sicut narraui tibi.	And administer the skill of surgery in every way possible to you, with ease, and calmness, or slowness, and firmness, just as I told you.
Et oportet, ut facias cum trahis Sagittam, ut infirmus sit secundum figuram, secundum quam fuit apud casum Sagittae in ipso.	And it is necessary that you do so when pulling out the arrow, making the patient conform to the shape as he was in the case of being shot with the arrow itself.
Quoniam est magis iuuatiuum.	Because it is more beneficial.
Si autem non est tibi possibile illud, tunc administra quod tibi est possibile ex figuris.	But if this is not possible for you, then administer what is possible to you from the shapes.
Sagitta autem quae egreditur ex contrario partis alterius, aut iam procedit ex ea aliquid ad exteriora: aut facit gibbositatem extremitas Sagittae per sensum ex superiore parte cutis propinquae, et uides eam eminentem: seca ergo super eam, et sit sectio secundum quantitatem quod capiant in ea forcipes.	But the arrow that comes out from the opposite part of another, or has already proceeded something to the exterior from it; or makes a swelling at the tip of the arrow by sensation from above on the neighboring skin, and you see it protruding: therefore cut above it, and let the incision be according to the size that forceps can take in it.
Deinde attrahe eam: ipsa namque fit facilis ad exitum.	Then draw it out: for it is easy to come out by itself.
Si uero retinetur in osse, tunc torque manum tuam secundum rotunditatem, donec imprimat Sagitta in osse, et amplificet sibiipsi: deinde trahe ipsam.	But if it is retained in the bone, then twist your hand according to the roundness, until the arrow stamps itself in the bone and makes room for itself: then draw it out.
Et si non: dimitte eam diebus aliquot: deinde itera eam, donec egrediatur.	And if not: let it be for a few days: then try to pull it out until it comes out.
Quod si lignum Sagittae est in ea, tunc impelle ipsam cum eo.	Which if the wood of the arrow is stuck in it, then push it with that.
Si autem cecidit lignum, et uis administrare impulsionem: tunc intromitte ad eam instrumentum concauum, ut ingrediatur concauitas eius in caudam Sagittae: deinde impelle eam cum ipso.	But if the wood has fallen and you wish to administer a push: then introduce into it an instrument with a concave shape, so that its concavity enters the tail of the arrow: then push it with it.
Si autem Sagita est concaua, tunc impelle eam cum instrumento intrante in ipsam.	But if the arrow is hollow, then push it with the instrument entering into it.
Sagitta enim alleuiatur per illud.	For the arrow is eased by that.
Quod si Sagitta est toxicata, tunc oportet, ut concaues carnem totam, in qua est uenenum: si est tibi possibile illud.	Which if the arrow is poisoned, then it is necessary to cut open all the flesh where the venom is, if that is possible for you.
Deinde cura eam cum eo quod conuenit ad illud.	Then take care of it with what is fitting for that.
Quod si Sagitta est cadens in pectore, aut in uentre, aut in uesica, aut in latere: et est propinqua ex eo quod tangis cum tenta, et possibile est tibi secare super eam: tunc seca, et caue ab incisione uenae, aut nerui, et extrahe eam.	If an arrow is fallen in the chest, or in the belly, or in the bladder, or in the side: and it is near what you touch with your hand, and it is possible for you to cut above it: then cut, and beware of cutting into a vein, or nerve, and take it out.
Deinde sue uulnus, si uides, et cura illud, donec sanetur.	Then wash the wound, if you see one, and care for it until it heals.
Et haec est forma Forcipum, quibus extrahuntur Sagittae.	And this is the form of forceps with which arrowheads are extracted.
Sint extremitates similes rostro auis, quae factae sunt sicut ferra: quando capiunt super Sagittam, non dimittunt eam.	Let the ends be like a bird's beak, which were made of iron: when they take hold above an arrow, they do not let go of it.
Et fiunt ex eis species multae, magnae, et paruae, et mediae, secundum quantitatem magnitudinis Sagittae, et paruitatis eius, et amplitudinis uulneris, et constrictionis eius.	And many kinds are made from these, great and small and middle-sized, according to the quantity of the arrow's magnitude, its smallness, and the width of the wound and its constricting nature.
Forma Impellentis concaui.	The form of a concave scoop.
Et forma Impellentis surdi.	And the form of a deaf scoop.
Hoc est surdae extremitatis sicut Radius, ut alleuietur introitus eius in sagittam concauam, et impellatur cum eo.	This is the shape of a deaf end like a radius, so that its entrance may be eased into an arrowhead and pushed with it.
Huius extremitas impellentis concauae est concaua sicut penna auis: ut alleuietur introitus sagittae in ipsam et impulsio eius.	The end of the concave scoop is concave like a bird's feather: so that the entrance of the arrow may be eased into it and its movement guided.

Verumtamen non oportet, ut sit phlebotomus acutae extremitatis, sicut reliqui phlebotomi, imo sit latae extremitatis.	However, it should not be a sharp-edged bleeding instrument, like the others, but rather one with a broad edge.
Et phlebotoma eam secundum transuersionem: quoniam os est propinquum: et fortasse in eo frangetur phlebotomus quando est subtilis.	And let it bleed according to the flow, since it is nearby; and perhaps the bleeding instrument may break when it is thin.
¶ De phlebotomia Venarum in duobus Lachrymalibus.	On bloodletting of the veins in two tear ducts.
Iuuamentum autem duarum Venarum quae sunt in duobus Lachrymalibus duorum oculorum, est ad oculum ex scabie et rubedine: et sebel in oculo, et aegritudinibus faciei.	The application of two veins which are in the tear ducts of two eyes, is for an eye with inflammation and redness; and swelling in the eye, and afflictions of the face.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae earum est, ut stringat infirmus collum suum cum uitta.	And the quality of bloodletting from them is that the patient should tighten his neck with a cord.
Deinde phlebotoma eas: et tu sis stans super caput eius.	Then perform the bloodletting, and stand above his head.
Et fiat phlebotomia secundum transuersum ad longitudinem parum, cum phlebotomo paruo, lato parumper, nam in loco non est caro.	And let the bloodletting be done across to the length a little bit, with a small, wide instrument, for there is no flesh in that place.
Si enim phlebotomus est subtilis extremitatis, fortasse frangitur.	For if the bloodletting instrument is delicate at the tip, it may break.
Deinde fac currere ex sanguine quantum est tibi necesse.	Then let the blood flow from the wound as much as you need.
Et pone super eas cotum, et stringe eas nocte una, et solue eas.	And put a linen cloth on top of them and bind them tightly at night for one day, and then release them.
¶ De phlebotomia uenarum Nasi.	On bloodletting of the nose veins.
Venae autem Nasi phlebotomia, est conferens ad febrem acutam, et sodam uehementem, et aegritudines faciei, sicut hemigraneam, et rubedinem quae accidit in facie: praecipue quando est antiqua.	The veins of the nose are for bloodletting when one has an acute fever, and intense swelling, and afflictions of the face, such as headache and redness that occurs on the face: especially when it is old.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut stringat infirmus collum suum.	And the quality of bloodletting from them is that the patient should tighten his neck with a cord.
Deinde tene nasum eius manu tua sinistra, et accipe phlebotomum subtilem, longum: et fige eum in medio leporis ipsius, inter illud quod distinguit nasum secundum rectitudinem.	Then hold the nose of that person with your left hand and take a slender, long bloodletting instrument, and insert it into the middle of his septum, between what separates the nose according to its straightness.
Quoniam uena non apparet sensui illic, et quia sanguis incipit fluere statim.	Because the vein is not apparent to the sense there, and because the blood begins to flow immediately.
Et oportet, ut ultimes manum tuam cum phlebotomo parumper: et facias currere ex sanguine secundum necessitatem tuam.	And it is necessary that you hold your hand with the bloodletting instrument a little while and let the blood flow as much as you need.
Deinde liga ipsam nocte una.	Then bind it tightly at night for one day.
Ipsa enim restauratur uelociter.	For that very thing is restored quickly.
¶ De phlebotomia uenarum Guidegi.	Here is the translation:
Duarum uero Guidegi phlebotomiae iuuamentum, est ad constrictionem anhelitus, et incaeptionem leprae, et aegritudines melancholicas, et impetiginem et ulcera mala, et corrodentibus, id est, herpetibus estiomenis.	The benefit of the two Guides' phlebotomy is for constriction of breath, and onset of leprosy, and melancholic diseases, and impetigo and bad ulcers, and corroding sores, that is, herpes-like lesions.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae earum est ut stringat infirmus sub utrisque in collo suo cum ligamento: et stet artifex super caput infirmi, et infirmus sit sedens super sedem.	And the quality of their phlebotomy is that it causes the patient to be bound beneath both of them on his neck with a bandage: and let the surgeon stand above the head of the patient, and let the patient sit upon a seat.
Deinde phlebotoma uenam ad longitudinem phlebotomia ampla parumper.	Then make the incision on the vein to the length of the wide phlebotomy for a little while.
Deinde extrahe ex sanguine quantitatem temperatam, aut secundum illud quod uides ex necessitate quae est ad illud.	Then take out from the blood a measured quantity, or according to what you see as necessary for that purpose.
Deinde fac similiter de uena alia.	Then do the same thing to another vein.
Postea solue ligamentum, et stringe duas uenas strictura media: ut non praefocetur infirmus.	Afterwards untie the bandage and bind the two veins tightly with a middle constriction: so that the patient does not become overheated.
Et dimitte eam usque mane.	And let it be until morning.
Sanatur enim uulnus.	For the wound is healing.
¶ De phlebotomia uenarum Algeberich.	On the phlebotomy of veins by Albucasis.
Venae autem Algeberich phlebotomiae iuuamentum est: quia confert ad alcolam in ore, et corruptionem gingiuae: et ulcera mala: et fissuras labiorum, et ulcera mala, etiam quae sunt in naso, et in circumitu eius.	The veins of Algeberich's phlebotomy are beneficial because they promote a flow to the mouth, and corruption of the gum: and bad ulcers: and cracks in the lips, and bad ulcers also, which are in the nose, and around it.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae earum est, ut facias sedere infirmum coram te: et stringe collum eius cum uitta.	And the quality of their phlebotomy is that you make the patient sit before you: and bind his neck with a cord.
Deinde reuolue labium eius, et aspice ad duas uenas: quarum una est a dextera labii, et secunda a sinistra eius: et demonstratio utriusque est per nigredinem ambarum.	Then turn his lip back and look at the two veins: one of which is on the right side of the lip, and the second on the left side of it: and the indication of each is by the blackness of both.
Et illud uerum est: quia in circumitu earum sunt uenae minutae, nigrae.	And that is true: because around them are small, dark veins.
Incide ergo utramque incisione incidente.	Therefore cut both with a cutting incision.
Si autem dubitatio est super te, et non scis quae earum est: tunc intende ad incisionem maioris earum, et ipsarum manifestiorem.	But if there is doubt on you, and you do not know which one it is: then look to the larger of them, and the more obvious one.
Et similiter fac de duabus uenis quae sunt in labio superiore: et plurimum quidem currit consuetudo cum eo: et incide duas uenas quae sunt in labio inferiori.	And similarly do with the two veins that are on the upper lip: and a great custom indeed runs along with it: and cut open the two veins that are on the lower lip.
¶ De phlebotomia Venae sub lingua post Cephalicae phlebotomiam.	On vein lancing under the tongue after cephalic venesection.
Duarum uero Venarum quae sunt sub lingua phlebotomiae iuuamentum: est, quod phlebotomia Cephalicae est ad praefocationes quae sunt in gutture, et aegritudinem uuulae, et aegritudines oris.	The benefit of lancing the two veins that are under the tongue is this: that cephalic venesection is useful for preternatural constrictions in the throat, and affliction of the uvula, and afflictions of the mouth.
Et qualitas phlebotomandi eas est, ut sedeat infirmus inter manus tuas coram sole: et eleualinguam eius, et aspice sub lingua a latere eius uno uenam, et a latere eius alio uenam: et color utriusque decliuis ad nigredinem.	And the quality of lancing them is this: that you sit the patient between your hands in front of the sun; and lift up his tongue, and look beneath his tongue on one side a vein, and on the other side a vein: and the color of each declineth to blackness.
Phlebotoma ergo utramque: et custodi, ne ultimes manum tuam in phlebotomando eas.	Therefore lance both of them; and take care not to touch with your hand when lancing them.
Nam sub eius sunt arteriae, et fortasse accidet fluxus sanguinis ex illis arteriis.	For under these are arteries, and perhaps a flow of blood will occur from those arteries.
¶ De tribus Venis in cubito.	On the three veins on the elbow.
Venae autem tres quae phlebotomantur in cubito, sunt in quarum phlebotomia cucurrit consuetudo in omnibus hominibus.	The three veins which are lanced on the elbow, are those in which venesection is customary for all people.
Et phlebotomia earum fit secundum duos modos.	And venesection of these is done in two ways.
Aut pungendo cum phlebotomo myrtino lato: aut oliuari ad subtilitatem decliui: aut secando cum phlebotomo cultellari, et est Alnesil.	Either by pricking with a myrtle-wood lancet: or to incline towards subtlety with olive oil; or by cutting with a surgical knife, and this is called Alnesil.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form.
Sic Alnesil est, quod conuenit ad sectionem.	So Alnesil is what is suitable for cutting.
Et ex eis sunt species latae, et subtiles secundum amplitudinem uenarum et stricturam earum Forma phlebotomi myrtini sit lata, sicut uides.	And from these there are broad and subtle kinds according to the breadth of the veins and their constriction. The form of the myrtle lancet is broad, as you see.
Et conuenit ad aperiendas uenas concauas, plenas, procedentes, apparentes, grossas, et illas quae continent sanguinem grossum, turbidum.	And it is suitable for opening up concave veins that are full, proceeding, appearing, thick, and those which contain thick, turbid blood.
Et iste phlebotomus est minoris latitudinis, et subtilioris extreminatis.	And this bloodletting is of lesser width and subtler extremities.
Et conuenit ad phlebotomiam uenarum subtilium, quae continent sanguinem subtilem citrinum	And it is suitable for bloodletting from small veins that contain subtle, citrine blood.
¶ De phlebotomia Basilicae.	The Book of Bloodletting.
Basilicae autem quae est una harum trium uenarum phlebotomiae iuuamentum est.	But Basilica is one of the three veins that benefits from bloodletting.
Quia extrahit sanguinem ex aegritudinibus, quae sunt sub gutture et collo, ex eo quod sequitur pectus, et uentrem: et conuenit phlebotomatori cum phlebotomat eam, ut caueat, et sit super timorem ex ea nam sub ea est arteria.	Because it draws out blood from afflictions that are under the throat and neck, following the chest and belly. And it is suitable for a bloodletting physician to take caution with it, since there is an artery beneath it.
Si ergo errat, et addit in punctura phlebotomi, incidet illam arteriam, et accidet fluxus sanguinis.	So if he makes a mistake and adds to the incision of bloodletting, he will cut into that artery and there will be a flow of blood.
Quapropter oportet, ne phlebotomet eam cum phlebotomo pungente: imo sit secans cum Alnesil.	Therefore it is necessary for the bloodletting to be done not with a piercing instrument but rather with an Alnesil, that is, a cutting instrument.
Quod si non apparet Basilica apparitione manifesta, tunc oportet, ut alienes ipsam, et permuteris ad aliam, aut quaeras aliquem ramum eius: aut phlebotomes loco eius Funem brachii.	But if the Basilica does not appear with a clear manifestation, then it is necessary to find another one, or search for a branch of it, or perform bloodletting on the arm instead.
Ipsa enim est manifesta, et seca eam cum phlebotomo Anesil, sicut diximus.	For it itself is clear and should be cut with an Alnesil instrument, as we said.
Si autem uis phlebotomiam ipsius eiusdem, tunc oportet ante stricturam brachii, ut tangas locum, donec cognoscas locum pulsus.	But if you wish to perform bloodletting on it itself, then it is necessary to touch the place before the arm's constriction, until you know the place of the pulse.
Deinde signa super locum cum encaustro, postea brachium, et seca uenam sectione concaua cum phlebotomo Alnesil, sicut diximus.	Then mark the place with encaustic, afterwards the arm, and cut the vein with a concave incision using an Alnesil instrument, as we said.
Et caue ne cadat percussio per spacium a loco arteriae.	And beware lest the blow falls through the space to the location of the artery.
Et quando uides, cum tu stringis ligamen, inflationem in loco quem signasti cum encaustro, tunc illa inflatio est inflatio arteriae: deuita ergo eam.	And when you see that as you tighten the bandage, there is swelling at the place you marked with encaustic, then that swelling is the swelling of the artery: therefore avoid it.
Quod si uides sanguinem apud phlebotomiam salire, sicut urina pueri, et est sanguis subtilis, rubeus: tunc scias, quia est ex sanguine arteriae.	What if you see blood rising at the bloodletting, like a child's urine, and it is subtle, red blood: then you will know that it is from the artery's blood.
Tunc ergo propera, et pone digitum tuum super ipsum spacio longo, deinde aufer digitum tuum.	Then accordingly, hasten and place your finger on top of it over a long space, then remove your finger.
Si ergo abscinditur sanguis (multotiens namque abscinditur) tunc stringe brachium, et dimitte ipsum: et caueat infirmus a motione eius: et sit super timorem eius.	If then the blood is cut off (for it is often cut off) then bind the arm and let it be, and beware that the patient avoid movement of it: and let him be in fear of it.
Et non moueat ipsum diebus aliquot, donec sanetur.	And do not move it for several days until it heals.
Si autem non abscinditur sanguis, et uincit te: et non est tibi praesens in momento tuo medicina, tunc incide arteriam, si apparet tibi.	But if the blood is not cut off and overpowers you: and medicine is not present to you at the moment, then cut the artery if it appears to you.
Nam extremitates eius contrahuntur, et abscinditur sanguis.	For its extremities contract, and the blood is cut off.
Aut accipe corticem fistici, et finde eum: accipe medietatem unam, et stringe eam super locum uenae strictura decenti, cum ligamento et puluillis usque ad diem alium.	Or take the bark of a sycamore, and find it: take one middle part, and bind it over the tight place of the vein with a ligament and wool until another day.
Tunc si abscinditur sanguis, est bonum.	Then if the blood is cut off, it is good.
Et si non: tunc cura ipsum cum eo cuius praecessit rememoratio ex loco puluerum abscindentium fluxum sanguinis: et abscisio sanguinis eius non est difficilis in pluribus dispositionibus, propter locum paruum uulneris, et possibilitatem ligamenti ex brachio.	And if not: then treat it with the one whose previous account precedes from the place of powder used for stopping blood flow: and the cutting off of his blood is not difficult in many dispositions, because of the small wound's location and the possibility of a ligament from the arm.
¶ De phlebotomia uenae Fuscae.	Chapter on Bleeding the Black Vein.
Venae autem Fuscae phlebotomiae iuuamentum est, quod trahit sanguinem ex superiori parte capitis, et inferiore corporis: propterea, quia est composita ex ramo Basilicae, et ramo Cephalicae, sicut diximus.	The Black Vein is beneficial for phlebotomy because it draws blood from the upper part of the head and lower part of the body: therefore, since it is composed of a branch of the Basilic and a branch of the Cephalic, as we said.
Et conuenit phlebotomanti eam, ut sit super timorem ex phlebotomia eius, nam sub ea est neruus.	And it is fitting for the phlebotomist to approach it with caution, since a nerve is located beneath it.
Si ergo addit in punctura phlebotomi, et inuenit neruum, accidit in ea stupor, et difficilis fit sanatio eius, et fortasse non sanatur penitus.	If therefore the phlebotomist adds to the puncture and finds a nerve, it happens that there is numbness, and healing becomes difficult, and perhaps it does not heal at all.
Et iste neruus multotiens apparet sensui.	And this nerve often appears to the sense.
Si autem occultatur in quibusdam hominibus, et est subtilis, et non ostenditur: tunc oportet ut ponas phlebotomiam tuam qua eam phlebotomas, sectionem cum Alnesil, et deuita neruum cum fortitudine tua.	If however it is hidden in some people and is subtle, and does not appear: then you must put your bloodletting technique to use where you can remove the bloodletting, section with Alnesil, and extract the nerve with your own strength.
Quod si uena est inter duos neruos, tunc finde uenam in longitudine.	If a vein is between two nerves, then find the vein along its length.
¶ De uena Cephalica.	About the Cephalic Vein.
Phlebotomiae autem uenae Cephalicae iuuamentum est, quia attrahit sanguinem ex capite, et confert ad aegritudines oculorum.	The benefit of the cephalic veins in bloodletting is that they attract blood from the head and bring relief to eye diseases.
Et oportet in hac uena proprie, si uis, ut phlebotomes eam pungendo cum phlebotomo oliuari, aut cum phlebotomo myrtino: quoniam est saluior uenarum omnium, quoniam non est subea arteria, neque neruus.	And it is proper to make a small incision in this vein, if you wish, with an olive-wood phlebotomizer or a myrtle-wood one: because it is the most healthy of all veins, since there is no artery underneath nor nerve.
Verumtamen conuenit tibi apud phlebotomiam, ut deuites cum phlebotomo caput lacerti tantum, et quaeras locum leniorem: et non nocet ei, si non inuenitur cum percussione prima, ut iteretur super eam cum phlebotomia aliquotiens.	However, it is suitable for you to use a phlebotomy instrument at the wrist, just enough to open up the skin, and search for a softer spot: and it will not harm him if he does not yield immediately with the first percussion, but rather let it be done repeatedly with phlebotomy.
Verumtamen fortasse apostematur in quibusdam hominibus quando non phlebotomatur in percussione prima, sed non nocet ei illud apostema in aliquo.	However, perhaps an abscess may form in some people if it is not bloodletted immediately, but it will not harm him by that.
¶ De utilitate Phlebotomiae, et cautelis in ea obseruandis.	About the utility of Bloodletting and the cautions to be observed in it.
Qualitas autem Phlebotomiae, et accidentia eius ex ea, in cuius rectificatione oportet te cogitare.	The quality and accidents of bloodletting, and in whose correction you should reflect.
Primum ergo illius est de quo oportet ut scias, quod phlebotomia non administratur, nisi in conseruatione sanitatis, et perseuerantia eius, et cautela ab aduentu aegritudinum.	Firstly, you should know that bloodletting is not administered except for the preservation of health, and the perseverance of it, and caution against the advent of diseases.
Et ut fiat phlebotomia in una uenarum trium quae sunt in cubito, scilicet Cephalica, et Fusca, et Basilica.	And so that bloodletting is done on one of the three veins at the elbow, namely the Cephalic, the Fleshy, and the Basilic.
Et ut fiat phlebotomia in principio Veris super ieiunium, in uere, et aestate: et autumno, et hyeme post comestionem, quando apparent significationes repletionis.	And so that bloodletting is done at the beginning of spring after a fast, in truth and summer: and in autumn and winter after eating, when signs of repletion appear.
Et fiat phlebotomia in die primo, aut in tertio, postquam praeterierint de die tres horae.	And let a bloodletting be done on the first day, or on the third, after they have passed three hours.
Phlebotomia autem quae administratur in aegritudinibus, non habet horam determinatam: sed quando prouocat conuenientia et necessitas ad illud, in nocte, aut die, et in omni hora, et in omni tempore.	But bloodletting which is administered for illnesses does not have a fixed hour: rather, when necessity and suitability dictate it, it should be done at night or day, and at any hour and at any time.
Et non oportet, ut phlebotomentur pueri, donec ueniant super eos quatuordecim anni.	And it is not fitting that boys are bled until they have reached the age of fourteen years.
Neque phlebotometur mulier praegnans, nisi a mense quarto usque ad septimum.	Nor should a pregnant woman be bled except from the fourth month to the seventh.
Neque phlebotomentur senes, qui iam pertransierunt sexaginta annos.	Nor should old men who have passed sixty years be bled.
Cum ergo aliquis uult phlebotomari propter quemcumque modum sit: oportet, ut mundificet intestina sua ante phlebotomiam cum clisteri leni, si in eis est stercus multum retentum: ut non attrahant uenae apud phlebotomiam ex intestinis superfluitates putridas nocentes membris principalibus.	Therefore, when someone wants to be bled for any reason whatsoever, it is necessary that he cleanse his bowels beforehand with a gentle enema if there is much retained feces in them: so that the veins are not attracted at the time of bloodletting by superfluous putrid things from the intestines which are harmful to the principal members.
Neque phlebotometur patiens toctina, id est, satietatem nauseatiuam: neque crapulatus, neque euadens ab ebrietate, donec remoueatur illud ab eis.	Nor should a patient who is thirsty, that is, one who has satisfied their nausea; nor one who is drunk or recovering from drunkenness, until that is removed from them.
Neque infirmus cum hydropisi.	Nor should an invalid with dropsy.
Et caueatur phlebotomia iterum post colicam passionem, et uomitum, et fluxum uentris, et multiplicationem coitus, et laboris, et exercitii, et uigiliarum, et ieiunii, et omnis quod dissoluit uirtutem ex re corporea aut animali.	And bloodletting should be avoided again after the experience of colic, vomiting, and diarrhea, and after excessive copulation, labor, exercise, watchfulness, fasting, and all that dissipates the power from bodily or animal substance.
Deinde considera in subtilitate humorum ante illud, si sanguis est grossus cum cibis et potibus, et medicinis: si possibile est ei illud.	Then consider the subtlety of the humors beforehand, if the blood is thick due to food and drink and medicines: if it's possible for him.
Deinde introeat balneum, si non prohibet ipsum aliquid: aut exercitetur aliquo exercitio, ut subtilietur sanguis.	Then let him enter the bath, unless something prevents it: or let him exercise some kind of exercise to subtletize the blood.
Et pone phlebotomiam eius in pectore, circa tertiam diei, sicut diximus: et conare, ut euacuetur pectus eius illa die ex omnibus accidentibus animalibus malis: sicut angustia, et ira, et timor: et ex omnibus accidentibus corporeis, sicut labor, et poena, et superfluicoitus, et illis similia.	And let his bloodletting be done in the chest area, around the third day, as we said; and try to purge his chest that day of all animal evils: such as anxiety, anger, fear; and of all bodily evils: such as labor, punishment, superfluity, and similar things.
Et sedi suae faciat esse praesentes res cum quarum usu cucurrit consuetudo hominum ex aromaticitate, et odoramento, et tripudio et similibus illis per quantitatem possibilitatis.	And let it make present those things which are of its own kind with the customary use of men from aromatics, and odors, and music, and similar things in proportion to their possibility.
Deinde sedeat phlebotomator super puluinari, quod sit altius quam puluinar phlebotomandi: postea extrahat brachium suum, et fricet ipsum phlebotomator manu sua bis, aut ter.	Then let the bloodletter sit on a cushion which is higher than the cushion of bloodletting. Afterwards, he should draw out his own arm and rub it with his hand twice or three times as the bloodletter.
Deinde stringat ligamentum cum corrigia, et inuoluat eam bis.	Then let him tie the bandage with a strap, and wrap it around twice.
Et sit strictura temperata, quoniam strictura quando est inaequalis, aut per superfluitatem in strictura, tunc prohibet cursum sanguinis: aut in mollificatione, tunc etiam prohibet cursum sanguinis.	And let it be tempered with a knot, because when the string is unequal, or through excess in the string, then it hinders the flow of blood: or if it is too loose, then also it hinders the flow of blood.
Deinde post stricturam oportet, ut fricet phlebotomandus manus suas simul adinuicem, donec inflentur uenae, et declarentur sensui.	Then after tying the knot, it is necessary for the bloodletter to rub his hands together simultaneously until the veins are inflated and declared to the sense.
Deinde abstergat phlebotomator phlebotomum cum pauco oleo, antiquo proprie.	Then let the bloodletter clean the bloodletting instrument with a little old oil properly.
Deinde ponat digitum suum indicem manus sinistrae super ipsam uenam sub loco cuius phlebotomiam uult, parum: ut non fugiat uena, et cassetur percussio.	Then let him place his index finger of the left hand on top of the vein at the place where he wants to make the bloodletting, a little bit away: so that the vein does not flee and the stroke may be made.
Quoniam ex uenis est quam inuenis sicut chordam fugientem apud phlebotomiam: et ex eis est quae est plena uentositate: et quando ponis phlebotomum super eam, contrahitur sub phlebotomo, et decipitur phlebotomator, et non aperit phlebotomus uenam: et si aperit eam, est stricta: propter illud ergo oportet, ut firmetur phlebotomator, et sit sollicitus in his rebus omnibus.	For from veins there is one that flees like an escaped string at bloodletting: and among them there is one that is full of windiness. And when you place the bloodletting instrument on it, it contracts under the bloodletter, and the bloodletter is deceived, and the incision does not open the vein: and if it does open it, it is constricted. Therefore, it is necessary for the bloodletter to be firm and vigilant in all these matters.
Deinde deponat phlebotomum.	Then let him put down the bloodletting instrument.
Si ergo aperitur uena ex uice una, tunc bonum est.	If then the vein opens on one side, then it is good.
Et si non, tunc itera illud uice alia sub illo loco parum, aut supra ipsum cum festinatione: si non apostematur locus.	And if not, then do that same thing on the other side a little bit away or above it with haste: if the place does not become inflamed.
Quod si apostematur, aut expauescit infirmus, tunc dimitte eum die, aut duobus diebus: et non stringat ligamentum.	If he swells up or grows inflamed, then let him rest a day or two; and do not tighten the bandage.
Fortasse enim attrahet apostema calidum.	Perhaps indeed it will draw forth the abscess' heat.
Neque ingrediatur balneum.	Nor should he enter a bath.
Deinde iteret phlebotomiam, si amat.	Then let him undergo bloodletting, if he likes it.
Quod si apertio est parua, aut currit sanguis subtiliter: et times ut non egrediatur ex sanguine quantitas quam uis: tunc itera phlebotomum in foramine ipso secundum rectitudinem, et adde in operatione parum.	What if the opening is small or the blood flows thinly: and you fear that not as much blood will flow out as you wish: then perform the bloodletting at the very same spot in accordance with the right path, and add a little to the procedure.
Et fac illud cum festinatione, antequam apostemetur locus, apostematus enim locus est in multis hominibus apud operationem paruam.	And do it quickly before the abscess forms, for many people experience an abscess during a minor operation.
Si ergo uides ipsum iam apostematum, tunc non iteres super ipsum omnino, non enim excusat apud te aliquid.	So if you see that it has already become an abscess, then do not bleed into it at all, for nothing excuses it in your presence.
Et pone super ipsum aliquid ex faece olei: quoniam alleuiat cursum sanguinis.	And put something from oil and dung on top of it, because it will ease the flow of blood.
Et est melior in hoc loco quam oleum ipsum, et quam reliqua olea.	And it is better for this place than oil itself, and than other oils.
Et similiter administra faecem olei in omni phlebotomia tua, qua phlebotomas uenas apud prohibitionem cursus sanguinis: et faciunt illud tyriaca alfarach, et sagzenea, quando ponitur ex una earum super locum.	And similarly administer oil and dung in every bloodletting of yours, by which you perform phlebotomy at the prohibition of the flow of blood: and they do that with tyriaca alfarach, and sagzenea, when one of them is put on top of the place.
Sanguis enim subtiliatur et resoluitur, quando est grossus.	For blood becomes thinner and dissolves when it is thick.
Quod si accidat in loco phlebotomiae apostema magnum, nam multotiens accidit, praecipue ei qui non est phlebotomatus nisi uice illa, aut est apertio uenae parua, tunc propera et pone super locum spongiam infusam in aqua et sale, calefacta parumper: et stringe eam hora una: quoniam soluitur.	What if a great abscess should occur at the site of bloodletting, for it often happens, especially to those who are not bled except by that method, or when the opening of the vein is small: then hurry and place a sponge soaked in water and salt, warmed up slightly, on top of the spot; tie it there for one hour: because it will dissolve.
Et oportet, ut facias illud post exitum sanguinis ex uena ipsa, cum complemento sui, aut ex uena alia.	And it is necessary that you do this after the blood has finished flowing out of the same vein, or from another vein.
Quod si remanet in loco post dies aliquid nigredinis, aut uiriditatis, non nocet illud: et si uis, pone super ipsum aliquid aloe, aut myrrhae solutorum: aut aliquid ex succo menthastri, id est, calamenti aut simile illius.	If something remains in the place after days with a blackening or yellowing, it does not harm; and if you wish, place something of aloe, or myrrh solvent, or something from the juice of mint, that is, of chamomile or similar.
Et multotiens quidem accidunt apostemata et eminentiae apud phlebotomiam Basilicae.	And many times indeed happen ulcers and swellings at bloodletting in the basilica.
Pone ergo manum tuam super ipsam, tunc si inuenis molliciem apud compressionem tuam super ipsam, tunc illa eminentia est mala.	So place your hand on it, then if you find softness under your pressure on it, then that swelling is bad.
Caue ergo, ut ponas super eam aliquid ex eo quod diximus.	Be careful then, so as to put something on it from what we have said.
Nam fortasse fluet ex ea sanguis arteriae.	For perhaps blood will flow from there of the artery.
Sed fac emplastrum ei cum eo in quo est stipticitas, ut induretur locus.	But make a poultice for it with something that has astringent properties, so that the place may be hardened.
Deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then take care of it with the rest of the treatment until it heals.
Et oportet, ut extrahas omni homini ex sanguine secundum quantitatem uirtutis suae.	And it is necessary to take away all blood from each person according to the quantity of their virtue.
Et quod apparet ex colore uincente super sanguinem.	And what appears in color victorious above the blood.
Nam sanguis si est niger, tunc dimitte ipsum exire, donec rubeat: et similiter si uides ipsum grossum: tunc dimitte eum, donec subtilietur: et similiter si est acutus, donec auferatur acuitas eius.	For if the blood is black, then let it go until it turns red; and similarly if you see it thick, then let it go until it becomes thin: and similarly if it is sharp, then let its sharpness be removed.
Et oportet ei qui est plenus, fortis, et indiget extractione sanguinis uice una, ut amplificetur phlebotomia uenae, et sit phlebotomus latus: et in eo qui est debilis, sit econtrario illius.	And it is necessary for one who is full, strong, and needs bloodletting once to amplify the bloodletting of a vein and make it lateral; and in one who is weak, to be the opposite of that.
Et oportet, ut extrahat ipsum in uicibus, et ut sit foramen strictum: et melius quod administratur in phlebotomia uenae est, ut sit transuersa sectio, non punctura.	And it is necessary to take it away in veins and to make a narrow opening; and better than what is administered in bloodletting of a vein is that there be a crosswise incision, not a puncture.
Et iste modus phlebotomiae est saluus a fluxu sanguinis, et ab incisione nerui: et est laudabilior, et saluior quam phlebotomia per latitudinem et longitudinem.	And this method of bloodletting is safe from bleeding and from cutting the nerve; and it is more praiseworthy and healthful than bloodletting by width and length.
Et cui consueuit peruenire apud phlebotomiam syncopis, oportet ut cibes ante phlebotomiam modico pane infuso in aqua granati muzi: aut secaniabin, si est calefactus: et extrahas ei ex sanguine in tribus uicibus, aut quatuor.	And to whoever is accustomed to arrive at bleeding with syncopes, it is necessary that he eats before bleeding a moderate amount of bread soaked in pomegranate juice: or a secamiba leaf, if he is warmed up; and take from his blood in three or four turns.
Et si est infrigidatae complexionis, tunc accipiat ante phlebotomiam panem infusum in syrupo miua, aut in syrupo de melle aromatizato cum speciebus, aut in syrupo aromatizato odorifero.	And if it is an infrigidated complexion, then he shall take before bleeding bread soaked in honey syrup, or in honey syrup flavored with spices, or in aromatic syrup that smells good.
Quod si accidat syncopis apud phlebotomiam, et est caussa eius exitus sanguinis multi: tunc oportet, ut sumat in potu aquam carnis, et syrupum odoriferum subtilem: et utatur aromaticitate cum algalia, et liniatur pectus eius cum ea: et utatur reliquis quae diximus in diuisione in capitulo syncopis ex euacuatione.	If syncope occurs during bleeding and the cause of it is the flowing out of much blood: then it is necessary that he takes a drink of meat broth, and a subtle aromatic syrup; and anoints his chest with it along with those things which we mentioned in the chapter on syncope from evacuation.
Qui autem uult euentare brachium suum, et soluere sanguinem suum secundo: oportet ei cuius phlebotomia est propter euacuationem multam, et uirtus eius est debilis, ut soluat sanguinem paulatim per quantitatem uirtutis in diebus continuis.	But whoever wants to succeed in releasing his arm and letting out his blood a second time: it is necessary that he who has bleeding for the sake of evacuation due to much blood and whose strength is weak, releases the blood little by little according to the amount of strength he has, day after day.
Qui uero uult euentare brachium suum, et soluere sanguinem suum secundo, et est corpus eius forte: tunc faciat illud post septem horas, aut nouem a phlebotomia sua prima.	But whoever wants to succeed in releasing his arm and letting out his blood a second time, and whose body is strong: then let him do it after seven hours or nine from his first bleeding.
Qui autem uult attrahere sanguinem ex corpore suo ad contrarium partis ad quam declinat: oportet ut euentetur ei in die secundo, aut in tertio.	But whoever wants to draw blood from his body to the opposite side which it declines towards: it is necessary that this happens to him on the second day or third.
In cuius uero corpore est sanguis multus iam calefactus, et acuitur, et facit accidere febrem: oportet, ut egrediatur ex eo sanguis in uice una, et extrahatur ex eo quantitas multa: et amplificetur apertio usquequo accidat syncopis: postquam tu fueris conseruans omnes conditiones phlebotomiae: et ut ponas manum tuam super pulsum eius apud cursum sanguinis, ut non accidat mors loco syncopis.	In whose body is much blood already warmed up and sharpened, and makes a fever occur: it is necessary that the blood goes out from him in one direction, and a large quantity is taken out: and the opening should be widened until syncope occurs: after which you will have preserved all the conditions of bleeding; and then place your hand on his pulse at the course of the blood, so that death does not occur instead of syncope.
Multotiens enim accidit illud, quando ignorat phlebotomator, et cadit negligentia.	It often happens that a bloodletter is unaware of this, and neglect occurs as a result.
Et non oportet quando uis soluere brachium, et soluere sanguinem secundo, cum iam clausum sit orificium uenae, et fiat difficilis exitus sanguinis, ut prematur super ipsum cum uehementia, et curuatum extendatur uelociter.	And it's not necessary when you want to release an arm and release blood secondarily, if the vein opening is already closed, and a difficult exit of blood occurs, so that you press upon it with force and stretch it quickly.
Nam illud est malum ualde, imo dimitte ipsum, donec phlebotometur secundo.	For that is very bad indeed; rather, let him be left until the second bloodletting.
Aut remoue cum acuitate phlebotomi illud quod coagulatum est ex sanguine in orificio uenae, et pone super ipsum aliquid salis dissoluti in aqua.	Or remove with sharp bloodletting what has coagulated from the blood in the vein opening, and place something dissolved salt on top of it in water.
Et pone super ipsum aliquid ex tyriaca alfaroch, aut sagzenea, et pone ipsum compressione leni, donec egrediatur sanguis.	And place something from terebinthina or saffron on top of it, and apply gentle compression to it until the blood goes out.
Si uero iam apostemata est uena, tunc dimitte eam, et non tegas eam, donec sedetur apostema.	If the vein is already inflamed, then let it be left alone and not be bound until the inflammation subsides.
Quod si necessitas prouocat ad soluendum sanguinem secundo, et non est excusatio, tunc aut phlebotoma ipsum supra illum locum, aut in brachio alio in uena alia.	But if necessity demands that blood be let secondarily and there is no excuse, then either let it above that place or in another arm through another vein.
Funis autem brachii phlebotomatur loco Fuscae, et Basilicae, cum non inueniuntur, et sunt occultae, quoniam est composita ex eis.	A cord of the arm is bloodletted at the places of the Black and Basilica veins when these are not found and are hidden, since it is composed of them.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut intromittat infirmus manum suam in aqua calida, donec rubeat focile, et appareat uena manifeste.	And the quality of this bloodletting is that the sick person should put their hand into hot water until it becomes red and the vein appears clearly.
Deinde stringatur super ipsam cum ligamento parum constrictione media.	Then a strap should be wrapped around it with a slight constriction in the middle.
Deinde phlebotoma secundum transuersationem paulatim, non latitudinaliter, neque secundum longitudinem: et sit apertio ampla, et sit phlebotomia tua qua eam phlebotomas super iuncturam manus parumper.	Then bloodletting should be done gradually across the transverse direction, not latitudinally or longitudinally: and make a wide opening and make your bloodletting so that you cut it over the joint of the hand for a little while.
Quod si prohibetur exitus sanguinis, tunc itera manum in aqua calida, et dimitte sanguinem currere in aqua, donec consequaris necessitatem tuam.	But if the flow of blood is impeded, then repeat with your hand in hot water and let the blood run into the water until you achieve your necessity.
Si autem fueris in diebus aestatis, tunc excusaris ab iteratione manus in aqua calida.	If however you are during the days of summer, then excuse yourself from repeated washing of hands in hot water.
Et plurimum quidem ponitur cursus sanguinis in aqua calida in tempore hyemis.	And indeed a great deal is placed on the course of bloodletting with hot water during winter time.
Et phlebotomia huius uenae est saluior omnibus uenis, quoniam non est sub ea uena pulsatilis, neque neruus.	And phlebotomy of this vein is more beneficial to all veins, because there is no pulsating artery nor nerve under it.
Phlebotomia uero Saluatellae manus dextrae, est conferens aegritudinibus epatis.	The phlebotomy of the Saluatella vein of the right hand is indeed beneficial for diseases of the liver.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut stringas mahason manus cum ligamento, aut manu tua, postquam tu intromittis eam in aquam calidam, donec infletur uena, et demonsteretur sensui ualde.	And the quality of phlebotomy is that you tie a string or cloth around the arm with a ligature, or use your own hand, after you have inserted it into hot water, until the vein inflates and becomes apparent to the sense.
Deinde phlebotoma eam transuersando.	Then perform the phlebotomy by crossing over.
Et si incidis eam totaliter, non nocebit ei illud in aliquo.	And if you cut it completely, that will not harm him in any way.
Et conserua, ne ultimes manum tuam cum phlebotomo.	And be careful not to stain your hand with the phlebotomy.
Sub ea enim sunt nerui digitorum denudati ex carne.	Under it indeed are the nerves of the bare fingers exposed from the flesh.
Deinde itera manum ad aquam calidam, et dimitte currere sanguinem in ea.	Then put your hand into hot water and let blood flow freely in it.
Nam si tu non iteras eam in aqua calida, coagulatur sanguis in orificio uenae, et prohibetur a cursu.	For if you do not wash it with hot water, the blood will clot at the opening of the vein and be prevented from flowing.
Cum ergo extraxeris ex sanguine quantitatem necessitatis, tunc pone super uenam oleum et sal: ut non consolidetur uelociter.	When therefore you have extracted the necessary quantity of blood, then place oil and salt on top of the vein, so that it will not congeal quickly.
Et similiter oportet, ut facias cum omni ramo stricto.	And similarly, you should do this with every tightened branch.
Iuuamentum uero phlebotomiae eius ex manu sinistra, est: quoniam est conferens ad aegritudines splenis: et similiter fac in phlebotomia eius, sicut fecisti in secunda aequaliter.	The application of the phlebotomy from the left hand is: because it is beneficial for diseases of the spleen: and similarly do this in its phlebotomy, as you did in the second one equally.
Saphenae autem phlebotomiae iuuamentum, est ad aegritudines quae sunt in inferiori parte corporis, sicut aegritudines matricum, et retentionem menstruorum, et infirmitates renum, et ulcera coxarum et crurium antiqua, et similia ex aegritudinibus.	The application of the phlebotomy on the saphenous vein is beneficial for diseases that are located in the lower part of the body, such as diseases of the womb, retention of menses, weaknesses of the kidneys, and old wounds of the hips and legs, and similar diseases.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut intromittat infirmus pedem suum in aquam calidam: et faciat super ipsum fricationem, donec exuberent uenae: et liga supra iuncturam pedis cum corrigia.	And the quality of phlebotomy is that the patient should put their foot into warm water and make a friction on it until the veins swell; and bind above the ankle with a bandage.
Et uenae quidem locus est apud calcaneum, apparens uersus pollicem: et ramificantur ex ea in facie pedis rami multi.	And indeed the location of the veins is at the heel, appearing towards the thumb; and they branch out from there into the face of the foot, with many branches.
Phlebotoma ergo eam in ampliore ramo eius, aut apud calcaneum in aggregatione eius: quoniam est melius et saluius.	Therefore, phlebotomy should be done on a larger branch of it, or at the heel in its gathering; since it is better and more wholesome.
Quod si phlebotomas eam in facie pedis, tunc caue a neruis qui sunt sub ea super faciem pedis.	For if you perform phlebotomy on the face of the foot, then beware of the nerves that are under it above the surface of the foot.
Et pone phlebotomiam tuam qua eam phlebotomas ex transuerso, quasi tu uelis incidere eam: et sit phlebotomus Nesil.	And place your phlebotomy so that it is cut across, as if you want to cut through it; and make the incision Nesil.
Si autem prohibetur exitus sanguinis, tunc itera pedem eius in aqua calida: et dimitte sanguinem currere in eam, donec euacuatur.	But if the flow of blood is hindered, then take his foot and put it into warm water; and let the blood flow into it until it is drained.
Quod si errat uenam phlebotomator in prima uice, tunc iteret cum phlebotomia ad superiora parumper, nam locus est saluus, et non times ex eo maliciam, quando tu caues a neruis, sicut diximus.	For if the phlebotomist erred in the first attempt, then he should move with the phlebotomy to higher places for a little bit, since the place is safe and you do not fear harm when you beware of the nerves, as we said.
Et similiter cum Saphena pedis alterius aequaliter.	And similarly with the saphenous vein of the other foot, equally.
Venae autem Sciaticae locus, sicut diximus, est apud calcaneum ex latere syluestri.	The location of the sciatic veins is, as we said, at the heel on the outer side of the hollow.
Et iuuamentum phlebotomiae eius est, ad dolorem anchae, quando est propter sanguinem calidum.	And the benefit of this phlebotomy is to relieve the pain of gout when it occurs due to hot blood.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut ingrediatur infirmus balneum, et festinet: et stringe crus eius a latere anchae usque supra calcaneum quatuor digitis, cum uitta subtili longa: non enim apparet nisi propter illud.	And the quality of this phlebotomy is that the patient should enter the bath and hurry; and bind their leg on the side of the ankle up to the heel with a thin, long strap: for it does not appear except because of that.
Quando ergo apparet, tunc phlebotoma eam secundum quodcumque ingenium est tibi possibile, aut secundum transuersionem: et est melius, aut ut incidas eam incisione, aut seces eam sectione.	When it appears, then make the phlebotomy as is possible for you, either according to cutting across or according to a cut; and it is better to make an incision or a section.
Locus enim eius est saluior, et ipsa est in pluribus hominibus occulta ualde.	The location of it is more healing, and itself is very hidden in many people.
Quod si non inuenis eam, et non apparet sensui omnino: tunc phlebotoma aliquem ramum eius, et est ille qui apparet in dorso pedis, et uersus auricularem: et caue a neruis, et fac currere ex sanguine quantitatem quam uis.	If you do not find it and it does not appear to the senses at all: then let blood from some branch of it, and that one which appears on the back of the foot, and turns towards the ear; and beware of the nerves, and make a flow of blood in the quantity you desire.
Deinde solue stricturam, et pone super locum phlebotomiae corium, et stringe locum.	Then loosen the constriction, and place skin over the site of the bleeding, and tie the place.
Uelociter enim sanatur.	For it heals very quickly.
¶ De Ventosatione, et qualitate usus eius.	About Pneumatization, and the quality of its use.
Caput XCVIII.	Chapter 98.
Uentosae fiunt ex cornibus, et ex aere, et ex uitro.	They are made from horns, and air, and glass.
Et Ventosatio quidem fit secundum duos modos.	And pneumatization is done in two ways.
Cum scarificatione, et extractione sanguinis: et alter est uentosatio sine scarificatione.	One is with scarification and the extraction of blood, and the other is without scarification.
Et haec Ventosatio quae est sine scarificatione, est secundum duos modos.	And this pneumatization which is done without scarification is in two ways.
Aut enim est cum igne.	Or it is with fire.
Aut est absque igne.	Or it is without fire.
Et uentosis quae administrantur cum scarificatione et extractione sanguinis sunt quatuordecim loca corporis.	And the pneumatisms that are administered with scarification and bloodletting are fourteen places of the body.
Quorum unus est, Ventosatio Alnocrati, et est postremum capitis: et Alkehel, et est medium colli: et uentosae Alhagdahim, et sunt duae laminae colli a duabus partibus simul: et uentosae menti, et est sub mandibula in inferiori oris: et uentosae duarum spatularum: et uentosae Alachosos super finem caudae: et uentosae duorum focilium, et sunt medium duorum brachiorum: et uentosae duorum crurium: et uentosae duarum cauillarum.	One of which is Ventosatio Alnocrati, and it is the back of the head; and Alkehel, and it is the middle of the neck; and pneumatisms Alhagdahim, and they are two plates of the neck from both sides at once; and pneumatisms of the mind, and it is under the jawbone in the lower part of the face; and pneumatisms of the two spatulas; and pneumatisms of Alachosos above the end of the tail; and pneumatisms of the two fireplaces, and they are the middle of the two arms; and pneumatisms of the two legs; and pneumatisms of the two caudals.
Et Ventosatio quidem non extrahit sanguinem tibi ex uenis minutis sparsis in carne, et propter illud non cadit uirtus ex eis, sicut est casus eius ex phlebotomia.	And pneumatization indeed does not extract blood from small scattered veins in the flesh, and because of that it does not fall into power from them, as is the case with bloodletting.
Neque oportet, ut administretur uentosatio siue cum igne, aut absque igne in aliqua aegritudinum quae fiunt ex repletione, donec euacuetur totum corpus.	Nor should it be necessary to apply suction, whether with fire or without fire, in any disease that occurs from fullness, until the entire body is evacuated.
Quod si necessitas prouocat ad Ventosationem ex aegritudine, aut propter consuetudinem, administramus eam in omni hora in principio mensis, in fine eius, et in medio ipsius, et in quocumque tempore fuerit.	For if necessity prompts to suction from disease or because of habit, we shall administer it every hour at the beginning and end of the month, and in the middle thereof, and at whatever time it may be.
Quod est, quia ex hominibus est qui quando multiplicatur in eo sanguis, donec indiget extractione eius per uentosationem, inuenit in capite suo grauedinem, et sodahan.	Which is because there are people who when blood multiplies in them, until they need its removal through suction, find heaviness and swelling in their head.
Et ex eis est qui inuenit repletionem et rubedinem in facie sua, capite suo, et collo suo.	And from these are people who find fullness and redness on their face, head, and neck.
Et ex eis est qui inuenit pruritum in facie sua, et fronte sua, et tenebrositatem, et hebetudinem in oculis suis.	And from these are people who find itching on their face and forehead, and darkness, and dullness in their eyes.
Et ex eis est qui scalpit locum uentosationis suae.	And from these is someone who scrapes at the site of his own suction.
Et ex eis est cuius risus multiplicatur.	And from these is someone whose laughter multiplies.
Et ex eis est qui inuenit gustum sanguinis in ore suo: aut apostematur lingua, et expuit sanguinem.	And from these is someone who finds the taste of blood in his mouth: or his tongue will become inflamed and spit out blood.
Et ex eis est cuius somnus multiplicatur.	And from these is someone whose sleep multiplies.
Et ex eis est qui uidet in somno suo sanguinem et rubedinem, et interfectos, et plagas, et quae sunt similia illis.	And from these is someone who sees in his sleep blood and redness, and corpses, and wounds, and things similar to those.
Quando ergo uidemus aliquid ex illis, et proprie si est in tertia media mensis: praecipimus tunc uentosationem fieri, postquam praeterierunt de die duae horae, aut tres.	When therefore we see something from those things, and properly if it is on the 15th day of the month: we then order suction to be done after two hours have passed, or three.
Iuuamentum autem Ventosationis nuchae, est: quoniam ipsa confert ad grauitatem in capite, et quod effunditur ad oculos.	The benefit of suction on the back of the head is: because it brings relief to heaviness there, and what flows down to the eyes.
At uero oportet, ut sit illud post euacuationem totius corporis.	But it is necessary for that to be done after evacuation of the entire body.
Et haec quidem Ventosa est loco phlebotomiae Cephalicae.	And this indeed is a suction in place of cephalic bloodletting.
Et non licet, ut utatur ea qui est frigidae complexionis, aut in quo est catarrus.	And it is not allowed for one who has a cold complexions, or who has a catarrh.
Nam infert ei nocumentum magnum.	For it causes him great harm.
Et propter illud non oportet, ut utantur ea senes, et in cuius capite sunt aegritudines frigidae.	And because of this, it is not fitting that the elderly use them, and those who are afflicted with cold complaints.
Qui autem super eam fit assiduus, generatur super eum obliuio.	But he who becomes accustomed to it will forgetfulness befall him over himself.
Et propter illud oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ut deponat manum suam cum uentosa parumper ad inferiora, timendo ex generatione obliuionis.	And because of this, it is necessary to warn the Ventilator to put down his hand for a little while on the lower part, fearing the generation of forgetfulness.
Ventosatio aut Alkehel, est loco phlebotomiae Fuscae, et phlebotomiae Basilicae, et propter illud confert asmati, et constrictioni anhelitus, et fissurae instrumenti anhelitus, et tussi, et repletioni.	Ventosation or Alkehel is a place for black bloodletting and basilic vein bloodletting, and because of this, it brings together the hiccups, constriction of respiration, rupture of breathing instrument, coughing, and repletion.
Et oportet, ut impellatur Ventosa Alkehel parumper, quoniam si ponitur inferius, generat debilitatem in corde, et stomacho.	And it is necessary to apply the Alkehel Ventosation for a little while, because if it is placed below, it generates weakness in the heart and stomach.
Ventosatio uero alhagdahim, confert doloribus accidentibus in capite, et obtalmiae, et hemigraneae, et perforationi, et dolori in radicibus dentium: et est loco phlebotomiae Basilicae.	Ventosation indeed is the relief for accidents of pain in the head, and for eyes, and for migraines, and for perforation, and for tooth root pain; and it is a place for basilic vein bloodletting.
Et oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ne premat manum suam cum scarificatione: ut non incidat arteriam, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	And it is necessary to warn the Ventilator not to press his hand with scarification: so that he does not hit the artery and a flow of blood occurs.
Ventosatio autem sub mento, confert alcolae in ore, et corruptioni gingiuae, et similibus eis ex aegritudinibus quae sunt in ore: et stat loco phlebotomiae alieherich, quae sunt in duobus labiis.	Ventosation indeed under the chin brings forth abscesses in the mouth, and corruption of the gums, and similar things from mouth afflictions: and it is located at the place of bloodletting alieherich, which are on both lips.
Ventosatio autem spatularum, confert ad alchafacham, quae fit ex replexione, et caliditate.	Ventosation indeed of spathulas brings forth alchafacham, which arises from relaxation and heat.
Ventosatio uero interiorum partium duorum focilium, confert iuuamentum phlebotomiae uenarum trium, Basilicae, et Fuscae, et Cephalicae: quoniam ipsa attrahit sanguinem ex omnibus illis uenis minutis, quae sunt in carne: et attrahunt illae uenae minutae ex uenis aliis grossioribus eis, donec peruenit attractio ad uenas tres.	Ventosation indeed of the interior parts of two fireboxes brings forth benefit for bloodletting of three veins, Basilic, Black, and Cephalic: because it draws blood from all those small veins that are in the flesh; and those small veins draw from other larger veins until the attraction reaches to the three veins.
Et oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ne multum procedat in scarificatione: quoniam locus est denudatus carne, et sub eo sunt nerui et arteriae.	And it is necessary that you precede the Ventosator, lest he proceed too far in scarification: for the location has been stripped of flesh, and beneath it are nerves and arteries.
Ventosa autem quae uentosatur super alchausos, confert hemorroidibus Ani, et ulceribus inferioribus.	But the Ventosa which is fumigated over old ulcers, applies to hemorrhoids of the anus, and lower ulcers.
Et oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ut sit uentosa magna, et ut sit ex aere: quoniam locus indiget suctione forti, et fortasse franguntur Ventosae subtiles: et scarificetur scarificatione magna.	And it is necessary that you precede the Ventosator, so that there may be a great Ventosa and one made of air: because the location needs strong suction, and perhaps the subtle Ventosae are broken: and it should be scarified with a great scarification.
Ventosae autem crurium minuunt diminutione manifesta: quoniam attrahunt sanguinem ex toto corpore, et conferunt doloribus antiquis in renibus, et matricibus, et uesica: prouocant menstrua, et conferunt bothor, et ademenul: et stant loco phlebotomiae duarum saphenarum, et alhorcobeni.	But the Ventosae of the legs diminish with a manifest decrease: because they draw blood from the entire body, and apply to pains old in the kidneys, and wombs, and bladder: they provoke menstruation, and apply to boils, and adema: and stand in place of phlebotomy of both saphena veins, and alopecic.
Verumtamen debilitant corpus multum, et faciunt accidere syncopim in pluribus hominibus.	However, they greatly weaken the body, and cause syncope to occur in many people.
Et Ventosarum alhorcobeni iuuamentum est propinquum iuuamento Ventosarum duorum crurium.	And the benefit of Alopecic Ventosas is similar to the benefit of two leg Ventosas.
Qualitas positionis Ventosarum est, ut ponas uentosam in primis uacuam, et sugas suctione temperata: et non prolonges positionem uentosarum, sed pone eas uelociter, et remoue eas uelociter, ut ueniant humores ad locum aduentu aequali: et non cesses iterare illud et continuare, donec uideas locum iam rubere et inflari, et appareat rubedo sanguinis: tunc ergo scarifica, et itera suctione paulatim.	The quality of the Ventosas' position is that you place the Ventosa first in a vacuum, and suck with tempered suction: and do not prolong the position of the Ventosas, but put them quickly, and remove them quickly, so that the humors may come to the location with equal approach: and do not cease to repeat and continue that until you see the location already reddening and inflaming, and appears redness of blood: then therefore scarify, and iterate suction slowly.
Deinde considera in dispositione corporum.	Then consider the disposition of bodies.
Nam qui ex hominibus est tenerae carnis, rarorum pororum, oportet ut scarifices ipsum semel, non plus: ut non ulceretur locus.	For those who are among men with thin flesh, rare pores, it is necessary to scarify him once only, not more: so that the location may not become ulcerated.
Et praecipe Ventosatori, ut amplificet scarificationem, et profundet parum: et temperet suctionem in facilitate, et uelocitate, et motu suaui.	And instruct the Ventosator to amplify the scarification and deepen it slightly: and temper the suction with ease, swiftness, and gentle motion.
Quod si in sanguine est grossitudo, tunc oportet, ut scarifices ipsum bis.	If there is coagulation in the blood, then it is necessary to lance it twice.
In uice quidem prima aperitur uia subtiliationi sanguinis, et aquositati eius: et in secunda quidem perscrutationi exquisitae extractionis sanguinis grossi.	Indeed, the first opening is for the subtlety of blood and its clarity: and the second, for a thorough search and extraction of thick blood.
Si uero sanguis est faeculentus ualde, tunc fiat scarificatio uice tertia: ut consequatur ultimum.	If however the blood is very foul, then let there be a third lancing, in order to achieve the ultimate result.
Et ad ultimum, quando uolumus extrahere sanguinem paulatim, uel parumper, sufficit nobis scarificatio una.	And finally, when we wish to withdraw blood little by little or a bit at a time, one lancing is sufficient for us.
Quod si uolumus extractionem sanguinis multi, scarificamus scarificatione plurima.	For if we wish to extract much blood, we lance multiple times.
Et si nos mensuramus, quod sanguis est grossus: tunc oportet, ut scarificetur scarificatione profunda: et terminus aequalis in scarificatione, est profunditas cutis.	And if we measure it, and find that the blood is thick, then it is necessary to lance deeply; and the equal term in lancing is the depth of the skin.
¶ Quid sit illud quod oportet administrari ex oleis apud positionem Ventosarum, et quid caueat uentosandus.	What should be administered with oils at the wound site of Ventsors, and what a windsor should beware.
IN illo quidem cuius cutis est grossa, dura, fusca, et pori eius sunt stricti, oportet ut ungantur loca Ventosare cum oleis apertiuis, lenitiuis, resolutiuis: si est in tempore aestatis, sicut est oleum alkeiri, aut oleum uiolatum, aut oleum de amigdalis dulcibus, aut oleum de semine cucurbitae.	In that person whose skin is thick, hard, dark-colored, and whose pores are tight, it is necessary to anoint the areas around the wound with open, soothing, resolving oils; if it is during the time of summer, such as alkeiri oil, or violet oil, or oil from sweet almonds, or oil from cucumber seeds.
Et si est in tempore hyemis, tunc oleum narcissinum, aut oleum de lilio, aut oleum camomellinum, aut sarbatinum: et eis similia.	And if it is during the time of winter, then oil of narcissus, or oil of lily, or oil of chamomile, or sabine: and similar things.
Si uero superfluitas est grossa, frigida: tunc oleum sit amaracinum, aut oleum de balsamita aut oleum alben, aut oleum anetinum: et eis similia.	If there is excessive thickened blood, cold; then the oil should be bitter, such as oil of myrrh, or oil of balsam, or white oil, or oil of anetis: and similar things.
Si uero uentosandus est amplorum pororum, tenerae carnis: tunc oportet, ut prohibeatur ab oleo, et oportet ut isti abluant loca Ventosarum earum post uentosationem cum aqua rosata, aut cum aqua frigida, aut cum aqua solatri, aut cum aqua cucurbitae, aut cum aqua portulacae: et similibus eis.	If the windsor has large pores and tender flesh; then it is necessary to prohibit him from using oil, and it is necessary for those places to be washed after lancing with rose water, or cold water, or sorrel water, or cucumber water, or portulaca water: and similar things.
Ille autem cuius sanguis est multae humiditatis, abluat uentosas cum aceto, aut cum aqua myrti, et sumach: et similibus eis.	He, however, whose blood is of much moisture, should wash his sores with vinegar, or with water of myrtle, and sumach: and similar things.
Cuius autem superfluitates sunt grossae, abluat uentosas suas cum uino antiquo, aut cum aqua samsuci, aut decoctione aneti, aut camomillae: et eis similibus.	He, however, whose excessences are coarse, should wash his sores with old wine, or with water of sambucus, or the decoction of anise, or chamomile: and similar things.
Et oportet, ut caueatur uentosatio in balneo, aut in uestigio balnei, imo oportet, ut administretur post exitum ex balneo per horam, aut per horas duas.	And it is necessary that the washing of sores should be done in a bath, or in a place where bathing takes place; nay, it is even necessary that it should be administered after coming out of the bath for an hour, or for two hours.
Et non oportet, ut dormiat aliquis post uentosationem.	And it is not necessary that someone should sleep after washing his sores.
¶ Quid est quo oportet ut regatur Ventosandus, aut Phlebotomatus ante uentosationem.	What is the thing by which one ought to regulate Venous-and or Blood-letting before washing.
ET post eam oportet, ut consideres in primis: tunc si Ventosatus, aut Phlebotomatus sit cholericus, et uincunt super sanguinem eius acuitas et inflammatio: tunc oportet, ut accipiat infrigidantia, sicut granatum muzum: et etiam endiuiam cum aceto et lactuca, et secaniabin, et iuleb: et eis similia.	AND after that, one ought first to consider this: then if the Venous-and or Blood-letting is choleric, and prevails over his blood with sharpness and inflammation: then it is necessary that he take refrigerants, such as pomegranate juice; and also endive with vinegar and lettuce, and sabine, and jujube: and similar things.
Et pone cibaria eius pullos, et carnes ouium sekebiget, et cibos conditos cum agresta: et eis similia.	And give him foods of eggs, and old goat meat, and cooked food with wild herbs: and similar things.
Et cuius complexio est frigida, oportet ut sumat in potu syrupum de melle, aut de almiua, aut alsecaniabin de seminibus factum: et sumat uinum odoriferum medium, quod est inter uetus et nouum: et praecipiatur, ut utatur paucitate cibi.	And whoever has a cold complexion ought to take in drink the syrup made from honey, or from almond, or from sabine seed; and he should take wine of medium odor, which is between old and new; and it is necessary that he abstain from eating much.
Et pone cibum eius pullos, et canebir: et passeres, id est, paruas aues: et pullos columborum issiadebet.	And give him food of eggs, and beets; and pigeons, that is, small birds; and eggs of doves should be allowed.
Et oportet, ut potus die uentosationis et phlebotomiae plus sit quam cibus: et oportet, ut detur in potu in quibusdam hominibus in horis tyriaca alfaroch, aut medicamen de musco, id est, muscata, aut alesselithe ante uentosationem: et ante phlebotomiam, aut post: ut confortentur membra principalia, et subtilietur sanguis.	And it is necessary that the drink on the day of washing and blood-letting be more than food; and it is necessary that some people should take in drink certain herbs, such as alfera or muscata, or alesselith before washing; or before or after blood-letting, to strengthen the principal limbs and thin the blood.
Et non oportet, ut sumant eam in potu calefacto.	And it is not necessary for them to take it in a warmed vessel.
¶ De Ventosis sine scarificatione.	On Hiccups without Scarification.
Uentosae autem quae sunt sine scarificatione, sunt Ventosae quae ponuntur super epar, et splenem, et podagram, et super uentrem, umbilicum, et loca renum, et pixidem anchae: quoniam ista membra non sufferunt scarificationem super se.	But the hiccups that are without scarification are those which are placed above the liver, and spleen, and foot joint, and above the belly, navel, and places of the kidneys, and near the anus: because these members do not tolerate scarification upon themselves.
Et non quaeritur per eas, nisi aut attactio ex membro sanguinis ad membrum: sicut ponimus Ventosam super mammillas in aegritudine fluxus sanguinis narium.	And it is not sought through them, except by the attraction of blood from member to member: as we place Hiccups on the breasts in illness of bloody discharge of the nose.
Et utimur eis, ut soluamus a membro uentositatem frigidam inuiscatam in membro: sicut ponimus uentosam super uentrem, et umbilicum.	And we use them to release a cold and congealed hiccup from a member into another member: as we place Hiccups on the belly and navel.
Ipsa enim rarificat membrum, et calefacit ipsum, et remouet dolorem propterea, quia resoluit illam uentositatem.	For it itself rarefies the member, and warms it, and removes the pain because it resolves that hiccup.
Etiam ponitur super renes, quando accidit in eis opilatio, aut lapis.	And also it is placed on the kidneys when there occurs a blockage or stone.
Uirtute enim attractionis suae fortasse aperit opilationem, aut eradicat lapidem ex loco suo.	For the virtue of its own attraction may perhaps open up the blockage, or eradicate the stone from its place.
Et similiter facit quando ponitur super epar, et splenem apud uentositatem terendam in eis utrisque.	And similarly it does when placed on the liver and spleen to treat a hiccup that is lingering there in both.
Et istae Ventosae administrantur uacuae cum sectione tantum.	And these Hiccups are administered empty with only an incision.
Et quandoque administrantur cum igne.	And sometimes they are administered with fire.
Et quandoque administrantur plenae aqua tepida in aegritudinibus pleuresis: et illud est, ut impleatur Ventosa, et sit magna, aqua calida sola, aut aqua in qua decoctae sint herbae quae conueniunt.	And sometimes they are administered with a full warm water bath in illnesses of pleurisy: and that is, so that the Ventosa may be filled and become large, with hot water alone, or with water in which herbs that are suitable have been decocted.
¶ Forma Ventosae administratae cum igne.	Form of Hiccups administered with fire.
Sit amplitudo orificii eius duorum digitorum apertorum, secundum quod formauimus: et quantitas eius in profundo sit medietas palmi: et sit in latere eius in loco qui est circiter medium eius, foramen paruum, secundum quantitatem quod ingrediatur ipsum acus: fiat ex aere simul, aut citrino, grossorum marginum, lenium, aequalium, tersorum: ut non laedat membrum apud positionem suam super ipsum: et sit in medio eius uirga transuersa ex aere, aut ferro, ubi ponitur candela cum igne.	Let the width of its opening be two open fingers, according to what we have formed: and let its quantity in depth be half a palm: and let there be a small hole on its side, about halfway down, proportionate to the size that the needle will enter it: make it simultaneously from air or citron, smooth, equal, and polished edges so that it does not harm the member at the position where it is placed upon it: and let there be a crosswise stick in the middle of it, either made of air or iron, where the candle with fire is placed.
Et iam fit haec uentosa magna, maior ea quam narrauimus, et parum minor illa, secundum aegritudines et aetatem eius qui utitur.	And now this abscess is large and great, greater than what we have narrated, and slightly smaller, according to the illnesses and age of the person who uses it.
Ventosae enim puerorum, et extenuatorum sunt aliae, quam uentosae uirorum, et grossorum corporum.	For abscesses of children and thin-bodied people are different from those of men and stout-bodied individuals.
Qualitas autem ponendi hanc uentosam cum igne super membrum, est, ut accendas licinium cum igne ex lino decenter, aut candelam paruam ex caera: et pone eam super medium uirgae transuersae quae est in medio uentosae: ut sit accensus ignis circiter inferiorem partem uentosae, ut non comburatur corpus infirmi.	However, the quality of applying this abscess with fire on a member is that you light a linen wick or a small candle made of tallow and place it over the middle of the transverse rod which is in the midst of the abscess: so that the burning flame may be about the lower part of the abscess, lest the sick body be burned.
Deinde ponatur super membrum: et digitus sit super foramen quod dixi, donec quando tenemus uentosam: dum indigemus, auferamus digitum, et egredietur uapor super illud foramen, et soluetur uentosa statim.	Then it should be placed on the member, and a finger should be placed above the opening which I mentioned, until we hold the abscess; while we need it, we will remove the finger, and moisture will issue forth over that opening, and the abscess will dissolve immediately.
Deinde igni licinium secundum modum suum, et itera eam, si indiges illa.	Then you should fumigate with a linen wick in its own way, and repeat it if needed.
In Ventosa autem quae administratur in aegritudine pleuresis cum aqua, non est uirga transuersa, neque foramen: et non administratur, nisi quia impletur aqua, et ponitur super membrum tantum.	But in the abscess which is administered in the case of pleurisy with water, there is no transverse rod nor opening; and it is not administered unless it is filled with water and placed only on the member.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form.
Et haec Ventosa quanto plus est magna, ut capiat aquam multam, est melior.	And this abscess, to the extent that it is larger and can hold much water, is better.
¶ De suspensione Sanguisugarum.	Of the Suspension of Bloodlettings.
Caput XCIX.	99th Chapter.
Sanguisugae non administrantur in pluribus, nisi in quibus membris non est possibilis positio uentosarum, propter paruitatem eorum, sicut labium, et gingiua, et eis similia.	Bloodletting instruments are not used on many people unless it is in those members where the position of abscesses is impossible due to their smallness, such as the lips and gums and similar things.
Aut in membro denudato a carne, sicut digitus, et nasus, et eis similia.	Or on an uncovered member deprived of flesh, such as a finger, nose, and similar things.
Et qualitas utendi eis est: ut ueneris ex Sanguisugis quae sunt in aquis dulcibus, mundis a putredinibus.	And the quality of using them is that you should take from bloodletting instruments that are in sweet and pure waters, free from putrefactions.
Deinde dimittantur die et nocte in aqua dulci, donec famelicae sint, et non remaneat in uentre earum aliquid.	Then they are left for a day and night in sweet water until they are hungry, and nothing remains in their belly.
Deinde euacuetur corpus in primis cum phlebotomia, et cum uentosis.	Then the body should be cleansed primarily by bloodletting and purging.
Deinde absterge membrum infirmi, donec rubeat.	Then wash the afflicted member until it turns red.
Postea ponantur super ipsum.	Afterwards place them on top of it.
Cum ergo implentur, et cadunt, et est possibilis suctio loci cum uentosa, tunc est magis ultimum in iuuamento: et si non, tunc ablue locum cum aceto.	When they are filled and fall, and it is possible to suck the place with a purging agent, then it is more effective for healing; and if not, then wash the area with vinegar.
Deinde cum aqua multa, et fricetur, et exprimatur.	Then with much water, rub it and express it.
Quod si prolongatur cursus sanguinis post casum Sanguisugarum, et est illud resudando: tunc infunde pannum lini in aqua frigida, et pone ipsum desuper, donec abscindatur resudatio.	But if the flow of blood is prolonged after a wound from Sanguisuga, and it is that which drips away; then dip a linen cloth in cold water, place it on top, until the dripping ceases.
Quod si multiplicatur sanguis, tunc pulueriza super ipsum zegi tritum, aut gallas, et similia eis ex stipticis: donec abscindatur sanguis.	But if the blood multiplies, then powderize superfine salt or gallstones, and similar substances from stiptics: until the blood ceases.
Aut ponantur super locum medietates fabarum excorticatarum: et dimittantur, donec adhaereant fabae in loco, nam sanguis abscinditur.	Or place on top of the area the middles of peeled broad beans: and leave them until they stick to the spot, for the blood is being stopped.
Et oportet si necessaria est iteratio Sanguisugarum, quando est possibile, mutare eas.	And it is necessary if the situation requires it, to change the Sanguisuga when possible.
Si autem prohibentur Sanguisugae a suspensione, tunc abstergatur locus cum sanguine recenti.	But if the Sanguisuga are prevented from hanging, then clean the area with fresh blood.
Aut fige acum in locis, donec egrediatur aliquid ex sanguine.	Or insert a probe into the area until something comes out of the blood.
Deinde ponantur, nam ipsae quando sentiunt aliquid ex sanguine, adhaerent statim.	Then place them, for they themselves immediately stick when they feel something coming from the blood.
Quando ergo uis ut cadant, pulueriza super eas aliquid ex aloe trito, aut salem, aut cinerem: et cadent statim.	When you want them to fall, powderize something from ground aloe, or salt, or ashes: and they will fall immediately.
¶ Partis Secundae Finis.	End of the Second Part.
¶ Liber Chirurgici Albucasis Pars III.	Book of Surgery by Albucasis, Part III.
¶ Sermo uniuersalis de restauratione, et dislocatione, et curatione torsionis, et similibus.	General discourse on restoration, and setting, and curing of twists, and similar things.
Caput I.	Here is the translation:
Hoc Capitulum etiam multotiens est necessarium in arte Medicinae, et est restauratio fracturae, et dislocationis accidentium in ossibus.	This chapter is also very necessary in the art of medicine, and it is a restoration of fractures and dislocations of accidents in bones.
Scitote o Filii, quia iactant se de hoc Capitulo stolidi medicorum et uulgi, et qui non inspexerunt unquam antiquorum librum, neque legerunt ex eo literam.	Know ye, sons, that foolish doctors and the common crowd boast about this chapter, and those who have never looked at an ancient book nor read a letter from it.
Et propter hanc caussam fit, quod iste modus ex scientiis in terra nostra est priuatus.	And because of this reason, the method based on knowledge is deprived in our land.
Et ego non obuiaui in eo unquam bono omnino, et non adeptus sum ex eo illud, quod sum adeptus nisi propter longitudinem lectionis librorum antiquorum, et studium super intellectum eorum, donec extraxi scientiam illius ex eis.	And I did not find in it anything good at all, and I was not able to obtain from it what I obtained except through the length of reading ancient books and study over their understanding, until I extracted the knowledge of that from them.
Deinde adhaesi experimento et studio longitudine uitae meae.	Then I adhered to experimentation and lengthy study throughout my lifetime.
Et iam descripsi uobis ex illo in hoc Capitulo totum quod continet scientia mea: et super quod praeteriit experimentum meum, postquam abbreuiaui illud uobis, et liberaui illud ex occupatione elongationis, et abbreuiaui illud fine abbreuiationis, et ostendi illud fine declinationis: et formaui in eo formas multas ex formis instrumentorum quae administrantur in eo, cum sit ex additione declinationis, sicut feci in duobus Capitulis praecedentibus.	And now I have described to you from that very thing in this chapter all that contains my knowledge: and beyond what went before, after having abbreviated it for you, and freed it from the occupation of elongation, and abbreviated it at the end of abbreviation, and shown it at the end of declination: and I formed many forms in it from the forms of instruments that are used in it, with is by addition of declination, just as I did in the two preceding chapters.
¶ Summae, et collectiones ex esse fracturae ossium, ex eis quarum praemissio necessaria est, antequam incipiamus rememorationem membrorum fractorum, et diuersorum, si uniuscuiusque.	Summaries and collections of the existence of bone fractures, from those whose preliminary necessity is required before we begin recalling the broken members and various ones if each.
Caput II.	Chapter II.
Oportet, ut dicamus in prologo huius Capituli, summas sermonis, et capitula, ad quarum intellectum cogitur in primis artifex ad stationem super earum ueritatem: scilicet ut uos, et qui sunt prompti, sciant, uel addiscant hanc artem nobilem, et alii a uobis.	It is necessary that we say in the prologue of this chapter the summaries and headings, by whose understanding the artist is compelled to take his stand above their truth: namely, that you and those who are prompt may know or learn this noble art from us.
Dico, ergo, quod quando accidit alicui fractura, aut dislocatio, aut torsio, aut casus: tunc oportet, ut properes in primis ad phlebotomandum eum, et soluendum ipsum, aut utraque simul: si non prohibeat aliquid, sicut debilitas uirtutis: aut est ille cui accidit aliquid ex illis puer, aut senex decrepitus: aut est tempus uehementis caloris, aut uehementis frigoris ualde.	I say therefore, that when it happens to someone a fracture, or dislocation, or twisting, or accident: then it is necessary that you hasten first to bleed him, and release him, or both at once: if nothing prevents, such as weakness of the virtue: or if he is a child who has fallen ill from one of those things, or an elderly decrepit person: or if the time is very hot with fever, or very cold indeed.
Deinde sit contentus in cibo suo, oleribus frigidis, et carnibus auium, et haedorum: et prohibe uinum, et carnes grossas, et repleri ex cibis et omni cibo qui replet uenas sanguine.	Then let him be content with his food, cold vegetables and bird meats, and the flesh of hares. And let him abstain from wine, and thick meats, and refrain from eating too much or any food that fills the veins with blood.
Donec quando securus sis ex apostemate calido, et non times effusionem materiei ad membrum: tunc redeat infirmus ad regimen suum primum cum quo cucurrit consuetudo eius.	Until you are free from a hot abscess and do not fear the discharge of matter onto the member; then the patient returns to his original regime with which he was accustomed.
Cum ergo incipit os fractum restaurari, tunc oportet, ut cibetur infirmus cibis nutrientibus nutrimento multo, grosso, graui, in quibus sit uiscositas: sicut cibaria facta ex tritico cocto cum aqua, et rizum, et capita, et pedes, et uentres uaccarum, et oua, et pisces recentes: et uinum grossum, et similia illis.	When the broken bone begins to be restored, then it is necessary for the patient to be fed nourishing foods in abundance, thick, heavy, and gelatinous: such as food made from cooked wheat with water, and rice, and heads, and feet, and intestines of calves, and eggs, and fresh fish, and thick wine, and similar things.
Cum hoc enim regimine fit coagulatio fracturae uelocius, et melius.	For with this regime, the coagulation of the fracture occurs more quickly and better.
Et scias, quod ossa fracta, quando sunt in uiris qui sunt in prima senectute, et decrepitis, non est possibile, ut continuentur et consolidentur secundum naturam suam semper, propter exiccationem membrorum eorum: et consolidantur et continuantur quae ex eis sunt in fine lenitatis, sicut ossa puerornm paruorum.	And know that when bones are fractured in old men who are in the first stage of old age and decrepitude, it is not possible for them to be held together and consolidated according to their natural state always, because of the drying up of their limbs: and they are consolidated and continued what remains of them at the end of their softening, like the bones of young children.
Verumtamen natura annectit super os fractum ex omni parte aliquid simile glutino, in quo est grossitudo, quo adhaeret et stringit ipsum, donec conglutinantur adinuicem, et ligantur adinuicem, donec uenit in fine fortitudinis et firmitudinis, sicut fuit in primis, donec non prohibet ipsum aliquid ab operationibus suis: et propter hanc caussam est necesse, ut ponas nutrimentum infirmi cibaria, in quibus sunt grauitas, et uiscositas, et grossitudo, sicut diximus.	However, nature attaches something similar to glue on both sides of the fractured bone, which has thickness and sticks together until they are glued and tied tightly, until it reaches the end of its strength and firmness, like in the beginning, until nothing prevents it from performing its functions: and because of this reason, it is necessary to place nourishment for the patient with foods that have weight, gelatinousness, and thickness, as we said.
Et scias, quod fracturae species sunt diuersae, secundum diuersitatem membrorum: quoniam fractura cruris, est diuersa a fractura ossis capitis: et fractura ossis pectoris, est diuersa a fractura ossis dorsi: et similiter reliqua membra omnia diuersa existunt adinuicem: et ego ueni cum rememoratione omnis speciei fracturae expositae in Capitulo suo distinctae ab alia.	And know that there are different kinds of fractures, according to the diversity of members: for a fracture of the leg is different from a fracture of the skull; and a fracture of the breastbone is different from a fracture of the backbone; and similarly all other members are different one from another until the end: and I come with the remembrance of every kind of fracture exposed in its own chapter, distinct from others.
Et diuersificantur species fracturae ossis etiam in seipsa.	And the types of bone fractures are differentiated even within themselves.
Quoniam fit fractura eius arcuata, praeter quod accidant in ea astellae.	Because it happens that a fracture is curved, besides which stars appear in it.
Et quandoque fit fractura eius secundum longitudinem ossis: et sunt fracturae eius satagiae, id est, astellae, et additiones procedentes, sicut sunt in calamo, cum aptatur cultello ad scribendum.	And sometimes a fracture occurs along the length of the bone; and there are fractures that are so called "satagiae", that is, stars, and additions proceeding, as are in a reed when it is adapted to writing with a pen.
Et non procedentes: et est fractura cum uulnere et disruptione in capite: et est fractura fissura parua.	And not proceeding; and there is a fracture with a wound and disruption at the head, and there is a fracture, a small cleft.
Et omni speciei est ingenium, uel instrumentum proprium in restauratione eius, secundum quod ueniet rememoratio eius, distincta in locis suis.	And every species has its own genius or proper instrument for restoration, according to the recollection of it, distinguished in its own places.
Et ex eo quo cognoscitur fractura ossis, est tortuositas eius, et ipsius eminentia: et apparitio eius sensui, et sonitus eius quando comprimis ipsum manu tua.	And since a bone fracture is known, its twistiness and prominence are apparent; and it appears to the sense, and its sound when you press it with your hand.
Quando ergo non est in loco tortuositas apparens, neque sonitus apud tactum tuum cum tangis os cum agitatione, neque inuenit infirmus magnum dolorem: tunc non est illic fractura, imo possibile est, ut sit tortuositas, aut fissura parua: non ergo oportet, ut moueas ipsum cum manu et compressione omnino, imo pone super ipsum ex medicinis, quarum uenit rememoratio, post momentum illud quod conuenit loco: deinde stringatur strictura subtili.	When therefore there is no apparent twistiness in the location, nor sound when you touch it with your hand after applying pressure, nor does an injured person find great pain; then there is no fracture there, nay, it may be that there is a twistiness or small cleft: therefore do not move it with your hand and compression entirely, but place on top of it medicines whose recollection comes, after the suitable moment in the location; then let it be tightened with a subtle string.
Et scias, quod locus quando arcuatur, et scinditur in duo, praeter quod accidant in eo satagiae, uerumtamen remouetur omnis pars a compari sua: tunc oportet tibi, ut incipias ab hora tua ad rectificationem eius, aequando ipsum antequam accidat ei apostema calidum.	And know that the location when it is curved and split into two, besides which stars appear in it, yet all parts are removed from their companion: then it behooves you to begin at your hour for its correction, equalizing it before a warm aposteme occurs.
Si autem accidat ei apostema calidum, tunc dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot, donec quiescat apoestema.	But if a warm aposteme occurs, then let it be for several days until the aposteme quiets down.
Deinde aequa ipsum secundum quemcunque modum potest ex lenitate et ingenio.	Then equalize it in whatever way possible with gentleness and ingenuity.
Et scias, quod restauratio eius, et ipsius aequatio, est facilior quam ossis, in quo accidunt satagiae.	And know that the restoration of it and its equalization is easier than for bones where stars appear.
Deinde stringe ipsum, secundum quod ueniet tibi rememoratio eius.	Then tie it in place according to how its memory comes back to you.
Si uero in osse sunt satagiae, tunc necessaria est extensio huius membri fracti ex duabus partibus, si manus sit, aut pes: aut cum manu tua, si membrum est paruum: aut cum duobus funibus, aut cum fune et manu.	If there are splinters in the bone, then it is necessary to extend this broken member from two parts, if it be a hand or foot: or with your own hand, if the member be small; or with two ropes, or with a rope and your hand.
Et sit positio tua qua ponis membrum super locum aequalem, secundum figuram suam naturalem, donec quando extenduntur partes membri fracti: tunc conare, ut redire facias illas additiones omni ingenio, et secundum quemcunque modum potes in locis suis: et caue secundum fortitudinem tuam, ne accidat super infirmum per operationem tuam dolor, neque laesio: et conare secundum fortitudinem tuam, ut applices unum duorum ossium cum socio suo, secundum meliores formas.	And be in the position you are placing the member on an equal place, according to its natural shape, until when the parts of the broken member are extended: then try to make those additions come back with all your skill and in any way you can in their places: and beware, according to your strength, lest there occur excessive pain or injury through your operation; and try, according to your strength, to join one bone to its fellow, according to the better forms.
Et oportet in illa hora, ut tentes et tangas ipsum manu tua.	And it is necessary at that hour for you to test and feel it with your own hand.
Si ergo uides illic aliquid diuersum, rectifica ipsum, et aequa illud per quantitatem tuae uirtutis.	If then you see something different there, correct it, and make it equal according to the quantity of your strength.
Et caue extensionem uehementem, et compressionem fortem, sicut faciunt multi stolidorum.	And beware of excessive extension and strong compression, as many foolish people do.
Multotiens enim faciunt accidere per operationem illam suam apostema calidum, aut contractionem in membro: sicut iam uidimus illud ex operationibus eorum multotiens.	For indeed they often cause an abscess to form hotly or a contraction in the member through their own operation, just as we have already seen from their many operations.
Deinde annecte post aequationem, et decentem operationem, et stricturam illius membri, et quietem, et tranquillitatem: et mone infirmum super ipsum.	Then connect it after the adjustment and gentle operation, and the binding of that member, and rest, and calmness: and caution the sick person over it.
Et fac ipsum cauere, ne moueat ipsum in hora suarum uigiliarum, et somni sui apud reuolutionem suam, et agitationem suam, et apud egestionem suam, et omnes motus suos ultima uirtute sua.	And make it so that it does not move during its own vigil and sleep, and during its own rotation, agitation, and evacuation, and all its movements with its utmost strength.
Et ut caueat, ne sit positio membri positio cum qua sequatur dolor.	And let him beware that the position of the member is not such as would lead to pain following it.
Quod est, quia quando sentit in dispositione positionis membri dolorem, aut laesionem: tunc oportet, ut permutes ipsum ad dispositionem aliam ab illa cum qua non sentiat dolorem.	Because when he feels pain or injury in the setting of the member's position, then it is necessary for him to change it into another setting in which he does not feel pain.
Et caue cum illo, ut sit positio eius illa aequalis, recta: ut non accidat in membro tortuositas, quando restauratur.	And beware that his position be equal and straight, so that there is not tortuosity in the member when restored.
Et qualitas stricturae membri fracti est, secundum quod narro.	And the quality of a broken limb's fracture is, according to what I narrate.
Scias, quod membra fracta diuersificantur in paruitate sua, et eorum magnitudine, et ipsorum forma.	Know that fractured limbs are distinguished by their smallness, and by their magnitude, and by their form.
Quae ergo ex eis sunt parua, sicut brachium, et digitus, et focile, et similia eis, tunc oportet, ut sit inuolutio panni mollis, subtilis.	What then are small among them, such as an arm, and a finger, and a toe, and similar to these, then it is necessary that there be wrapping with soft, thin cloth.
Quae autem ex eis sunt grossa, sicut coxa, et crus, oportet ut sit in eis inuolutio lata, dura.	But what are large among them, such as the hip and the thigh, it is necessary that there be wrapping with a wide, hard cloth.
Quoniam ligamentum latum, connectit membrum magnum, et stringit ipsum ab omni parte strictura aequali, ita quod non ingreditur ipsum macula.	For the broad band connects the large limb and tightens it equally from every part of the fracture, so that no stain enters.
Deinde incipe post euacuationem tuam ab aequatione ponere linimentum conueniens ad illud, in stuppa leni super locum fracturae ipsius.	Then after your own evacuation from equality, begin to put the suitable liniment on it, in a gentle poultice over the place of the fracture itself.
Deinde incipe inuoluere ligamentum super locum fracturae ipsius tribus inuolutionibus, aut quatuor, secundum quod meretur membrum: et stringe manum tuam parumper cum ligamento.	Then begin to wrap the bandage over the place of the fracture itself with three or four wrappings, according as the limb deserves it; and tighten your hand a little with the bandage.
Deinde uade cum eo ad partem superiorem a loco fracturae, et stringe minus quam fuit strictura tua, qua strinxisti locum fractum.	Then go with him to the upper part above the place of the fracture, and tighten less than your original tightening, which you tightened over the broken place.
Deinde elonga te cum inuolutione a loco fracturae parumper, et mollifica stricturam paulatim, donec capias ex loco sano rem magnam.	Then stretch yourself with the wrapping away from the place of the fracture a little, and gradually loosen the tightness until you reach a healthy part.
Deinde accipe uittam aliam, et inuolue eam iterum super locum fractum inuolutionibus.	Then take another bandage and wrap it again over the broken place with wrappings.
Postea uade cum inuolutione ad partem inferiorem a fractura.	Then go with the wrapping to the lower part below the fracture.
Et sit operatio tua in strictura inuolutionis, et mollificatione eius, secundum quod diximus in inuolutione prima superiore.	And let your operation be in the tightness of wrapping and loosening it, according to what we said in the first wrapping above.
Deinde pone inter inuolutiones ex stuppa leni, aut panno, cum quo aequetur tortuositas fracturae, si est in ea tortuositas: et si non, non ponas in ea aliquid.	Then put a thin poultice or cloth between the wrappings to equalize any tortuosity of the fracture if there is one; and if not, do not put anything in it.
Deinde inuolue super ipsam uittam aliam.	Then wrap another vine around it.
Postea aequa super has inuolutiones astellas decenter factas statim, si non est in loco inflatio, neque apostema calidum.	Next, place stars of equal number on top of these wrappings, made in thirty days' time, unless there is no swelling or warm abscess.
Si autem in ea est inflatio, aut apostema: tunc pone super eam quod sedet illud apostema, et auferat inflationem: et dimitte eam aliquot diebus.	But if there is swelling or abscess in it: then place on top of it what lies beneath the abscess, and remove the swelling; and let it be for a few days.
Deinde stringe super ipsam tunc astellas.	Then tie another vine on top of those stars.
Et sint Astellae ex medietatibus cannae latae, rasae, formatae sapienter: aut sint ex ligno unde fiunt cribra, quae fiunt ex pino, aut geraid, id est, ramis palmae, aut calingi: et sit amplitudo omnis Astellae, secundum hanc formam, et hanc eandem figuram.	And the stars should be made from the middle part of a broad cane, smooth and well-shaped; or they can be made from wood, such as pines, or geraid, that is, palm branches, or calingi: and the width of each star should be according to this shape and same figure.
Verumtamen oportet, ut Astella quae ponitur super ipsam tracturam, sit grossior et latior parumper, quam reliquae Astellae: et longitudo Astellae sit secundum quod licet membro ex magnitudine et paruitate.	However, it is necessary that the star placed on top of the wrapping be a little thicker and wider than the other stars: and the length of the star should be according to what is fitting for each member in size and smallness.
Deinde stringe super Astellas cum uitta alia, secundum stricturam primam eandem.	Then tie another vine on top of the stars with a binding similar to the first one.
Deinde liga desuper cum filis decenter, secundum quod diximus de strictura: et est, ut sit strictura tua super locum fracturae plus: et quanto plus elongatur a fractura sit, strictura minor.	Then bind above with threads in thirty days, according to what we said about binding: and it is, that your binding should be tighter over the place of the fracture, and as you move further away from the fracture, the binding should be looser.
Et oportet, ut sint fila media in grossitudine et subtilitate, et sint ex lino molli.	And it is necessary that the threads be medium in thickness and subtlety, and they should be made of soft linen.
Quoniam si fila sunt grossa, sicut uidi ex operatione stolidorum ponentium fila sua ex chordis lini tortis, est error magnus: quoniam cadit strictura cum eis extra qualitatem.	For if the threads are thick, as I have seen from the operations of foolish people who use twisted linen strings for their bindings, it is a great mistake: because the binding falls short of its quality.
Et fila subtilia iterum non conueniunt: quoniam tu non consequeris per stricturam cum eis illud quod uis.	And thin threads again do not agree: for you do not achieve through binding with them what you want.
Et non oportet, ut sit inter astellam et astellam minus quam digitus.	And it is not necessary that there be less than a finger's width between the stars.
Quod si laeditur infirmus per extremitates astellarum post stricturam in locis sanis: tunc pone sub eis ex stuppa leni, aut lana carminata, donec nihil laedatur ex illo.	If the injured person is hurt through the extremities of the star-shaped wounds after suturing in healthy places: then place under them a piece of soft cloth or knitted wool, until nothing is hurt from that.
Quando autem est fractura cum uulnere, et accidit disruptio in cute, ego ueniam cum rememoratione eius in capitulo secundum singularitatem.	But when there is a fracture with an injury and disruption occurs on the skin, I come back to it with a recollection of it in the second chapter by way of singularity.
Et scias, quod non omne membrum fractum oportet ut stringatur cum astellis a primo die.	And know that not every fractured member needs to be stitched with star-shaped sutures from the first day.
Quod est, quia membrum quando est magnum, non oportet ut ponas superipsum astellas, nisi post quinque dies, aut septem, aut plus, secundum securitatem tuam ab euentu apostematis calidi.	Because the member is large, it does not need to be covered with star-shaped sutures above it, unless after five days, or seven, or more, according to your own security from the risk of hot abscesses.
Et iste est modus emplastrorum, quibus restaurabant antiqui, quae ponuntur super fracturam et dislocationem.	And this is the method of plasters by which the ancients restored what is placed over fractures and dislocations.
¶ Modus Emplastri communis abbreuiati, restaurans fracturam, conueniens pluribus complexionibus, praecipue mulieribus, et pueris: quoniam est ex eo super quod non uincit calor, neque frigus.	The common plaster method of abbreviation, restoring a fracture, suitable for many complexions, especially women and children: because it is above what heat does not conquer nor cold.
Et est, ut accipias ex puluere molendini, et est medulla farinae quae pendet in parietibus molendini apud motum molae: et conficias ipsum sicut est, praeter quod cribelles ipsum cum albugine oui: et pone confectionem eius non spissam, neque subtilem.	And it is that you take from the flour mill dust, and it is the bran that hangs on the walls of the mill when the millstone is in motion: and you make it as it is, except for removing any husks with a layer of sheep's milk fat: and put the confection together not thick nor thin.
Deinde utere eo.	Then use it.
¶ Modus Emplastri alius, restaurantis fracturam, et dislocationem, et torsionem.	Another plaster method for restoring a fracture, and dislocation, and twisting.
Recipe almess, et laudani, et acaciae, et enulae, et mugath: et suc, omnium ana ʒ X myrrhae, et aloes amborum ana ʒ V et alethil ʒ XX terantur omnia, et cribellentur, et misceantur cum aqua alethil: aut cum albugine oui, si complexio infirmi est calefacta.	Recipe of almaces, and ladanum, and acacia, and enula, and mugwort: and the juice of all equal to 10 parts of myrrh, and aloe of both equal to 5 parts, and alethi equal to 20 times: pound all together, sift them, and mix with water of alethi: or with sheep's milk fat, if the patient has a warm complexion.
Deinde utere hoc emplastro.	Then use this poultice.
Nam ipsum est bonae compositionis, restaurat ossa fracta uelociter, et confert pluribus hominibus.	For it is of good composition, quickly heals broken bones, and benefits many people.
¶ Modus Emplastri alius, quod etiam confert fracturae et torsioni.	Another method of making a poultice that also helps with fractures and sprains.
Recipe mugath, et mess, et alteae albae, omnium ana ʒ X myrrhae, et aloes amborum ana ʒ V acaciae ʒ VI boli armeni ʒ XX terantur omnia contritione multa, et cribellentur, et conficiantur cum aqua, aut albugine oui: et administrentur.	Recipe of myrrh, and mastich, and white aloes, each equal to 10 parts; of both kinds of aloe, each equal to 5 parts; and armenian balsam, equal to 20 parts. All are to be pounded many times, and sifted, and mixed with water or egg-white: and it is to be administered.
¶ Modus Emplastri ad iuncturas, et ossa separata ex locis suis: et sedat dolorem accidentem eis, et scissuram ossis, et fracturam.	Another method of making a poultice for joints and separated bones from their places; and it calms the pain that has occurred to them, and splits in the bone, and fractures.
Sumatur lana succida, et submergatur in aceto, et oleo decocto: et ponatur super locum.	Take well-greased wool and immerse it in vinegar and oil that has been decocted; and place it on the spot.
Et in hoc quidem Emplastro non est uirtus restaurationis, sed est bonum in sedatione apostematis calidi: et expellit dolores proprie.	And in this poultice there is no power of restoration, but it is good for calming hot abscesses and expelling pains properly.
¶ Modus Emplastri, quod restaurat os fractum.	Another method of making a poultice that restores a broken bone.
Sume folia fici surdi, et folia papaueris syluestris: et tere omnia, et fac emplastrum ex utrisque.	Take leaves of mulberry and leaves of opopanax: and grind all into a powder, and make a poultice from both.
¶ Modus Emplastri abbreuiati, administrati apud restaurationem fracturae ossis: et quando tu uis resolutionem residui apostematis.	Another method of making a poultice for shortening the administration in restoring a broken bone; and when you wish to bring about the resolution of any remaining abscess.
Recipe radicis alteae, et camomillae, et florum uiolarum, et farinae herbi, omnium ana partem unam: terantur omnia, et conficiantur cum uino, si non est membrum calefactum.	Recipe of roots of white aloes, and camomile, and flowers of violet, and seeds of a herb, each one part: all are to be pounded and mixed with wine, unless the member is already warm.
Si uero est calefactum, tunc confice illud cum aqua coriandri humidi, aut cum aqua, et utere eo.	If it is already warm, then mix it with the moist water of coriander, or with water, and use it.
¶ Modus Emplastri alius fortioris in resolutione, quam istud primum, quando accidit apostema durum apud restaurationem membri.	Another method of making a poultice that is stronger for resolving than the first one, when there occurs a hard abscess during the restoration of a member.
Recipe radicis alteae, et seminis lini, et balaustiae, et melliloti, et samsuci, et floris uiolarum, et camomillae, omnium ana, partem unam, terantur omnia, et conficiantur cum aqua salicis, aut cum aqua dulci, aut cum uino.	Here is the translation:
Totum illud secundum caliditatem membri, et quietem caloris eius.	Everything concerning that is according to the warmth of the member and the calmness of its heat.
Hippocrates uero non dixit in libro suo, quod ponatur super membrum fractum apud restaurationem eius, nisi caerotum factum ex caera, et oleo: non aliud: et narrauit, ut sit medium inter grossitudinem et subtilitatem.	But Hippocrates did not say in his book that something should be placed on a fractured member at the time of its restoration, except a poultice made from caera and oil: nothing else. He narrated that it should be midway between thickness and subtlety.
Galeno autem uisum est, ut ponantur super membrum fractum apud restaurationem eius res, in quibus est exiccatio caliditatis, sicut myrrha, et aloes et olibanum, et similia eis ex eis quae narrauimus.	But Galen seems to have thought that things should be placed on a fractured member at the time of its restoration, which have an extinguishing quality of heat, such as myrrh, and aloes, and olibanum, and similar things to those we have mentioned.
¶ Modus Emplastri quod confert ad laesionem et dolorem.	The Method of Plastering which Relates to Injury and Pain.
Recipe mugath, et ciceris, et capillorum hominis incisorum, aut pennae auis, et alteae, et salis partes aequales: terantur, et cribellentur, et conficiantur: et fiat ex eo emplastrum.	Recipe equal parts of mugwort, cypress, and human hair clippings from the incisors or bird's feathers, and altoside: grind them, sift them, and mix them together. And make a plaster out of it.
Quantitas autem secundum quam oportet, ut remaneat ligatura, deinde soluatur, est, ut consideres tunc, si non accidit infirmo dolor, neque pruritus, neque mouetur os fractum a loco suo: tunc non resoluas ipsum diebus multis.	However, the quantity needed is such that the bandage remains in place and then dissolves, which you should consider as follows: if the patient does not experience pain, itching, or movement of the fractured bone from its original position; then do not dissolve it for many days.
Quod si accidat ei in loco pruritus uehemens, aut dolor inquietans, aut inflatio: tunc propera, et solue in hora ipsum, et aufer emplastrum ab eo: et accipe pannum lenem, aut spongiam marinam lenem, humidam: et submerge eam in aqua tepida, et ablue cum ea locum, donec quiescat pruritus, et sedetur dolor.	If it happens to him that there is intense itching or disturbing pain or swelling in the place; then hasten and dissolve it within an hour, and remove the plaster from him: and take a soft cloth or a marine sponge, moistened; and immerse it in warm water, and bathe with it until the itching subsides and the pain is assuaged.
Deinde dimitte membrum quiescere una hora.	Then let the member rest for one hour.
Deinde pone super ipsum lanam succidam, submersam in aceto et oleo, aut oleo rosato: et liga super ipsum nocte una, donec sis securus ab apostemate calido, et quiescat inflatio membri, et remoueatur dolor eius.	Then place over it a scalded wool, submerged in vinegar and oil, or rose oil; and bind over it for one night, until you are secure from the risk of warm aposteme, and the swelling of the member subsides, and the pain is removed.
Deinde itera ipsum ad stricturam subtilem, et emplastrum paruum: et non stringas ipsum constrictione tua prima, et subtilia cum eo, donec sanetur.	Then lead him to a subtle constriction, and prepare a small plaster; and do not tighten the constriction with your first compression, nor with a subtlety with it, until he is healed.
Quod si uides, quod apostema, et rubedo, et dolor, et inflatio, et omnia accidentia iam remota sunt penitus, et indiges emplastro et strictura, tunc itera illud sicut fecisti in primis aequaliter.	If you see that the apostema, redness, pain, swelling, and all the other accidents have entirely gone away, and you still need to apply an ointment and constriction, then lead him through it just as you did at first equally.
Quod si non accidit membro aliquid ex eis quae diximus, tune non soluas ipsum, nisi post tres dies, aut quatuor, aut quinque, aut septem.	If nothing of what we said happens to the member, then do not release it until after three days, or four, or five, or seven.
Et quando que dimittitur uiginti diebus totum illud, secundum quod apparet tibi ex solutione membri, sicut diximus, donec quando adhaeret fractura, et approximat coagulatio carnis super eam: adde etiam tunc in strictura plus quam strictura tua prima tota: et adde etiam in ingrossatione cibi infirmi, secundum quod praecessit rememoratio eius.	And when it is released after twenty days, altogether according to what appears to you from the dissolution of the member, just as we said, until the fracture adjoins and the coagulation of flesh is close: add also then in constriction more than your first constriction all; and add also then to the patient's diet in proportion to his previous remembrance.
Si autem uides locum fracturae iam exiccari, et extenuari plus quam oportet: tunc scias, quod nutrimentum prohibetur peruenire ad ipsum.	But if you see the place of the fracture to be dried up and wasted more than is proper: then you will know that nourishment is being prevented from reaching it.
Embroca ergo ipsum cum aqua tepida apud omnem uicem qua soluis ipsum, et sit illud in omnibus tribus diebus, et alleuia stricturam parumper.	Therefore apply it with warm water everywhere as you release it, and let that be for three days, and then slightly loosen the constriction.
Per hanc ergo operationem currit ad membrum nutrimentum, et sanatur uelociter.	Through this operation, nourishment is brought to the member, and it is healed quickly.
Illud autem quod faciunt stolidi restauratores ex fractura membri uice alia, quando non restauratur in primis, secundum quod oportet, et restauratur secundum tortuositatem, est error ex operatione eorum, et timor magnus: et si esset rectum, dixissent illud antiqui in libris suis, et operati fuissent cum eo.	But what those foolish restorers do to a broken member by another way, when it is not restored first as it should be, and restored according to the twisting, is an error from their operation, and a great fear: and if they were right, they would have said that in their ancient books, and worked with it.
Et ego non uidi alicubi eorum uestigium in illo omnino, et rectius est, ut non fiat illud.	And I did not see anywhere among them any trace of this altogether, and it is better that it not be done.
¶ De factura accidente in capite.	¶ About making an incision on the head.
Caput III.	Here is the translation:
Species fracturae sunt diuersae, et figurae eius multae: et caussae eius sunt distinctae.	The species of fracture are diverse, and its forms many; and its causes are different.
Nam ex fractura est quae fit a percussione cum ense: et percussio aufert os totum usquequo peruenit ad siphac, quod est sub osse, sicut facit axia in ligno: et propter illud nominatur haec species fracturae Axialis.	For there is a fracture that occurs through percussion with a sword: and the percussion takes away the whole bone as far as it reaches to the siphac, which is under the bone, just as an axle does in wood: and because of this, this type of fracture is called Axialis.
Aut ensis incidit quiddam ossis, et incidit faciem eius, et non penetrat incisio usque ad ultimum eius: et nominatur haec species fracturae Kalaan, id est, Leuatio absolute.	Or the sword falls upon some bone and cuts its surface, and does not penetrate as far as to the end of it: and this type of fracture is called Kalaan, that is, Simple Cleavage.
Et est uulnus duarum fracturarum, aut magnum, aut paruum.	And it is a wound of two fractures, or great, or small.
Et ex fractura est, quae est contritio, aut attritio: et caussa eius est percussio cum lapide, aut casus super lapidem, aut eis similia.	And there is a fracture that occurs through crushing or grinding: and the cause of it is percussion with a stone, or falling on a stone, or similar cases.
Et haec fractura est etiam aut penetrans, quae iam appropinquat panniculo, quod est sub osse: aut est in facie ossis: et est uulnus harum duarum fracturarum etiam aut paruum, aut magnum.	And this fracture is also either piercing, which already approaches the peritoneum, which is under the bone: or it is on the surface of the bone; and it is a wound of these two fractures, whether small or great.
Et ex fractura est, quae est occulta in osse in subtilitate capilli: et est fissura parua, et propter illud nominatur haec species fracturae Capillaris.	And there is a fracture that occurs hidden within the bone in subtlety like a hair: and it is a small crack, and because of this, this type of fracture is called Capillaris.
Et ex eis est fractura, quae fit a casu, aut percussione lapidis, et eis similium, quae faciunt ingredi laminam ossis ad interiora, et fit loco concauitas: sicut accidit caldariis aeris, quando occurrit eis percussio, et ingreditur pars eorum ad interiora.	And from these is a fracture that occurs through falling or percussion by a stone and similar causes, which cause the bone plate to advance into the interior, and it becomes hollowed out: just as happens in the blowing of bellows when they are struck, and a part of them advances into the interior.
Et plurimum quidem fit illud in capitibus humidorum ossium, sicut sunt capita puerorum.	And indeed most of it occurs in the heads of hollow bones, such as those of children.
Et fiunt omnibus istis speciebus fracturae satagiae separatae, et ego ueniam cum rememoratione illius totius in loco suo.	And all these types of fractures are separate and distinct, and I will come with the recollection of that whole in its place.
Et cognoscimus omnes has species fracturae per detectionem super eam, et inquisitionem earum cum tentis, et ablationem carnium corruptarum, quae sunt super eas.	And we know all these types of fractures by examination on them, and inquiry into those with probes, and removal of corrupted flesh that is above them.
Species uero Capillaris cognoscitur per hoc, quod detegitur super os, et abstergitur, et linitur super ipsum cum encaustro: fractura enim apparet nigra.	The species of Capillus is known by this, that it is removed from above the bone, and wiped clean, and smoothed over with wax: for a fracture appears black.
In curatione autem fracturae, considera in primis accidentia infirmi: tunc si uides ex accidentibus quod significet significatione manifesta super timorem, sicut uomitus cholerae, et extensio, et amissio intellectus, et abscisio uocis, et syncopis, et febris acuta, et egressus oculorum, et rubedo eorum, et similia eis ex accidentibus in pluribus dispositionibus, proculdubio non sanatur: et si uides accidentia non terrentia te, et speras salutem: tunc incipe curationem eius.	In the care of a fracture, consider first the accidents of the patient: then if you see that from the accidents there appears a clear indication of fear, such as vomiting of choler, and distension, and loss of intellect, and cutting off of speech, and syncope, and acute fever, and departure of the eyes, and redness of them, and similar things from accidents in many dispositions; without doubt it does not heal: and if you see that the accidents do not terrify you, and you hope for recovery; then begin its treatment.
Quod est, si uenit ad te uulneratus in primis cum uulneratur: et est illud in diebus hyemis, tunc oportet, ut studeas in ablatione ossis ante diem quartumdecimum secundum omnem dispositionem.	What if the wounded person comes to you first when they are wounded, and it is during winter days; then you should strive in removing the bone before the fourteenth day according to every disposition.
Et si est in diebus aestatis, tunc oportet, ut properes remouere os ante diem septimum, antequam corrumpatur quod est sub osse ex panniculo, et accidant illa accidentia quae narrauimus.	And if it is during summer days, then you should hasten to remove the bone before the seventh day, lest what is underneath the bone be corrupted by linen and those accidents which we have described occur.
Quod si fractura ossis iam peruenit ad panniculum tangentem cerebrum, et est cum minutiis, et attractione: tunc oportet, ut incidas partem comminutam, et attritam, secundum quod narro tibi.	What if the fracture of the bone has already reached the linen touching the brain and is with minute particles and attraction; then you should cut off the broken and bruised part according to what I tell you.
Et est, ut radas caput uulnerati: et detege super os secundum quemcunque modum possibile est tibi: et secundum figuram uulneris, et quod leue est super infirmum.	And it is that you should shave the head of the wounded person; and wipe over the bone in whatever way is possible to you; and according to the shape of the wound, and what is light on the patient.
Quod si accidat tibi apud detectionem ossis fluxus sanguinis, aut apostema calidum: tunc oppone ei cum eo quod oportet.	What if it happens to you while detecting the bone that there is bleeding or a warm abscess; then apply to him what is needed.
Et est, ut impleas locum cum pannis infusis in uino, et oleo rosato: et facias quiescere uulnus, donec sedetur apostema, et sis securus a fluxu sanguinis.	And it is that you should fill the place with cloths soaked in wine and rose oil; and make the wound quiet, until the abscess settles, and be secure from bleeding.
Deinde incipe in curatione ossis, et ablatione eius.	Then begin the treatment of the bone and its removal.
Et illud fit secundum unum duorum modorum.	And this is done according to one or two methods.
Modus quidem unus est, ut incidas os cum Incisorio strictae aciei: et haec est forma eius.	One method indeed is to cut the bone with a sharp-edged chisel; and this is its shape.
Dende administra Incisorium aliud post Incisorum latius eo parumper: et haec est forma eius.	Then take another chisel, one that is broader than the first one by a bit, and this is its shape.
Deinde administra etiam Incisorium aliud latius etiam quam secundum.	Then take also another chisel, one that is even broader than the second one.
Et modus secundus est, ut sit apud te numerus Incisoriorum diuersorum: quorum quaedam sint latiora quibusdam, et quaedam eorum breuiora quibusdam: et sint in ultimo acuitatis extremitatum suarum, et sint ex ferro indo, aut fuled: et utere facilitate in percussione super Incisorium, ut non concutiat caput, et laedat ipsum.	And the second method is that you should have a variety of chisels at your disposal: some should be broader than others, and some should be shorter than others; and they should be in the last degree of sharpness on their edges, and made of iron or steel; and use them with ease to strike the chisel, so as not to shake the head and hurt it.
Si autem os est forte, durum: tunc oportet, ut perfores in circumitu eius, antequam tu administres Incisoria, cum Terebris quae nominantur Terebra non profundantia: et non nominantur ita, nisi quoniam ipsa non pertranseunt terminum ossis carnei ad illud, quod est post ipsum: propterea, quod Terebro est extremitas rotunda super illud, quod est sub capite eius acuto, similis margini, et circulus paruus prohibet submergi, et pertransire spissitudinem ossis.	But if the bone is hard and tough: then it is necessary to perforate around its circumference before you administer chisels, with drills that are called non-penetrating drills; and they are not so named unless because they do not pass beyond the end of the bony part behind it. Because the drill has a rounded tip above what is under its sharp head, similar to an edge, and a small circle prevents it from sinking in and piercing through the thickness of the bone.
Et conuenit tibi, ut accipias ex istis Terebris numerum multum, quorum unumquodque conueniat quantitati spissitudinis ossis, donec praesens sit tibi omni craneo Terebrum: cuius extremitatis acutae quantitas in longitudine et breuitate sit, secundum quantitatem spissitudinis illius cranei.	And it is fitting for you to take a great many of these drills, each one corresponding to the thickness of the bone, until you have with you a drill suitable for every kind of skull. And the length and shortness of the sharp end of this drill should correspond to the thickness of that skull.
Et haec est forma trium specierum Terebrorum, uel Trepanorum.	And this is the form of three kinds of drills, or trephines.
Qualitas autem perforandi in circumitu ossis fracti, est: ut ponas Terebrum super os, et reuoluas ipsum digitis tuis, donec scias, os iam penetratum esse.	The quality of drilling around the broken bone is: to place the drill on the bone and turn it with your fingers until you know that the bone has been pierced.
Deinde permuta Terebrum ad locum alium, et pone quod est inter omne foramen quantitatem grossitudinis radii, aut circiter illud.	Then move the reamer to another place and put what is between all the openings of the radius's thickness or around that.
Deinde incide cum Incisoriis quod est inter omne foramen ex osse: et fac illud subtilius quam potes super illud ex fine leuitatis, sicut diximus, donec eradices os, aut manu tua, aut cum aliquo alio ex quibusdam instrumentis, quae parasti ad illud: sicut tenaliae, et forpices subtiles.	Then cut with the resectors what is between all openings of the bone: and make it thinner than you can above that from the end of levity, as we said, until you eradicate the bone, or by your hand, or with some other instrument which you prepared for this purpose, such as tenaculae and subtle forceps.
Et oportet, ut caueas omni cautela, ne tangat Terebrum, aut Incisorium aliquid ex siphac.	And it is necessary that you beware of all caution lest the reamer or resector touch anything from the siphon.
Cum ergo circumieris os perforando, et separatum fuerit a siphac, si fuerit continuum cum eo, et extraxeris ipsum, oportet ut radas, et aeques extremitatem eius quod remanet in osse cum instrumento alio simili Incisorio.	When therefore you have circumcised the bone by perforating and it has been separated from the siphon, if it was continuous with it and you have extracted it, it is necessary that you rasp and equalize the extremity of what remains in the bone with another similar resector.
Verumtamen oportet, ut sit tenuis et subtilis magis aliis Incisoriis.	However, it is necessary that it be thin and subtle more than other resectors.
Quod si remanet aliquid ex ossibus paruis, et satagiae: tunc accipe ea cum facilitate, cum eo quod est apud te ex instrumentis.	And if anything remains of small bones and fragments: then take them up with ease with the instrument that is among those which are with you.
Deinde cura uulnus post illud cum liciniis, et unguentis quae diximus.	Then care for the wound after that with lint and ointments which we said.
Et modus alius operationis est facilis, prorsus longinquus a timore: quem dixit Galenus, et laudauit ipsum laude magna: et iste est sermo eius.	And another mode of the operation is easy, absolutely far from fear: which Galen said and praised it with great praise: and this is his saying.
Necese est tibi in primis, ut incipias detegere partem ossis ex loco, in quo fractura est uehementior, et manifestior: donec quando detexeris illam partem, et posueris sub eo extremitatem huius Incisorii lenticularis, cuius haec est forma.	It is necessary for you first to begin to uncover the part of the bone from the place where the fracture is more violent and manifest: until when you have uncovered that part and placed the end of this lens-shaped resector underneath it, which has this shape.
Et pars lenticularis, lenis non incidit aliquid: et pars acuta eius in duabus lateribus eius uadens in longitudinem, sicut uides: ut sit pars lenticularis innixa ad siphac, facie eius incidente acuta in osse.	And the lens-shaped part does not cut anything: and the sharp part of it goes into two sides of it along its length, as you see: so that the lens-shaped part is attached to the siphon, with its acute face cutting into the bone.
Deinde percute super Incisorium a parte una cum malleo paruo, donec incidas totum os cum facilitate, sicut reuoluitur: et tu sis securus ex panniculo, quod non accidat in eo accidens, quod timeas prorsus.	Then strike above the Incisor bone on one side with a small mallet, until you cut through the whole bone easily, as it turns over; and be sure with a cloth, lest anything happen to you that you would fear entirely.
Et si medicans non esset stultior hominum, et magis ignarus eius, nec esset dormiens, tunc si remaneret aliquid annexum ossi ex panniculo in quibusdam locis, incideret ipsum ab eo cum extremitate incisorii lenticularis ipsius, et liberaret ipsum ab eo cum facilitate.	And if the physician were not more foolish than men and more ignorant of it, nor sleeping, then if anything remained attached to the bone from a cloth in certain places, he would cut off that part with the end of the incisor's lens itself, and free it with ease.
Liberatur enim ab eo sine nocumento, et absque timore.	It is freed from him without harm, and without fear.
Et si fractura ossis non penetret usque ad panniculum, et illud quod abscinditur ab osse est facies eius, et remanent in ipso asperitas et satagiae subtiles: tunc oportet, ut radas illam asperitatem, et eradices illas satagias cum rasoriis subtilibus ex quibus praeparasti numerum diuersarum quantitatum, ut sit tibi possibile administrare ex eis in omni loco conuenientiora eorum, et rectiora ipsorum, secundum illud ad quod perducit te operatio, et ipsum os fractum, et figura eius.	And if the bone fracture does not penetrate to the cloth, and what is being cut off from the bone is its face, and there remain on it roughness and subtle ridges: then you must take away that roughness, and remove those ridges with fine rasors which you prepared in different quantities, so that it will be possible for you to apply them in any suitable place of their own, and straighten up those things, according to what the operation leads you to, and the fractured bone, and its shape.
Et oportet, ut administres in rasione tua, qua in primis radis os, latius illorum rasoriorum.	And it is necessary for you to apply yourself with your own reason, by which you first roughen the bone, and more widely than those fine rasors.
Deinde utere post ipsum subtiliore eo.	Then use it after that one, finer.
Et non cesses facere illud secundum continuitatem, donec peruenias ad administrandum tenuius, et subtilius eorum omnium.	And do not cease to do that in succession, until you reach the point of administering it more thinly and subtly than all of them.
In unaquaque autem fissurarum reliquarum paruarum capillarium, et fractura subtili, oportet ut administres curam, secundum illud quod perducit ad rectificationem eius.	In each of the remaining small cracks and fractures, it is necessary to apply care, according to what leads to its correction.
Et est res quae non occultatur super omnem, cui in hac arte est quodlibet studium, et stetit super illud quod scripsimus, et ostendimus in fracturis magnis.	And it is a thing that is not hidden from anyone, to whom every pursuit is dedicated in this art, and stands over what we have written, and shown in great fractures.
Si autem panniculus detectus retinetur, quando tu eradicas os: tunc oportet, ut accipias pannum lini, secundum quantitatem uulneris, et submerge ipsum in oleo rosa, et pone ipsum super orificium uulneris.	If however the cloth is detected and retained when you remove the bone: then it is necessary for you to take a linen cloth, according to the size of the wound, and submerge it in rose oil, and place it over the opening of the wound.
Deinde accipe pannum alium duplicatum, aut triplicatum, et submerge ipsum in uino et oleo rosa, et pone ipsum super pannum primum: et fac illud quam facilius potes super illud, ut non grauetur siphac.	Then take another cloth, doubled or tripled, and immerse it in wine and rose oil. Place it on the first cloth, and do that as easily as you can over it, so that it is not made too tight.
Deinde administra supra ipsum ligamentum latum: et non stringas ipsum, nisi per quantitatem quae teneat uulnus tantum: et dimitte ipsum cum hac cura die uno, aut diebus duobus, donec sis securus ab apostemate calido.	Then apply the broad ligament above it: and do not draw it tight except for as much as will hold the wound; and leave it with this care for one day or two days, until you are sure against a hot abscess.
Deinde solue ipsum, et administra post illud medicinas cum quibus est superflua siccitas: sicut radices lilii, et farina herbi, et puluis thuris, et aristolochia, et similia eis: et est, ut facias ex istis medicinis puluerem, qui puluerizetur super uulnus sicut sunt siccae.	Then loosen it and apply medicines to what is excessive dryness, such as lily roots, and herb flour, and frankincense powder, and aristolochia, and similar things: and do this by making a powder from these medicines which will be scattered over the wound like dry things.
Et uniuersaliter administra in illo omnem medicinam de proprietate cuius est ut abstergat, et non mordicet.	And universally apply to it all medicine that has a property of cleansing and not biting.
Et caue secundum tuam uirtutem, ut uulnus in curatione tua sit limpidum: neque sit in ea sordes unguenti, neque sordicies.	And beware according to your ability, so that the wound is clean in your treatment: nor be it dirty with ointment, nor fouled.
Neque dimittas uirus aggregari in eo omnino: quoniam quando uirus aggregatur super panniculum cerebri, corrumpit eum, et putrefacit ipsum, et accidit super infirmum post illud malicia magna: et iam accidit in siphac capitis, cum mundificatur ab eo os, praecipue quando negligitur cura eius, nigredo in superficie eius.	Nor should you allow the discharge to accumulate completely: for when the discharge accumulates on the brain cloth, it corrupts it and putrefies it, and a great evil occurs afterwards on the sick person, especially when the surface is not cleaned, particularly when its care is neglected, blackness forms on its surface.
Considera ergo tunc, si accidunt infirmo accidentia quae diximus, scias, quia est pernitiosum proculdubio.	Therefore consider then, if accidents befall the sick person as we have said, you will know that it is undoubtedly pernicious.
Et si nigredo non accidit, nisi a medicina quae ponitur super ipsum, et est in uirtute illius medicinae, ut faciat illam nigredinem: tunc oportet, ut accipias ex melle partem unam, ex oleo rosato partes tres, et linias cum eis pannum.	And if blackness does not occur except from the medicine that is placed on it, and it is in the power of that medicine to cause that blackness: then you should take one part from honey, three parts from rose oil, and mix with them a cloth.
Deinde pone ipsum super siphac: postea cura ipsum cum speciebus curationis quae conueniunt, donec sanetur.	Then place it on the wound: afterwards care for it with remedies that are suitable, until it is healed.
¶ De restauratione Nasi quando frangitur.	On the restoration of the nose when it is broken.
Caput IIII.	Chapter IV.
Scias, quod non franguntur ex Naso nisi duae partes eius superiores simul, aut una earum: propterea, quod ipse sunt duo ossa: quoniam inferius eius est cartilaginosum, non frangitur, et non accidit ei nisi attritio, et tortuositas, et simitas.	Know that the upper two parts of the nose are not broken at the same time, nor one of them, because they consist of two bones. The lower part is cartilaginous and does not break, but rather suffers from abrasion, twisting, and curvature.
Si frangitur una duarum partium eius, tunc oportet, ut intromittas digitum paruum in foramen Nasi, et aeques illam fracturam digito tuo indice, et pollice deforis, donec redeat Nasus super figuram suam naturalem: et fiat illud arte, cum facilitate.	If one of the two parts of the nose is broken, then you should insert a small finger into the nasal cavity and use your index finger and thumb to equalize the fracture until the nose returns to its natural shape. And do this skillfully with ease.
Et caue, ne accidat per operationem tuam illam super infirmum dolor.	And beware that the patient does not experience excessive pain during your operation.
Quod si fractura est in superiore parte Nasi, et non perueniat ad illam digitus: tunc oportet, ut aequetur extremitate radii, in quo sit grossitudo parua.	If the fracture is in the upper part of the nose and cannot be reached by your finger, then you should use the end of a radius bone with a small knob on it.
Si uero fractura est in duabus partibus, tunc fac simile illius: et propera cum restauratione eius in die primo fracturae, si est possibile.	If the fracture is in both parts of the nose, then do the same thing; and if possible, hasten with its restoration on the first day after the fracture.
Et si non, tunc post diem septimum, aut decimum apud quietem apostematis calidi.	And if not, then afterwards, after seven or ten days in a state of calm and free from suppuration.
Deinde intromitte in extremitate Nasi licinium ex panno lini, si fractura est in parte una: aut intromite duo licinia si fractura est in duabus partibus: et sit in licinio grossitudo tantae quantitatis, quae impleat foramen Nasi.	Then insert a linen cloth into the end of the nose, if the fracture is in one part; or insert two cloths if the fracture is in both parts. And let the thickness of the cloth be such that it fills up the nasal cavity.
Et dixerunt quidam antiquorum restauratorum, ut infundantur licinia in butyro, et permutentur omni die.	And certain old restorers said to immerse the cloths in butter and change them every day.
Illud uero non uidetur mihi, imo oportet, ut infundatur licinium in albugine oui, confecto cum puluere molendini.	But I do not see it that way, rather it should be soaked with egg white, mixed with flour mill powder.
Deinde dimitte licinium, donec firmetur os, et induretur cartilago.	Then leave the cloth until the bone is solid and the cartilage is hardened.
Et quandoque intromittitur in Nasum loco licinii penna anseris, postquam inuoluitur super ipsam pannus lenis: et fit, quod ipsa tenet fracturam Nasi uehementius, et ut non prohibeatur infirmus ab inspiratione.	And sometimes a goose feather is inserted into the nose in place of the cloth, after it has been wrapped with a soft cloth; and it happens that it holds the nasal fracture more firmly, so that the patient may not be hindered from breathing.
Et non est haec res necessaria.	And this is not necessary.
Si uis, fac illud: et si uis, fac licinia.	If you wish, do that; and if you wish, make an incision.
Quod si accidat Naso iterum dum operaris apostema calidum, emplastra nasum cum caeroto, aut cum coto infuso in oleo rosato, aut modico ex dyaquilon.	But if an apostema warm should occur on the nose while you are operating again, plaster the nose with cerate, or with cotton steeped in rose oil, or a little from dyaquilon.
Si autem non accidit apostema calidum, tunc oportet, ut emplastres ipsum cum farina sisami, et puluere thuris confecti cum albugine oui.	But if a warm apostema does not occur, then it is necessary to plaster it with sesame flour and incense powder made from the whites of eggs.
Deinde pone super ipsum stuppam lenem, et non liges Nasum cum aliquo omnino.	Then place a soft cloth over it, and do not bind the nose with anything at all.
Si uero franguntur ossa Nasi fractura parua, aut comminuuntur, tunc oportet, ut scindas super ea, et extrahas ipsa cum instrumentis quae conueniunt eis.	If the bones of the nose are broken into small pieces or fragmented, then it is necessary to split them apart and remove them with instruments that fit.
Deinde sue scissuram, et cura ipsum cum eo quod incarnat, et consolidat ex emplastris conuenientibus ad illud, uel unguentis.	Then sew it up and care for it with what enfles it, and consolidate it with suitable plasters or ointments.
Quod si accidat inter Nasum uulnus, tunc oportet, ut cures ipsum cum liciniis: et administres cannulam de plumbo, donec sanetur.	But if a wound occurs between the nose and upper lip, then it is necessary to care for it with licinia and administer a lead cannula until it heals.
¶ De restauratione Mandibulae inferioris, quando disrumpitur.	Of the restoration of the lower jaw when it is dislocated.
Caput V.	Chapter 5.
Quando disrumpitur Mandibula inferior, et fractura eius non est cum uulnere: conspice tunc si est fractura eius deforis tantum, et non frangitur in duo, et curuatur ad interiora: tunc cognitio eius est facilis.	When the lower jaw is dislocated and there is no fracture with a wound: then look to see if it is fractured only on the outside and not broken into two parts, and bent towards the inside: then its recognition is easy.
Oportet ergo, si est fractura eius in parte dextra, ut intromittas digitum indicem sinistrae in os infirmi: similiter si fractura est in mandibula sinistra, tunc intromitte indicem manus dextrae: et impelle cum eo gibbositatem fracturae deintus cum facilitate ad exteriora cum manu tua altera ab interiori parte ossis decenter, et cum eo aequa ipsam.	Therefore, if the fracture is in the right part of the jawbone, you should insert your left index finger into the weak bone: similarly, if the fracture is on the left side of the mandible, then insert the index finger of your right hand: and push with it the curvature of the fracture inward from behind with your other hand, and make it equal.
Quod si fractura mandibulae iam separata est in duo, tunc oportet, ut administres extersionem a duabus partibus, secundum rectitudinem: donec possibilis sit aequatio eius.	But if the fracture of the jawbone is already separated into two parts, then it is necessary to administer extension from both sides, according to straightness: until it is possible to make it equal.
Si autem iam accidit in dentibus commotio, aut disruptio: tunc stringe illos de quibus speras quod remaneant cum filo auri, aut argenti, aut seta.	If however a commotion or disruption has already occurred in the teeth: then bind them with the remaining ones using a gold wire, silver wire, or silk.
Deinde pone super mandibulam fractam caerotum.	Then place a splint above the fractured jawbone.
Deinde pone super ipsum pannum duplicatum, et pone super pannum astellam magnam decenter factam: aut frustum cutis soleae aequale, in longitudinem mandibulae.	Then place a doubled cloth on top of it and place a large, well-made asterisk or a piece of sole skin the same length as the jawbone.
Deinde liga ipsum desuper, secundum quod praeparatur tibi ligatura eius, et conuenit ipsius applicatio, donec non destruitur: et praecipe infirmo, uti tranquillitate et quiete: et pone cibum eius sorbitiones lenes.	Then bind it above with the binding you have prepared for it, and apply it as suits its application, until it is not destroyed; and instruct the patient to use quiet and calmness: and give them gentle sips of food.
Si autem estimas, quod iam alteratur aliquid figurae aliquo modorum: tunc propera, et solue ipsum in die tertio.	If however you think that something is altering its shape in some way: then hurry and release it on the third day.
Deinde rectifica quod alteratum est ex eo, et emplastra ipsum ex puluere molendini, cum albugine oui, aut cum farina sisami, postquam tu abstuleris caerotum: et pone super emplastrum lanam lenem.	Then straighten out what has been altered from that and apply a poultice to it using mill dust with egg white or sesame flour after you have removed the splint: and place a soft wool cloth on top of the poultice.
Dum ergo permanet annexum illud emplastrum super ipsum, et non alteratur ossis dispositio, dimitte ipsum, ne soluas, donec sanetur: aut stringe fracturam.	While that poultice remains attached to it and the bone arrangement does not change, release it without breaking, until it is healed: or bind the fracture.
Multotiens enim stringitur haec fractura in tribus septimanis.	For this fracture is often bound for three weeks.
Quod si interim accidat apostema calidum, tunc administra illud quod diximus multotiens in sedatione eius, donec remoueatur illud apostema.	And if a warm abscess should occur in the meantime, then administer what we have said many times for soothing it, until that abscess is removed.
Et si fractura est cum uulnere, considera.	And if the fracture is with an wound, take notice.
Namsi iam separatur ex osse frustum, aut a satagie: tunc subtilia te in hoc, ut auferas illa frusta satagiae cum eo quod conuenit tibi in ablatione eorum ex instrumentis.	But if the fragment has separated from the bone or the socket: then be subtle about this and remove those fragments with what suits you for their removal using instruments.
Si uero orificium uulneris est strictum, tunc amplifica ipsum cum phlebotomo secundum quantitatem necessitatis tuae.	If the wound's opening is tight, then enlarge it with a phlebotomizer according to the necessity of your own.
Deinde quando abstuleris illa satagie, et non remanserit ex eis aliquid, sue tunc orificium uulneris, si est amplum: et si non, pone super ipsum ex emplastris quae conueniunt ad illud, et incarnant illud, donec sanetur.	Then when you have removed those socket fragments and nothing remains, or if the wound's opening is large; and if not, place a poultice on top that suits it to heal and cover it until it is healed.
¶ De restauratione Furculae, quando frangitur.	On the restoration of the clavicle when it is broken.
Caput VI.	Chapter Six.
Plurimum quidem frangitur Furcula ab anteriore parte ex parte humeri, et fractura eius fit secundum unum trium modorum.	Indeed, the clavicle is often broken at its anterior part from the shoulder, and the fracture occurs according to one of three modes.
Aut enim frangitur et separatur in duo, praeter quod accidant in ea satagiae: et est facilius ad restaurationem eius.	Or it is broken and separated into two parts, apart from the difficulties that occur in it; and this is easier to restore.
Aut ita, quod accidunt in osse satagiae: et est difficilius ad restaurationem.	Or so that there are difficulties in the bone itself; and this is more difficult to restore.
Aut ita, quod est fractura cum uulnere.	Or thus, with a fracture accompanied by a wound.
Et operatio in ea quando fractura est absque uulnere, est, ut facias praesentes esse duos ministros, ut teneat unus eorum adiutorium quod sequitur Furculam fractam, et alter extendat collum uersus partem.	And the operation in this case when there is no wound is to have two attendants, so that one of them supports the fractured clavicle with the aid that follows it, and the other stretches out the neck towards the affected side.
Deinde aequa fracturam digitis tuis, donec fiat forma eius, secundum quod oportet: et non sit in ea eminentia, neque concauitas.	Then equalize the fracture with your fingers until its form is restored, as it should be; and that there may not be any prominence or concavity.
Quod si indiges extensione plus, tunc oportet, ut ponas sub titillico infirmi spheram ex panno, aut lana: et sit magnitudo eius secundum quantitatem necessitatis tuae: et extende, et eleua Furculam, et coarta spheram manu tua, donec aeques fracturam, secundum quod oportet.	And if you need more extension, then it is necessary to place under the patient's tittilico a ball made of cloth or wool, and its size should be according to the quantity of your need: and stretch out and elevate the clavicle, and bind the ball with your hand until the fracture is equalized, as it should be.
Quod si non potes trahere extremitatem Furculae ad exteriora: propterea, quia peruenit ad profundum: tunc oportet, ut resupinetur infirmus super ceruicem suam: et ponas sub humero eius puluinar medium in magnitudine, et premat minister humerum eius ad inferiora, donec eleuetur os Furculae quod est in profundo ad sursum: atque tunc rectifica fracturam, et aequa eam digitis tuis.	And if you are unable to pull the end of the clavicle outward because it has gone too far: then it is necessary to have the patient rest on his back over his own chest; and place a medium-sized pillow under his shoulder, and have the attendant press down on his shoulder until the bone of the clavicle that is deep is lifted up towards the top: and then correct the fracture and equalize it with your fingers.
Si autem sentis sathaiatum ex Furcula, et mouetur: tunc oportet, ut findas super illud, et extrahas ipsum alsathaiatum cum facilitate.	If however you feel a swelling from the clavicle and it moves: then it is necessary to bind it above, and remove the swelling with ease.
Si autem est retentum in osse, tunc ingenia in incisione eius cum uno Incisoriorum quae praeparasti ad illud, postquam tu posueris sub Furcula instrumentum quod seruat sifach: et est instrumentum ex ligno, aut ex ferro.	If it is retained in bone, then apply your skills to the incision of it with one of the Incisors that you prepared for that purpose, after you have placed under the Furcula instrument which saves the sifach: and this instrument is made of wood or iron.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its shape.
Assimilatur cochleari cui non est concauitas.	It resembles a snail shell which has no hollow part.
Et sit latitudo eius secundum illud quo indiges eo ex magnitudine ossis, et paruitate eius.	And let its width be according to that which you desire in it, depending on the size of the bone and its shape.
Longitudo uero eius etiam secundum quod possibile est tibi ad operationem.	But its length also according to what is possible for you to do in the operation.
Et habeat duas extremitates, sicut uides: et extremitas una sit ampla, et altera stricta.	And let it have two ends, as you see: and one end be broad, and the other narrow.
Si autem disruptio uulneris quod scidisti quando extraxisti sathaiatum ossis, est ampla, et securaris ab apostemate calido: tunc aggrega duo labia uulneris cum sutura.	If however the disruption of the wound that you cut when you removed the broken bone is wide, and you secure it from hot apostema: then gather together the two lips of the wound with a suture.
Et si disruptio est parua, aut times apostema calidum: tunc imple uulnus cum pannis, et puluillis secundum quantitatem scissurae uulneris.	And if the disruption is small, or you fear hot apostema: then fill the wound with cloth and flax according to the size of the cut in the wound.
Quod si accidat apostema calidum, tunc infunde pannum in oleo rosato, et aceto, et uino, et pone super ipsum.	Which if hot apostema happens, then pour a cloth into rose oil, vinegar, and wine, and place it on top.
Strictura uero ossis quando est absque uulnere, et absque sectione, est, ut ponas super os emplastrum factum ex farina molendini cum albugine oui.	The binding of the bone when it is without a wound and without cutting is, as you place an ointment made from wheat flour with egg white on the bone.
Et pone stuppam lenem super ipsum.	And put a smooth bandage on top.
Deinde pone spheram sub titillico eius, si indiges illa.	Then place a ball underneath the splint of it, if you need it.
Deinde accipe himematem, id est, rotam quam tenent Saraceni, quae sit longa ualde: et sit latitudo eius palmi unius, aut circiter illud.	Then take a himemat, that is, a wheel which the Saracens hold, which is very long: and let its width be the breadth of one hand, or about that.
Deinde pone puluillum duplicatum super stuppam et emplastrum.	Then place a doubled flax on top of the bandage and ointment.
Deinde accipe astellam ex tabula subtili, cuius latitudo sit trium digitorum, et in longitudine similiter.	Then take a needle made from fine board, whose width is three fingers, and similarly in length.
Deinde inuolue eam in panno.	Then wrap it in cloth.
Deinde inuolue pannum illum cum astella in loco alhimemati qui cadit super fracturam et locum.	Then wrap the cloth around with a small piece of linen in that place where the inflammation falls on the fracture and the wound.
Deinde pone alhimemati super fracturam sicut reuoluiur, et inuolue eam super collum eius, et sub titillico eius sano, et sub titillico eius infirmo: et reduc eam super omnem partem, et quomodo uides quod strictura tenet fracturam strictura decenti: et est illud, quod non occultatur super te, et totum, ut non remoueatur astella desuper os fractum.	Then place the inflammation over the fracture as it revolutes, and wrap it around his neck, and under his chin sound, and under his chin weak: and bring it over all parts, and see how the constriction holds the fracture in its constriction: and that is what does not conceal itself from you, and all so that the linen thread does not come off above the broken bone.
Et propter hoc oportet, ut aspicias infirmum in omni die.	And therefore it is necessary for you to look at the weak person every day.
Quotiens ergo mollificatur ligamentum, et uides astellam iam remoueri: tunc rectifica illud, et stringe ligamentum.	Whenever then the bond becomes relaxed and you see the linen thread has already come off: then straighten it out and tighten the bond.
Deinde pone somnum infirmi super dorsum eius, et pone sub titillico eius apud somnum eius puluinar paruum in nocte, ut cum eo eleuetur adiutorium eius a latere ipsius.	Then place the patient's sleep on his back and place a small pillow under his chin while he is sleeping at night, so that with him may be lifted up to him his aid from the side of himself.
Eleuatur ergo fractura furculae per eleuationem humeri.	The fracture of the wing is therefore elevated by the elevation of the shoulder.
Aut liga brachium eius ad collum ipsius: et non soluas ligamentum, si non accidat in loco accidens ex pruritu, aut ab apostemate, usque ad duodecim dies.	Or bind his arm to his neck: and do not loosen the bandage unless something happens by chance from itching or an abscess up to twelve days.
Deinde renoua emplastrum, si uideris faciem eius ad illud.	Then renew the poultice if you see his face is towards it.
Et adde in strictura, et dimitte ipsum, donec restauretur et coaguletur.	And add to the constriction, and let him go, until he is restored and has formed a scab.
Et fractura quidem furculae stringitur et confortatur secundum plurimum in uigintiocto diebus: et quandoque fit in quibusdam hominibus in minore illo.	And the fracture of the wing is indeed tightened and strengthened according to many people in twenty-eight days: and sometimes it happens in some people in a shorter time.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Spatulae.	Of the Restoration of the Fracture of the Wing.
Caput VII.	Chapter 7.
Raro frangitur Spatula, et in loco lato eius: et non franguntur ex ea nisi margines eius.	The wing rarely breaks and is broken only in a wide place: and it does not break except at its edges.
Quando ergo frangitur ex eo locus, et frangitur in medio eius, et non cognoscitur illud nisi per tactum: tunc secundum quod est figura fracturae conare praeparationem eius.	When then the break occurs from that place and it is broken in the middle of it, and it is not known except by touch: then according to what the figure of the fracture is, strive for its preparation.
Et reduc eam super figuram naturalem omni modo ingenii, quod est tibi possibile.	And bring it back to its natural shape by all means of intelligence, as much as is possible for you.
Deinde pone super locum puluerem molendini cum albugine oui, et stuppam lenem, et pone desuper puluillum ex panno duplato.	Then place a dusting of miller's powder with egg white and sweet pitch, and put a small cloth wrapped double over it.
Deinde pone super ipsum astellam latam ex tabula subtili secundum quantitatem Spatulae totius, aut ampliorem ea parum.	Then place on top of that a wide plate from fine glass, according to the size of the spatula as a whole, or slightly larger.
Si uero sub astella est concauitas in aliquo locorum Spatulae, tunc aequa illam concauitatem cum stuppa leni, donec descendat astella secundum aequalitatem.	If there is a concavity under the plate in some part of the spatula, then fill that concavity with sweet pitch until the plate descends to an equal height.
Deinde ftringe desuper cum alhimemati longa, constrictione decenti, et firmitudine astellae, donec non remoueatur a loco suo.	Then bind it on top with a piece of linen cloth, tightening in a gentle constriction and with the firmness of the plate, until it does not move from its place.
Et considera ligamentum in omni die.	And check the bandage every day.
Quotienscunque ergo mollificatur ligamentum, stringe ipsum, et aequa astellam si remoueatur a loco suo: et iaceat infirmus super latus suum sanum.	Whenever the bandage becomes loosened, tighten it, and if the plate moves from its place, let the patient lie on his healthy side.
Et Spatula quidem restauratur in uiginti diebus, aut in uigintiquinque diebus.	And the spatula is restored in twenty days, or in twenty-five days.
Quando ergo completur iste numerus, tunc solue ligamentum: et tu sis in securitate.	When this number is complete, then loosen the bandage: and you will be in safety.
Nam ipsa est ex ossibus quorum communitio non timetur, neque eorum solutio.	For it is from bones whose connection is not to be feared, nor their separation.
Si autem procedat ex osse frustum, et pungit sub cute: tune scinde super ipsum, et aufer ipsum.	If however a bone fragment proceeds and pierces beneath the skin: then cut above it, and remove it.
Et fac quod diximus in fractura furculae ex sedatione apostematis calidi, si accidat ex eo aliquid.	And do as we said for a fracture of the wing-like bone from sedation of an inflamed apostema, if anything happens to it.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Pectoris.	About the restoration of a fractured breastbone.
Caput VIII.	Chapter VIII.
Pectus quandoque frangitur in medio sui, et raro accidit illud.	The breastbone is sometimes broken in its middle part, and this rarely occurs.
Extremitates eius quidem plurimum franguntur, et comminuuntur ex accidentibus eius.	Its extremities indeed are mostly broken and shattered from accidents that occur to it.
Quando frangitur eius medium, quod declinat ad inferiora, et accidit ei dolor uehemens, et difficultas in anhelitu, et tussis: et fortasse euomit sanguinem, et declaratur concauitas in osse fracto, et non occultatur sensui, Restauratio eius est, ut resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum: et pone inter Spatulas eius puluinar.	When it is broken in its middle part, which declines towards the lower parts, and a sharp pain occurs to him, and difficulty in breathing, and coughing; and perhaps he vomits blood, and a hollow appears on the fractured bone, and it does not conceal itself from sense. The restoration of it is, that the patient should be placed upon his back: and put between two spatulas a poultice.
Deinde preme humeros eius, et aggrega costas a duabus partibus uel lateribus cum manibus: et subtiliare in aequatione eius, secundum omnem modum quo possibile est illud et conuenit, donec redeat figura ossis, secundum quod oportet.	Then compress his shoulders and gather the ribs from both sides with your hands: and make it equal in proportion, as much as possible and fitting, until the bone figure returns, as it should.
Deinde pone super ipsum emplastrum et stuppam, et pone desuper astellam ex tabula subtili ex salice, aut chalingi, et ex eis similibus in leuitate, postquam tu inuoluis eam in panno.	Then place a poultice and a plaster on him, and put a splint made of willow or hazel wood, or similar materials, lightly on top, after you have wrapped it in cloth.
Deinde subtiliare in ligando eam super os fractum, ut non remoueatur: et uade cum ligatura secundum rotunditatem ad dorsum aliquotiens, et stringe ipsum strictura decenti.	Then make it secure by binding it over the broken bone, so that it is not dislodged; and go along with the bandaging in a circular motion to the back several times, and tighten it as is proper.
Deinde considera ligaturam in omni hora, et quotienscumque mollificatur, stringe eam: et si necessitas eius prouocat ad solutionem eius apud pruritum, uel corrosionem quae accidit in loco, aut dolorem, aut apostema: tunc propera, et solue eam, et eradica emplastrum, et rectifica quod accidit cum modo curationis eius.	Then check the bandage at every hour, and whenever it becomes slack, tighten it; and if necessity demands that you remove it due to itching, corrosion occurring in the place, or pain, or abscess: then hurry and release it, and remove the poultice, and correct what has happened with its usual treatment.
Deinde reduc emplastrum, si uides ad illud faciem: et annecte ei stricturam, donec sanetur.	Then return to the poultice if you see it is needed again; and attach a strapping to it until it heals.
¶ De restauratione Costarum, quando franguntur.	About the restoration of Ribs when they are broken.
Caput IX.	(There is no translation for this one)
Scias, quod Costarum fractura non accidit, nisi in locis grossis quae sequuntur dorsum, et ex extremitatibus earum ab anteriori parte.	Know that the fracture of Ribs does not occur except in thick places that follow the back, and from the extremities of these from the anterior part.
Et non accidit eis attritio, nisi propterea, quia sunt cartilaginosae.	And it does not happen to them that they are worn away, except because they are cartilaginous.
Et cognitio ipsius non occultatur sensui apud inquisitionem cum digitis.	And the knowledge of this is not hidden from sense during an examination with fingers.
Et restauratio eius fit ita, ut aeques fracturam cum digitis secundum modum possibilem, donec aequetur figura, secundum quod oportet.	And its restoration is done in such a way that you equal the fracture with your fingers as much as possible, until the figure becomes equal, as it should be.
Deinde emplastra, et stringe os fractum cum astella, si indiget illo.	Then apply poultices and bind the broken bone with a splint, if it needs one.
Et si fractura Costarum est decliuis ad interiora: tunc accidit infirmo dolor uehemens, et punctura, sicut punctura illa quae accidit illi qui habet pleuresim: propterea, quod os pungit uelamen, et etiam ei accidit difficultas anhelitus, et tussis, et uomitus sanguinis multi: et haec est difficilis curationis.	And if the fracture of the ribs is inclined towards the interior: then it happens to the patient a severe pain, and a puncture, like that which occurs in one who has pleurisy: because the bone pierces the membrane, and also he suffers difficulty in breathing, coughing, and vomiting blood profusely: and this is difficult to cure.
Et iam ingeniati sunt antiqui in ea cum ingeniis multis: et ex eis sunt qui dicunt, ut ponas cibos infirmi qui generent inflammationem et uentositatem, ut inflammetur uenter, et extendatur, et impellatur fractura ad exteriora.	And now the ancients have contrived many devices for it: and among them are those who say that you should give food to the patient which generates inflammation and flatulence, so that the belly may be inflamed, and distended, and forced outwards to bring the fracture towards the exterior.
Nos uero abhorremus, ut non fiat caussa uelox ad faciendum apostema calidum, si non accidit.	But we detest giving cause for a rapid formation of a hot abscess unless it happens by chance.
Si autem iam accidit, tunc addit in eo.	If it has already happened, then you add to it.
Et dixerunt quidam eorum: ponatur super locum uentosa, deinde sugatur cum fortitudine, et est similius ratiocinationi.	And some of them said: Let a poultice be placed over the place, then let it be sucked with strength, and it is similar to this reasoning.
Verumtamen timetur, quod attrahat uentosa superfluitates ad locum, propter dispositionem debilitatis.	However, one fears that the poultice may attract superfluidities to the place because of the condition of weakness.
Et dixerunt quidam eorum: oportet ut cooperiatur locus cum lana quae iam submersa est in oleo calido: et ponantur puluilli inter Costas, donec impleatur: ut sit ligatura aequalis quando inuoluis eam secundum rotunditatem.	And some of them said: It is necessary to cover the place with wool that has already been soaked in hot oil, and to put small feathers between the ribs, until it is filled: so that there may be a binding that is equal when you wrap it around according to the roundness.
Deinde curetur infirmus curatione pleuresis ex cibo et medicina.	Then the patient should be cured of pleurisy with food and medicine.
Quod si coartat infirmum res uehemens, quam non tolerat, et os pungit uelamen punctura laedente, et timemus super infirmum: tunc oportet, ut scindamus super locum, et detegamus a Costa fracta.	But if the patient's strength is strained, which they cannot tolerate, and the bone pierces the membrane with a puncturing wound that causes injury, and we fear for the patient: then it is necessary to split open over the place, and to lay bare the fractured rib.
Deinde ponamus super ea instrumentum quod conseruat sifac, cuius rememoratio praecessit: et incidamus os cum facilitate, et incidamus ipsum.	Then we should place over it an instrument that conserves the suture, whose previous description preceded: and we should cut open the bone with ease, and cut into it.
Deinde aggregemus duo labia uulneris, si est magnum cum sutura: et curemus ipsum cum emplastris, donec sanetur.	Then let us bring together the two lips of the wound, if it is large with a suture; and heal it with plasters until it is healed.
Quod si accidat interim apostema calidum, tunc propera, et infunde puluillos in oleo rosato, et pone super locum: et curetur infirmus cum eo quod conuenit apostemati.	But if an abscess should occur in the meantime, then hasten and pour poultices into rose oil, and place it over the spot; and let the patient be cured with that which is suitable for the abscess.
Interim etiam resupinetur super latus super quod dormit, donec sanetur.	Meanwhile, also a poultice should be placed on top of the side where they sleep, until it heals.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Spondilium dorsi et colli.	Of the restoration of fractures of the spine of the back and neck.
Caput X.	Chapter 10.
Ossibus quidem colli quandoque aduenit fractura, et raro accidit eis attritio: et similiter Spondilibus dorsi etiam.	Indeed, fractures of the vertebrae of the neck sometimes occur and rarely is abrasion caused to them; similarly with those of the back.
Cum ergo accidit illud alicui, et uis scire, an sanetur, an non sanetur: tunc confidera.	When therefore it happens to anyone, and you wish to know whether it will heal or not: then examine him.
Nam si uides manus eius iam mollificatas, et stupefactas, et mortuas: et non potest mouere eas, neque extendere eas, neque constringere eas: et quando constringis eas cum digitis tuis, et pungis eas cum acu, non sentit illud, et non sentit in eis dolorem: tunc scias, quia non sanatur, et in pluribus dispositionibus est mortale.	For if you see his hands already softened, and numb, and dead; and he is unable to move them, nor stretch them, nor constrict them; and when you constrict them with your fingers, and prick them with a needle, he does not feel it, and does not feel pain in them: then you will know that it is not healing, and in many cases it is mortal.
Quod si mouet eas, et sentit in eis constrictionem cum digitis et puncturam: tunc scias, quia nucha ossis salua est, et quod infirmus sanabitur cum curatione.	But if he moves them and feels constriction and pricking sensation with your fingers and needle: then you will know that the bone is not broken, and that the patient will be cured with treatment.
Quod si eueniat Spondilibus dorsi simile illius, et uis scire, an sanetur etiam, an non: tunc considera ad pedes eius: tunc si uides quod mollificati sunt, et accidit in eis illud quod accidit in manibus: deinde quando iacet super dorsum suum, egreditur uentositas et egestio absque uoluntate: et quando resupinatur super uentrem suum, egreditur egestio sine uoluntate: et quando resupinatur super dorsum suum, et uult mingere, et non potest: tunc scias, quia est mortale.	But if it happens to the vertebrae of the back in a similar way, and you wish to know whether it will heal or not: then look at his feet; then if you see that they are softened, and that the same thing occurs as in his hands: afterwards when he lies on his back, flatulence and evacuation occur without his consent; and when he is rolled onto his stomach, evacuation occurs without his consent; and when he is rolled onto his back, and he wants to urinate, but cannot: then you will know that it is mortal.
Non ergo labores in curatione eius.	Therefore he does not labor in its cure.
Si uero non accidit ei aliquid ex illo, res est leuior.	But if nothing of that kind happens to him, the case is easier.
Et curatio eius quod accidit ex illo est, ut coneris sedationem apostematis calidi: ita, ut ponas super Spondilem attritam oleum rosatum solum: aut cum uitellis oui assati.	And the cure of what happens to him because of that is to apply a poultice for apostumes hot: thus, you will place upon Spongia worn-out rose oil alone: or with egg yolks well-cooked.
Pone super ipsam illud aliquotiens in die, donec quando sedatur apostema calidum: tum pone super locum unum ex emplastris confortantibus, exiccantibus, et stringe super ipsum cum ligamento: et praecipe infirmo, ut utatur quiete et tranquillitate.	Place it on top of her several times a day, until the hot apostume is calmed down: then place one of the soothing, drying plasters over the spot, and tie it with a bandage; and instruct the patient to use quietness and tranquility.
Nec dormiat super partem cum qua inuenit dolorem, donec sanetur.	He should not sleep on the part where he finds pain until he is healed.
Quod si accidit apud attritionem ossis sathaiatum, aut aliquid quod iam separatum fit ex eo: tunc oportet, ut seces super cutem, et auferas illud.	But if it happens with the abrasion of a shattered bone, or something that has already separated from it: then you should remove the flaps on the skin and take away what is left.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris, si est magnum, cum sutura.	Then gather two lips of the wound, if it is large, with a suture.
Deinde cura ipsum cum aliquo incarnatiuo, ex unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with some ointment, from unguents, until he heals.
Si uero frangitur postremum ossis alhausos, et est finis caudae: tunc oportet, ut intromittas pollicem manus sinistrae in anum, et aeques os fractum manu altera, secundum quod possibile est, et secunda aequatione.	But if the last bone of the backbone is broken and it is the end of the spine: then you should put your left thumb into the anus, and adjust the fractured bone with your other hand, as much as possible, and secondly.
Deinde pone super ipsum, et aufer ipsum: et cura uulnus cum curatione quae praecessit, donec sanetur.	Then place something over it, and take it away; and care for the wound with the treatment that preceded, until he heals.
¶ De restauratione Anchae.	About the restoration of an anus.
Caput XI.	Chapter 11.
Raro franguntur ossa Ancharum.	The bones of the anus are rarely broken.
Quod si franguntur, tunc fractura eorum non est, nisi comminutio in extremitatibus ipsorum: et scinduntur in longitudine, et declinantur ad interiora: et accidit infirmo dolor in loco, et punctura: et stupescit crus quod frangitur.	For if they are broken, then the fracture of them is not unless there is comminution at their ends: and they split along their length, and bend inwardly: and it happens to the patient that he experiences pain in the place, and a puncture: and his leg becomes numb which is broken.
Et restauratio quidem eius est, ut extendas manum tuam super ipsum, donec stes super fracturam qualiter est figura eius.	And the restoration of it is, that you stretch forth your hand over it until you steady yourself above the fracture in its own shape.
Quod si fractura est in extremitatibus eius tantum, tunc aequa illam fracturam, secundum quod praeparatur tibi ex aequatione, donec assimiletur figurae suae naturali.	But if the fracture is only in its extremities, then equalize that fracture, according to how it prepares itself for you in equality, until it resembles its natural shape.
Si autem fractura est in longitudine, aut iam declinat ad interiora: tunc fac iacere infirmum super uentrem suum, donec praeparetur tibi restauratio illius fracturae.	But if the fracture is in length, or already inclines towards its inward parts: then make the patient lie down on his stomach, until you are prepared to restore that fracture.
Quando ergo aequaueris ipsam, pone super ipsam emplastrum: deinde pone super ipsam astellam ex ligno, aut ex cute: et stringe strictura super quam non timeas permutationem fracturae, neque remotionem astellae.	When therefore you have equalized it, place a poultice over it: then place a wooden or leather splint over it; and bind tightly over what you are not afraid to change the fracture nor remove the splint.
Et aequa concauitatem illorum cum eo quod impleat eam, donec capiat eam strictura secundum aequalitatem: et praecipe infirmo, ut dormiat super dorsum suum, aut super latus suum sanum.	And equalize the concavity of those with him as it fills it, until it is bound tightly according to equality; and instruct the patient to sleep on his back or on his healthy side.
Si autem accidat ei apostema calidum: tunc cessa ab extensione eius, et ipsius restauratione, donec sedetur apostema calidum: et pone super ipsum quod sedet ipsum, secundum quod praecessit, deinde redi ad restaurationem eius: et stringe ipsum sicut oportet.	But if a hot abscess occurs to him: then cease from stretching and restoring it, until the hot abscess subsides; and place over it what settles on it, according as preceded, and then return to restoring it: and bind it as necessary.
Si uero accidit in osse satagie, aut comminuitur, extrahe.	But if it happens that the bone is shattered or crushed, remove it.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Adiutorii.	Of the Restoration of a Fracture Assistive Device.
Caput XII.	Chapter 12.
Adiutorium est illud, quod est inter cubitum usque ad caput Spatulae.	The Assisting device is that which is between the elbow and the head of a spatula.
Si ergo frangitur, tunc restauratio eius est secundum unum duorum modorum.	If it breaks, then its restoration is according to one or two methods.
Quorum unus est: ut accipias lignum planum mediae grossitudinis, secundum hanc formam, quae sequitur.	One of which is: that you take a piece of flat wood of middle thickness, according to this shape, which follows.
Et ligentur in duabus extremitatibus duo ligamenta.	And it is tied at both ends with two straps.
Deinde suspendatur ex loco eleuato: et sedeat infirmus super sedem.	Then it is suspended from a raised place; and the patient sits on a chair.
Deinde proiiciat brachium suum fractum super lignum, donec perueniat ad titillicum eius, in cuius medio sit annexa curuitas ligni.	Then he should place his broken arm on top of wood until it reaches the elbow joint, where a curved piece of wood is attached.
Deinde suspende desuper ipsum aliquid graue, ut extendat ipsum minister ad inferiora.	Then he should hang something heavy above it, so that the assistant can stretch it down to the lower parts.
Deinde aequet medicus fracturam manibus suis simul, donec redeat fractura, secundum quod oportet.	Then the doctor should equalize the fracture with his own hands at the same time, until the fracture returns to what is necessary.
Et modus alter est, ut resupinetur infirmus super ceruicem suam: et suspende manum eius a collo ipsius cum ligamento.	And another method is, that the patient be laid on their back: and suspend his hand from his neck with a bandage.
Deinde praecipe duobus ministris, ut teneat unus eorum illud quod est supra fracturam cum manibus suis: et ut alter teneat inferius eius, et extendat unusquisque eorum ad partem suam.	Then instruct two assistants to have one of them hold that which is above the fracture with their hands: and to have the other hold below it, and each stretch out to their own side.
Et si uis, ut sit extensio fortior, tunc stringe sub fractura cum ligamento, et supra ipsam cum ligamento alio: et extendat ea unusquisque duorum ministrorum ad duas partes suas.	And if you wish for a stronger extension, then bind below the fracture with one bandage, and above it with another bandage; and each of the two assistants should stretch out to their own two sides.
Si ergo fractura est propinqua extremitati humeri, tunc oportet, ut ponatur unum ligamentum sub titillico, et alterum sub fractura uersus cubitum.	If then the fracture is near the extremity of the shoulder, it is necessary that one bandage be placed below the elbow joint, and another below the fracture towards the forearm.
Et similiter si fractura est propinqua cubito: tunc oportet, ut ponatur ligamentum super illum locum, et super cubitum ipsum.	And similarly if the fracture is near the elbow: then it is necessary that a bandage be placed above that place, and above the elbow itself.
Deinde aequa fracturam cum facilitate absque labore, donec quando aequatur fractura secundum quod oportet, et applicatur applicatione bona: tunc stringe eam, si non accidit apostema calidum.	Then equalize the fracture with ease without labor, until the fracture is equalized as it should be, and a good application is applied; then bind it, if there is no occurrence of hot abscess.
Si uero accidit apostema calidum, tunc dimitte stricturam usque ad diem septimum.	If indeed a hot abscess occurs, then leave the bandage off until the seventh day.
Et pone super ipsum lanam succidam imbibitam in aceto et oleo rosato, donec quando quiescit apostema: tunc stringe eam: et modus stringendi eam est, ut ponas emplastrum super fracturam.	And place a compress of sheep's wool that has been soaked in vinegar and rose oil over it, until the abscess subsides; then bind it: and the way to bind it is, by placing an application over the fracture.
Deinde pone inuolutionem ex panno nouo super emplastrum.	Then place a poultice made from new cloth over the application.
Deinde aggreget brachium super adiutorium ipsum, et ponat manum suam apertam super humerum suum.	Then gather the arm above the assisting hand, and place his open hand on his shoulder.
Et pone pannum, et stringe super adiutorium brachium, ut brachium stet loco astellarum: si non prohibet te ab illo aliquid, neque alteretur super te aliquid ex osse fracto.	And place a cloth and tie it above the assisting hand, so that the arm may stand in the position of the shoulder blades: if nothing hinders you from him or something is altered on you by a broken bone.
Quod si times, quod alteretur super te ex osse fracto aliquid, tunc utere astellis: et est, ut ponas super fracturam ipsam astellam quae sit latior et fortior reliquis astellis.	But if you fear that something may be altered on you by a broken bone, then use the shoulder blades: and it is, to place over the fracture itself the shoulder blade which is wider and stronger than the other shoulder blades.
Et ponas inter omnem astellam latitudinem digiti: et sit longitudo astellarum secundum fracturam cum additione trium digitorum ab omni parte.	And place between all the width of a finger: and let the length of the shoulder blades be according to the fracture with an addition of three finger-breadths from every part.
Deinde stringe super astellas strictura quam dixi in principio capituli.	Then tie above the shoulder blades with a binding which I said at the beginning of this chapter.
Et est, ut sit strictura tua super locum fracturae strictior.	And it is, that your binding should be tighter over the place of the fracture.
Et quanto plus elongatur fractura, sit strictura minor.	And to the extent that the fracture is more elongated, the binding should be looser.
Si ergo uides situm astellarum et stricturam, sicut diximus, in hora qua restauras membrum statim, tunc fac: et si times apostema calidum, tunc dimitte stricturam et astellas usque ad diem septimum, sicut diximus.	So if you see the position of the shoulder blades and the binding, as we said, at the hour when you restore the member immediately, then do so; and if you fear a hot abscess, then release the binding and the shoulder blades until the seventh day, as we said.
Deinde considera ligamentum in omnibus tribus diebus, ut non accidat in loco pruritus, aut inflatio, aut prohibeatur cibus peruenire ad membrum, propter dispositionem superfluitatis stricturae.	Then consider the swelling in all three days, so that no itching, or inflammation, or impediment of food may reach the member, due to the excessiveness of the binding.
Rectifica ergo illud totum, secundum quod diximus.	Therefore correct everything according to what we said.
Si uero es super fiduciam, ut non accidat ex illo aliquid: tunc non soluas ligamentum, nisi post tres dies, aut plus.	If indeed you are confident that nothing will happen from it: then do not loosen the binding, unless after three days or more.
Et sit dormitio infirmi super dorsum suum, et manus eius super stomachum suum: et pone sub adiutorio culcitram plenam lana aequaliter.	And let the patient's sleep be on his back, and his hand on his stomach; and place under the assisting bolster a full wool blanket evenly.
Et considera in omni hora noctis, aut diei, ut non soluatur figura membri fracta, aut mollificetur ligamentum.	And consider at every hour of night or day, so that the figure of the broken member does not become loose, or the binding becomes relaxed.
Rectifica ergo illud totum uirtute tua.	Therefore correct that whole thing with your skill.
Et pone cibum infirmi secundum ordinem quem praemisimus, ita ut sit cibus subtilis in primis, donec incipiat os stringi: tunc oportet, ut ingrosses cibum eius.	And give the patient food according to the order we have set forth, so that the food is fine at first, until the mouth begins to open; then it is necessary to thicken his food.
De consuetudine enim adiutorii et cruris est, ut stringatur in quadraginta diebus: tunc ergo oportet, ut soluatur, et administretur balneum, et medicetur cum unguentis quae rectificant illud.	For it is a custom of assistance and the leg is that it should be stretched over forty days; then therefore it is necessary to release it, and administer bathing, and treat with ointments which correct that.
Quod si fractura fuerit foeda, attrita: tunc non soluas ab ea ligamentum et astellas usque ad quinquaginta dies, et usque ad duos menses.	But if the fracture is foul and bruised: then do not release from it a ligament and keep an eye on it until fifty days, and even until two months.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Brachii.	On the Restoration of a Fracture of the Arm.
Caput XIII.	Chapter 13.
Brachium est compositum ex duobus ossibus, quae nominantur duo focilia.	The arm is composed of two bones which are called two elbow-bones.
Quorum unum est paruum: et est illud quod sequitur pollicem.	Of which one is small and it is that which follows the thumb.
Et alterum est magnum, et est illud quod est positum sub paruo ab inferiori parte.	And the other is large, and it is that which is placed below the small one from the lower part.
Fortasse ergo frangitur focile maius solum, aut paruum: et fortasse franguntur simul.	Perhaps therefore the larger elbow-bone alone breaks, or the smaller one; and perhaps they both break together.
Quando ergo frangitur focile paruum superius, tunc restauratio eius est facilis, et sanatio eius est facilior.	When therefore the small upper elbow-bone is broken, then its restoration is easy, and its healing is easier.
Et quando frangitur focile inferius, est fractura eius mala, et sanatio eius difficilis.	And when the lower elbow-bone is broken, it is a bad fracture, and its healing is difficult.
Et deterior ea est, quando franguntur duo ossa simul.	And worse still is that, when both bones break at the same time.
Si ergo os quod frangitur est focile parum superius, tunc conuenit medico apud restaurationem eius, ut ponat extensionem paruam cum facilitate, donec aequet ipsum.	If therefore the bone that is broken is the small upper elbow-bone, then it is fitting for a doctor to apply in its restoration an extension with ease, until it becomes equal.
Si uero focile magnum est illud quod fractum est: tunc oportet, ut ponat stricturam fortiorem ualde.	If however the large elbow-bone is that which is broken: then it is necessary to apply a stronger tightening very much.
Et oportet, ut ponat figuram manus apud restaurationem eius, et ipsius extensionem extensam super puluinar.	And it is necessary to place the shape of a hand in its restoration, and its extended extension above the elbow.
Et sit pollex manus ad superiora altior omnibus digitis: et sit articularis inferior omnibus digitis, uel reliquis: et infirmus sedens quadratus super seipsum, et sit puluinar coram eo, uel in directo eius, in altitudine, ut non incurrat infirmus laborem.	And let the thumb be higher than all other fingers on the hand, and let it be articular at the lower joint of all fingers or others. And let the weak one sit square above itself, and let the poultice be before him, or directly opposite, in height, so that the weak one does not incur labor.
Deinde extendat minister Brachium ab inferiori parte, aut manu sua, aut cum ligamento.	Then the attendant should stretch out his arm from below, either with his own hand or with a strap.
Et minister alius extendat desuper similiter.	And another attendant should stretch out similarly from above.
Deinde aequet medicus os, donec reducat ipsum secundum meliorem figuram quam potest.	Then the doctor should adjust the jaw until it is reduced to its better shape as much as possible.
Quod si in fractura ossis sunt satagiae, tunc conare reducere omne frustum in loco suo uirtute tua.	But if there are fragments of bone in the fracture, then try to reduce each fragment to its place with your force.
Si uero apparet in eo sathaiatum separatum, et pungit cutem, et non est tibi spes in restauratione eius: tunc finde super ipsum, et aufer ipsum secundum modum quem diximus in eis quae praemissa sunt.	But if it appears that a splinter is separated and is poking the skin, and you do not have hope of restoring it; then find it above and remove it according to the method we mentioned earlier in what has been said before.
Si autem fractura est cum uulnere, ego iam feci ad illud capitulum singulare, ergo accipe curationem illius inde.	But if there is a fracture with an open wound, I have already treated that separately in a special chapter; therefore, receive its treatment from there.
Quod si accidat in principio tuae restaurationis apostema calidum, tunc line pannum cum caeroto facto ex oleo rosato, et caera alba, et sit medium inter spissitudinem et subtilitatem: et stringe pannum super ipsum strictura subtili, donec quando sedatur apostema: tunc remoue caerotum, et pone emplastrum praeparatum ex puluere molendini cum albumine oui.	And if a warm abscess occurs at the beginning of your treatment, then make a poultice with cerate made from rose oil and white wax, and let it be in the middle between thickness and thinness; and tie the poultice over it tightly, until the abscess subsides: then remove the cerate and apply a prepared plaster made from flour from the mill with egg white.
Deinde pone astellas, et sit astella quae ponitur super fracturam ipsam latior parumper, et fortior.	Then place splints, and let the splint placed over the fracture be a little wider and stronger.
Et scias, quod numerus astellarum Brachii est sex in pluribus dispositionibus: siue sit fractura in focili uno, aut in duobus focilibus simul.	And know that the number of splints for an arm is six in various arrangements: whether the fracture is in one or two joints at the same time.
Deinde pone stricturam tuam super locum fracturae fortiorem et uehementiorem, et aliquanto plus cum strictura ad superiora fracturae, aut ad inferiora eius: aut pone stricturam molliorem strictura eius parumper, secundum quod praecessit rememoratio eius in principio capituli.	Then place your bandage over the site of the fracture stronger and more vigorously, and a little bit tighter above or below the fracture, or put a softer bandage on top of it for a short while, according to what was remembered earlier at the beginning of this chapter.
Et sint panni qui inuoluuntur super fracturam, panni lenes, humidi: et non sint duri, asperi.	And there are cloths which are wrapped around a fracture, soft cloths, moist ones: and they should not be hard, rough.
Et sit filum quo stringitur ex lino proprie, medium inter subtile et grossum, sicut narrauimus.	And let there be a thread of flax properly twisted, medium between fine and thick, just as we have narrated.
Et considera membrum et ligamentum post dies.	And consider the member and ligament after days.
Quod si accidat aliquid cuius rectificatio sit necessaria, sicut pruritus qui accidit membro: tunc oportet, ut embroces membrum cum aqua calefacta, donec quiescat ille pruritus, et dimittas membrum non constrictum, donec quiescat, deinde itera stricturam.	And if something happens that requires correction, such as itching on a member: then it is necessary to wrap the member with warm water-soaked cloths until the itching ceases, and do not constrict the member until it has ceased, then iterate the constriction.
Quod si strictura iam mollificata est, et os iam remotum, et similia illis: tunc rectifica illud totum uirtute tua, et considera iterum.	And if the constriction has already been softened and the bone has already been moved away, and similar things: then correct that whole thing with your skill, and consider again.
Nam si nutrimentum prohibetur peruenire ad membrum, propter superfluitatem stricturae, tunc oportet, ut mollifices ipsum parumper, et dimittas ipsum aliquot diebus, donec currat ad ipsum nutrimentum, deinde stringe ipsum.	For if nourishment is prevented from reaching the member due to excess constriction, then it is necessary to soften it slightly and let it be for a few days until it reaches the member, and then bind it.
Si autem non accidit infirmo aliquid eorum quae diximus, tunc non oportet, ut soluatur, nisi post uiginti dies, aut circiter hos.	But if nothing of what we said happens to the patient, then it is not necessary to release it until after twenty days or around that.
Deinde suspendatur manus infirmi ad collum eius.	Then suspend the patient's hand at his neck.
Et sit collum eius aequale, et custodiatur uirtute sua a motibus agitatiuis.	And let his neck be level, and be guarded with his own strength against agitated movements.
Et fac eum dormire super dorsum suum.	And make him sleep on his back.
Et scias, quod haec fractura in triginta diebus, aut in triginta duobus diebus restauratur: et fortasse restauratur in uigintiocto diebus.	And know that this fracture is restored in thirty days, or in thirty-two days: and perhaps it is restored in twenty-eight days.
Totum illud est secundum dispositiones complexionum, et dispositiones uirtutis.	The whole thing is according to the dispositions of humors and the dispositions of virtues.
¶ De restauratione fracturarum Manus.	Book of the Restoration of Fractures Hands.
Caput XIIII.	Chapter 14.
Scias, quod pectini Manus, et nodis digitorum raro accidit fractura.	Know that fracture rarely occurs in the palm of the hand and the knuckles of the fingers.
Et non accidit ei, nisi attritio multotiens.	And it does not occur unless there is repeated rubbing.
Quando ergo accidit plantae fractura, aut attritio: tunc oportet, ut sedeat infirmus quadratus: et coram eo sit sedes secundum aequalitatem.	When therefore a fracture or attrition of the foot occurs: then it is necessary that the patient sits square: and before him is a seat according to equality.
Deinde pone Manum eius super eam extensam.	Then place his hand over it extended.
Deinde extendat minister ossa fracta, et aequet ea medicus, donec quando coniunguntur coniunctione bona.	Then the assistant should stretch out the broken bones and the doctor should adjust them until they are well joined together.
Tunc oportet, ut ponat emplastrum et stuppam, si non accidat apostema calidum.	Then it is necessary that he puts on a poultice and bandage, unless a hot abscess should occur.
Deinde pone astellam desuper secundum quantitatem loci: et tu iam inuoluisti eam in panno lini.	Then place a cloth above it according to the size of the place: and you have already wrapped it in a linen cloth.
Si autem fractura est ad inferiora circiter uentrem plantae, tunc fac simile spherae ex panno: et praecipe infirmo, ut coartet super eam cum planta sua fracta: deinde stringatur cum panno longo.	But if the fracture is near the lower part of the foot around the belly of the plantar area, then make a similar sphere out of cloth and instruct the patient to bend over it with his fractured foot: then tie it with a long bandage.
Et sit astella ex corio, in quo sit lenitas, ut applicetur corium cum corpore plantae: et stringe eam, secundum quod oportet.	And let the gauze be made of leather, with a softness to it, so that it may be applied to the skin of the foot and tied according to what is necessary.
Si autem fractura est ad exteriora, tunc oportet: ut ponas astellam desuper, et astellam aliam ab inferiori in planta: et sit manus aperta recta.	But if the fracture is on the outside, then it is necessary that you place a gauze above and another below on the plantar area: and let his hand be straight open.
Deinde pone stricturam, sicut reuoluitur manus: et extende inter digitos cum ligamento.	Then place a strapping, as if it were revolved around the hand: and extend between the fingers with a bandage.
Quod si accidat fractura alicui nodorum digitorum, tunc si est pollex, aequetur secundum quod oportet.	What if there is a fracture of some joint of the fingers? Then if it is the thumb, it should be adjusted as necessary.
Deinde stringatur cum planta: et si amas, pone ei astellam rectam, paruam: ut eleuetur fractura, et non moueatur.	Then let it be tied with the foot: and if it is pleasing, place a small straight gauze on him, so that the fracture may be elevated and not moved.
Si autem fractura est reliquis digitis, sicut medio, et indici, aut auriculari, et anulari, tunc aequetur, et ligetur cum digito sano qui sequitur eum: aut ligentur omnes secundum continuationem: et est melius.	But if the fracture is in the other fingers, such as the middle finger, ring finger, or pinky, then it should be adjusted and bound with the healthy finger that follows it: or all should be bound according to succession: and this is better.
Aut pone super ipsum astellam paruam, sicut diximus in pollice.	Or place a small gauze on top of it, as we said with the thumb.
Et considera in restauratione tua, et post ipsam dispositionem apostematis calidi: et oppone cum eo quod oportet, quando accidit aliquid ex illo, secundum quod iteratur eius narratio.	And consider in your restoration, and after that arrangement of hot boils: and apply to it what is necessary, whenever something occurs from it, according to how its narration proceeds.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Coxae.	Of the Restoration of a Fractured Hip.
Caput XV.	Chapter 15.
OS Coxae multotiens frangitur, et declaratur sensui: quoniam conuertitur ad interiorem et posteriorem partem.	The hip bone is often broken and becomes evident to the sense: because it turns towards the inner and posterior part.
Et restauratio eius fit ita, quod stringitur ligamentum supra fracturam, et ligamentum aliud sub fractura.	And its restoration is done thus: by tightening a ligament above the fracture, and another ligament below the fracture.
Et infirmus prostretur super faciem suam.	And the patient should be stretched out on their face.
Deinde extendat omne ligamentum minister ad partem suam secundum aequalitatem: et hoc, quando est fractura in medio ossis.	Then the assistant should stretch out all the ligaments to his own side according to proportion: and this when there is a fracture in the middle of the bone.
Si autem est fractura propinqua radici Coxae, tunc sit ligamentum ad partem pectinis, ut cadat extensio ad sursum: et ligamentum aliud sub fractura.	But if there is a fracture near the root of the hip, then let there be a ligament to the side of the groin, so that the extension falls upwards: and another ligament below the fracture.
Et sic similiter si est fractura propinqua genu, tunc sit ligamentum propinquum genu, ut sit extensio ad inferiora.	And similarly if there is a fracture near the knee, then let there be a ligament near the knee, so that the extension falls downwards.
Deinde aequet medicus os utriusque manibus suis, donec reducat ipsum secundum similitudinem figurae naturalis: et coniugatur os coniunctione bona.	Then the doctor should equalize the bone with both of his hands, until he reduces it to its natural shape: and the bone should be joined by a good union.
Tunc oportet, ut ponas emplastrum et stricturam, si non accidit membro apostema.	Then it is necessary to apply a poultice and bandage, if there is no swelling in the member.
Quod si accidat in eo apostema: tunc dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot, donec sedetur apostema calidum, deinde redi ad curationem tuam.	For if there occurs a swelling in it: then leave it for several days, until the warm swelling subsides, and then return to your cure.
Strictura autem eius ita sit.	The bandage should be applied thus.
Oportet ut inuoluas super fracturam imema duram, id est, bindam: et dupla eam bis, aut ter: et remaneat ex ea superfluitas.	It is necessary to wrap a hard bandage over the fracture, that is, to bind it; and double it two or three times; and leave some excess from it.
Deinde inuolue crus, donec perueniat calcaneus apud radicem natis.	Then wrap the leg until the heel reaches the root of the nativities.
Et intromitte filum longum inter Coxam et crus prope genu ad inferiora, et ueniant extremitates fili a superiori parte duarum partium.	And insert a long thread between the hip and leg near the knee downwards, and let the ends of the thread come from above on both sides.
Deinde reuolue super Crus et Coxam quod superfluit ex alimema.	Then turn back over the shoulder and knee which is redundant from above.
Deinde pone super Coxam in loco fracturae ipsius astellas, et pone ex eis astellam unam super os cruris.	Then place a splint on the knee in the location of its fracture, and place one of them over the bone of the leg.
Deinde imple uacuitates inter crus et coxam cum pannis lenibus, ut aequetur strictura.	Then fill the gaps between the shin and the knee with soft cloths, so that the constriction may be equalized.
Deinde incipe cum strictura forti a medio super locum fracturae tribus inuolutionibus, aut quatuor.	Then begin with strong bandaging from the middle over the location of the fracture, with three or four foldings.
Et quanto plus elongaris cum ligamento a loco fracturae, sit strictura tua minor et mollior, et lenior.	And as much as you stretch the bandage away from the place of the fracture, let your bandage be less tight and softer, and more gentle.
Deinde intende ad duas extremitates fili, quod tu intromisisti inter coxam et crus.	Then tend to the two ends of the cloth, that you have inserted between the knee and shin.
Liga ergo cum utrisque tres astellas quae sunt desuper.	 Bind with each of them three splints which are above.
Deinde uade cum duabus extremitatibus fili ad inferiora, donec peruenias ad cauillam pedis.	Then go with the two ends of the cloth to the lower parts, until you reach the ankle of the foot.
Et cum utrisque stringe etiam extremitates astellarum a parte altera: ut non remoueatur ligamentum ex loco suo.	And with each of them tie also the ends of the splints from the other side, so that the bandage is not moved from its place.
Deinde dimitte stricturam super illud, dum permanet, ita quod non accidat membro corrosio, neque apostema, neque inflatio, et similia eis.	Then release the bandage over that, as long as it remains, so that there is no danger of member corrosion, or abscess, or swelling, and similar things.
Quod si accidat aliquid ex illo.	If anything happens to that.
Propera ergo cum solutione eius, et rectifica illud quod accidit inde totum, secundum quod diximus multotiens.	Therefore hasten with its dissolution and correct what has happened from it entirely, according as we have said many times.
Si uero in osse est frustum ex osse quod pungat: tunc oportet, ut aeques illud, si est tibi possibile.	If however there is a bone fragment in the bone that pierces: then it is necessary for you to equalize it if it is possible for you.
Et si non, finde super illud, et remoue illud: et cura cum eo cuius praecessit rememoratio, donec sanetur.	And if not, find something above it and remove it; and take care with the one whose previous mention was made, until it is healed.
Et quandoque stringitur haec fractura Coxae, praeter quod addantur ei astellae, sicut diximus in adiutorio et brachio.	And when this fracture of the knee is bound, besides what splints are added to it, as we said in the aid and arm.
Verumtamen in restauratione eius taliter fracta, non accidit infirmo claudicatio.	However, in its restoration when thus fractured, it does not happen that an invalid suffers from lameness.
Et si restauratur sola, praeter quod applicetur ei crus alterum, tunc necesse est, ut claudicet ille cuius est, semper.	And if it is restored alone, except that another leg is applied to it, then it is necessary for the one who has it to limp forever.
Et scias, quod Coxa stringitur in quinquaginta diebus, uel additur parum, aut minuitur parum: totum illud est secundum diuersitatem complexionum, et reliquarum dispositionum.	And know that the Hip is tightened in fifty days, or increased a little, or decreased a little: all this is according to the diversity of complexions and other dispositions.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Rotulae genu.	On the restoration of a fractured Knee-Joint.
Caput XVI.	Chapter 16.
Scias, quod Rotulae genu raro accidit fractura, sed accidit ei attritio multotiens.	Know that a fracture of the Knee-Joint rarely occurs, but wear and tear often happens to it.
Si uero accidit ei fractura, tunc non nisi aut fissura, aut foramen in partibus suis.	If indeed a fracture occurs to it, then only either a cleft or an opening can be found in its parts.
Et est illud cum uulnere, et absque uulnere.	And it is that with a wound and without a wound.
Et statur super illud totum cum sensu.	And stands over it altogether with sense.
Et restauratio eius est ita, ut aequetur quod disruptum est ex partibus eius cum digitis, donec aggregetur, et coniungatur secundum quod possibile est ex aequatione et facilitate, et fabricatione.	And its restoration is such that what has been disrupted from its parts with the fingers is made equal again, until it is gathered and joined together as much as possible by equality, facility, and skill.
Deinde pone emplastrum ex farina sisami, uel molendini, cum albumine oui: et pone super ipsum astellam rotundam, si indiges illa: et stringe desuper strictura conueniente ad illud.	Then place a poultice made from sesame flour or miller's flour with egg white on it; and put over that a round bandage, if needed; and bind tightly above it with a suitable strap.
Deinde considera omnes dispositiones quas narrauimus in reliquis fracturis: sicut apostema calidum, et similia illi: ita, ut opponas omni accidenti cum eo quod conuenit ei, donec sanetur.	Then consider all the conditions which we have described in other fractures, such as warm abscesses and similar ones; so that you counteract every accident with what is suitable for it, until it heals.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Cruris.	On the restoration of a fractured Leg.
Caput XVII.	Chapter 17.
Scias, quod Cruri sunt duo ossa, quorum unum est grossum, et nominatur nomine Cruris: et alterum subtile, et nominatur Focile.	Know that there are two bones in the Leg, one of which is large and is called the Crurus, and the other is slender and is called the Fibula.
Et accidit utrisque ex speciebus fracturae quod accidit duobus ossibus brachii: et propter illud fit restauratio eius, sicut restauratio brachii aequaliter, et operatio est una.	And it happens to both of them in the same way as a fracture that occurs to two bones of the arm; and because of this, its restoration is like the restoration of the arm, equally, and the operation is one.
Quod si franguntur duo ossa simul, conuertitur Crus ad omnes partes.	If two bones are broken simultaneously, it is turned towards all parts.
Et si frangitur os subtilius, conuertitur Crus ad anteriorem partem.	And if a slender bone is broken, the splint is turned towards the anterior part.
Et si frangitur os grossius, inuenis illud inferius: et est ex eis quae non occultantur tibi.	And if a thick bone is broken, you will find it lower down; and it is one of those that do not remain hidden from you.
Deinde administra extensionem, et aequationem, et ligationem astellarum secundum illud aequaliter.	Then apply extension, equality, and astral binding according to what is equal.
Verumtamen oportet, si fractura Cruris est fractura foeda, habens sethagie multa: ut sit extensio minor, et lenior alleuiatione tua.	However, if the fracture of the leg is a foul one, having many seths, so that there should be less extension and gentler alleviation by your means.
Et in Crure quidem est ex operatione quiddam super brachium: et est, ut quando tu aequas astellas, et comples omnem operationem tuam, tunc accipe duas fascias ex ligno pini, quod administratur in fabricatione solariorum quod ponitur sub tabulis: et fiunt ex spatulis palmae: et elige ex eis quibus est grossitudo parua, et neque sint ex minutis: et sit longitudo earum secundum longitudinem Cruris a genu usque inferius.	And in the leg there is something like a procedure for the arm: and it is, that when you equalize the astral bindings, and complete your entire operation, then take two strips of pine wood, which are used in the fabrication of solaria, which is placed under tables: and they are made from palm leaves: and choose among them those with a small thickness, nor are they very thin: and let their length be according to the length of the leg from the knee down.
Deinde inuolue super unamquamque pannum duabus inuolutionibus secundum longitudinem eius.	Then wrap around each strip with two wrappings according to its length.
Et pone unam partem Cruris a parte una, et alteram a parte altera: et sint ex genu usque inferius pedis.	And place one part of the leg on one side and the other on the other side: and they should be from the knee down to the foot.
Deinde liga duas fascias in tribus locis ex duabus extremitatibus et medio.	Then bind the two strips in three places at both ends and the middle.
Cum enim strictura prohibetur, Crus declinat ad dextram et sinistram, et stat statione bona.	When a constriction is prevented, the leg bends to the right and left, and remains in a good position.
Et iam quidem administretur cunabulum ex ligno secundum longitudinem Cruris, et ponatur in eo Crus, ut conseruet ipsum a motu.	And now apply a cradle made of wood according to the length of the leg, and place the leg in it, so that it may preserve itself from movement.
Et plurimum quidem oportet, ut facias illud in fractura quando cum ea est uulnus proprie.	And indeed very much is necessary, that you should do this in a fracture when the wound is fresh and proper.
Deinde considera Crus in omni die, et stude cum eo studio ultimo ab apostemate, aut inflatione, aut reliquis aliis.	Then consider the leg every day, and strive with it with utmost effort to prevent abscess, or swelling, or other things.
Si ergo accidit aliquid ex illis, tunc oppone ei cum eo quod oportet, usquequo sanetur, si Deus uoluerit.	If then something happens to one of those things, then apply to it what is needed until it heals, if God wills.
De fractura ossium Pedis, et Digitorum.	On the Fracture of Bones of the Foot and Fingers.
Caput XVIII.	Chapter 18.
Calcaneo quidem non accidit fractura penitus.	Indeed, a fracture does not occur at all in the calcaneum.
Ossibus uero Pedis accidit quandoque fractura, et Digitis parum etiam accidit fractura: et non accidit eis nisi attritio in pluribus dispositionibus.	The bones of the foot sometimes suffer a fracture, and the fingers also suffer a fracture to a lesser extent. And this does not happen to them except by attrition in many dispositions.
Quod si accidit ossibus Pedis fractura, et uides illa ossa sublimari super se adinuicem, tunc ponat infirmus Pedem suum super terram praeparatam, sicut ambulans.	If a fracture occurs in the bones of the foot, and you see those bones elevated above themselves to infinity, then let the patient place their foot on prepared ground, as if they were walking.
Deinde sta tu, et pone Pedem tuum super illud quod eleuatur ex illis ossibus: postea preme, uel calca eam: et aequa ipsam, donec redeat in locis suis.	Then stand you, and place your foot on what is elevated from those bones; afterwards press or tread upon it; and equalize it until it returns to its place.
Deinde pone emplastrum, et stuppam desuper: et pone sub uentre Pedis tabulam paruam, cui sint duo capita plana.	Then apply a poultice, and grease on top; and place beneath the foot a small flat plate with two flat heads.
Deinde stringe eam cum Pede strictura decenti, postquam tu inuoluis eam cum pannis, et reliquis quibus indiget.	Then bind it to the foot with a tight wrapping, after you have wrapped it with cloths and other things that are needed.
Cum ergo praetereunt ei tres dies, aut quatuor, tunc solue ligamentum.	When then three days or four have passed for him, then loosen the bandage.
Nam tu inuenies ossa aequata, siue sint fracta, aut sint dislocata.	For you will find that the bones are equalized, whether they be fractured or dislocated.
Operatio ergo in eis est, sicut uides.	The operation therefore is as you see it.
Si autem franguntur aliqui digiti, tunc restaura eos, et aequa ipsos secundum quod narraui tibi in restauratione digitorum manus.	But if any fingers are broken, then restore them and equalize them as I have told you about the restoration of fingers and hands.
Deinde pone digito tuo astellam secundum longitudinem digiti, et sit latior eo parumper: deinde pone sub Pede hanc tabulam quam narraui tibi, et stringe eam strictura decenti.	Then place a splint on your finger according to the length of the finger, and let it be slightly wider at that point; then place this plate under the foot as I told you, and bind it with a tight wrapping.
Si uero quod frangitur ex ossibus est duo, aut tria, aut plus, tunc pone super omnem digitum astellam suae quantitatis, inuolutam in panno lini: et stringe tabulam in inferiori Pedis: et sit stans super unum capitum tabulae extra uentrem Pedis, ut teneat retentione bona.	But if what is broken is two or three or more bones, then place a splint over all the fingers of that size, wrapped in linen cloth; and bind the plate to the lower foot; and let it stand above one head of the plate outside the belly of the foot, so as to hold good retention.
Et conuenit tibi, ut non obliuiscaris, quin consideres omnia quae dixi tibi in reliquis fracturis ex accidentibus quae diximus: et oppone omni accidenti cum eo quod oportet.	And it is fitting for you that you do not forget, unless you consider all the things I told you about other fractures from accidents we discussed; and oppose every accident with what is necessary.
¶ De fractura Vuluae mulieris, et ossis pectinis, et uirgae uiri.	On the fracture of a woman's vulva, and of the bone of the hip, and of the man's beard.
Caput XIX.	Chapter 19.
Quando frangitur Vulua mulieris, tunc fac eam sedere quadratam.	When a woman's vulva is broken, then make her sit square.
Deinde inclina eam ad partem dorsi ipsius parumper, et teneatur retro.	Then bend her towards the part of her own back, and hold her back a little bit.
Deinde impleat obstetrix Vuluam eius coto, donec impleat eam: et fiat in Vulua ex eo sicut sphera.	Then let the midwife fill her vulva with cotton, until she is filled: and it should be in the vulva like a sphere.
Deinde concutiatur mulier, et eleua dorsum eius paulatim.	Then beat the woman and raise her back gradually.
Illud enim cotum egreditur, donec fiat ante portam Vuluae sicut sphera, et os fractum redit.	For that cotton comes out until it becomes like a sphere before the entrance of the vulva, and the broken bone returns.
Deinde pone puluillum super dorsum eius.	Then place a poultice on her back.
Quando ergo uult mingere, remoueat cotum cum facilitate, deinde mingat: et reduc ipsum secundum modum, quo intromisisti ipsum in primis: deinde redeat ad puluillum suum primum.	When she wants to urinate, remove the cotton with ease, then let her urinate; and return it according to the way you inserted it at first: then let her return to her original poultice.
Faciat illud septem diebus, aut circiter, os ipsum enim restauratur.	Let it be done for seven days, or around that time, because the bone itself is restored.
Et si uis, accipe uesicam ouis, et stringe super foramen eius cannulam arundinis, et intromitte uesicam totam in Vuluam eius.	And if you want, take a sheep's bladder and tie it over her opening with a reed tube, and insert the whole bladder into her vulva.
Deinde suffla in cannulam cum uirtute, donec infletur uesica intra Vuluam, fractura enim redit.	Then blow into the tube with force, until the bladder is inflated within the vulva, because the fracture returns.
Deinde impleatur cum coto, et stet aliquot diebus, secundum quod narrauimus, donec sanetur.	Then let it be filled with cotton and stand for a few days, according to what we narrated, until she is healed.
Et quando frangitur os Pectinis uiri, aut mulieris, tunc administra in restauratione eius, et ipsius aequatione illud quod narrauimus in osse Anchae.	And when the bone of the hip of a man or woman is broken, then apply what we narrated for the restoration and equability of the anchor bone.
Et non occultatur rectum in his fracturis propinquis, quae parum contingunt, praecipue cui est quiddam studii, uel usus.	And the anus is not concealed in these nearby fractures that are somewhat connected, especially for someone who has some knowledge or use.
Et intellige librum meum istum multum, quoniam fractura ipsa significat tibi in pluribus dispositionibus uiam rectam in restauratione sui, et strictura sui: intellige ergo.	And understand my book thoroughly, for the fracture itself signifies to you a straight path in many dispositions for restoring it and binding it up; therefore, understand.
In Virga autem uiri quando frangitur, accipe guttur anseris: et intromitte uirgam in ipso.	But when the man's arm is broken, take a goose's gullet, and insert the rod into it.
Deinde pone super ipsum inuolutionem ex panno, et inuoluatur, et dimittatur tribus diebus, aut circiter eos, et sanabitur, si Deus uoluerit.	Then place a bandage made of cloth over it, and wrap it up, and let it be for three days or about that time, and it will heal if God wills.
¶ De restauratione fracturae ossium, quando est cum uulnere.	Of the restoration of bone fractures when there is a wound.
Caput XX.	Chapter 20.
Conuenit ei cui accidit fractura cum uulnere, praecipue si est magnum, sicut os coxae, aut adiutorii, aut simile illi, ut properes, et phlebotomes ipsum statim: si attestantur tibi conditiones phlebotomiae, sicut praemisimus.	It is suitable for someone who suffers a fracture with a wound, especially if it is great, such as the head of the femur or pelvis, or similar to those, that you hasten and perform bleeding on them immediately: if the conditions of bleeding are indicated to you, as we have mentioned before.
Quod si uulnus effluit sanguinem, tunc oportet, ut properes ad abscisionem eius, ita ut puluerizes super ipsum zegi tritum: si non est tibi praesens aliud.	But if the wound flows with blood, then you should hasten to its excision, so that you powder powdered zinc on top of it: if you do not have anything else present.
Deinde incipe restaurare fracturam in illo eodem die: et non postponas illud, si non accidit apostema.	Then begin to restore the fracture in that very same day: and do not put it off if no abscess occurs.
Si uero accidit apostema calidum, tunc dimitte restaurationem eius usque ad diem nonum, donec sedetur apostema.	If a warm abscess occurs, then put off the restoration of it until the ninth day, until the abscess subsides.
Et non appropinques ei in die tertio, et quarto omnino, nam tu faceres ei accidere accidentia mala.	And do not approach it on the third and fourth days at all, for you would cause to happen to it bad accidents.
Si autem os fractum est eminens super cutem detectum: tunc oportet, ut coneris reducere ipsum, et aequare ipsum manibus tuis cum facilitate et extensione parua.	But if a broken bone is prominent above the skin and detected: then you should reduce it, and equalize it with your hands with ease and slight extension.
Si autem non praeparatur extensio eius, et ipsius aequatio manibus tuis: tunc reduc ipsum cum isto instrumento.	But if its extension is not prepared, nor its equalization by your hands: then reduce it with that instrument.
Et est instrumentum quod fit ex ferro, cuius longitudo est quantitas septem digitorum, aut octo: et eius latitudo est secundum quantitatem uulneris.	And the instrument is one made of iron, whose length is seven or eight fingers' breadth, and its width is according to the size of the wound.
Et propter illud necesse est medico, ut accipiat ex eis tria, aut quatuor secundum quantitatem qua indiget ad illud ex curatione in omni specie fracturae.	And for that reason it is necessary for a doctor to take from them three or four according to the quantity which he needs for curing any kind of fracture.
Et sit rotundum: et sit in eo grossitudo parua, ut non duplicetur apud compressionem super ipsum in hora operationis: et sit acutae extremitatis, cui sit margo in extremitatibus suis.	And let it be rounded: and let there be a small thickness to it, so that it does not double upon the pressure on it at the time of the operation: and let its sharp extremity have an edge on its ends.
Et sit superius eius ad grossitudinem ex medietate eius usque ad inferiora.	And let its upper part be to the thickness from its middle up to its lower parts.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its shape.
Oportet in Hac Operatione, ut ponatur extremitas eius acuta curuata super extremitatem ossis eminentis: et impelle ipsum cum eo uice una, donec quando redit os et aequatur quadam aequatione.	It is necessary in this operation that the sharp extremity be placed curved over the end of the prominent bone; and push it with one force until the bone returns and becomes equal to some sort of equality.
Conare ergo aequare extremitates fracturae adinuicem.	Therefore, strive to make the ends of the fracture equal to each other.
Quod si extremitates eius fracta est subtilis, et non accipit eam instrumentum accaeptione bona, tunc opotet, ut incidas extremitatem illius ossis, donec instrumentum potestatem habeat eius.	But if the ends of it are a thin fracture and do not receive it by good acceptance, then it is necessary to cut off the end of that bone until the instrument has power over it.
Si uero non potes reducere eos cum eo quod narrauimus omnino, tunc incide ipsum cum eo quod conuenit ei ex Incisoriis quae diximus: aut serra ipsum cum una serrarum quocunque modo possibile est tibi.	But if you cannot reduce them with what we have described entirely, then cut it off with the one that suits it from the saws which we mentioned: or saw it through in whatever way is possible for you.
Deinde rade illud quod remanet in osse ex asperitate et corticibus minutis.	Then remove what remains on the bone of roughness and small splinters.
Cum ergo reducitur os, et inuenit infirmus post reductionem eius dolorem uehementem laedentem, tunc scias, quod os non rediit ad locum suum naturalem.	When therefore the bone is reduced and the patient after its reduction finds a violent and painful suffering, then you will know that the bone has not returned to its natural place.
Fac ergo illud.	Do it.
Nam tu confers infirmo iuuamentum magnum, cum completur restauratio tua quam facis ossi.	For you bring great benefit to the patient, when your completion of restoration is done on the bone.
Tunc submerge pannum in uino stiptico, nigro.	Then plunge a cloth into black wine for dressing.
Et proprie si est in aestate.	And if it is proper in summer.
Et non ponas super uulnus caerotum, neque aliquid in quo sit oleum: ut non faciat accidere in ipso putredinem et corruptionem.	And do not place a poultice over the wound nor anything that has oil on it, lest it cause putrefaction and corruption to occur in it.
Deinde administra astellas in hora complementi tui a restauratione ossis.	Then administer astragalus for the completion of an hour to restore bone.
Et dimitte uulnus detectum: ita, ut incidas cum forficibus foramen in inuolutionibus secundum quantitatem uulneris.	And let the wound discovered be thus: that you cut with scissors a hole in the swellings according to the size of the wound.
Et caue omni cautela, ne stringas uulnus cum fractura.	And beware with all caution, lest you suture the wound with a fracture.
Multotiens enim fecerunt istud stolidi medici: et fecerunt accidere super infirmos suos aut mortem, aut corrosionem, aut zuchem, id est, saniem.	For many times foolish doctors have done this: and they have brought about upon their weak patients either death or consumption or gangrene, that is, suppuration.
Et sit strictura tua mollis, lenis, diuersa stricturae fracturarum reliquarum.	And let your stitches be soft, gentle, and different from the stabs of other fractures.
Quod si uulnus est malum, aut est uulnus magnum, et times super ipsum quaedam accidentia mala quae narrauimus, et inuenis dolorem in loco suspensum: tunc non oportet, ut ponas super ipsum astellas.	For if the wound is bad or a great one, and you fear some evil accidents that we have mentioned happening on it, and you find pain suspended in the place; then it is not fitting to apply astragalus to it.
Et fac eis inuolutiones ex pannis duris in loco astellarum, et stringe ipsum cum eis.	And make swellings on them with hard cloths in the place of astragalus, and bind it with them.
Cum autem est post diem unum, aut dies duos, et uides uulnus iam incipere, ut in eo generetur pus: tunc aufer desuper ipsum pannum quem posuisti super ipsum cum uino.	When however it is after one day or two days, and you see the wound already beginning to generate pus: then remove from above it the cloth which you placed over it with wine.
Deinde administra licinia, et unguenta cum quibus de consuetudine nostra est, ut medicemur uulnera: sicut unguentum tetrapharmacon, et similia illi.	Then administer lycium and ointments with which we are accustomed to treat wounds, such as the four-drug ointment, and similar ones.
Et conuenit tibi, ut soluas ligamentum.	And it is fitting for you to loosen the bandage.
Et considera uulnus in omni die mane et uespere, donec consolidetur, et sanetur.	And consider the wound every morning and evening, until it is consolidated and healed.
Et oportet, ut praeparetur membrum taliter, ut currat ex eo pus ad inferiora cum facilitate.	And it is necessary to prepare the member so that the pus may flow from it downwards with ease.
Quod si praetereunt uulneri dies multi, et non consolidatur, neque abscinditur pus ab eo: tunc scias, quod illic sunt satagie ossis parua.	For if many days pass over the wound and it does not consolidate, nor is the pus cut off from it: then you will know that there are small abscesses of bone.
Quare oportet, ut inquiras uulnus cum tenta.	Therefore it is necessary to explore the wound with a probe.
Quot uero ex illis alsatagie sunt separata, remoue ea, et extrahe ipsa.	As many of those small abscesses are separated, remove them and take them out.
Et quae ex eis sunt non separata, et pungunt membrum, et faciunt accidere dolorem, conare incidere ea, et auferre ea omni modo quo possibile est tibi illud.	And what are not separated from them, and pierce the member, and cause pain to occur, try to cut them off and remove them in every way possible for you that thing.
Quod si accidat uulneri zuchen, aut ekileten, id est, estiomenus, aut species alia corruptionis et putrefactionis: tunc oportet, ut opponas unicuique ex eis cum eo quod conuenit ei ex curatione, cuius praecessit narratio in capitulo suo.	But if it happens that a wound is inflamed, or gangrenous, that is, corrupt and putrid: then you should apply to each one of them what suits it for treatment, the account of which precedes in its own chapter.
Et ex eo in quo oportet ut stet sermo meus, et cui facias praesentem mentem tuam quando frangitur os, et eminet super membrum, sicut os coxae, et adiutorii, et similia eis ex membris magnis, est, ut non praesumas attractionem eius, multotiens enim accidit ex illo mors, imo dimitte ipsum, donec putrefiat.	And from that in which my speech should stand and to whom you should direct your present mind when the jawbone is broken and protrudes over a member, such as the os coxae and pelvis, and similar ones from large bones: it is, do not presume its attraction, for often death occurs because of it, nay, leave it alone until it putrefies.
Fortasse enim cadet per se post uiginti dies, aut triginta.	Perhaps it will fall off by itself after twenty days, or thirty.
Tunc ergo cura uulnus, si uidetur tibi: et sinon, dimitte ipsum.	Then therefore treat the wound if it seems to you; and otherwise, leave it alone.
¶ De curatione Nodationis in uestigio fracturae.	Of the Treatment of Swelling after a Fracture.
Caput XXI.	Chapter XXI.
Multoties accidit haec Nodatio in uestigio sanationis fracturae.	This swelling often occurs as a result of the healing process of a fracture.
Praecipue, quae est prope iuncturas: et foedatur ex ea figura membri.	Especially those near joints: and it is deformed by the figure of the member.
Et fortasse prohibet membrum ab operatione sua naturali.	And perhaps prevents the member from performing its natural function.
Considera ergo tunc, si nodatio est recens: administra in ea medicinas quae stipticitatem habent, sicut aloe, et olibanum, et myrrha, et sarcocolla, et acacia, et similia eis.	Therefore, consider then if the swelling is recent: apply to it medicines that have astringent properties, such as aloe, and olibanum, and myrrh, and sarcocolla, and acacia, and similar ones.
Ita, ut accipias ex istis quasdam, aut omnes eas: et confice eas cum uino stiptico, aut cum albumine oui, aut cum aceto: et pone eas super nodationem in stuppa, et stringe eas super ipsam strictura bona.	So that you take some or all of these, and mix them with astringent wine, or with egg white, or with vinegar: and apply them to the swelling in a poultice, and bind them securely on top of it.
Et dimitte stricturam, nec soluas eam diebus multis.	And leave the bandage, nor loosen it for many days.
Deinde solue eam, et itera aliam, donec remoueatur nodatio.	Then dissolve it and proceed to another one until the swelling is removed.
Aut stringe super ipsam laminam plumbi decenter.	Or bind on top of that metal plate a piece of lead evenly.
Plumbo enim est proprietas remouendi omne quod timetur ex membris.	For it is the property of lead to remove everything that is feared from the member.
Si autem nodatio iam in lapidem conuersa est, et stricta est, et festine prouocat necessitas ad auferendum eam: tunc finde super eam ex superiori parte eius, et incide superfluitatem eminentem: aut rade eam cum quibusdam rasoriis, donec remoueatur: et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	But if the swelling has already turned to stone and is tight and pressing circumstances require it to be removed promptly: then find a way to cut away the excess part above it: or shave it off with certain rasps until it is removed; and take care of it until it heals.
¶ De curatione quando restauratur, et remanet membrum post illud subtile, non secundum naturam suam.	On the cure when restored, and the member remains after that subtle one not according to its natural state.
Caput XXII.	Chapter 22.
Quando restauratur fractura ossis, et remanet membrum post illud subtile, debile: tunc non fit illud nisi propter caussas multas.	When a bone fracture is restored and the member remains after that subtle one weak: then it does not happen unless for many reasons.
Quarum una est, multitudo solutionis ligamenti et ligationis eius non secundum quod oportet: aut propter superfluitatem stricturae ligamentorum, donec prohibeatur nutrimentum currere ad membrum: aut propter multitudinem embrocationis superfluae in non sua hora: aut propter paucitatem sanguinis in corpore infirmi, et debilitatem eius.	One of which is the multitude of ligament solution and its binding not according to what is fitting: or due to excess tightness of the ligaments, until nourishment is prevented from reaching the member; or due to excessive application of embrocation at an improper time; or due to a lack of blood in the body of one who is infirm and weak.
Et curatio illius est, cibare infirmum, et tenerum facere corpus eius, donec multiplicetur sanguis in eo.	And its cure is to feed the infirm person and make their body tender until blood increases in them.
Et administra balneum.	And administer a bath.
Et intromitte gaudium et laeticiam super eum.	And introduce joy and gladness over him.
Deinde pone picem super membrum: ut attrahat pix ad ipsum nutrimentum multum.	Then place pitch on the member: so that the pitch may draw to it a great deal of nourishment.
Et assiduet embrocationem eius cum aqua tepida, donec currat nutrimentum, et redeat ad figuram suam naturalem.	And continue to apply its embrocation with warm water, until nourishment flows and it returns to its natural shape.
¶ De curatione ossium fractorum quando restaurantur tortuose.	On the cure of fractured bones when they are restored in a twisted way.
Caput XXIII.	Chapter 23.
Quando accidit membro iam restaurato post sanationem eius tortuositas, et eminentia ossi fracto, aut nodatio: et foedatur per illud forma membri, uerumtamen membrum non prohibetur ab operatione sua naturali: tunc non oportet ut recipias sermonem eius, qui existimat, ut frangatur membrum denuo.	When it happens that a member already restored after its healing becomes twisted and the fractured bone or swelling appears, and is disfigured by that member's form, although the member is not prevented from performing its natural function: then it is not necessary to accept its advice, which thinks that the member should be broken again.
Et iam fuerunt multi stolidorum medicorum et restauratorum, qui fecerunt illud in terra nostra.	And already there have been many foolish surgeons and restorers who did that thing on our earth.
Et haec quidem operatio est uituperabilis ualde, perducens ad mortem, uel timorem magnum, ut scilicet sit mortalis.	And this operation is indeed very reprehensible, leading to death or great fear, so that it will be mortal.
Verum si claudicatio et nodatio sunt recentes: tunc oportet, ut embrocetur cum aqua tepida, in qua decoctae sint herbae mollificantes, sicut folia alteae, et radix eius, et mellilotum, et illis similia.	But if the swelling and constriction are recent: then it is necessary to anoint with warm water in which herbs that soften have been decocted, such as tall grass leaves, and its root, and sweet melilotus, and things similar to these.
Et fiat ei emplastrum cum emplastro mollificatiuo, sicut dyachilon decenter factum.	And a poultice should be made with a softening plaster, such as dychilone made in this way.
Aut sumatur mucilago radicis alteae, et concutiatur cum adipe gallinae, aut oleo sisamino: et emplastretur cum eo.	Or the mucilage of tall grass root should be taken and mixed with hen's fat or sesame oil, and poulticed with it.
Aut sumantur ficus pingues, et terantur cum fimo columbino, et similibus eis quae nominantur ex medicinis diminuentes consolidationem.	Or they should take figs that are ripe, and pound them with dove's dung, and similar things which are called by medicines that reduce consolidation.
Et quandoque soluitur nodatio cum fricatione assidua, antiqua, et leni, quae fit cum manibus humidis.	And sometimes constriction is loosened with frequent, gentle, and soft friction done with moist hands.
Et administretur motus membri ad omnem partem in horis omnibus.	And movement of the member should be administered to every part at all hours.
Si autem tortuositas iam antecessit, et fortis facta est, et conuersa est in lapidem, et prouocata est necessitas ad curatonem eius cum ferro: tunc oportet, ut secetur superius eius, et soluatur continuatio ossis, et incidatur quod superfluit ex nodatione aut osse cum Incisoriis subtilibus: et administretur facilitas in illo cum sollicitudine et studio.	But if the twisting has already occurred and is strong, and has turned into a bone and necessity for its cure with iron has been provoked: then it is necessary to cut above it, and to release the continuity of the bone, and to cut away what is excessive from the constriction or bone with fine scissors; and to administer ease in that place with solicitude and study.
¶ De sermone in Dislocatione.	On Speech in Dislocation.
Caput XXIIII.	Chapter 28.
Dislocatio est exitus alicuius iuncturarum a loco suo.	A dislocation is the departure of some joints from their place.
Quare prohibetur a motu suo, et foedatur figura membri.	Therefore it is prohibited from its own motion, and the figure of the member is disfigured.
Et facit accidere super infirmum dolores, et laesiones uehementes.	And it causes great pain and violent injuries to occur over the weak person.
Quando ergo accidit alicui dislocatio, tunc oportet festinare ad restaurationem eius: neque tardet eam omnino.	When therefore a dislocation occurs to someone, then it is necessary to hasten to its restoration: and not to delay it at all.
Nam si tardatur, apostematur locus, et fortasse cum eo reductio dislocationis.	If it is delayed, the site will become inflamed and perhaps with it, reduction of dislocation.
Propter illud ergo non oportet, ut moueatur, neque extendatur in hora apostemationis eius.	Therefore, one should not move or stretch it during the inflammation of that place.
Quoniam multotiens facit accidere spasmum, et dolores laedentes.	Because it often causes cramp and piercing pains.
Verum quando accidit illud, tunc oportet, ut properes ad phlebotomiam infirmi.	However, when that happens, then it is necessary to hurry to perform bloodletting on the patient.
Deinde dimittatur, donec quiescat apostema.	Then let it be left alone until the inflammation subsides.
Deinde embrocetur membrum cum aqua calida et oleo.	Then anoint the member with warm water and oil.
Deinde reducatur cum facilitate.	Then reduce it with ease.
Et curetur omne membrum cum eo cuius rememoratio ueniet in loco suo.	And treat the entire member along with him whose remembrance will come into its place.
Ego quidem iam ordinaui capitula dislocationis, etiam secundum quod praecessit in fractura, a superiori parte corporis usque ad inferiorem eius.	I have indeed already arranged the chapters on dislocation, just as it preceded in fracture, from the upper part of the body to the lower.
¶ De cura dislocationis Mandibulae inferioris.	Chapters on the Treatment of Dislocation of the Lower Jawbone.
Caput XXV.	Head 25.
Parum dislocantur duae Mandibulae nisi raro.	Two jawbones are only slightly dislocated unless rarely.
Et dislocatio ambarum fit secundum unum duoru modorum.	And the dislocation of both is done according to two modes.
Aut enim remouentur a locis suis remotione parua, et mollificantur parumper.	Or indeed they are moved away from their places by a small removal and are softened for a little while.
Aut dislocantur dislocatione integra, completa, donec mollificentur ad partem pectoris, donec currat saliua infirmi, et non possit tenere eam, neque possit claudere os suum, et inuoluatur lingua eius cum sermone.	Or they are dislocated entirely and completely, until they are softened to the point of the breast, until the patient's saliva flows, and he is unable to hold it or close his mouth, and his tongue becomes entwined with speech.
Quando autem dislocatio eius est parua, tunc redit in pluribus dispositionibus per se cum paucitate.	When however the dislocation of that is small, then it returns to its place by itself with slight difficulty.
Si uero est dislocatio completa, integra: tunc oportet, ut administretur reductio eius uelociter, et non tardetur penitus: et est, ut teneat minister caput infirmi: et intromittat medicus pollicem manus suae unius in radicem Mandibulae dislocationis inter os eius, si dislocatio est a parte una.	If the dislocation is complete and entire, then it is necessary to apply reduction quickly and not delay at all: and it is, as if one would hold the patient's head in place; and the doctor should insert his thumb into the root of the dislocated jawbone between the patient's mouth, if the dislocation is from one side.
Aut intromittat duos pollices suos simul, si dislocatio est a duabus partibus.	He should insert his two fingers simultaneously, if the dislocation is from two parts.
Et reliqui digiti manuum eius sint extra, quibus aequet.	And the remaining fingers of his hand shall be outside, to which it corresponds.
Et praecipe infirmo, ut mundificet Mandibulas suas, et absoluat eas ad manducandum ad omnem partem.	And he should instruct the patient to clean their jawbones and prepare them for eating in all parts.
Et medicus aequet Mandibulam, et impellat Mandibulam, donec redeat ad locum suum.	And the doctor will set the jawbone and push it until it returns to its place.
Quod si difficilis sit reductio eius, praecipue si sunt ambae Mandibulae simul: tunc administra uaporationem cum aqua calida, et oleo, donec fiat facilis reductio ambarum: neque tardes reductionem ambarum omnino, sicut diximus.	But if the reduction is difficult, especially if both jawbones are simultaneously dislocated: then administer a poultice with hot water and oil until it becomes easy to reduce both; nor should you delay reducing both altogether, as we said.
Cum ergo redeunt et aequantur, et clauditur os infirmi, et non mollificantur: tunc pone super eas puluillos pannorum, cum ceroto quod sit factum ex cera: et oleo rosato.	When therefore they return and are set in place, and the patient's mouth is closed and not relaxed: then place over them poultices of cloths, made with wax and rose oil.
Deinde ligetur cum facilitate cum ligamentis mollibus.	Then it should be bound easily with soft ligaments.
Et sit somnus infirmi super dorsum suum: et caput eius sit stans inter duo puluinaria, ut non moueat ipsum ad dextram et sinistram: neque conetur, uel cogatur masticare aliquid: imo ponatur cibus eius sorbitio lenis, donec quando remouentur dolores, et nodatur Mandibula: tunc comedat quod uult, et administretur illud cum facilitate.	And let the patient sleep on his back: and let his head be placed between two pillows, so that he does not move it to the right or left: nor should he try or be forced to chew anything: but rather have his food offered by gentle sipping, until when the pains are removed, and the jawbone is relaxed; then let him eat what he wants, and administer it with ease.
Non laboret super operationem oris sui apud comestionem et potum, et oscitationem, donec nodetur Mandibula, et sanetur.	He should not exert himself over his mouth's function during eating and drinking, and kissing, until the jawbone is relaxed and healed.
Quod si difficilis fiat reductio duarum Mandibuiarum, quando dislocantur in hora aliqua, et non conuertuntur ad loca sua: tunc multotiens accidunt inde febres, et soda assidua: et fortasse soluitur uenter infirmi, et fortasse uomit choleram puram.	What if the reduction of both jawbones becomes difficult when they are dislocated at some time and do not return to their place: then many fevers and prolonged illnesses occur; and perhaps the patient's bowels become loose, and perhaps he vomits pure bile.
Cum ergo uides illud: tunc scias, quia est perditio, et multotiens moritur ille cui accidit illud in decem diebus.	When therefore you see that: then you will know that it is a loss, and many times that person dies within ten days.
¶ De reducione dislocationis Furculae, et extremitatis humeri.	On the reduction of a shoulder dislocation and the extremity of the arm.
Caput XXVI.	Chapter 26.
Furcula quidem non dislocatur ex latere intrinseco, propter continuationem suam cum pectore.	The shoulder indeed does not become dislocated from the internal side, because of its continuity with the breast.
Et dislocatur quandoque ad exteriora: et declaratur illud sensui.	And it becomes dislocated sometimes to the outside: and that is made known by sense.
Et restauratio eius est, ut iaceat infirmus super dorsum suum, et extendat brachia sua.	And its restoration is, that the weak person lies on his back, and stretches out his arms.
Deinde coarta locum cum palma tua coartatione forti, nam ipsa redibit.	Then compress the place with a firm palm compression, for it will return itself.
Deinde pone super ipsam emplastrum, et puluillos, et stringe eam.	Then place a poultice on top of it, and bind it tightly.
Extremitates uero eius quae sequuntur cubitum, et continuantur cum eo, non dislocantur, nisi raro.	As for its extremities which follow the elbow and are connected with it, they do not become dislocated, unless rarely.
Quod s dislocatur die aliquo: tunc oportet, ut reducatur et aequetur secundum quod diximus, et quod praeparatur tibi.	For if it becomes dislocated one day: then it is necessary to reduce and set it right according to what we said, and what has been prepared for you.
Deinde pone super ipsam emplastrum, et puluillos, et stricturam.	Then place a poultice on top of it, and bind it tightly.
Et praecipe infirmo, adhaerere tranquillitati et quieti, donec sanetur.	And instruct the patient to adhere to tranquility and quiet, until they are healed.
Et cum hac eadem curatione reducitur extremitas Humeri, quando separatur etiam a loco suo.	And with this same treatment, the extremity of the arm is reduced when it becomes separated from its place.
¶ De reductione dislocationis Humeri.	On the reduction of a shoulder dislocation.
Caput XXVII.	Chapter 27.
Scias, quod Humerus non dislocatur, nisi secundum tres modos.	Know that the arm does not become dislocated, unless according to three modes.
Quorum unus est, ut dislocetur ad partem titillici ad inferiora.	One of which is, that it becomes dislocated towards the part of the titillium downwards.
Secundus est, ut dislocetur ad partem pectoris.	The second is, that it becomes dislocated towards the part of the breast.
Et fortasse dislocatur ad superiorem partem Humeri: et illud fit raro.	And perhaps it becomes dislocated to the upper part of the arm: and that happens rarely.
Et non dislocatur ad posteriora, propter spatulam.	And it does not become dislocated towards the back, due to the spate.
Et non dislocatur ad anteriora, propter neruos.	And it does not become dislocated towards the front, due to the nerves.
Et plurimum quidem dislocatur et egreditur ad inferiora uersus titillicum: praecipue in illis, quorum carnes sunt paucae.	And it is indeed mostly dislocated and comes out towards the lower part towards the titillium: especially in those whose flesh is rare.
Quoniam egrediur in eis uelociter, et ingreditur uelociter.	Because it departs quickly from them and enters quickly.
In illis autem quorum carnes sunt multae, est econtrario illius, scilicet quia egreditur cum difficultate, et ingreditur cum difficultate.	But in those whose flesh is many, it is contrary to that, namely because it departs with difficulty and enters with difficulty.
Et fortasse accidit quibusdam hominibus percussio, aut casus, et apostematur Humerus apostemate calido, et putatur propter illud, quia iam dislocatus est.	And perhaps it happens to certain people that they are struck or fall, and the shoulder becomes inflamed with apostema, and is thought to be because of that, since it has already become dislocated.
Oportet ergo, ut experiaris illud, donec stes super certitudinem eius, et tunc procedas in curatione eius.	Therefore, you must test it until you are certain of its nature, and then proceed with its cure.
Et cognoscitur dislocatio, quando est ad inferiora uersus titillicum: et distinguas inter Humerum dislocatum, et humerum sanum.	And it is known to be a dislocation when it turns towards the lower part in a tilting manner; and distinguish between a dislocated shoulder and a healthy one.
Nam tu inuenis inter eos diuersitatem manifestam, et inuenis in capite Humeri concauitatem, et sub titillico apud tactum caput humeri quasi ipsum sit ouum: et non potest infirmus reducere manum ad aurem suam, neque mouere eam omnibus motibus.	For you will find a manifest difference between them, and you will find in the head of the shoulder a hollowing out, and under the tilting part at the touch it is as if the head of the humerus were an egg; and the infirm person cannot bring their hand to their ear or move it with all movements.
Et similiter, si dislocatur uersus pectus, aut ad sursum: tunc inuenis manifestum tactum, neque occultatur.	And similarly, if it becomes dislocated towards the chest or upwards: then you will find a manifest touch and it is not hidden.
Et huius quidem dislocationis fit facilis reductio, quando est recens, aut infirmus est puer.	And the reduction of this dislocation is easy when it is recent or the infant is weak.
Et reductio eius est, ut eleuet minister manum suam ad superiora.	And its reduction is to lift one's hand up to the higher part.
Deinde pone tu pollices tuos sub titillico eius, et eleua iuncturam cum fortitudine ad sursum ad locum suum: et minister eleuet manum suam, et extendat eam ad sursum.	Then place your fingers under the tilting part of it and lift the joint with force upwards to its place; and the minister will lift their hand and stretch it upwards.
Deinde ponat eam inferius, ipse enim redit uelociter.	Then put it back down, for it returns quickly by itself.
Si autem non redit per illud quod diximus, et sunt a principio quo accidit dislocatio dies multi: tunc oportet, ut balneetur infirmus in aqua calida, et administretur embrocatio quae mollificat et lenit, sicut si decoquantur radices alteae, et foenugraecum, et mellilotum in aqua, et administretur.	But if it does not return by what we said, and there are many days since the dislocation occurred: then it is necessary for the infirm person to bathe in warm water, and a poultice should be applied which softens and soothes, just as if one were to decoct roots of althea, and fenugreek, and melilot in water, and apply it.
Deinde resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum: et ponatur sub titillico eius sphera et lana, quae sit aequalis inter lenitatem et stricturam.	Then the patient should be placed on his back: and a sphere and woolen wadding should be put under his headrest, which is equal between softness and tightness.
Deinde ponat medicus calcaneum suum super spheram, et eleuet caput humeri cum uirtute, et attrahat manum infirmi ad inferiora.	Then the doctor should place his own heel on the sphere, and lift the patient's shoulder with force, and pull the patient's hand down towards the lower part.
Et minister alius teneat caput infirmi, ut non moueatur ad inferiora: ipse namque redit statim.	And another attendant should hold the patient's head, so that it does not move downwards: for he will immediately return to his former state.
Et si uis, reduc eum secundum modum hunc: et est, ut facias esse praesentem uirum qui sit longior infirmo, et stet a parte lateris, et intromittat humerum suum sub titillico infirmi: et eleuet titillicum eius ad superiora, donec sit infirmus suspensus in aere.	And if you wish, reduce him according to this method: and it is, that you should make the present man who is taller than the patient, stand on his side, and insert his shoulder under the patient's headrest; and lift up the headrest of the patient until he is suspended in the air.
Et minister alius trahat manum infirmi ad inferiora uentris eius.	And another attendant should pull the patient's hand down towards his lower stomach.
Si autem infirmus est leuis: tunc oportet, ut suspendatur cum eo aliquid aliud, ut grauet ipsum: nam redit dislocatio statim.	But if the patient is light, then it is necessary to suspend something else with him, so that he may be weighted down: for the dislocation will return immediately.
Et reducitur etiam secundum modum alium: et est, ut figatur in terra lignum longum, cuius caput sit rotundum figura: sicut manica mortarii: quod non sit grossum, neque subtile.	And he is also reduced according to another method: and it is, that a long piece of wood is placed on the ground, whose head is rounded like a mortar handle: not thick nor thin.
Deinde ponatur sub infirmo postquam ponuntur super caput ligni panni lenes: et infirmus sit stans secundum longitudinem ligni.	Then a soft cloth should be placed under the patient after they are placed on top of the wooden headrest: and the patient should stand according to the length of the wood.
Deinde extendatur manus eius ad inferiora a parte altera, et extendatur corpus eius ab altera parte cum fortitudine: nam iunctura redit ad locum suum cum uelocitate.	Then his hand should be stretched down from the other side and his body should be stretched out from the other side with strength: for the joint will return to its place quickly.
Quod si difficilis sit eius reductio per omnia quae diximus, tunc utere hac cura: et est, ut accipias lignum cuius longitudo sit quantitas duorum brachiorum, et eius latitudo quantitas quatuor digitorum, et grossitudo eius quantitas duorum digitorum: cui sit caput rotundum, ut alleuietur introitus eius in profundum titillici, secundum hanc formam.	But if his reduction is difficult through all that we have said, then use this treatment: and it is, that you should take a piece of wood whose length is the quantity of two arms, and its width the quantity of four fingers, and its thickness the quantity of two fingers: which has a rounded head to facilitate its entry into the deep headrest, according to this form.
Deinde ligentur super caput rotundum panni lenes, ut non laedat lignum infirmum.	Then soft cloths are placed over the round head, so as not to hurt the weak wood.
Deinde ponatur sub titillico infirmi, ut extendatur manus, aut brachium super lignum usque ad inferiora: et ligetur lignum super adiutorium et brachium et extremitatem manus.	Then it should be placed underneath the weak person's armpit, so that their hand or arm can be extended over the wood up to the lower part: and the wood should be tied above the assistant, the arm, and the end of the hand.
Deinde ponatur brachium super gradum scalae per latitudinem, et extendatur manus ad inferiora, et dimittatur reliquum corpus suspensum a parte altera.	Then the arm should be placed over the step of the ladder in width, and the hand extended downwards, and the rest of the body suspended from the other side.
Iunctura enim ingreditur statim.	For the junction enters at once.
Cum ergo completur introitus eius secundum quemcunque modum possibile est: tunc oportet, ut ponas sub titillico spheram aequalis quantitatis ex lana.	When however the entrance is completed in any way possible: then it is necessary to place under the armpit a sphere of equal size made of wool.
Deinde pone emplastrum praeparatum ex puluere molendini cum olibano, et albumine oui super humerum totum, sicut reuoluitur desuper.	Then place the prepared poultice made from mill dust with frankincense and egg white over the entire shoulder, as it turns over above.
Deinde stringe sub titillico strictura decenti: et reuoluatur ligamentum super emplastrum desuper: et annectatur manus eius ad collum ipsius, et dimittatur, neque moueatur manus eius septem diebus.	Then bind under the armpit a suitable tight bandage; and turn the ligature over the poultice above; and attach his hand to his own neck, and let it be, so that his hand is not moved for seven days.
Et oportet, ut ponatur cibus infirmipaucus, donec confortetur membrum: quoniam est uelocius ad sanationem eius.	And it is necessary to place a light diet for the sick person until the member is comforted: because it is more conducive to its healing.
Deinde ponatur amplior post septem dies, aut quinque, et ex ercitetur cum motu.	Then place a larger one after seven days, or five, and exercise with movement.
Si ergo firmatur et non mollificatur, tunc iam sanatus est.	If it is then strengthened and not weakened, then he is already healed.
Si uero iunctura dislocatur multotiens, propter humiditatem quae accidit ei, aut propter caussam aliam: tunc oportet, ut administretur in ea cauterium cum tribus foraminibus, secundum quod praemissum est in capitulo de cauterio.	But if the joint is dislocated many times, due to moisture that happens to him, or for some other reason: then it is necessary to apply a cauterization with three openings, according to what was previously mentioned in the chapter on cauterization.
Quod si fiat hoc totum, et soluatur ligamentum post septem dies, et non confirmetur iunctura, et reducatur emplastrum et strictura super ipsum aliquotiens, et non firmetur, et cadat, et non possit eleuare ipsum ad superiora: tunc scias, quod nerui eius qui sunt ad caput humeri, iam incisi sunt, aut extensi, aut mollificati: et scias, quod iunctura nunquam figetur in loco suo.	But if this is done entirely, and the ligament is loosened after seven days, and the joint is not confirmed, and the poultice and bandage are applied again over it several times, and it does not firm up, and it falls, and he cannot lift it to the higher part: then you will know that the nerves of his who are related to the head of the shoulder have already been cut, or stretched, or weakened; and you will know that the joint will never be set in its proper place.
Dislocationis autem quae fit uersus pectus et mammillam, aut ad posteriora reductio, fit cum impulsione et extensione cum manibus: donec redeat, et administretur in ea reliqua strictura et cura, donec sanetur.	However, the dislocation that occurs towards the chest and nipple, or is reduced to the back, is accomplished with a blow and extension using hands, until it returns, and then a remaining binding and care are administered until it heals.
Quod si accidat post sanationem grauitas in membro, et tarditas in motu eius, tunc utatur infirmus balneo multotiens, donec leniatur illa grauitas, et redeat ad naturam eius primam.	But if heaviness occurs in a member after healing, and tardiness in its movement, then the invalid will use a bath many times until that heaviness is alleviated, and it returns to its original nature.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Cubiti.	Of the Curing of Elbow Dislocations.
Caput XXVIII.	Chapter 28.
Scias, quod iunctura Cubiti dislocatur cum difficultate, et similiter redit cum difficultate etiam: et ipsa quidem dislocatur ad omnes partes, et praecipue ad anteriorem, aut ad posteriorem.	Know that the joint of the elbow is dislocated with difficulty and similarly returns with difficulty also; and indeed it dislocates to all parts and particularly to the anterior or posterior.
Et eius dislocatio non occultatur tibi: quoniam est cadens sub uisu, et sub tactu, secundum quamcunque figuram dislocetur.	And its dislocation is not hidden from you; because it falls under the sight and touch, according to whatever shape it may be dislocated.
Et quando coniungis cubitum dislocatum cum sano, declaratur tibi illud manifeste.	And when you join the dislocated elbow with a sound one, it is made manifest to you.
Concauatur enim iunctura, et non potest duplicare brachium, neque tangere cum eo humerum suum.	It is bent, and cannot straighten the arm, nor touch its shoulder with it.
Et oportet, ut properes, et reducas dislocationem statim, antequam accidat ei apostema calidum.	And you should hasten to reduce the dislocation immediately, before a hot abscess occurs.
Nam si accidit ei apostema calidum, difficilis fit eius reductio: et fortasse non sanatur omnino, praecipue quando est ad posteriora.	For if a hot abscess occurs, the reduction becomes difficult and perhaps not at all successful, especially when it is located in the back.
Est enim deterior omnibus speciebus dislocationis, et uehementioris doloris eis: et multotiens descendit cum ea mors.	For it is indeed worse than all other types of dislocations and accompanied by more violent pain; and many times death follows with it.
Et restauratio eius quando est ex eis quae possibile est reducere, est, ut extendatur manus eius cum duabus manibus: et brachium eius sit expansum, et manus medici sint supra cubitum et sub eo, et ipse impellat iuncturam cum pollicibus manuum suarum simul, aut cum radice palmae suae, donec redeat ad locum suum.	And the restoration of it when it is possible to reduce it, is for his hand to be stretched out with both hands: and his arm to be expanded, and the hands of the doctor to be above and below the elbow, and he himself to push the joint with the tips of his fingers or with the palm of his hand, until it returns to its place.
Aut uero dislocatio est ad anteriora: tunc redit ita, ut duplicet manum cum manu sua, donec percutiat cum radice palmae suae cubitum qui est dislocatus.	Or indeed the dislocation is to the front: then it returns thus, that he doubles his hand with his own, until he strikes the elbow which is dislocated with the tip of his palm.
Quod si non obedit dislocatio ad reductionem, tunc administra extensionem uehementem, fortem ualde: et est, ut extendant brachium duo ministri: et teneant ipsum duo ministri etiam, ut non remoueatur apud extensionem.	If the dislocation does not obey reduction, then administer a strong and great extension; and this is, to have two attendants stretch out the arm, and for the two attendants also to hold it so that it will not be moved during the extension.
Deinde reuoluatur brachium ad omnem partem postquam inuoluitur super manum eius pannus duplicatus longus, aut ligamentum latum.	Then roll back the arm to all parts after it has been wrapped around his hand with a doubled long cloth or broad bandage.
Et quando tangit medicus manu sua iuncturam, inungat ipsam cum oleo: ut sit illud ex eis quae adiuuant in lubricitate iuncturae cum facilitate.	And when the doctor touches the joint with his own hand, let him anoint it with oil, so that it may be one of those things which aid in the lubrication of the joint with ease.
Deinde impellat iuncturam impulsione uehementi, donec redeat.	Then push the joint with a strong push until it returns.
Et post reductionem eius oportet, ut ponatur super ipsam emplastrum, in quo sit stipticitas, et exiccatio cum albugine oui: et stringatur strictura decenti.	And after the reduction, it is necessary that a poultice be placed on top of it, in which there should be a soothing quality, and a cooling with a white ointment; and let it be bandaged tightly.
Et suspendatur brachium a collo infirmi: et dimitte diebus aliquot.	And let the arm be suspended from the sick person's neck; and leave it for several days.
Deinde soluatur.	Then it will loosen.
Si ergo firmatur iunctura in loco suo, tunc solue ligamentum ab ea, et dimitte ipsam.	If the joint is strengthened in its place, then untie the bandage from it and let it go.
Et si uides iuncturam non bene stringi, tunc itera emplastrum, et ligamentum, et dimitte ipsam diebus aliquot, donec stringatur.	And if you see the joint not well bound, then repeat the poultice, and the bandage, and let it go for several days until it is bound.
Deinde solue ipsam.	Then release it.
Si autem accidit ei grauitas post reductionem iuncturae, et dispositio sit in motu: tunc administra humectationem in balneatione, et fricationem subtilem, et compressionem, donec liniatur, aut pone super iuncturam iliati, id est, natem arietis pinguem.	But if heaviness occurs after the reduction of the joint, and its position is in motion: then administer moisture in bathing, and gentle friction, and compression, until it becomes smooth, or place a fatty sheep's womb on top of the joint, that is, a rich goat's placenta.
Deinde ligetur, et dimitte ipsam super eam die et nocte.	Then let it be bound, and leave it there day and night.
Deinde aufer eam, et intromitte ipsum in balneum.	Then take it away, and introduce him into the bath.
Cum ergo sudat, tunc frica iuncturam fricatione temperata.	When he sweats, then rub the joint with a moderate friction.
Deinde itera super ipsam aleliati uice una, et secunda, et tertia cum introitu balnei, donec leniatur.	Then place a poultice on top of it for one, two, and three days with the introduction of bathing, until it is softened.
Et si uis, pone super ipsam stercus uaccinum, humidum, calefactum cum butyro, et stringe super ipsum.	And if you wish, place over it sheep's dung, moist, warmed with butter, and tie above it.
Fac illud aliquotiens.	Do that several times.
Ipsa namque lenitur, et redit ad dispositionem suam.	It is itself eased, and returns to its natural state.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Almahassem.	On the treatment of a broken limb.
Caput XXIX.	Book Twenty-Nine.
Mahassem manus multotiens dislocatur, id est, iunctura quae est inter brachium et manum.	The limb called Mahassem is often dislocated, that is, the joint which is between the arm and the hand.
Et reductio dislocationis eius est facilis.	And the reduction of this dislocation is easy.
Econtrario reliquarum iuncturarum.	On the contrary, it is more difficult than the other joints.
Verumtamen oportet, ut uelocitas sit in reductione dislocationis eius in hora in qua dislocatur, antequam apostemetur locus: aut accidat in eo apostema calidum.	However, it is necessary that the swiftness be in reducing this dislocation within an hour of when it occurs, before the location becomes inflamed or a warm abscess forms.
Et reductio dislocationis in eo est, ut ponas Mahassem manus infirmae super tabulam, et extendat minister manum eius: et ponat medicus palmam suam super eminentiam iuncturae, et impellat eam, donec redeat.	And the reduction of this dislocation is to place the Mahassem hand, which is weak, on a table, and let the servant stretch out his hand: and the doctor shall place his palm on the prominence of the joint, and push it until it returns.
Verumtamen oportet, ut consyderetur, si palma iam recessit ad uentrem manus: tunc ponat infirmus dorsum manus suae super tabulam apud extensionem et reductionem: et si dislocatio est procedens ad dorsum manus, tunc sit positio manus eius intrinsece super tabulam, id est, interior pars manus eius super tabulam ponatur, ut cadat manus medici super ipsam eminentiam iuncturae.	However, it is necessary to consider whether the palm has already receded to the back of the hand: then let the weak person place the back of his hand on the table for extension and reduction; and if the dislocation is proceeding towards the back of the hand, then let the position of his hand be inward on the table, that is, the inner part of his hand shall be placed on the table, so that the doctor's hand falls over it onto the prominence of the joint.
Si ergo redit statim, bonum est: et si non, tunc stringe eam cum emplastro sedante apostema: et dimitte ipsum, neque iteres illud.	So if it returns immediately, it is good; and if not, then bind it with a soothing plaster and abscess, and leave it alone, nor repeat that.
Nam si non tolerat, neque potes super reductionem eius, postquam praetereunt ei dies, uerumtamen iunctura remanet secundum tortuositatem suam: et non nocet infirmo aliquid, nisi quod mollificatur manus, et non potest stringere aliquid: tunc scias, quod nerui sunt abscissi, aut attriti.	For if it does not tolerate, nor can you work on its reduction after the days have passed, yet the joint remains according to its own twisting; and it does not harm the patient anything except that the hand becomes soft, and cannot grasp anything: then you will know that the nerves are cut or worn out.
Non est ergo ingenium in ea, nisi ut stringatur cum cauterio prope casum eius.	It is not, therefore, a talent in it, unless it is bound with caustic near its fall.
Et fortasse non confert illud aliquid.	And perhaps that thing does not matter at all.
Cum ergo non redit Almahassem, tunc pone super ipsum emplastrum, quod narrauimus.	When therefore Almahassem does not heal, then place a poultice on top of it as we have described.
Deinde stringatur, et dimittatur quinque diebus: postea soluatur et dimittatur, et exercitetur manus.	Then let it be bound and let it remain for five days; afterwards let it be loosened and let it remain, and let the hand be exercised.
Si autem priuatur motus eius, et accidat in ea aliquid grauitatis: tunc leni eam cum aqua calefacta, et fricatione aliquotiens, donec leniatur.	But if it is deprived of movement and something grave happens to it; then soothe it with warm water and gentle friction several times, until it becomes soothing.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Digitorum.	Of the Curing of Fingernail Dislocations.
Caput XXX.	Chapter 30.
Quando dislocatur ex eis Digitus ad omnem partem, uel ex eis Digitus ad dorsum palmae, aut uentrem eius: tunc extende Digitum, et impelle dislocationem pollicibus tuis, donec redeat.	When a finger is dislocated in any direction, or one of the fingers to the back of the palm or to its belly; then extend the finger and push the dislocation with your thumbs until it returns.
Deinde sustenta caput Digiti, et suspende ipsum uersus partem ad quam dislocatur, et dimitte ipsum duobus diebus.	Then support the head of the finger and suspend it towards the direction in which it is dislocated, and let it remain for two days.
Deinde suspende eum, et extende ipsum, donec aequetur rectus in illo die suo.	Then suspend it and extend it until it becomes straight on that day itself.
Cum ergo fuerit nox, liga ipsum secundum narrationem ipsam: et non cesses soluere ipsum in die: et exerce eum cum motu: et liga ipsum in nocte.	When therefore it is night, bind it according to the same narration; and do not cease to loosen it by day: and exercise it with movement: and bind it at night.
Fac illud diebus aliquot, donec stringatur.	Do that for several days until it becomes bound.
Et similiter fac cum eo, si dislocatur ad uentrem manus: et liga eum ad partem ipsam, et fac cum eo operationem tuam primam, donec sanetur.	And do the same with him if it is dislocated towards the palm of the hand; and bind him to that part, and perform your first operation on him until he is healed.
Et similiter fac cum eo quando dislocatur ad reliquas partes.	And do the same with him when it is dislocated to the other parts.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Spondilium dorsi.	Of the Curing of Dislocation of the Spine of the Back.
Caput XXXI.	Chapter 31.
Quando accidit alicui Spondilium dorsi, aut colli dislocatio completa, aut remouentur Spondiles multae a locis suis: tunc non est in ea curatio, quoniam mors properat infirmo.	When it happens to anyone that the spine of the back or neck is completely dislocated, or many vertebrae are removed from their places; then there is no cure for this, since death approaches the sick person.
Et signum illius est, quod egestio infirmi egreditur absque uoluntate, neque potest tenere eam: et multotiens mollificantur ex eo quaedam membra eius, aut duo crura eius, aut duo brachia ipsius, aut unum eorum: aut remouetur Spondilis una de loco suo.	And its sign is that the patient's evacuation occurs without his will, nor can he hold it; and some of his limbs become softened, or two legs of his, or two arms of his, or one of them: or it is removed from its place.
Multotiens enim remouetur, quod multotiens fit remotio earum ad quatuor partes.	For indeed it is often removed, because removal occurs often to four parts.
Illa ergo quae remouetur ad posteriora, nominatur Gibbositas.	Therefore, that which is removed to the rear is called Gibbositas.
Curatio uero eius est, ut consyderes tunc, si Gibbositas accidit a puericia: tunc non est in ea curatio, neque ex ea est sanatio omnino.	But its cure is that you should consider then, if Gibbositas occurs from childhood: then there is no cure in it, nor is there any recovery at all.
In illa autem quae accidit a casu, aut percussione, aut similibus illis, iam dixerunt antiqui modos curationis sermone prolixo.	But as for that which occurs by chance, or striking, or similar things, the ancient modes of treatment have already been said in lengthy speech.
Cuius plurimum non redit cum proficuo.	Of which most do not return with profit.
Ego uero iam abbreuiaui ex illo, cuius parum excusat a multo eius ex propinquitate mea ad intentionem: et expositione mea qua exposui illud, et formaui instrumentum eius diuerso modo ab eo quo ostenderunt illud, et exposuerunt ipsum.	However, I have already abbreviated that from which there is little excuse due to my proximity and intention: and the explanation of it, as I explained it, and shaped its instrument in a different way than they showed it, and exposed it.
Dico ergo, quod in gibbositate quae accidit ab anteriori parte, non est ingenium, neque sanatio ex ea.	I say therefore that in the gibbosity which occurs from the anterior part, there is no remedy, nor recovery from it.
Et similiter in illa quae fit ad duo latera etiam.	And similarly in that which occurs to two sides as well.
Et non curatur ex eis, nisi illa quae accidit in dorso proprie, cum eo quod ego narro: et est, ut extendatur infirmus super faciem suam super podium aequale prope parietem: et expandatur sub eo stramentum humidum, ut non laedatur pectus eius.	And it is not cured from them, except for that which occurs properly on the back, as I narrate: and this is, that the patient lies stretched out on his face on a level platform near the wall; and a wet cloth is spread out beneath him, so that his chest is not injured.
Deinde ponatur lignum rectum fixum in fouea in terra, in extremitate podii, circiter caput eius: et lignum aliud circiter pedes eius in extremitate altera podii: et minister teneat lignum, et sit non firmatum in fouea.	Then a straight piece of wood should be placed, fixed in the corner of the floor on one side of the platform, near his head; and another piece of wood around his feet on the other side of the platform: and a servant should hold the wood and stand not firm in the corner.
Et minister alter teneat alterum.	And let the other servant hold the other one.
Deinde inuolue super caput infirmi, et sub titillicis eius ligamentum lene, firmum: et extende extremitatem ligamenti ad lignum quod est apud caput eius: et liga ipsum in eo.	Then wrap a soft, sturdy bandage around the patient's head, and extend the end of the bandage to the wood that is at his head. And tie it there.
Deinde stringe ligamentum aliud supra anchas eius, et supra genua ipsius, et apud cauillas eius.	Then bind another bandage above their shoulders, and above their knees, and around their calves.
Deinde aggrega ligamenta omnia, et liga ea in ligno altero quod est apud pedes eius.	Then gather up all the bandages and tie them to another piece of wood that is at his feet.
Deinde extendat omnis minister ad partem ligni ligamentum, et non remoueantur duo ligna ex locis suis in quibus sunt fixa: uerumtamen non sint firmata, sicut diximus.	Then let every attendant stretch out their bandage to the piece of wood and not move the two woods from their places where they are fixed: yet they should not be tightened as we said.
Et medicus ponat palmas suas super Spondilem cum fortitudine, donec redeat: aut ponat super eam tabulam.	And let the doctor place his hands on the spine with strength until he returns or places a board on it.
Deinde annectat super tabulam pedes suos, donec redeat.	Then let him attach his feet to the board until he returns.
Si autem non redit per hanc curationem, tunc accipe tabulam cuius longitudo sit circiter tria brachia.	If however he does not return through this treatment, then take a board whose length is about three arms' lengths.
Et caua in pariete de quo diximus quod est prope infirmum, locum in quem ingrediatur extremitas tabulae.	And make an opening in the wall that we mentioned, which is near the patient, to the place where the end of the board will fit.
Deinde pone medium tabulae super Spondilem.	Then place the middle of the board on the spine.
Et ponat pedes suos medicus super extremitatem alteram.	And let the doctor place his feet on the other end.
Et stringat bene, donec coartetur Spondilis, et redeat ad locum suum.	And let him tie it well until the spine is straightened and he returns to his place.
Deinde si uis, operare cum torno quod inuoluitur cum manu tua: et est, ut figas in terram apud caput infirmi in postremo podii duo ligna, quorum longitudo sit brachii unius: et apud caput eius in postremo podii duo ligna.	Then if you wish, operate with a turn that is wrapped around your hand; and it is, to fix two pieces of wood on the ground at the patient's head at the end of the bed, each being the length of one arm: and at his head in the end of the bed, two pieces of wood.
Et sit longitudo quae est inter omne lignum palmus unus: et iam factum est in omni loco foramen, in quo currit tornum: et firmetur lignum omne in terra multum, ne moueatur omnino.	And let the length that is between all the wood be one palm: and now a hole has been made in every place where the turn goes; and strengthen all the wood firmly on the ground, so that it may not move at all.
Et intromittatur lignum rotundum: et est tornum in quo reuoluitur ligamentum in duobus foraminibus duorum lignorum.	And insert a round piece of wood: and there is a turn where the bandage is wound around in two holes of two pieces of wood.
Et in extremitate eius est foramen, in quo firmatur lignum, cuius longitudo est palmus cum eo quod reuoluitur: et in duobus lignis aliis est similiter illius.	And at its end is a hole, in which the wood is fastened, whose length is a hand's breadth plus what is turned back; and similarly there are two other woods.
Deinde stringe ligamenta quae strinxisti in pectore infirmi torno quod est apud caput eius: et ligamenta quae strinxisti in cruribus eius in torno quod est apud pedes eius.	Then tie the ligaments which you have tightened in the patient's chest to the ring that is at his head; and the ligaments which you have tightened in his legs to the ring that is at his feet.
Deinde stet apud omne tornum minister, qui torqueat manum suam cum licinio, cum quo reuoluitur tornum: et medicus aequet Spondilem, secundum quod diximus.	Then stand by every turning post with the attendant who turns his hand with the lever, as the turning post is turned back; and the physician adjusts the sponge, according to what we have said.
Haec est forma torni, quae sequitur.	This is the form of the turning post that follows.
Deinde postquam redit Spondilis, et aequatur locus, tunc oportet, ut ponas emplastrum exiccatiuum cum albumine oui.	Then after the sponge returns and the place is adjusted, then it is necessary to put on an adhesive plaster with egg white.
Deinde stuppam.	Then a poultice.
Postea pone supra emplastrum astellam ex tabula, cuius latitudo sit trium digitorum, aut circiter eos.	After that, place on top of the plaster a platelet from a tablet, whose width is three fingers or about those.
Et longitudo eius quantitas quae capiat locum Gibbositatis, et super partem Spondilis sanae.	And its length should be as much as it can take up the place of the gibbosity, and above the sound part of the sponge.
Deinde ligetur cum ligamento quod diximus.	Then it is bound with the ligament that we mentioned.
Et utatur infirmus nutrimento subtili, donec sanetur.	And the patient should be nourished with subtle food until he heals.
Quod si remaneat quiddam eminentiae in loco in fine sanationis: tunc oportet, ut administrentur medicinae quae mollificant, et leniunt, cum administratione tabulae quam narrauimus tempore longo.	But if something remains of the prominence in the place at the end of the healing process: then it is necessary that medicines which soften and soothe be administered, along with the application of the platelet we described for a long time.
Et iam administratur in illo lamina plumbi.	And now it is applied with lead foil.
Et quandoque accidit eminentia in postremo Spondilium dorsi: et putatur per eam dislocatio, et est illud os quod iam eminet.	And when an elevation occurs at the last sponge of the back: and it is thought that there has been a displacement through it, and it is that bone which now protrudes.
Quare non oportet, ut praesumptio fiat ei cum hac medicina: fortasse enim accidere faciet mortem.	Therefore one should not presume to treat him with this medicine: perhaps it will cause death.
¶ De curatione Anchae dislocatae.	Of the cure of a dislocated Anca.
Caput XXXII.	Here is the translation:
Scias, quod iuncturae Anchae, et iuncturae humeri, non accidit, nisi dislocatio tantum: neque accidit eis quod accidit reliquis iuncturis ex remotione parua, et concauitate.	You shall know that the joint of Anche and the joint of the shoulder do not happen unless a dislocation occurs. Nor does it occur to them as it occurs to other joints due to a small removal and hollowing out.
Et iunctura quidem Anchae dislocatur secundum quatuor partes.	And indeed, the joint of Anche is dislocated into four parts.
Quod est, quia dislocatur ad anteriora, et ad posteriora.	Which is because it dislocates towards the front and the back.
Et plurimum quidem dislocatur ad interiora: et parum dislocatur ad anteriora, et ad posteriora.	And indeed, it dislocates mostly towards the inside: and a little towards the front and the back.
Et curatio dislocationis eius ad interiora, est: quia quando tu coniungis crus infirmi sanum cum infirmo, est longius: et est genu eius eminens plus quam sani, et non potest infirmus duplicare pedem suum apud inguen: et est locus qui sequitur inguen apostematus apostemate calido, propterea, quod caput coxae iam peruenit illic.	And the cure for this dislocation towards the inside is: because when you join the infirm leg with a healthy one, it is farther along; and his knee is more prominent than that of the healthy one, and the infirm person cannot duplicate their foot at the groin; and the location that follows is inflamed with a hot aposteme, because the head of the hip has already arrived there.
Et signum eius cui accidit dislocatio ad exteriora est, quod sunt accidentia eius contraria istis accidentibus.	And the sign of it to whom the dislocation occurs towards the outside is that the accidents that befall him are contrary to these accidents.
Et signum eius cui accidit dislocatio ad anteriora, est, quia expandit crus sanum secundum complementum: uerumtamen non duplicat ipsum absque dolore qui est in genu: et si conatur ad ambulandum, non potest super illud ad anteriora: et retinetur urina eius, et apostematur inguen eius, et apud ambulationem est calcatio eius super calcaneum.	And the sign of it to whom the dislocation occurs towards the front is that he stretches out his healthy leg according to its complement: yet he does not duplicate it without pain in the knee; and if he tries to walk, he cannot get beyond that point towards the front: and his urine will be retained, and his groin will become inflamed, and while walking there will be a pressure on his heel.
Et signum eius cui accidit dislocatio ad posteriora est, ut non expandat genu, neque possit duplicare ipsum antequam duplicet inguen: et est crus eius etiam breuius altero: et inguen est mollificatum, et est caput coxae apud locum ilii.	And the sign of it to whom the dislocation occurs towards the back is that he does not stretch out his knee, nor can he duplicate it before duplicating his groin; and his leg is also shorter on one side: and his groin is softened, and there is the head of the hip in that location.
Reductio uero huius dislocationis specierum est, ut consyderes tunc, si dislocatio est uetusta, quae iam antiquatur cum habente ipsam.	The reduction of this dislocation is such that you should consider then, if the dislocation is old, which has already become antiquated in the one having it.
Deinde si tu administres reductionem eius, et remanet secundum dispositionem suam: tunc non est in ea curatio omnino.	Then if you administer its reduction and it remains according to its own disposition: then there is no cure at all for it.
Non ergo oportet, ut praesumptio fiat ei penitus.	Therefore it is not necessary that a presumption be made for him entirely.
In illo autem cuius dislocatio est recens, et est ex una specierum quatuor dislocationis: tunc propera ad hoc, ut uoluas iuncturam, et extendas ipsam ad interiora et ad exteriora, et moueas eam dextra et sinistra: fortasse enim redit, et non indiget alia cura.	But in the one who has a recent dislocation, and it is of one of the four kinds of dislocations; then hasten to do this, so that you may manipulate the joint, and stretch it out to the inner and outer parts, and move it right and left: perhaps it will return, and it will not need further care.
Si autem non redit hoc modo, tunc oportet, ut praepares ministrum fortem, et extendat crus eius ab inferiori parte: aut cum manibus suis, aut cum ligamento, quod ligetur super crus eius supra genu: et minister alius extendat manum eius desuper, ita ut intromittat manus suas sub titillicis eius.	But if it does not return in this way, then you must prepare a strong assistant, and have him stretch his leg from the lower part: either with his own hands or with a bandage that is to be tied above his knee; and another assistant should stretch out his hand over it, so that he may insert his hands under the patient's knees.
Deinde stringat cum ligamento leni super radicem coxae, et teneat extremitatem ligamenti alterius.	Then bind him with a soft bandage above the hip joint, and hold the end of the other bandage in place.
Et sit extensio eius aut ab anteriori parte inguinis ad partem furculae, aut a posteriori ad partem dorsi.	And let his extension be either from the front part of the groin to the crural region, or from the back part to the dorsal area.
Et sit extensio eorum omnium uice una, donec eleuetur infirmus cum corpore suo a terra, et remaneat pendens.	And let their extension be all together one way, until the patient is lifted up with his own body from the ground, and remains hanging.
Et haec enim species extensionis est species communis specierum quatuor.	And this kind of extension is a common type among the four kinds.
Si ergo redit dislocatio cum eo quod diximus, est bonum: et si non, tunc necesse est omni speciei illud quod dicam de curatione propria.	If then the dislocation returns as we said, it is good; and if not, then it is necessary to follow the proper cure of which I will speak.
In reductione quidem eius propria quando dislocatio est ad interiora, oportet, ut resupinetur infirmus super latus suum sanum.	Indeed in the reduction itself, when the dislocation is to the inner parts, it is necessary that the patient be placed on his sound side.
Deinde ponat ligamentum super radicem coxae, in eo quod est inter caput coxae, et locum qui est sub inguine.	Then place a bandage over the hip joint, in that part which is between the head of the femur and the location below the groin.
Deinde extende ligamentum ad sursum a parte inguinis ad altiorem partem corporis, ad partem furculae.	Then stretch the bandage upwards from the part of the groin to the higher part of the body, to the crural region.
Deinde accipiat minister alius fortis brachia eius, et minuat locum grossum coxae infirmae, et extendat ad exteriora extensione uehementi.	Then let another strong assistant take hold of his arms and reduce the swollen area of the weak hip joint, and stretch it out to the outside with a violent extension.
Iam enim redit ad locum suum.	Now then, it returns to its place.
Et haec species est facilioris reliquis speciebus curationis, qua reducitur hoc membrum.	And this type is easier than the other types of healing, by which this member is restored.
Si autem excusatur super te, et non obedit tibi ad introitum cum hac specie curationis omnino: tunc oportet, ut ligentur duo pedes infirmi simul cum ligamento forti, leni, super duos calcaneos, et super duo genua: et sit longitudo cuiusque a compare suo quantitatis quatuor digitorum: et sit crus infirmum extensum plus altero quantitate duorum digitorum.	But if it refuses to obey you and does not submit to this type of healing at all, then you should bind the two legs of the patient together with a strong and gentle bandage, from the heels up to the knees. And let each part be stretched out one finger's breadth more than the other.
Deinde suspendatur infirmus super caput ligni, quod sit in domo: et sit longitudo eius a terra quantitas duorum brachiorum.	Then the patient should be suspended above a wooden beam that is in the house, and its length from the ground should be equal to two arm lengths.
Deinde praecipe iuueni forti, ut muniat caput coxae: et suspendatur cum infirmo inuenis alius: et impellat iuuenis alius, muniens coxam cum fortitudine, nam iunctura redit ad locum suum cum uelocitate.	Then instruct a strong youth to support the patient's hips: and another youth should be suspended with the patient; and the other youth should push gently, supporting the hip with strength, for the joint returns to its place quickly.
In reditione autem eius propria, quando est dislocatio ad exteriora, oportet, ut iaceat infirmus super podium, secundum quod narrauimus in habente gibbositatem.	But when the dislocation is to the outside, it is necessary that the patient lie on a platform, as we have described in the case of having a hump.
Et stringatur ligamentum super crus eius, infirmum proprie, et super pectus eius.	And let a bandage be wrapped around his thigh, specifically the infirm one, and also around his chest.
Deinde ponantur duo ligna, unum apud pedes eius, et alterum apud caput ipsius.	Then two wooden poles should be placed, one at his feet and another at his head.
Deinde ponatur lignum additum in medio podii, fixum bene: super quod inuoluti sint panni humidi, ut non laedat infirmum: et sit lignum inter coxas eius, ut non attrahatur ad inferiora apud extensionem.	Then a wooden pole should be placed in the middle of the platform, securely fixed; with wet cloths wrapped around it, so that it does not hurt the patient. And let this pole be between his hips, so that he is not drawn down to the lower part during the stretching.
Deinde extendat omnis minister ad partem suam, et medicus aequet reductionem manu sua.	Then all the attendants should stretch out to their side, and the doctor should equalize the reduction with his own hand.
Si ergo obedit ad reuersionem, erit bonum.	If it then submits to being put back in place, it will be good.
Et si non, pone super ipsam tabulam, et preme ipsam, sicut diximus in gibbositate, aequaliter.	And if not, place it on the table and press down on it, as we have said in the case of a hump, evenly.
Verumtamen oportet, ut iaceat infirmus super latus suum sanum.	However, it is necessary that the patient lies on his healthy side.
Et quando dislocatio est ad anteriora, tunc oportet, ut extendatur crus infirmi uelociter: et est secundum hanc eandem narrationem super podium: et ponat medicus palmam manus suae dextrae super inguen infirmum.	And when the dislocation is to the front, then it is necessary that the patient's leg be extended quickly; and according to this same account on a pedestal; and the doctor should place his right hand on the patient's thigh.
Deinde coartet ipsum cum manu altera, et cum illa coartatione pone ipsum extensum ad inferiora ad partem genu.	Then he should grasp him with one hand and with that grip place him extended to the lower parts of the knee.
Et si dislocatio est ad posteriora: tunc non oportet, ut extendatur infirmus ad inferiora, et sit eleuatus super terram: imo oportet, ut sit positus super rem duram, sicut oportet, ut fit etiam si dislocatur ancha eius ad exteriora, secundum illud quod diximus de accubitu eius super duas anchas: et est super faciem eius, et ligamenta extensa: secundum quod diximus nuper.	And if the dislocation is to the back, then it is not necessary for the patient to be extended downwards and lifted off the ground. Rather, he should be placed on a hard surface, just as is also the case if his ankle dislocates to the outside, according to what we said about his lying on two ankles: and it is above his face, and stretched ligaments: according to what we have recently said.
Et oportet, ut administretur compressio cum tabula etiam super locum ad quem egreditur iunctura, cum completur reductio secundum quod oportet.	And it is necessary that pressure be applied with a board even on the place from which the joint protrudes, when the reduction is complete according to what is proper.
Et signum reditionis eius non occultatur tibi: et est, ut extendas duo crura infirmi: et quando uides ea aequalia, et infirmus stringit crus suum, et expandit ipsum absque excusatione: tunc scias, quia iam redit membrum, secundum quod oportet: tunc coniunge duas coxas, et pone emplastrum, et stringe cum imemati, id est, rota: ita, ut non moueatur ancha ad aliquam partium: et adhaereat infirmus quieti tribus diebus, aut quatuor.	And the sign of its return is not hidden from you: and it is, when you stretch out the patient's two legs: and when you see them equal, and the patient tightens his leg and expands it without straining: then you will know that already the limb has returned as it should: then join the two hips together, and apply a poultice, and bind with a bandage, namely, a wheel: so that the ankle does not move to any part; and the patient should remain quiet for three or four days.
Deinde solue ligamentum, et emplastrum, et compara crus cum altero: tunc si uides ea aequalia in statu, tunc scias, quod dislocatio iam firmata est: absolue ergo infirmum ad ambulandum.	Then release the bandage and poultice, and compare the leg with the other one: then if you see them equal in state, then you will know that the dislocation is already set right: therefore, therefore let the patient go for walking.
Et si uides aliquid mollificationis: tunc redi, et emplastra illud, et stringe illud secundum stricturam tuam primam: et dimitte illud etiam tribus diebus.	And if you see something softened: then return and reapply the poultice, and bind it according to your first tightening; and let it also be for three days.
Deinde solue illud et fac ipsum tardare in ambulatione super utrumque aliquot diebus, donec confortetur bene.	Then loosen it and make it delay in walking on both sides for a few days until it is well comforted.
¶ De dislocationis Genu.	Of the Dislocation of the Knee.
Caput XXXIII.	Chapter 33.
Genu dislocatur secundum tres modos.	The knee is dislocated in three ways.
Dislocatur ad exteriora, ad interiora, et ad inferiora, scilicet ad posteriora.	It is dislocated to the outside, inside, and downwards, that is, to the back.
Et non dislocatur ad anteriora.	And it does not dislocate to the front.
Et signum dislocationis eius, est, ut praecipias infirmo, ut applicet crus suum ad coxam suam.	And a sign of its dislocation is that the patient cannot straighten up, but instead applies his leg to his hip.
Si autem non adhaeret cum coxa: tunc scias, quod Genu est dislocatum.	But if it does not adhere with the hip: then you will know that the knee is dislocated.
Et restauratio omnium modorum dislocationis eius est, ut facias sedere infirmum rectum, ita ut iam extendat crus suum si potest super illud, et adhaeret dorsum tuum ad faciem eius: et pone pedem eius inter pedes tuos.	And the restoration of all three ways of its dislocation is to make the patient sit up straight, so that he can extend his leg if possible over it, and lean his back against your face: and place his foot between your feet.
Deinde adhaerere fac Genu eius cum palmis tuis, et recta eas inter digitos tuos super Genu eius.	Then make him apply his knee to your palms, and straighten them up between your fingers over his knee.
Deinde applica cum palma tua duo latera Genu eius cum fortitudine.	Then apply with your palm both sides of his knee with force.
Et minister alius extendat pedem eius, donec redeat Genu ad locum suum.	And have another person stretch out his foot until the knee returns to its place.
Et signum reditionis est, ut adhaereat crus cum coxa in lenitate, non laboriose.	And a sign of its return is that the leg adheres with the hip gently, not painfully.
Deinde emplastra ipsum, et adhaerere fac crus cum coxa.	Then bind him and make his leg adhere to his hip.
Deinde liga ea simul cum uitta tribus diebus, aut quatuor.	Then bind them together with a bandage for three days or four.
Deinde solue ea.	Then loosen them.
Et non utatur infirmus ambulatione aliquot diebus, donec sanetur.	And the patient should not use his leg in walking for a few days until he is healed.
Si autem recusatur tibi reductio eius, tunc administra extensionem fortem cum ligamentis, quorum praecessit narratio in curatione anchae, donec redeat.	But if it resists your reduction, then apply a strong extension with ligaments of which the narration was previously mentioned in the cure of an ankylosed limb, until it returns.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Calcanei.	Of the Cure of Dislocation of the Heel.
Caput XXXIIII.	Chapter 34.
Calcaneus quandoque remouetur remotione parua, et quandoque dislocatur secundum complementum.	The calcaneus is sometimes removed by a small removal, and sometimes it becomes displaced according to its own nature.
Et dislocatio eius fit, aut ad interiora, aut ad exteriora.	And its displacement occurs either towards the interior or towards the exterior.
Et signum dislocationis eius est, quod uides Calcaneum inflatum, procedentem ad partem ad quam dislocatur.	And a sign of its displacement is that you see the Calcaneus inflated, proceeding to the side to which it becomes displaced.
Curatio autem remotionis eius, est facilis reditionis: et est, ut extendatur cum facilitate cum manibus, et aequetur, donec redeat.	But the cure of its removal is easy reduction: and this is, to stretch it out with facility by hand, and equalize it until it returns.
In curatione autem eius quando dislocatur secundum complementum, oportet, ut facias sedere infirmum rectum: et teneat ipsum minister fortis ualde a posteriori parte dorsi eius, in medio ipsius.	But in the cure of it when it becomes displaced according to its own nature, it is necessary that you make the patient sit straight: and have him held by a strong assistant very firmly from the back part of his shoulder, in the middle of himself.
Deinde tene tu cum manu tua dextra pedem eius a superiori parte eius, et cum manu tua sinistra ab inferiori parte pedis eius loco cauillae.	Then you should take hold with your right hand at the upper part of his foot, and with your left hand at the lower part of his foot in the location of the heel.
Deinde trahe pedem ad tecum manu tua dextra.	Then pull his foot towards yourself with your right hand.
Deinde cum sinistra duabus uicibus.	Then with your left hand, on both sides.
Deinde extende cum sinistra, et impelle pectus pedis cum dextra uersus crus absque labore.	Then stretch it out with your left hand, and push the foot of the calf with your right hand towards the knee without any effort.
Fac illud bis, sicut narrauimus.	Do that twice, as we have narrated.
Deinde impelle pectus pedis ad crus in uice tertia, et tu trahis cauillam.	Then push the foot of the calf towards the knee on the third side, and you pull the heel.
Si ergo redit in uice una, aut in duabus secundum hunc modum, et uides pedem aequatum, est bonum: et si non, tunc itera operationem super ipsum: quoniam ipse redit.	If then it returns to one side or two sides according to this method, and you see the foot equalized, it is good; and if not, then iterate the operation on it: for it will return.
Si autem prohibetur tibi reductio eius cum eo quod narrauimus: tunc fac iacere infirmum super dorsum suum super terram, et fige paxillum in terra firmatum ualde, ut cadat inter coxas eius: et tu iam inuoluisti super ipsum pannum, ut non laedat infirmum.	But if reduction is prevented from happening with him according to what we have narrated: then make the patient lie on his back on the ground, and place a small pillow firmly on the ground so that it falls between his thighs: and you should already be wrapping cloth around him, so as not to harm the patient.
Deinde accipiat minister coxam eius: postea extendat minister alter pedem, aut cum manibus suis, aut cum ligamento quod liget super collum pedis.	Then the assistant should grasp his thigh: afterwards, the assistant should stretch out the other foot with their hands or with a strap that binds around the ankle of the foot.
Deinde extendat omnis minister contra extensionem comparis sui: et paxillus sit stans inter duas coxas infirmi retinens eum, ut non attrahatur corpus eius ad inferiora apud extensionem.	Then let every assistant stretch out against the extension of his companion: and a splint shall stand between the two weak hips, holding him back so that his body is not drawn down towards the lower parts with the stretching.
Deinde aequet medicus dislocationem manibus suis, et minister alter teneat crus sanum ad inferiora.	Then let the doctor equalize the dislocation by hand, and let another assistant hold the sound leg down below.
Nam dislocatio redit cum uelocitate.	For the dislocation returns with speed.
Quando ergo redit dislocatio, et declaratur tibi sanitas reditionis eius: tunc pone emplastrum et stuppam, et stringe ipsam cum ligamentis firmiter, et liga pedem cum ligamento ad crus.	When therefore the dislocation returns and its return is declared to you as sound: then put on a poultice and a compress, and bind it firmly with bandages, and bind the foot with a bandage to the leg.
Et oportet, ut caueas uel timeas de neruis, qui sunt supra calcaneum posterius, ut non sit ligamentum super eos uehemens, et laedat eos.	And it is necessary that you beware or fear of the nerves which are above the posterior calcaneus, lest the bandage be too tight over them and hurt them.
Deinde dimitte ipsum duobus diebus, aut tribus.	Then let him go for two days, or three.
Quod si mollificatur ligamentum, stringe ipsum: deinde solue ipsum in die tertio, aut quarto: et prohibe infirmum ab ambulatione quadraginta diebus.	Which if the bandage becomes soft, bind him again; then loose him on the third or fourth day: and prohibit the patient from walking for forty days.
Si uero conatur ambulare ante illud spacium, non fit securitas quin dissoluatur super ipsum dislocatio, et corrumpatur, et non recipiat post illud curationem.	But if he tries to walk before that period, there will be no security lest the dislocation recur over him, and be corrupted, and not receive subsequent treatment.
Quod si accidat ei apostema calidum: tunc oportet, ut administres in sedatione eius illud, in quo praecessit narratio nostra in alio loco ex curatione, et embrocationem, donec remoueatur.	Which if a hot abscess occurs to him: then it is necessary that you apply to his sedation what we previously described in another place concerning treatment, and an ointment, until it is removed.
¶ De dislocatione Digitorum pedis, et cura.	Of the Dislocation of the Toes of the Foot, and the Cure.
Caput XXXV.	Chapter 35.
Oportet, ut aequetur quod dislocatur ex eis cum extensione pauca absque labore: et illud quidem non est difficile, imo est facile.	It is necessary that what is dislocated be equalized with extension a few times without effort; and indeed it is not difficult, rather easy.
Si autem dislocatio est in quibusdam nodis dorsi pedis: tunc oportet, ut faciat sedere infirmus pedem suum super locum aequalem terrae, aut super tabulam: et est stans sicut ambulans.	But if the dislocation is in certain knots of the back of the foot: then it is necessary that the patient sit with his foot on an equal spot of the ground, or on a board; and he should stand as one walking.
Deinde tu sta, et pone pedem tuum super illud quod eminet ex illis iuncturis.	Then you stand, and place your foot on what protrudes from those joints.
Deinde calca illud cum pede tuo cum uirtute, donec redeat, et uideas ipsum iam aequatum, et non appareat in loco eminentia.	Then tread on it with your foot with force until it goes back, and you will see it now level and not appearing in the elevated place.
Deinde pone sub uentre pedis eius tabulam quae capiat pedem totum, cui sint duo capita.	Then place a plate under his foot that will take up the whole foot, having two heads.
Deinde stringe ipsum strictura decenti tribus diebus.	Then bind him with a bandage suitable for three days.
Deinde solue ipsum, et fac quiescere eum ab ambulatione diebus multis, donec stringatur et securetur a reductione.	Then release him and make him rest from walking for many days, until he is bound and secured by reduction.
¶ De speciebus dislocationis cum uulnere uel fractura.	On the kinds of dislocations with injury or fracture.
Caput XXXVI.	Chapter 36.
Quando accidit aliquid ex illo, et conaris curationem eius, et ipsius restaurationem, multotiens succedit mors: et propter illud non oportet, ut praesumat super curationem eius, quod est huiusmodi, nisi qui est prudens in arte longi usus, misericors, pius, tardus, non audax, neque praesumptuosus: et ut utatur in incaeptionce medicinis quae sedant apostemata calida tantum: et dimittat infirmum diuino iudicio.	When something happens to that and you try to cure it and restore its condition, death often results: and therefore one should not presume over the curing of it, unless one is skilled in the art through long practice, compassionate, pious, slow, not bold, nor presumptuous: and use medicines that sedate apostematic sores only when hot, and let the patient be dismissed to divine judgment.
Nisi uideas, aut speras salutem a perditione cum lenitate aegritudinis, et in quo apparet quiddam spei.	Unless you see or hope for salvation from destruction with the gentleness of suffering, and in which something appears as a glimmer of hope.
Conare ergo reductionem eius statim in principio rei, antequam accidat apostema calidum.	Therefore, attempt to reduce it immediately at the beginning of the case, before a hot aposteme occurs.
Si ergo redit membrum, secundum quod uolumus, tunc administra regimen quod sedat apostema: et cura uulnus cum eo quod conuenit ei ex unguentis desiccatiuis.	So if the member returns as we wish, then administer a treatment that will calm the aposteme: and care for the wound with what is suitable to it from drying ointments.
Quod si dislocatio est cum fractura, et accidunt in osse satagiae separatae, tunc conare ablationem earum, et fac in illo quod diximus in aegritudinibus simplicibus ex eo quod praecessit in locis earum.	What if the dislocation is with a fracture, and there are separate cracks in the bone, then attempt to remove those and do in that what we said for simple afflictions from what occurred in those places.
Et caue secundum tuam uirtutem, et custodi teipsum ab introitu in uiam timoris: secundum quod praecessit praedicatio mea tibi.	And beware according to your own strength and guard yourself from entering the way of fear: according to what my preceding warning has been to you.
Nam illud est melius tibi apud Creatorem tuum, et magis permanens ad gloriam tuam, et magis saluum tuo corpori apud illos in tuo tempore.	For it is better for you with your Creator, and more lasting to your glory, and more safe for your body among them at your time.
