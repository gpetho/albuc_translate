Chapter Twenty-Five on the Reduction of the Dislocation of the Clavicle and the Tip of the Shoulder	CHAPTER TWENTY-FIVE. On the reduction of a dislocation of the clavicle and of the head of the humerus.	0.8164966
As for the clavicle, it does not dislocate from the inner side due to its connection to the chest. It may dislocate outward, and that is apparent to the senses.	The clavicle is never dislocated inwards because of its continuity with the breast-bone; but sometimes it is dislocated outwards, and then it is detected by palpation.	0.683468
Its treatment is that the patient lies on his back and extends his arms, then you press the area firmly with your palm, and it will return.	The replacement is thus: the patient is to lie on his back and stretch out both arms; then with the palm of your hand press heavily upon the place and it will go back.	0.797914
Then you put on it the bandage and the supports and tighten them.	Then apply to it the plaster and pads, and bandage it up.	0.85936326
As for its end, which is next to the shoulder and connected to it, it does not dislocate except rarely. If it ever dislocates, then it should be reduced and adjusted as we have mentioned and as is possible for you.	As to the extremity of the clavicle, which is close to the shoulder and joined to it, it is only rarely dislocated; but if ever it is dislocated you must reduce it and set it straight as we have mentioned, by any convenient means.	0.8553003
Then put on it the bandage, the supports, and the tightening, and instruct the patient to maintain rest and stillness until he recovers.	Then apply the plaster, pads, and bandages, and bid the patient keep quiet and still until it is healed.	0.8987973
With this same treatment, you reduce the end of the shoulder if it also moves from its place.	By this same treatment you may also reduce the head of the humerus when it is displaced.	0.8129877
