On the treatment of alconati.	On the treatment of hypopyon.	0.57624793
This disease called alconati is not anything but a fluid which is attached in the eye resembling descending water, but it is not that.	This disease which is called 'hypopyon' is a collection of pus in the eye which resembles cataract but is not so.	0.66792226
The way to treat it is to make the patient sit on a prepared and upright seat, then take his head in your hands on both sides and move it until you see the fluid come to the lower parts, and it dries and does not descend, and the vision is clear, and the patient sees things as before.	The method of operating in this disease is to make the patient sit upright on a chair before you. Take his head on either side with your hands and shake it about till you can see the pus come down; then it will be fixed and not move; and the light will pass and the patient will see things as he was before.	0.85899734
If it does not descend, you know it is water.	But if it does not come down, we know it is cataract.	0.68529844
If the descent is not prepared with what we have said, then make the patient sit between your hands and take a fine instrument and make a small incision on the panniculus towards the continuation of the conjunctiva with the corneal tunic in the circle (in the empty place), until the fluid is expelled.	But if the pus is not ready to be brought down by this method, then seat the patient in front of you; then take a fine scalpel and cut a little above the corneal tunic near the coronal junction of conjunctiva and cornea, till the pus comes out.	0.7005671
Then when it is expelled, you drip warm water into the eye in which you have mixed honey or water in which fenugreek and honey have been boiled.	When it comes out, instil warm water mixed with honey, or water boiled with fenugreek and honey.	0.84170455
Then treat it with other remedies until it is healed.	Then treat as usual till healed.	0.7305641
