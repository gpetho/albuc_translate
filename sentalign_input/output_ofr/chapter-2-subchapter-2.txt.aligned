When someone experiences an illness called "catarrh" in the eyes or chest, and the illness is chronic, and medical treatment is not effective, then the last resort is cauterization, along with cutting the two arteries.	When a person gets painful defluxions into the eyes or chest which become chronic, and medical treatment is ineffectual in this case, then section of these arteries will be the most efficacious treatment.	0.6321403
It is therefore necessary, when you are about to cut them, that the patient tilt their head back; afterwards rub the area with a rough cloth until the arteries appear, then have the patient constrict their neck with a cloth; then observe where the vein pulsates, and the location of each is behind the ears, and a little recessed;	When you decide on section, you should shave the patient's head with a razor; then rub the place with a rough cloth to show up the artery; then bind the patient's neck with an end of his garment; then you will observe where the artery is pulsating (the sites of both are the depressions behind the ears) for it is uncommon for them to remain hidden, except in a few persons.	0.8227521
then mark the locations with ink, then cut one and the other with a sharp scalpel in two places, so that the cut reaches the bone, and this should be across the width of the head.	Then do you mark with ink over both; then cut with a hooked scalpel, cutting down to the bone; the incision should be lateral to the head.	0.8004527
And if you wish, place the scalpel under the artery and cut it from above, cutting like two fingers across.	Or if you prefer, introduce the scalpel beneath the artery and make a thrusting cut up at it. The incision should be of about two fingers' breadth.	0.7683476
And when the vein is cut, the blood spurts upwards continuously.	When cut, the artery gives out a pulsating jet of blood spurting intermittently.	0.6522881
And if the artery cannot be felt, then you must measure the distance of three fingers, then mark with ink and cut to the bone;	If the artery is not discernible, you should measure three fingers' breadth from the ear, than mark with ink, and cut down to the bone.	0.7902167
and the necessary amount of blood to let out is six hundred (600 ml), and perhaps a little more or less, depending on what the patient can tolerate, and the fullness of the artery;	The quantity of blood that should be let is six ounces on the average, but often more blood, or less, is withdrawn; all in proportion to the strength of the patient and the fullness of the arteries as they appear to you.	0.6636021
then examine the wound: if any of the periosteum remains on the bone, cut it so that no abscesses form there, then tighten the wound and bind it, and treat it with ointment until it is healed.	Then examine the wound and if there remains on the bone any part of the membrane cut it off to avoid a haematoma. Then bind up the wound with a bandage of linen cloth and dress with ointments till healed.	0.73850155
