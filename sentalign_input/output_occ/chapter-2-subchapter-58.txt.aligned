Urine retention in the bladder is caused by an obstruction from a stone, coagulated blood, pus, or flesh, similar to what we have discussed in the methods of treatment in the division.	Retention of the urine is caused by an obstruction, from a stone or a clot of blood or pus or a fleshy tumour, or similar cause.	0.756951
And if the urine is not dissolved by what we have said and the cause is severe for the patient, then you must administer extraction with an instrument called a syringe, which has the following shape: It should be made of silver, thin, concave, like a birdâ€™s quill with a fine long ray similar to a palm and a half in length, with a thin tube at its tip.	But if these measures do not free it and the matter is very urgent with the patient, then you should attempt to bring it out with the instrument called a catheter, of which this is the figure. It is made of silver, slender and smooth and hollow like the quill of a bird's feather; as slender as a probe; about a span and a half in length; and with a tiny funnel at the end.	0.7684859
And the method for releasing urine with this is to take double bile and tie wool or cotton at its end for a good binding; insert the ends of the bile into the lower part of the syringe, and cut any excess wool with scissors, then insert it into the tube with force. Then wet the syringe with water and egg white.	This is the manner in which you draw off the urine through it: take a double thread and with a strong knot tie a little wool or cotton on the end, introduce the end of the thread into the lower end of the catheter, and trim off with scissors any superfluous wool, so that it will go into the tube and close it like a tassel. Then smear the catheter with oil or butter or egg-white.	0.81119925
Have the patient sit on a chair, and anoint his bladder and penis with moist oils, olive oil, and rose water.	Make the patient sit down; then anoint the bladder and the meatus of the penis with humid oils or with olive-oil and warm water.	0.7991522
Then insert the syringe gently until it reaches the base of the penis; fold the penis upwards towards the navel; push the syringe into it; and push it until it reaches the bladder, and the patient feels it reaching the empty area, not following this order, but in a winding path.	Then gently introduce the catheter into the urethra until it reaches the root of the urethra. Then turn the end of the penis upward toward the umbilicus; then push the catheter inwards until the curve of the catheter ends, and push the catheter in until it reaches nearly to the seat. Then turn the penis down, with the catheter in it, and push until it reaches the bladder, and the patient now feels that it has entered a hollow.	0.86878574
Then extend the bile with the wool little by little, as the urine soaks into the wool.	Then withdraw rather firmly the thread with the wool plug attached, for the urine follows the wool; then pull it right out and the urine will pour out.	0.58247256
Then extract it and make urine flow for treatment, using the syringe; continue doing this until the bladder is emptied and the patient finds relief.	Apply the catheter again and again until the bladder is emptied and the patient finds relief.	0.6750488
