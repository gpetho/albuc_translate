O, children, since I have completed this book for you, which is the final one of the science of medicine, by its completion the end is reached, and through its explanations and declarations, it seems to me that I have fulfilled that for you with this treatise, which is a section of surgical practice.
For surgical practice is so neglected in our region and time that the science of it is greatly in danger, and its knowledge is lost; and of it there remain only some small descriptions in the books of the ancients, which have been misinterpreted and led to error and uncertainty, until the understanding of it is obscured and its strength and art are weakened.
And it seems to me that I will revitalize it with the organization of this treatise in accordance with the method of explanation, clarification, and summarization; and so that it will contain the forms of cautery tools and other instruments of the craft, as well as the declaration's addition and preparation, which is necessary.
But the reason why a skilled craftsman with his own hands is not found in our time is that the art of medicine is lengthy, and its practitioner must first be exercised in the science of anatomy, which considers the body's organs, their shapes, connections, and separations;  and he must have knowledge of the bones, nerves, and ligaments, their number, and their arrangement;  and of the pulsating and still veins and the places of their origin.
And for that reason, Hippocrates says that with a name it is little, but in the work it is great, especially in the art of the hand.
But we have already stated this in the introduction to this book, for whoever is not knowledgeable in what we have said about anatomy will inevitably fall into error, leading to the deaths of people, as I have seen many such cases, for some are trained in this science but abandon it without knowledge or experience.
For I saw a foolish and unskilled physician open a scrofulous abscess on a woman's neck, and cut some of the neck's arteries so that a great deal of blood flowed until the woman died in his hands.
And I saw another physician who attempted to remove a stone from a man who was advanced in years, and the stone was large.  He went at it and pulled out the stone, taking a piece of the bladder with it, so that the man died on the third day.
And I, having already tried to extract it, saw that due to the size of the stone and the patient's condition, I knew beforehand that he would die.
And I saw another physician who received a stipend from a duke in our land for surgery, and went to a blackguard who had fractured his thigh; and this physician, through his ignorance, treated the fracture, on the wound, with bandages and splints with excessive tightness, and did not allow the wound to breathe.
And then he loosened it according to his desires, and then he bound it up, and then he left it for several days and commanded that we loosen the bandage.  And it remained like that until the thigh and foot were abscess-ridden, and it was lost.
And I was called to him, and I prepared to loosen the bandage, and calmness was achieved, and thus he was relieved of his pain.
However, corruption had already taken hold in the limb, so I could not stop it, and the corruption continued in the limb until the patient perished.
And I saw another physician who opened a cancerous abscess, and it ulcerated over several days, until its malignancy was greatly aggravated by the patient's condition.
Since cancer is typically caused by melancholic humor, it is not appropriate to treat it with an iron cautery throughout, but rather to treat the affected limb as if everything were to be removed from it.
Therefore, children, it is necessary for you that the surgical procedure be divided into two parts: one is an operation associated with health, and the other is an operation that is dangerous in most situations.
And I have already noted this throughout this book where an operation contains error and fear; therefore, it is necessary for you to avoid this and abandon it, so that mistakes don't find a way to speak and dishonor you.
Therefore, take your tools with diligence and God's protection, and your patients with skill and firmness.
And use the best path, by God's grace, seeking health and praiseworthy success, and abandon the terrible illnesses of difficult healing, and remove from your tools what makes you fear, so that your devotion and your name don't fail: for more remains for your glory, and more highly in the world and behind your holiness.
Gualia already said in some of his teachings/instructions/admonitions: Do not treat a bad illness, so that you may not be called bad doctors.
And I have divided this book according to three chapters.
Begins the division of the book, and first of the first part. The first chapter is ordered from head to foot, regarding the forms of instruments and the tools for cauteries, and of what is necessary in the operation.
The division of the second part. The second chapter, on incision and perforation, and cupping, and sores, and the extraction of arrows and similar things, all chaptered and ordered according to the forms of the instruments.
The third chapter, on restoration and dislocation, and the treatment of twisting and similar things; a chapter ordered from head to foot, and of the forms of the instruments.
It is necessary for me to state the benefits of this cautery and its harms, and in what constitution cautery is forbidden.
Therefore, I say that the discourse on the nature of the benefits of cautery and its harms is a long and verbose discourse, subtle in science, and a hidden secret; and many wise men have already spoken of it, and they have disagreed about it, but a small part of their discourses will suffice for me, lest I prolong it.
And therefore I say that cautery benefits every constitution universally, which is with or without matter, except for two constitutions, which are hot constitutions without matter.
In the hot and dry constitution with matter, there is disagreement; for some say that cautery is beneficial to it, and others say the opposite, that cautery is not suitable for an illness that is due to heat and dryness, because the nature of fire is heat and dryness, and it is inconvenient that a hot and dry illness with something that is hot and dry be cured.
And those who say the opposite claim that cautery is beneficial in all hot and dry illnesses that affect the human body, for when you compare the human body and its humours to the constitution of fire, you find the human body to be cold.
And I say, concerning this matter, that experience has revealed this to me on several occasions.
However, it is not appropriate for someone who has not already been experienced and practiced in the chapter on cautery through previous exercises, and who has not understood the diversity of human constitutions, the nature of illnesses, their causes, the symptoms, and the appropriate time for treatment, to comment on this.
But in other constitutions, there is no doubt, and especially in cold and humid illnesses, for all physicians have agreed on these, and there is no disagreement on the benefit of cautery in those.
And know, children, that the secret of healing through cautery with fire, and its efficacy, is different from cautery with burning medicines, because fire is simple, its action only reaches the part that is cauterized, and does not harm other parts joined with it except with a small amount of harm.
But the action of burning medicines reaches parts further away, and easily causes difficult-to-heal illness and severe pain in the affected part.
However, fire, due to its subtle nature and the goodness of its substance, does not do this except to a minor extent.  We are already familiar with this through experience and long study of the art, understanding the truth of causes.  Because of this, I am excused from a lengthy explanation.  And if it were not that my book already discusses in detail the secret use of fire, and its effect on the body and the expulsion of illnesses, with a philosophical and demonstrable account that would be useful to you, I would dwell on it.
And know, children, that they disagree about the time when cautery is best done, and they consider spring the best time.
And I say that cautery is appropriate at any time, because the harm from the time of the accident is outweighed by the benefit that cautery brings, especially if the cautery is needed for sudden, acute pains, which cannot tolerate delay, for fear of the harm caused by the disease outweighing the small harm caused by the time factor.
And this does not apply to your concerns, children; only the ignorant populace and foolish physicians believe that the illness cured by cautery is not always appropriate, and hold to this belief.
And the reason is not as they suppose, for cautery is merely a method of medicine that alters the complexion and dries the moisture that causes pain.
But nonetheless, cautery is superior to medicine in terms of its power, the effectiveness of its operation, and the greatness of its lord.
And it is possible that the illness may return at some time, depending on the patient's complexion, the location of the illness, the patient's constitution, and the accumulation of superfluities in the body, as well as what they have ingested in food and similar things; however, if the illness for which cautery is administered is a localized illness with only a small amount of superfluity and moisture, such as toothache and similar cases, it is likely that the pain will not return, but this will happen gradually.
And it is a common saying that cautery is the last resort in medicine, and it is a true statement, not in the way they understand it, for they believe that there is no cure that is as effective as cautery.
And the reason is the opposite; the idea that cautery is the last resort in medicine is only true when we have exhausted other methods of treatment for certain illnesses, and those methods do not work, and thus, at the end of the process, cautery is used, and proves effective. Therefore, the statement that cautery is the last resort in medicine is not true according to the understanding of the common people and many foolish physicians.
And the ancients said that cautery with gold is better than cautery with iron, and they did not say this except because of the equal and superior nature of gold.
And they said that the location of the cautery does not matter, but this is not entirely true, for I have tested this and found that it only works this way in some bodies, not in others, and cautery with gold is good and better than with iron as they said; however, when you do cautery with gold, it's not clear to you how much gold is needed, depending on the resistance of the gold, and it prepares to receive heat; and if you apply heat to it, the gold will melt into the fire, and sometimes small pieces of gold will fall into the fire, making it difficult for the craftsman to work with it.
Therefore, cautery with iron is performed more easily and more effectively for the purpose of the operation.
And I have organized this chapter on cautery according to chapters, and I have organized them from head to feet, so that the seeker may find what they want from it.
The first chapter.
This cauterization addresses the dampness and cold affecting the brain, of which there are two causes:  one is the cause of runny noses and a multitude of rheumatic fluxes, called colds, flowing from the head to the eyes and ears, and the multitude of sleepiness, toothache and sore throats; and universally of all illnesses that come from cold, such as paralysis, lethargy, and apoplexy, and similar ailments.
The method of this cauterization is this: first, command the patient to be purged with laxative medicine to cleanse the head, for three or four nights, according to the strength of the patient, their age and their usual condition.
And then command him to shave his head, and then place him on a clean bench, with your hands supporting his feet.
And then place the blade of your palm (presumably a cautery) near the base of his nose between his eyes. However, when your middle finger has reached that spot, mark the area with a probe, and then apply the olive cautery, of which this is the method:
And then place that (the cautery) upon the spot marked with the probe, in such a way that it descends, while your hand is gradually tightened, and you turn it.
And then gently lift your hand and examine the area; and if you see any amount of bone exposed, about the size of a grain of millet, then lift your hand, and if not, turn your hand with the iron, using another one of the irons, until you see the bone as I have told you.
And then take a small amount of salt and dissolve it over the area, and leave it for three days.
And then place a cloth soaked in broth over it and leave it there until the scab from the fire is destroyed. And then treat the area with four-drug ointment until it is healed.
And if the wound remains open, the better it is to bandage the arm, because it is better and more helpful.
And some of them would say that the bone should be cauterized down to the bone, and the cautery should be held until a certain part of the bone's substance has been burned.
And then that which has been burned off the bone should be scraped off, and then it should be treated.
And others would say that with the cautery one should penetrate to the back, until it presses strongly on the bone until the bone yields, and this is the way of small cauterization: And they consider that vapors from the head are escaping from that place.
And the wound should be kept open for a long time, and then treated until it is healed.
But I have not seen these two kinds of cauterization in all cases, only in some men, according to their fear; and, in my opinion, it is better to avoid it if possible, because the head is weakened by a break in its continuity just as we have testified in other limbs, and especially when the patient's head is of fragile nature.
And the first kind of cautery is safer and better, in my opinion; and with that use and method, it is healthier.
Second Chapter.
Of cauterization of the head.
When chronic and prolonged pain affects the entire head of a prolonged ill person, and treatment using leeches, cupping, head purges, plasters, poultices, herbal remedies, and similar methods has been used, but none of these things help, then consider that if the patient's head is strong by nature, and not frail, and is experiencing a very severe cold, then cauterize with a second cautery slightly beneath the first one. And then cauterize that area on the side of their head with a cautery until the abscess is broken open. Cut open the abscess and expose the bone to the extent we have described, then cauterize that area on the back of the head in the location called the *vas* (vein) — it is the area where a cupping device is placed. And be careful with your hand in this, and do not expose the bone, for the patient will experience very severe pain, different from the pain of other head cauterizations.
And I would say this cauterization is in the right place, for the cautery used on the sides and back of the head needs to be a finer instrument than the one used in the middle of the head; and this is how it should be done.
Third Chapter.
On the cauterization of non-chronic migraines.
When pain in the head is sudden or spreading to the eyes, the head should be cleansed with medicines, and the other treatment, which I have described in the sections on illnesses, should be administered. If this proves ineffective, then cauterization can be performed in two ways: either with a sharp, burning medicine, or with iron.
However, cauterization with a burning medicine is when you take a garlic clove, remove the skin, and cut off the tips of both ends. And then, you carefully cut the painful area on the temple with a sharp lancet until a small, hidden cavity is formed beneath the skin.
Then, press on it with a bandage to constrict the area, and leave it for three hours; and then remove it and discard the garlic, and leave the wound for two or three days, and then apply a piece of cloth soaked in broth until the area heals.
And then treat it with ointment until it is healed.
And if you wish, use some burning medicines, which I have written about in the second treatise on burning medicines.
But cauterization with iron, according to this method:  use fire for cauterization, and this is the method:
and it is called a "claus clavilhs," because its head is shaped like a nail, with some curvature, and in the middle of it is a small elevation.
Then place it on the painful area, and hold your hand – so that the surrounding flesh is not burned – and turn the small iron slowly but with speed.
And if the amount burned by the intensity of the cautery is as much as half of it, lift your hand so that the artery below is not burned, lest there be a flow of blood.
Then soak cotton in salt water and place it on the area, and leave it for three days; then apply cotton moistened with butter, and then treat with ointment until healed.
And if you wish, cauterize with the blade of the scalpel, according to the cautery method, and be careful not to cut an artery in this specific, not very ancient, procedure.
Fourth Chapter.
On the cauterization of ancient migraines.
When you treat a migraine with the methods described in the previous treatment and what we've discussed in the divisions of illnesses, and the treatment does not work, and sometimes the illness does not respond to what we've said about the first cauterization with medicine or cauterization with fire, then you must heat the scalpel cautery until it is white-hot, then apply it to the painful area in a long line, half the length of your finger, or so; and press your hand down once, and press firmly until you cut through the artery and reach the bone.
However, it is necessary for you to be mindful of the continuity of the jawbone, which is stressed by chewing, and that the muscle is not strained, and the nerves which control it are not affected, and that no spasm develops.
And if it concerns the care and caution of the flow of blood from the severed artery, for in its severing there is a fear, and especially for the one who does not understand what they are doing and is not knowledgeable or experienced, and leaves the operation unfinished at the beginning.
And I will bring a reminder of the treatment for accidental blood flow from the artery according to its method, in its proper place in this book.
And if you see that this illness does not respond to this cauterization and you find the patient's condition tolerable, cauterize the area in the middle of the head as we have described, and treat the wound until it is healed.
And if you wish, administer the cautery we described in the chapter on artery constriction with a two-bladed cautery; this is a better and more effective cauterization.
Chapter 5.
Of the cauterization of ear aches.
When pain in the ear comes from cold and is treated with laxatives and the other treatment I have described in the division, and the pain does not subside, then cauterize the ear with a cautery, and this is the one called *puncta*, whose shape is:
And then, cauterize around the ignition, and move it around the entire ear in a circular motion, or in segments around each affected area if the pain is localised. Move the cautery from the base of the ear slowly, after you have marked the location with a probe.
And if the cautery has ten points on the entire ear, and cauterize those, and then treat the areas until they are healed.
Chapter 6.
Of cauterization for tumors.
Tumors that are cured by cauterization are only of the types that arise from phlegm, as we have said in the divisions of diseases.
Avoid cauterization of the type that arises from dryness or nerve spasm.
When you treat that type of tumor with poultices, purging, and other remedies, and your treatment does not prove effective, then you should cauterize the patient with three cauteries: one at the base of the ear, a second a little below the temple, and a third at the junction of the two lips.
And place your cautery on the opposite side of the diseased area, for softening only occurs in the area that appears healthy.
And the method of cauterization is to cauterize with the cautery at the right side of the ear's extremity, a little above the temple of the head, and another in the temple, the length of which should be according to the length of the index finger.  Hold your cautery there until the amount of the tumor's size is half consumed/burned.
And this is the method of cauterization, a type of surgical procedure, the method of which is shown below. However, it is even more subtle than what you see here; and it is necessary to cut away any excess fat/bulk.
And then treat the area with what has been previously described until it is healed.
Chapter 7.
Of cauterization for old apoplexy.
When apoplexy is long-standing, and you have treated it with what we have said, and your treatment is not working and the patient has no fever, then cauterize the following areas with four cauteries: on all the corners of their head; and with a cautery on the middle area of the head, as we have said; and with a cautery on the neck. And the method of cauterization is done according to what has been previously stated.
And it has already been cauterized above the mouth of the stomach; and it is further back; and then it should be treated with the procedure that follows.
Chapter 8.
Concerning cauterization for forgetfulness, caused by flame.
Large jars and pills should be given to the patient at the beginning, to cleanse the brain.
And then shave the patient's entire head and place a plaster of cerate, described in the treatise on plasters, on the patient's scalp.
And apply that several times, for that is a method of cauterization. And do this according to the same order which I have already mentioned.
And if this cures him well, then do so; but if not, then make three cauteries on the back part of his head, which should descend from the highest part of the head down to the lowest part of the neck. And place the thickness of a finger between each cautery, and then treat the cautery with what has been prescribed.
But if the application is small and the patient tolerates it, then make a cautery in the middle; and if the application is greater, then cauterize the spot above the two horns.
Then treat it until it is healed; and let the cautery be olive-shaped, according to the form previously given.
Chapter 9.
Of the cauterization of paralysis and the softening of the whole body.
You must proceed with cleansing the head with herbs and as we have said; then shave the patient's head, and then cauterize it with cautery in the middle of the head, and with cautery above all the horns of the head, and with cautery on the back part of it, and with three cauteries on the vertebrae of the neck.
And if in the illness of softening of the body, the affected person and the illness are severe, then cauterize with four cauteries on the vertebrae of the back, and continuously with cautery until the pain is relieved from the back significantly, and lift your hand. And then treat it until it is healed, and this should be olive oil cautery.
Chapter 10.
Of cauterization for epilepsy.
The epileptic is not cauterized unless the epilepsy is due to phlegm.
And therefore it is necessary to treat the brain of the patient at the beginning with herbs and with the other treatment we have described in the division when the illness is severe and is tolerating the reception of medicines.
And if it is a child who does not tolerate the medicines, then administer remedies and masticators that treat the brain, beforehand for many days, with the improvement of the diet.
And then shave the patient's head, and then cauterize it with a cautery in the middle of the head according to the previous method, and with another cautery at the back of the head, and cauterize on each side of the patient's head. And if the illness is severe and is tolerant, then cauterize it with the cauteries I have mentioned, having paralysis and softening of the body on the vertebrae of the neck and the vertebrae of the back.
Let the cautery be olive-shaped, as it is described previously.
But if the patient is a child, then use a subtle cautery according to this method.
Chapter 11.
On the cauterization of melancholia.
When the causes of melancholia are corrupted moisture and thick phlegm, then cauterize it with the cauteries which we have described in the previous section on paralysis.
And if the cause of melancholia is an excess leaning towards melancholia, and the patient's body is humid, then give them to drink what purifies the brain, according to what has been described previously in the division.
Then shave the patient's head, and then carefully apply a properly made cautery to the scalp, and place it in the middle of the head.
And the patient should be seated upright, and supported on all sides.
Then apply a liniment; and an old sheep's fleece is more suitable. And heat that over a fire, with a moderate and measured heat, which the said patient will tolerate when placed on them. And then place that in the middle of their head, on the scalp, and leave it until it has cooled.
And do this with the patient once a week, along with the other treatments for them until they are healed; or, if you wish, cauterize that area making small punctures according to their tolerance, but keeping your hand with a cautery appropriately positioned: this is a type of cautery which moistens the brain evenly.
And then place that cloth soaked in wool or hen's droppings.
Chapter 12.
Concerning the cauterization of descending water in the eye.
When you have observed the beginning of water in the eye, according to the signs I described in the previous section, then start giving the patient drinks that will clear their head and protect it from all moisture.
And have them sweat in a bath for several days.
Then command them to shave their head, and cauterize it with a cautery in the middle of the head; and afterwards cauterize with two cauteries on both temples if the beginning of the water in the eyes is in both, or on one temple if the water is in one eye.
Cut with the cautery all the veins and arteries that are beneath the eyebrow; and let the cauteries be of that length, the width of the temples.
And watch for blood flow when cauterizing; and if you see blood flowing from the patient, stop it with whatever medicine you can find.
And I will come with the knowledge which is in the extraction of arteries and with the excision of those and the precaution of blood flow.
And sometimes it is cauterized on the neck below the two bones with two cauteries specifically applied there.
Chapter 13.
Concerning the cauterization of old sores.
When sores on the eyes are old and persistent, and through the veins and arteries in the visible area of the head's exterior, and it is confirmed that this is due to cold, phlegmatic superfluities, then cauterize it with the cautery we described in the chapter about applying hot water to the eyes, and with a cautery in the middle of the head and with two cauteries on the neck below the two temples, and with two cauteries on the neck below the two bones. And if you need additional treatment, then cauterize that area along the entire eyelid margin, over the eyebrow's edge, with a small cautery.
Chapter 14.
Concerning the cauterization of nasal foul odors.
If your treatment, as described in the previous section, is ineffective, then prepare and give the patient poppy seeds to drink for three nights; then shave the patient's head and cauterize it with a middling-sized cautery and an olive-oil cautery. Then cauterize the area with a clove-shaped cautery, using two cauteries, one small one above each eyebrow, under the hair.
And be careful to avoid burning the area.
And this is the shape of the clove-shaped cautery.
Chapter 15.
Of cauterization for softening the eyelids of the eyes.
When the eyelid of the eye is softened by illness or moisture, then cauterize that eyelid with a cautery using this lunar cautery; and this is its shape:
And if you, cauterize that area above the two eyebrows a little with two cauteries on every part, and let them extend from the temples. And let the length of each cautery be according to the amount of eyebrow.
And do not press your hand with the cautery too hard, but according to the amount that the third part of the eyelid is adhered.
Chapter 16.
Of cautery of the eyelid of the eye when the hairs are turned inward and the eye is inflamed.
When the hairs of the eye are turned inward so that the eye is inflamed, cautery in those cases is in two ways, for cautery is either with burning or with a burning medicine.
If with a burning cautery, command the patient beforehand to cut their hairs as those who groom them, until they are extended and aligned.  And if you burn it near its origin, then you should tightly bind the eyes with a bandage to prevent harm until the hair grows back.
Then, when they have grown back and aligned, place the patient's head on your lap, and gently apply a cautery to the eyelid of their eyes using a probe.  The shape of the cautery should be similar to a leaf of mint, and the beginning of the mark should be close to the hairs.
And then place cotton soaked in albumen of egg or in ptisane poultice on the eye.
And then apply the cautery, which has this shape.
And then cauterize over the shape you have marked, little by little, many times, until the surface of the skin, which is shaped like a myrtle leaf, is completely burned.
The sign of successful treatment is that you see the eyelid of the eye already contracted, and the hairs raised towards the puncture in the eye.
And then lift your hand and leave it for three days, and then place cotton with a border over it until the scab is removed. And then treat it with ointment until it is healed.
But if, due to any cause, the hair regrows around it, and the eyelid becomes softened, then apply the cautery again in exactly the same way as you did at first.
But if the hair is under the eyelid, then cauterize it until it is raised to its natural position, smoothed, and the hair is no longer irritating the eye.
But the cautery with a burning medicine, which you prescribe to the patient, is to allow the hair to grow out and smooth, and then a sheet of cloth in the shape of a myrtle leaf is to be placed over it.
And then take a known herb and a live coal, or similar, and mix these well, doing this quickly so it doesn't cool down; and then spread this mixture onto the cloth shaped like a myrtle leaf, and place it over the one or both eyes; and place under the eye a cloth soaked in egg white, and the patient's head should be resting on your lap.
And place your finger on the medicine and press it gently, and do not remove it until the patient feels the medicine's burning sensation, for the burning sensation is like a fire.
And therefore, when he perceives the burning sensation, then remove the medicine and take it away with your finger; then when the burning ceases, remove the medicine and wash the eye with water; then consider if the eyelid has been lifted as if it were released from the constriction with fire or incision, for then it is good; and if not, return to applying the medicine to the area where the medicine wasn't applied and do not let it be black until your treatment is complete and the eye is healed.
And then apply a cloth over it until the burning sensation is gone, and then treat it with a specific ointment or another remedy until it is healed.
And it is necessary for you, in the course of your treatment, to guard with vigilant care that nothing of the medicine falls into the eye, and if the eyelid after a few days becomes softened, and some cause of the hairs are in the eye, then repeat your medicine on that part of the eyelid that is softened, and precisely as you did at the beginning, and then continue until it is healed.
And this is the method/procedure for treating an eye injury/problem.
And know that the eyes of men are diverse in size and smallness, and therefore, your treatment is done accordingly.
And the path to recovery will not be hidden from the one who studies this art.
Chapter 17.
Of cauterization of a fistula in the tear duct of the eye.
When you treat a fistula with what we have said in the divisions of diseases, and your treatment is not effective, then you must cauterize it in this manner: tell the patient to rest their head on your lap, and have another attendant hold the patient's head between your hands in such a way that it is not moved or agitated by their head.
And then place a cotton pad soaked in albumen (egg white) or in a mucilage (of plant gum) on their eye.
And then heat the cautery, of which this is the shape:
which should be concave, like the shape of a reed or a vulture's wing, at the end used for cauterization.
And if you wish, it should be pointed towards the other end. And if you want, it should be shaped like a probe.
However, the one that is concave is better for your work.
And then press the fistula if it is open, and drain and dry it. And if it is not open, then open it and extract the pus from it.
Then place the heated cautery on it, and hold your hand a little away from the cautery near the nostril, so that your hand or the patient is not disturbed.  Then place the cautery on the bottom of the sore and cauterize it.
And so if at the beginning your cautery penetrates to the bone, good.  If not, then repeat the cautery once or twice, if necessary; and leave it like that for three days, then apply a poultice with a bandage and surround it with a drying ointment until it is healed.
But if more than ten days have passed and it is not healed, then apply an aggressive, corrosive medicine until the bone is exposed and is scraped as appropriate in its chapter.
And there is another way of cauterizing a fistula, which some earlier doctors said:  apply to the site of the fistula and make a cut there, and then put into that fissure a small amount of melted lead, of the shape it is described: and place it in there, the amount of 1 ounce of melted lead.  And hold it in place with your hand firmly, and so the patient is not moved by the melted lead not reaching the sore;  and it is necessary to put on the wound of the patient a poultice dipped in egg white or in water, for the lead will adhere to the site of the fistula and will heal it with a marvelous cure.
And if the fistula is healed with what we have said about the cautery and the cure, good.  But if not, then it is necessary to administer a procedure through the nose, and to push the fistula back into the nasal passages, to its proper place.
Chapter 18.
Of cauterization of a fissure of the pot (or:  a fissure in the [body part] that holds the pot).
Often fissures occur in the lips, and more often in the lips of children.
Therefore, if you treat those fissures with what we have discussed in the divisions, and your treatment is not effective, then heat the small, knife-like cautery according to this method which is described as follows:
And let its cavity be according to the sharpness of the knife.
Then carefully apply this heated cautery to those fissures until the cautery reaches the base of the fissures.
And then treat it with a plaster until it is healed.
Chapter 19.
On the cauterization of fistulas in the mouth.
When an abscess develops at the base of the uvula, or on the palate, or at the roots of the teeth, and it bursts, and then heals over, but a fistula forms, and you attempt to treat it but the treatment fails, then you must cauterize it with fire according to the size of the fistula. Then place that heated cautery in the opening of the fistula, and hold your hand until the heated iron reaches the bottom, repeating this once or twice. Then treat it with whatever healing method we have described until it is healed.
And therefore, if the pus has been drained and healed, it is good; but if not, then it is necessary to expose the area and remove the corrupted bone, as will be described in its own chapter.
Chapter 20.
Of the cauterization of teeth and the softening of the gums.
When the gums are softened by moisture and the teeth are loose, and treatment with medicines does not help, then place the patient's head on your lap.  Then heat the cautery, the shape of which will be shown in this context (or that appears in this context).  Hold the cannula over the tooth, and quickly insert the heated cautery into it. Hold your hand there a short time until the patient feels the heat from the fire reach the root of the tooth.
Then remove your hand, and repeat the cauterization several times as you wish.
Then have the patient fill their mouth with salt water and hold it for an hour, and then spit it out, for the loose tooth will be fixed, the softened gum strengthened, and the corrupt moisture dried.
Chapter 21.
Concerning the cauterization of tooth pain.
When tooth pain is caused by coldness, or there is a cold or worm in it, and medicine does not provide a cure, then cauterization in that case is done in two ways: either cauterization with cow dung, or cauterization with fire.
Cauterization with dung is done by taking cow dung, boiling it in an iron pot, then taking a cloth and wrapping it around the end of a stick, dipping it in the boiled dung and quickly placing it on the painful tooth until it cools.
And then repeat this several times until the heat reaches the root of the tooth.
And if you wish, soak wool or cloth in the aforementioned dung, and place it over the aching tooth, and then place the heated iron on top of that, until the iron reaches the interior of the tooth cavity.
However, cauterization with fire is done by using a heated iron or bronze cannula, ensuring it's thick enough so the heat doesn't reach the patient's mouth.
Then heat the cautery, shape it as needed, and place it on the tooth, holding it until it cools; repeat this several times, as the pain may disappear either on that day or the following day.
And it is necessary that, during the cauterization, the patient fill his/her mouth with good dung and keep it in place for an hour, then spit it out; and this is the manner of cauterization.
And cauterize any extremity you can, as possible.
And this is the form of the cannula:
Chapter 22.
Of cauterization of extrophulos.
When extrophulos are of phlegm and cold humors, and are not amenable to digestion by medicines, and you desire their digestion easily, then ignite the cautery according to the following shape, having two open ends so that the smoke escapes from the cautery through the other end, and place that ignited cautery on that abscess once, and another if needed, until you reach the base of the abscess.
And if the abscess is small, then place the cautery according to the size of the abscess, and then leave it for three days and put a cloth soaked in wine upon it until that which the fire has burned is healed.
And then treat it with ointments, bandages, and dressings until it is healed.
Chapter 23.
Of cauterization of sore throats and constrictions of the windpipe.
When moisture gathers in the airway, especially if it's associated with a cold temperament, the patient should initially be relieved of excess fluids with laxative medicines, and then cauterize the area near the base of the throat where the discomfort is located.
And be careful not to reach the throat with the cautery, or burn the skin too much, but just a little.
And cauterize that area with another cautery near the collarbone, at the back of their spine. And the cautery should be a pointed, sharp instrument, as described before.
And then treat it with what was previously described until it is healed.
Chapter 24.
Concerning the cauterization of lung ailments and coughs.
When coughs and lung ailments are caused by cold, damp humours, and the patient has neither a fever nor consumption, and the ailment is chronic, then cauterize the area with two cauteries on the breastbone in the hollow, distant, and depressed locations; and with another cautery in the middle of the chest between the two nipples; and let the cautery be pointed, according to the previous form.
And if you wish, your cauterization can be done puncturing with the cautery called *puncta*, the form of which was previously described in the puncturing of earaches.
And let there be punctures in those areas; and then treat it with the same remedies as before until it is healed.
And let the cautery have three prongs, for cauterization is done with that: with one application you can make three cauteries according to this form:
Chapter 25.
Of cauterization of the ticklishness, which is the head of the assistance.
When the head of the assistance [presumably a part of the body] is dislocated due to lubricating humidity and is not held in place during its return to its original position until it is in place, and then through a small movement it is dislocated again as it should be, as we have testified, then it is necessary to first reduce the dislocation, and then turn the patient on their back or side; and then elevate the part that is inside the ticklish part [or area] upwards with the fingers of your left hand, if the joint is dislocated inwards.
And then heat the cautery, having two heads; and this is the form of it:
And then cauterize the part until it penetrates to the other side; and the form of cauterization will then be of four cauterized heads.
And sometimes it is adjusted according to this count, and therefore the cauteries are eight.
And then place salt-filled porous cloths over the cauteries, and then put the patient at rest, and the limb should not be moved for some time until it is healed.
And if the dislocation is in the upper parts and this is done late, then cauterize the muscle with a pointed cautery or with many pointed cauteries, for the joint is strengthened and the moisture is removed, and the patient is healed.
Chapter 26.
Of cauterization of the stomach.
When cold and excessive moisture enter the stomach, disrupting its constitution and multiplying within it, and if you continue the treatment and do not improve the situation, then the patient must be placed on their back, extending their arms and legs, and then cauterize the area with three cauteries: one under the foot for the length of a finger with a pointed cautery, and two cauteries under the two sides of the stomach, creating a triangular cautery shape; and extend those that are not adjacent so that they will be durable.
And if the depth of the cautery is the amount of two-thirds of the thickness of the fingernail.
And let the shape of the cautery be according to this form without addition.  And if you wish, cauterize with a large cautery in the middle area of the stomach according to this form; and this cautery should be in the form of a circle according to this form:
And let the stomach be cauterized by puncturing the area that is affected by this cautery.  That is, mark the stomach with points according to the amount you want with a probe, and then cauterize those points with a cautery; and then treat it with the previous treatment until it is healed.
Chapter 27.
Of cauterization of the cold liver.
When pain in the liver arises from cold, moisture, or large windiness, until its normal constitution is expelled through superfluous discharge, and the patient is treated with what we have stated and not otherwise, then it is necessary that the patient be lying on their back, and mark three cauteries in this shape and this same quantity on the liver under the ribs, where the recumbent position of a person is found.
And let the space between each cautery be the width of a finger, and let the cauteries be the length of a straightened finger.
And do not press with the cautery too hard.
And if the amount cauterized is half the thickness of a fingernail, and no more should be applied; and if the patient is standing on their feet; and if not standing, then lying down, with their legs already stretched out, and their arms raised.
And it is possible for you to cauterize these cauteries with a knife cautery, when you have subtlety and prudence in the art.
And be careful not to proceed too much with the cauterization, and that only the tip of the fingernail is cauterized, so that the whole body and the intestines are not affected, for the fingernail is delicate here; and know this.
Chapter 28.
Of the puncture of a liver abscess with a cautery.
When there is a swelling or abscess in the liver, and you want to know if that abscess is in the liver tissue or in its covering, then if it is in the liver tissue, the patient will experience heavy, sharp pain.
And if it is in the liver's covering, the pain is sharp and often, even experienced doctors find its treatment difficult.
Therefore, the patient should be turned onto their side; then mark the location of the abscess with a probe; and then apply the cautery, which is shaped like a rag, the form of which has been shown on the previous page. And cauterize with that cautery until all the pus is consumed, until it reaches the core, until it spurts out healthy fluid.
And then treat it as part of the treatment for other abscesses until it is healed.
And only use this type of cautery if the knowledge in the art of medicine about it is extensive, and many diseases have been treated with it; but sometimes, someone with little experience might be rash in this operation, however, leave that aside, and it is better.
Chapter 29.
Of cauterization for pleurisy.
The ancients said that cauterization of the roots of herbs for pleurisy, done in this manner, is effective.  And this is how you do it: take a long, dry root from the roots of herbs, one that is found to be long and pointed, and is the thickness of a finger.
And then, immerse it in oil and heat it in the fire.  Then, cauterize the area between the continuation of the collarbone and the neck with one cautery.  Use two small cauteries below that, angled slightly towards the area under the chin;  use two other cauteries on the angled area between the fifth rib and the sixth rib, inclining them slightly toward the back.  Apply another cautery to the middle of the chest; and another to the stomach.  Use three cauteries on the back; use one cautery on the area between the two shoulders, and two more cauteries on the two sides of the chest, below the cautery on the area between the shoulders.
And you should not hold your hand with the cautery, instead, let it be visible in the act of applying it.
And some ancient ones said that some people use a cautery made of iron, shaped like a ray, and heat it up. They place this on the area between the ribs, until it reaches the abscess, and the pus is drained, just as we've described in the case of a liver abscess.
But this cauterization technique is not without risk, for one might accidentally create a fistula in the area, and there will be no cure.
Chapter 30.
On the cauterization of the spleen.
When you treat spleen ailments with the methods we've discussed in the section on treatment, and you're not achieving the desired results, then cauterization of the area can be done in three ways, all of which are effective. One method involves making three or four lines of cauterization along the length of the spleen, similar in shape to the cauteries of the liver, as previously described.
And the distance between each cautery mark should be the width of a finger, or slightly more.  The technique for the cauterization should be the same as that for the liver, as previously described.
And do not hold your hand with the cautery instrument; and the patient should be lying on their side.
Another method of cauterization is to apply the cautery using two incisions, as described in the chapter on muscle dislocations.  Lift the ribs that lie over the spleen, so you can reach the side of the sick person.
And your lifting should be done along the length of the body, so that the cauteries are made along the width of the body.
Then, quickly insert the two incisions into the space where they penetrate the ribs on the other side.
Then remove the cautery; and thus four cauteries have been made.
And if you wish, cauterize with a cautery using three incisions.
And then you treat the cautery, since it has stopped emitting pus after several days, for this is more important than the other preceding steps in the treatment.
Chapter 31.
Of the cauterization of hydrops (dropsy).
Cautery is not used on dropsy but on [a condition] called alcinte³ properly.
When you treat dropsy using the methods of treatment we have described in the division and your treatment does not work, then it is necessary that he be cauterized with four cauteries in the circuit of the navel, and with one cautery on the stomach, and with another cautery on the liver, and with another cautery on the spleen, and with two cauteries between the vertebrae of the back, and one cautery on the right foot, and with another cautery on the stomach. And the depth of the cautery should be proportional to the sharpness of the cautery.
And then leave the cautery open so that it exudes pus for a long time.
And do not evacuate the patient's illness near the cautery with what is necessary, because this will add two intentions to the patient, and will hasten their recovery with aid of healing.
The shape of the cautery used to cauterize the belly should be nail-shaped, similar to the previously described shape, and the cautery used to cauterize the back should be olive-shaped, similar to the previous shape.
Chapter 32.
Of the cauterization of the feet and thighs.
When the feet are affected by dropsy and filled with yellow water, it is necessary to cauterize the feet on the back of the foot, in the area between the auricular and annular [veins/bones/tendons?], and raise your hand with the cautery without twisting it.  Then lift your hand, and do not completely return it, because the yellow water will recede.
The cautery should be in this shape: Then make two cauteries on both thighs, and on each thigh, use the knife-like end of the cautery. And let the cauterization be along the length of the thigh: one below the knee and the other below the middle of the thigh; and on each thigh, two cauteries.
And leave the wound open without treatment for a long time so that any remaining water drains from it.
Then treat it with the things we have mentioned.
Chapter 33.
Concerning cauterization of the belly/abdomen.
When the abdomen is afflicted by cold and moisture, to the point of weakening the powers, namely the digestive and retentive powers, which are located in the stomach and intestines, this is treated with the methods of treatment and no other, and sometimes the patient endures cauterization to reveal the extent of the ailment.  In that case, cauterize that with a large cautery on their stomach, as was previously described in cauterizing the stomach, using a circular cautery and four small cauteries around the navel, a small pointed cautery, and/or cauteries on the flank (or hypochondrium), on the groin or upper thigh (or in a large area), or with two cauteries.
And if the excess moisture is prominent and the patient tolerates it, then cauterize the area over the groin and over the intestines, and place two cauteries forcefully near the stomach and close to the groin area, for this is a complete curative treatment which will help and you will not be mistaken in doing so.
Chapter 34.
Concerning cauterization of old hemorrhoids.
When old hemorrhoids are caused by thick, cold humors or corrupt moisture, and they haven't been cured by what we have discussed in the previous sections (and you should not rely on other treatments), then cauterize with three cauteries on the mound (or swelling) below the coccyx (small bone at the end of the spine), one small and one triangular, and a cautery just above the navel placed by two fingers (width).
And if you fear that their stomach is chilled and their food is not being digested, and their face is often inflamed, then cauterize the area over their stomach with a large cautery, as previously described; and with one cautery on the liver and another on their spleen, using a nail-like cautery. Leave the cautery open for a period, and then treat it until it is healed.
Chapter 35.
Concerning the cauterization of a boil close to the site of a surgical incision.
When you cut out a boil, then you heat the cautery, which is shaped like a ray. Then, insert that heated instrument into the cut boil, and hold your hand over it until the cautery reaches the opening of the vein from which blood is flowing.
And do this once or twice. For if there are many boils, then cauterize each of them as described, and then treat them with the ointments you give them until they are healed.
And if you cauterize with a large cautery over a large area, it is more harmful than helpful.
Chapter 36.
Concerning the cauterization of fistulas that are formed naturally in various parts of the body.
When nature does not respond to the treatment described in its place, and the patient is terrified by this, it can be treated with cautery.
Therefore, when someone has a naturally occurring fistula, and it is old, with festering pus and corrupted moisture, then it is more appropriate to probe it with a fine probe, and then determine the depth of the fistula with the aforementioned probe.
Then heat the cautery, which resembles a ray. And then place that heated cautery into this fistula, according to the depth to which you inserted the probe.
And repeat the application of the cautery until those corrupted parts are burned, once, twice, or three times, according to your need.
And be careful not to burn the nerves or veins; or if the fistula goes towards the bladder or towards the intestine, then be careful about those places; and do not do this unless the fistula is in a fleshy area and you believe it is not penetrating.
And then treat the area until it is healed.
And if the area is sealed, and the materials have been removed from it, and it remains like that for a long time, then know that it is completely cured.
And if the materials are not removed from it, then know that it is penetrating, or in the proximity of a corrupt part, or that this comes from one of those causes from which the ailment will return to its place.
Chapter 37.
On the cauterization of the kidneys.
When pain in the kidneys arises from cold or excessive wind, and this causes the patient's body to be weakened, then it is necessary to cauterize the area over each kidney with a pointed cautery, the application of which will help the ailment to return.
And a little lower with the second, so that there will be three arranged cauteries, and thus they will be more beneficial in the future.
Chapter 38.
On the cauterization of the bladder.
When weakness and softening of the bladder occur due to cold and dampness, so that the patient cannot retain urine, then cauterize the area just below the bladder, where the hairs of the pubic region begin, and cauterize with one cautery on the right side and another on the left.
And the length of each cautery should be according to the quantity of the pain; and cauterize the lowest part of the area with one cautery, or with two if necessary.
And let the cautery be a pointed one, according to the procedure.
Chapter 39.
Of cauterization of the mother.
When cold and dampness affect the mother, and therefore pregnancy is forbidden, and her menstrual flow is corrupted, and its expulsion is delayed, and pain occurs before their arrival, then the area should be cauterized with three cauteries around the navel, as we have described in cauterization of the bladder; and with a cautery on the lower part of the area, or with two cauteries, and the cautery should be pointed.
Chapter 40.
Of cauterization of the dislocation of the arm.
When mucous dampness has infiltrated the arm's area, and has caused it to leave its proper place, and a sign of this is that the joint extends over the other when they are compared. And the location of the dislocation is found where it protrudes.
Then it is necessary to cauterize the patient on the arm's area with a circular cautery, after you have marked the area with a probe in a circle the way it is twisted, and so that the area returns to the middle of the circle.
And let the cautery be of the form that preceded in the cauterization of the stomach.
And if this cautery is not present for you, then cauterize it with three cauteries, using a large olive cautery.
And let the cauterization be done according to the amount of inflammation of the entire area; and then treat it until it is healed.
Chapter 41.
Of cauterization of the sciatic vein.
When pain comes to the area of the hip, and it is caused by cold and humidity, the patient is cured by what we have said and not otherwise, and this is old-fashioned, then it is necessary that you cleanse the patient of heavy humors with fetid pills or with artificial pills or similar; and then cauterize that area.
And the method of cauterization in that case is in two ways: either cauterization with burning medicines, or cauterization with fire.
There are two known methods, one of which is to cauterize that area on the patient's hip with three triangular cauteries, following this form; and make them of good depth. And let the spaces between each cautery be the width of a finger, if the cautery is small or large.
But sometimes the cautery is placed in the middle, over the hip joint, so there are four cauteries.
And if you wish, cauterize with the circle, whose form precedes in the cauterization of the hip dislocation, so that there is a continuous circle that burns the affected area of the entire joint.
And this is the method of cauterization for sciatica when the pain is localized to the hip and does not extend down into the thigh.
However, if the pain extends into the thigh, then cauterize that with two cauteries on the thigh, over the area where the patient feels the pain; and with one cautery on the shin, approximately four finger-widths away from the outer side.
And if the cautery is a knife, the depth of the cauterization should be in proportion to the extent of the joint injury.
And if the patient feels the pain extending to the area near the toes, then cauterize the affected area there with three or four points, or more, as required.
And if the patient feels pain below the knee towards the thigh, then cauterize that area with a knife-cautery.
And be careful in all cauterizations that you do not burn any nerves or major arteries, lest you cause further harm or contraction to the patient.
And I have seen others who cauterized near the ankle and overdid the cauterization, and the leg became so swollen that the swelling reached the foot, and the foot became perforated and corrupted. And soon after, severe abdominal issues occurred, and because of that, death.
And if the pain is in two parts at once, cauterize each part according to this method.
And some wise men say in the cauterization of an ulcer, that this is the method: make a cautery shaped like an iron ring, whose circumference is half a palm; and let its opening be the size of a date stone, or slightly less.
And within that ring, there is another third ring; and the space between them should be the size of a hazelnut; and those rings should be open in two parts; and the length of those cauteries should be one or two hazelnuts; and make those iron marks properly fitted into the rings; and this is the form of them:
Then heat it in the fire until it glows red and throws sparks, and then place it on the affected area of the ulcer, the patient lying on their side. And therefore cauterize that with three round cauteries at once.
And then leave it for three days; then plaster it with a bandage and leave the wound open for several days; and then treat it with ointments until it is healed.
Albucasis says:  "O, children, we have used this type of cautery little, because of the fear of the burn's appearance and because we have found few that heal with it.
But of the good cauteries, to those who suffer them, and discover the spot with it.
But a cautery with adhering medicines is what you should do, creating two circles with a perforated implement through which the iron door latch is inserted;  the length of the implement should be the height of two nuts or similar items.
And if the spaces between each are the thickness of a finger; and are open below and above, and should contain themselves between them in this shape:
And then place the patient, lying on their right side, over the area of the hip, and press your hand over the hip area; then take some hot water and pour it between the two circles, and make the water heat gradually with a small fire, and keep it for about an hour, and allow the patient to endure the burning and scorching of it—for it produces a burning sensation like fire—until the burning stops.
And then lift your hand with the instrument and remove the hot water from the entire hip area with fresh water.
And then leave it for three days and apply a bandage until the blackness of the burn remains, and leave it for several days, and it will then be less painful; this is the final treatment.
And then treat it with ointments until it is healed.
And if the pain extends to the thigh or leg, apply a poultice to it containing water, in the same way as done for the hip.
And this is the method of hot water, and I have already written about it in my treatise on the rectification of medicines. Take a part of alkali and a part of extinguished charcoal, both equally divided, crush them, and place them in a new pot whose bottom has a small hole, corresponding to the size of the wound.
Place another, glazed pot underneath the bottom of the first pot, and pour over the alkali and charcoal a quantity of fresh water, using your finger to measure it.  Then, with your hand, firmly compress the mixture.  Allow the excess water to drain into the glazed pot below.
Then collect all that water, and pour it over more fresh charcoal and alkali.  This will now be very potent, and is used in many medical operations and cauterizations of other parts of the body, for it acts like fire.
And this is done with some medicines that are used for cauterization, such as sulfur, honey, and charcoal mixed together in a particular way.
And Galen recounts a story of an ancient man who was cured of pain in the groin and sciatica with this operation, and praises it highly.  He says that no other treatment was needed, and that it worked so quickly that, as recounted, once he entered the bath, he was already healed.
And it is to be taken from fresh green nettles, and if nettles are not available, take fresh fig leaves; and they are to be finely crushed with a little pepper and placed on the groin, thigh, or leg where the pain is, and bandaged.
And it should be left on for three hours, or for the amount of time the patient feels the heat subsiding.
And then put him in a bath; and when his body is warmed through, let him lie on the ground, for the pain will cease and he will be healed.
And know that no one should use cauterization with these remedies except after the body has been purged.
However, Esquirus says that when a vein in a goat's leg is cauterized, it benefits the patient greatly; and the cauterization should be done this way: take wool, soak it in old oil, and place it between the veins and bones of the foot.
And then take a dry piece of goat's skin and burn it in a fire until it is made into charcoal; and then place it on the wool and leave it until it has spread out. And then repeat this, and do not stop doing this until the feeling of the bite reaches the heart and the pain is relieved.
And this method of cauterization is called cauterization with a [goat/kid] skin.
Chapter 42.
On cauterization for double pain.
Sometimes pain in the back arises from various causes, such as injury, impact, or excessive evacuation, and similar causes, due to the infusion of cold, moist matter.
And cauterization is only effective in this single type, which is caused by the outflow of cold matter.
Therefore, it is necessary to evacuate the patient's ailment with powdered pills and similar remedies, placing them on the back where the pain is, in three lines following its width, and placing three or more cauteries (or more, depending on the patient's tolerance and the cauterization's potency) in each line.
And let the cauterization be performed with a pointed cautery.
And if you wish, cauterize with three or four cauteries, using a medial-shaped (or wedge-shaped) cautery, according to this method:
Chapter 43.
Of cauterization at the beginning of a swelling (or tumor).
Often this illness strikes young children; and a sign of its beginning in children is that it affects their structure, causing stiffness, elevation, and movement problems.
And you find that the last vertebra of the back and the bones of the buttocks are already starting to protrude over the other vertebrae.
And therefore, when you see this and wish to prevent it, then cauterize that with a cautery that is circular in this shape: that takes the cautery over the entire surface of the vertebra evenly.
And if you wish, cauterize in the area around the vertebra with the pointed cautery two or three times. And let the punctures be close together.
And then treat the area until it is healed with what we have said.
But be careful not to apply cautery to a swelling caused by nerve spasm.
Chapter XLIV.
Of cauterization for gout and joint pain.
When joint pain is caused by cold humors which are diffused throughout each part of the body, and when pain occurs in the feet, it is customarily called gout by physicians.
And thus, if gout caused by cold is treated with other methods of healing and the pains persist, then use cauterization.
And you cauterize that area around the joint of the foot with many cauteries.
And the cautery is olive-shaped, which is its form:
And if it is necessary to make punctures on the surface of the foot, then do it with a pointed cautery. And if the pain ascends to the knees or other joints, and this often happens, then cauterize each knee with three or four cauteries on all sides, using this olive-shaped cautery.
And if many cauteries are needed, then cauterize the area, but do not press your hand too hard with the cautery beforehand, only around the skin's surface.
And if the pain goes up to the knee and hip, then administer the cautery which we have described in its chapter.
And if the pain is only in the hands, and is called "suagra", then puncture the circuits of the vessels, as if turning around, puncturing along those two lines.
And if pain remains in the fingers, then puncture the circuits of the vessels over each nail and on the side of the hand.
And if the pain extends to the hamstrings or muscles over a few days, then cauterize the areas around them on all sides.
And you do not evacuate the illness by a good regimen and the reception of medicines, for if a good regimen is applied and the inflammation is evacuated with this cautery, it will be healed, God willing.
Chapter 45.
Of cauterization of ruptures.
When a rupture occurs in the groin, and the intestines protrude from the hernia at the opening, and this begins gradually, then it is necessary that you instruct the patient to abstain from their usual food on that day and to use soothing remedies so that the wound heals from within.
And then support the patient between your hands on their side, and instruct them to hold their breath until the hernia or intestines are fully expelled or appear.
And then return it with your fingers and hold the rupture over the pelvic bone, with the limb of which should be similar to half a circle at the parts of the body above.
And then apply the cautery, of which this is the shape:
until it is very red and throws sparks. And then return the intestine or hernia to its cavity, and then place your hand over the area so that the intestine does not come out again.
And you have already opened the space between the patient's thighs, and placed a cushion under them, and another attendant is on their legs, and another on their chest, who holds their hands.
Then place the cautery over that mark with your hand, using a straight cautery, and hold it there until with it you can reach the bone of the shinbone (or "pentenill," likely a specific part of the leg bone) to the middle of the (the) shin; and repeat with it another time if you haven't succeeded in reaching the bone the first time.
And carefully observe the protrusion of the intestine during your cauterization, so that you do not burn that intestine, lest the patient experience death or another serious harm.
And know that if, using the cautery, you do not reach the bone, your operation is not successful.
And it is necessary that the cautery for children be subtle, according to their size and proportions.
And then treat the cauterized area for three days with a bandage until the scar from the burn is healed.
And then treat it with other ointments until it is healed.
And the patient should lie on their back for 40 days until the area and wound are sealed.
And it is necessary to regulate the patient's nourishment according to the length of their healing time, carefully monitoring their stomach, so that the intestine does not come out due to the effort of healing.
And then, when approximately 40 days have passed, apply a properly made bandage, and let him keep it on for another 40 days.
And he should abstain from strenuous work, overeating, and excessive drinking and shouting, for if he follows this treatment regimen, he will be entirely healed.
And I will now describe the treatment for ruptures in other parts of the abdomen.  If, at the beginning, you want to prevent them from appearing, cauterize the rupture with a round cautery according to its size, just as the third part of its circumference is cauterized. Then treat it as previously described, and it will be healed.
And some early practitioners would say that a rupture should be cauterized with a triangular cautery, following this shape, since it has been located with a probe:
and a line is drawn along the widest part of the rupture, and another line above it; then, apply a wedge-shaped cautery with your hand, but the first, lighter cautery is better.
Chapter 46.
Of cauterization for twisting (or torsion).
When pain persists in some limb due to injury or impact, and that pain persists for a long time and you do not achieve healing with medicinal treatments, then it is necessary to cauterize with a pointed cautery.
And let the cautery be of a size appropriate to the limb's size and weakness, its location of twisting, and the pain in it.
So, if it is healed by the first cauterization, good; and if not, then repeat the cauterization; for it is customary for such pains to be treated by puncturing the limb near the afflicted one, therefore it is necessary to apply cauterization until the patient is healed.
Chapter 47.
Of the cauterization of leprosy.
Some leprous individuals receive great benefit from cauterization, especially if the type of leprosy is caused by the putrefaction of phlegm and melancholy.
And therefore, when you wish to cauterize that, consider if the leprosy is contagious and has been treated with what we have said in the division and is not worsening, and if you fear that the corruption might spread throughout the patient's body and affect their whole constitution, then cauterize the area above the head with five cauteries: one in the middle of the head, a second below that, even with the forehead near the hairline; and two more on either side of the temples; and one at the back of the neck, or in the nape of the neck.
And finally, press the cautery slightly into the bone until a small depression is formed, and the skin is raised, so that the expulsion of thick vapors is relieved; and cauterize on the spleen as required.
And if the leprosy has already spread throughout the patient and is clearly visible, then you must cauterize with the cauteries mentioned for the head; and with a cautery on the tip of the nose, and with two cauteries on both cheeks, and with two cauteries on two vertebrae of the neck, and with six cauteries on the vertebrae of the back, and with one large one on the vertebrae near the hips, and one on the hips, and with two on the ribs, and one on each rib, and with two on the thighs, and with two on the muscles, and with two on the tendons of the feet; and cauterize on all the joints of the fingers and toes, and on each heel of their feet, and on the joints of their hands.
And be careful of the nerves located on the heel so that you do not burn them.
And sometimes it is cauterized with a cautery on the hip bone and another on the mouth of the stomach, and another on the liver.
And know that the more cauteries you apply, the more helpful and beneficial it is; and know that the patient does not feel pain from the cautery, as they do from lancets, because the body is already numbed.
And the cauteries should be large or small, depending on the limbs and joints, according to the specifications of the tools.
And then treat the cauterization with flour of herbs cooked with honey and the other treatment until it is healed.
Chapter 48.
Of cauterization for numbness.
When a limb is numb or asleep and is treated with medicines, oils, and plasters, and is not healed, then you cauterize that numb limb with cauteries, according to the size of the limb.
And let your cautery penetrate the skin a little. And then treat it with ointment until it is healed.
And sometimes numbness is cauterized, which affects the hands and feet, and the vertebrae of the back, and the branching of the nerves which affect that limb, and the numbness is removed.
But do not presume on this unless one is knowledgeable in the anatomy of the limbs and the branching of the nerves throughout the moving body.
Chapter 49.
Of the cauterization of a skin disease called morphea.
When the skin disease is longstanding and you do not find any remedy among medical ointments, then you cauterize over it with a cautery, applying it a little, according to the intensity of the condition, until the whiteness and the discoloration are removed, and its color is changed.
Then treat it with flour of barley and lentils, mixed with roasted oil and arnica leaves, and with part of dove's blood or swallow's blood, all mixed together.  Then, apply a linen cloth and place it over the affected area until healed.
Chapter 50.
Of the cauterization of cancer.
When cancer is beginning and you want to remove it, then cauterize it with a circular cautery around it, as it is rolled/encircles.
And the learned say it should be cauterized with the back of the cautery in the middle place; but I do not see this, because I fear that it will be ulcerated, and I have seen this a few times myself.
And it is more appropriate that it be cauterized around it with a circle, as we have said, or with many cauteries.
Chapter 11.
Of cauterization of tumors/growths.
When a tumor has been delayed in maturing, and this is due to excess causing it, or to the patient's age, because they are old and frail, with little blood, or due to time, and you wish to hasten the tumor's maturation, then cauterize around it with many small, puncturing cauteries; and then leave it, for it will hasten in maturation.
But if you want to perforate it with a cautery, then you heat the cautery, of which this is the form: and place it in the middle of the tumor until it penetrates the skin.
And if the cautery is in that place that is lower, so that the arm's condition is alleviated; and then treat it until it is healed.
Chapter 52.
Of the cauterization of corrosive (or: ulcerative/destructive) conditions.
A corrosive is a wandering corruption in the limb, which eats away at it as if a consuming fire eats dry wood.
Therefore, if that corrosive is in a location suitable for cauterization with fire, then you apply small, pointed cauteries, and larger ones as appropriate to the area where the corrosive is.
And then cauterize it from every side until you eradicate all the corruption and no trace of it remains.
And then leave it for three days, and apply dressings of oil mixed with something to the cauterized areas until the scabs are all gone and all the corruption is eradicated.
And then treat it with flesh-generating ointments.
But if after three days the flesh grows healthy in the area where there is no corruption, it is good; but if not, then repeat the cauterization on the remaining corrupted areas.
And sometimes a corrosive medicine is used as a substitute for cautery. However, cautery with fire is a more immediate cure.
And I have already mentioned the treatment with sharp medicine in the division, so take it when you need it.
Chapter 53.
Of the cauterization of ulcers and similar conditions.
Many times there are ailments beneath the sick foot called ulcers, a large, gaping wound, which pains the foot; and cauterization for these is done in two ways, that is, cauterization with fire and cauterization with hot water.
But cauterization with fire is to ignite a concave cautery resembling a small oven, made of iron according to the size needed to contain the ulcer completely, and it should have fine edges.
Then place that heated cautery on the ulcer, and then rotate your hand with the cautery around the ulcer until the cautery reaches the depth of the ulcer. And leave it for three days until it begins to heal. Then apply a poultice of crushed wild mallows with salt, and leave the poultice on it for one night, for this will eradicate the ulcer from its roots.
And then treat the area with a healing ointment until it is healed.
And if this doesn't work, and this often happens on the surface of the body, especially in the hands and feet, then you should apply cauterization with water. Take a cannula of brass, iron, or a piece of a vulture's wing and place it over the ulcer. Then pour a small amount of hot water into the cannula, and hold your hand steady, rotating the cannula with the pressure of your hand.  Press the edge of the cannula firmly against the base of the ulcer, and the hot water will reach the root of the ulcer. Let the patient feel the effect of the hot water for an hour, and then remove it, for the ulcer and its roots will be eradicated.
And thus do this to each one and then the other, until you have treated all those that are affected by it on the body.
And then treat those pus since the roots of the ulcers are eradicated with these ointments that cause flesh to regenerate.
Chapter 44.
Concerning the cauterization of tremor.
When someone suffers tremor due to cold in the nerve or a cold fever, or another similar cause, then it is necessary to cauterize that person with four or five cauteries on the vertebrae of the back, one between each vertebra; and with a cautery on the soles of their feet, and on their stomach, with an olive oil cautery.
And the tremor in him/her subsides and hastens the recovery from the cold illness.
Chapter 45.
Concerning the cauterization of white spots (or blemishes) on the body.
When white spots appear on the body, and there are pustules or fissures caused by corrupted, thick matter; then, from the beginning when they appear, the affected area at the head of each fistula should be cauterized with a slender cautery made of myrtle wood, the tip of which is heated; or with long roots of herbs; or with a lens-shaped cautery.
And sometimes, a cautery is applied at the beginning of their expulsion, using this method;  and if it is not effective, it will break up the excess causing them, and thus cure them.
However, this must be done after an evacuation with bloodletting.
Chapter LVI.
Of cauterization of an accidental blood flow by archery incision.
Many times, an archery wound that is incised towards the plague, which is outside, or towards the incision of abscesses or cauterization of the limb, and similar cases, is difficult to heal.
Therefore, if this happens to someone, then you should press with your hand on the opening of the archery wound, and place your index finger over it, pressing it repeatedly until the blood flow is stopped under your finger and it does not come out again.
And then place the small and large olive cauteries, numerous in number, on the fire, and blow on them until they are well ignited.
And then take one, either small or large, depending on the location and wound where the artery is ruptured, quickly placing it on that vein after you have removed your finger, and hold the cautery until the blood is cauterized and constricted.
And if the blood is expelled from the artery's opening when you remove your finger and apply the cautery, then take another cautery quickly from the cauteries prepared in the fire, and thus do not cease doing this repeatedly until the blood is constricted.
And be careful not to burn the nerve that is here, and that further harm comes to the patient.
And know that when blood flows from the artery, it is not possible to constrict it, especially when the artery is large, unless by one of four methods: either with cautery as we have said, or by extraction if it is not extracted, for when it is extracted the extremities of the patient are likely burned and the blood is constricted, or that it be tied with thread or ligature by strong constriction, or that medicines whose virtue is to constrict blood be applied to it; and they be pressed with a cushion with a proper constriction.
However, whoever administers proper constriction with ligatures and tight bandages or by applying cauterizing substances, will only have success after a delay.
But if this happens to someone and the physician is not present nor is medicine available, then proceed with calmly pressing the finger on the opening of the vein as we have described, and attempt to greatly constrict it until the blood is stopped from flowing, and the finger remains on the wound; and over the wound, sprinkle with very cold water until the blood is congealed and thickened; and further consider whether cautery or medicine is necessary.
Of incisions, perforations, leeches, phlebotomy, sores, and similar conditions.
We have already discussed in the first chapter all illnesses in which cauterization with fire is appropriate, along with burning medicines, and the occasions and causes for them, and the instruments necessary for various types of cauteries; and I have ordered the chapters from the supremacy of the head down to the feet.
And I will proceed in this chapter in the same manner, so that the seeker of this knowledge will be helped in understanding what they have asked.
And before I begin this, children, you must understand that in this chapter, this is a continuation of what is in the first chapter on cauterization.
And therefore great caution is needed, for in the operations of this chapter, often evacuation occurs involving blood, which sustains life, during the opening of a vein, or incision of an abscess, or removal of a suture, or healing of a wound, or the removal of an arrow, or the incision of a stone, and similar procedures. And all of those are accompanied by fear and trembling, and in their occurrence, death often results.
And I warn you that this should not happen to you, for sometimes, you will find yourselves dealing with many different types of sicknesses in many ways. And some of these, because of their illness, approach death easily;  this is because of the severity of their illness, the length of their suffering, and the illness itself, which signifies impending death.
And among those is one who gives you their possessions and declares that they expect health, yet their illness is harmful.
Therefore, you should not consent to those who come to you with this kind of illness;  let your caution be greater than your desire and your eagerness. Do not presume anything about it, but rather seek certain knowledge that verifies it for you, and to which a commendable outcome will follow.
Employ prognosis and indication of the path to health in the treatment of all your patients, for this will assist you in gaining fame and remembrance, praise, and glory.
O, children, may God inspire your understanding and not withhold his guidance and protection, for that is in his power.
And I have organized this chapter, distinguishing it by sections, just as the previous chapter on cauteries did, for the treatment of the head to the feet, so that you may find what you are seeking and what you require in it.
First Chapter.
Of the treatment of water contained within the heads of children.
Know that this illness often comes to children after birth, and when the nurse tightens the child's head without gentleness.
And sometimes it comes about due to hidden causes that are unknown.
However, I have only seen this illness in children; and of all those I saw, death followed, and therefore, I leave the work on them.
And I have seen a child whose head was filled with water, and the head of him was always thus swollen until he could no longer support himself due to the size of his head, and that the moisture continued to increase until he died.
And this moisture is either accumulated between the bone and the skin, or is accumulated beneath the bone on the spine.
When the operation in that case, if the moisture is between the skin and the bone and the abscess is small, then you should make a cut in the middle of the head with a fissure in the width, and the fissure's length should be about two fingers until the moisture runs out. This is the way of a spatum.
And so, if the moisture is more increased and the abscess is larger, then there are two fissures according to this method:
And if the moisture is beneath the bone, a sign of it is that you see the seams of the head opened from all sides, and the water is squeezed out when you press it with your hand on the sides, and this is not hidden from you. You should cut in the middle of the head with three fissures according to this method:
And then remove all the moisture; then bind the fissures with cloths and bandages; then apply wine and oil to it until the fifth day, and then loosen the bandage and treat the wound with bandages and ointments, and bandage the head evenly; and let the patient eat dry foods with little moisture until the member is strengthened and healed.
And there is another method of incision, considering where the size of the abscess and the collection of water appear, for sometimes it is more in the occiput, or in the front part, or in the right, or in the left; and therefore, make the incision where the abscess and the collection of water appear, and do it as best as possible for you.
And be careful not to cut the artery, lest blood flow and the patient die from that blood flow with the evacuation of moisture.
Second Chapter.
When there is a persistent cold or sores on the eyes or feet, and the usual medical treatments are ineffective, then the final treatment in this case is incision of those two arteries.
And therefore, when you wish to incise those, where the patient's illness affects the head, first rub the area with a rough cloth to make the arteries apparent, then bind the patient's neck with a cloth; then consider where the vein pulses; and locate the places, which are near the ears, and press them, and these (arteries) are hidden in some men.
And then gently probe the artery with a probe, and then make an incision along each artery, using a sharp instrument, ensuring the incision goes into the bone, and this should be in line with the breadth of the head.
And if you wish, insert the instrument beneath the artery and sever it at the points above.
And the length of the incision should be about two fingers' width, for when any vein is cut, the blood comes out with a pulsating flow, which leaps out with frequent spurts.
But if the artery is not apparent by feeling, then you must measure from the ear the amount of space of three fingers, and then probe with a probe, and proceed into the bone.
And the amount of blood to be removed is approximately a cup, and it may be more or less depending on the amount that appears from the patient's constitution and the fullness of their artery.
And then consider the wound, and if any cause of inflammation remains on the bone, then separate it so that a harmful abscess does not develop.
And then compress the wound with lint and cloth bandages, and then treat it with ointments until it is healed.
Chapter 3.
Of the extraction of the arteries which are in the temples.
When, in someone, an old migraine or acute headache arises, due to acrid humidities and qualities in the temple tissues, or a similar, old and violent one, and it is treated with the known methods of medicine, and this does not work, then we have tested, in these illnesses, the extraction of the arteries in the temples, or the cauterization of those, as we have shown.
And the method of the operation and extraction of those is that the patient shaves the hair that is on the temples; and look for the artery appearing on the temple because it is shown to you by its pulse, and it is hidden except for a few people due to the violence of the cold.
And if it is hidden from you, then the patient's neck should be tightened with a cloth; and then rub the area with a rough cloth or warm the area with hot water until the artery appears clearly to you. And then you take the instrument of which this is the shape: And then you gently scrape the membrane with that until you reach the artery; and then you apply heat there and extract that to its highest point until you extract it from the membrane and uncover the tissues underneath it, on all sides.
But if the artery is delicate, then wrap it with the tip of the instrument, and then cut off a portion of it according to the amount by which its extremities are elongated and contracted, so that no blood flow occurs, for if they are not cut, the blood will not rise fully.
And then remove the blood of one to three ounces.
And if the artery is large, then you must tie it in two places with strong, double-folded silk thread or strong cords, and not cut it until the wound is consolidated, lest there be a flow of blood.
And then cut the excess that is between the two ligaments; and do this at that time or another time.
And if you wish, cauterize it with a cautery until the bone is reached, with a knife cautery until its extremities are cut, and it will remain in the same condition.
And it is a better course of action if the patient does not have a fever or is not of a hot constitution; for cautery is from those things that help eliminate moisture, and therefore is better in a cooling treatment.
And after the extraction of the arteries, the area should be filled with old lint, and powdered medicines should be placed on it, and then it should be treated with drying medicines that cause flesh to grow and with poultices until it is healed.
And if, while working, a flow of blood from the artery occurs again, then you should try to stop the blood, either with a cautery, or by filling the area with lint and pressing your hand until the blood is stopped. And if any of those things are not available to you, then place your finger on the area until the blood has clotted, and apply water of extreme coldness until the pain subsides and it is tightened as necessary.
And the easiest way to extract an artery is to cauterize the vein with this cautery, using two knives, after you have marked the two spots with a probe, and heating each one intensely until they reach the bone and sever the vein in two places, so that what is between its extremities is elongated, because it is not completely consolidated by this cautery.
And this is the form of the cautery:
And the sharpness of the two knives is an example. However, if there is less sharpness than two knives, it is better, for if it is sharp like two knives close to each other, it will not cut the flesh quickly.
Therefore, since there is some thickness in them, the heat of the fire is contained within them, and the flesh is cut away easily.
And this work is better than any other work and more effortless.
And let the space between the two knives be the thickness of a finger.
Fourth Chapter.
Of the care of bodies suffering from acute and acidic ulcers of the eyes.
When the eyes are acidic, and the blood vessels around the forehead are inflamed, and you find no medical cause for this condition, and the patient's face begins to redden, and you feel a crawling sensation on their forehead as if ants were crawling, and the eyelids are swollen, moist, and their skin is irritated, and the eyelids are irritated by the acidity of the tears,  the ancient practitioners of medicine used a certain procedure for this condition, and they called that cure "spassa.
And you instruct the patient to shave the hairs on their forehead, and then make three equally spaced incisions on the forehead, following the length of the forehead. And if the length of the incision is two fingers, the first incision should be equidistant from the nose along the middle of the forehead, the second approximately the length of the distance from the movement of the muscles near the tear ducts, and the third on the other side.
And be careful not to cut the blood vessels that lie on both sides, and keep your hand away from the area connecting both jawbones. And make each incision about three fingers wide.
And if you have a piece of prepared sponge or very dry cloths with which you absorb the blood.
And then place the spatula with its two sharp ends, of which this is the form of the incision on it: which is from the temple area to the second incision. Scrape away all the flesh between the two incisions, using the chisel which is on the bone, and then do this from the middle incision to the second incision. And then remove this spatula and insert into the first incision again another instrument called a scalpel, sharp on one side and not sharp on the other.
And place the sharp edge of this against the flesh adjacent to the flesh, and its blunt edge against the bone, and push it in until it reaches the middle fissure, and sever with it all the vessels that descend from the head to the eyes.
But let the incision continue in this manner along the flesh, and then do this in the middle fissure up to the other fissure.
And when a quantity of blood flows, press the spots of congealed blood.
And then place in each fissure a piece of old cloth, and put over these powders mixed in wine, oil, and vinegar, and watch that it doesn't become a hot abscess.
And on the third day, loosen the ligaments and administer a large infusion of warm or lukewarm water, and then treat it with basil ointment with rose oil and others until the wounds are healed.
Chapter 5.
Of the treatment of tears, and the wounds descending from the parts within the head.
When a patient experiences sharp and continuous tearing, and the wounds on the patient's skin are small and already their care is weakened, and the eyelids are ulcerated and their hair is falling out, and there is acute pain and subsequent exhaustion in the front of the head, then know through these symptoms that the matter and tears come only from the many veins of the internal parts of the head.
And the best treatment for this is as follows: instruct the patient to lie down on their forehead, then make a small incision in the middle of their forehead, from the left temple to the right temple,  (beginning with a fissure from the left temple towards the right temple; and let the incision extend to the bone; and keep your hand away from the temples, which are prone to damage from chewing), until the bone is exposed.
Dry all the blood with a sponge or a dry cloth, and then fill the gap between the two edges of the fissure with old cotton or linen cloths. And then apply a poultice made of powdered herbs mixed with wine and oil, so that a hot abscess does not form.
And when you remove this and see that the abscess has diminished, then you must clean the bone until flesh begins to grow, and then treat it with a drying regimen to promote the growth of flesh.  This is done by mixing two parts wheat flour with four parts colophony, to make a poultice.  This poultice is used in these wounds to encourage flesh to grow.
Chapter 6.
Of the treatment of that which affects the ears.
Any ailment affecting the ears belongs to one of four types: either it is a mineral, or something similar to a mineral, like iron or glass; or it is from a plant, such as a thistle or a bean; or it is from a fluid substance, such as water, sour wine, and their like; or from an animal.
And therefore, when a stone or similar hard substance is lodged in the ear, and you place the ear in the sun, and it moves the stone, then pour into it some kind of oil (like olive oil or sesame oil), and then use extraction techniques to remove it.  Make the person sneeze with some kind of stimulant, and press the nostrils to help with the sneezing event. Then, place some pieces of cloth or wool around the ear, and stretch the ear in different directions, because many times it is pushed out with these actions.
And if it is not pushed out, then apply extraction with the instrument called a *gesti epicicarios* (a very small, likely surgical, instrument), of which this is the form:
If it is pushed out with the instrument, it is good; and if not, then administer its extraction with a small, thin, spoon-like instrument (a *pontius*).
And therefore, if it is not pushed out by that, then make a copper tube (a cannula) and insert the end of the tube into the ear canal. Seal around the tube with softened wax and oil so that only the tube is open. Then, extract with your hand using strong traction, for often this helps, as we have described.
But if it is not pushed out in this way, then take a lighted cloth or a cloth prepared for this purpose, a small quantity, and place it on the end of the wound. Then carefully wrap the cloth around it. Then gently insert that into the ear canal, and then dry the ear of moisture.
And therefore, if it is not pushed out by all the methods we have described, then you must cut it open before it becomes a painful abscess or spasm.
And the way to cut it open is that you first bleed the patient from the cephalic vein and extract the blood according to the method appropriate to the patient's condition, then make a small incision between your fingers, turning the ear outward, and make a small incision in the base of the ear, close to the patient's head, in a well-supported position. And let the incision be crescent-shaped until it reaches the stone, and, once the stone is found, remove it if possible with appropriate instruments; then close the incision immediately, and treat it until healed.
And if the cause of the ear affliction is a swelling that has grown and inflamed, then administer the cure and removal of it; but if you do not succeed in this, then you take a subtle spatula in this manner: and use that to remove the swelling that is lodged in the ear.
And do not do this if you think the swelling is already softened by ear moisture, and place it in small pieces, and remove those with tweezers or with a delicate hand, or with a small incision as we have said, because this will ease its removal.
But if water has entered the ear, the patient should initially use sneezing, and fill the ear with old cloth, and lie on the side with the affected ear, and if the water is thereby expelled, that is good; and if not, then take small, smooth stones, the length of one's finger, and heat them slightly in the fire, and the patient should insert one into the ear canal, and step on one foot on that side, and strike with another stone on the stone in the ear. So do this with a stone until all the water is expelled.
So do this with a stone until all the water is expelled. And if the water has already been expelled, then take some paper or linen, place one end in the ear, and hold the other end near a fire until the majority of it is burned.
And then put more linen in, and do this repeatedly until all the water is expelled, and remove it with a cannula, just as described above for removing the stone.
However, in the extraction of a small animal or similar object that has entered the ear, treat it as described in the section on similar cases; but if it is a large object causing a visible swelling, then administer its extraction with tools and forceps, and this condition is easier to treat than any other thing that lodges in the ear.
But in the extraction of a worm generated in the ear, if you treat it as described in the section on similar cases and in the treatise on distillations, and your treatment doesn't work, then you should expose the ear to sunlight.
And therefore, if any sign of worms appears, then extract it with fine forceps or tweezers; but if no sign is visible, then take a cannula, narrow at the bottom and wider at the top, of which this is the form: Insert the narrow end into the ear according to the amount the patient can tolerate; and then, repeatedly draw out the worms with forceful suction, until all the worms are expelled.
But if it doesn't respond to this treatment, then you should plug and seal the area around the cannula with wax as previously described.  Then, administer distillations, which the ancients have used in treating worms; you will find this in the treatise on distillations.
And let your application be the introduction of medicinal oils into the ear using this instrument, of which this is the form: Make it of silver or brass, narrow at the bottom, with a small hole, and a flat top.
And thus, it should be like a funnel, situated within the cavity of the cannula wherever needed. And if you wish, take a reed, wrapping its end neatly with cloth.  Then pour oil into the concavity of the ear, or the juice of any herb, or whatever medicinal substance you desire, into the cannula – and that is within the ear.  Then carefully insert the reed wrapped in cloth, and press gently with your hand until the oil is expelled into the concavity of the ear, and the patient feels the oil inside.
And whatever is inserted into the ear should be warmed slightly with fire. And be careful that the substance you distill into the ear is not too cold, for ear remedies cannot tolerate that.
Chapter 7.
Of the treatment of ear blockages.
Sometimes children inherit this from their mothers' wombs, and this also occurs in some adults, a blockage in the ear canal caused by pus or some flesh growing there; and this blockage sometimes occurs at the entrance to the ear canal, preventing the passage of sound, and sometimes is in the outer parts.
And that which occurs at the entrance to it, preventing the passage of sound, is in the most difficult cases to cure.
And in those cases where you can hear sound, you should place the patient's ear in the sun and observe it. And so if a blockage is apparent, open it with a very small instrument, which has this shape:
If its tip has a small width, one side sharp and the other not; and the instrument has two thin ends so that it doesn't damage the ear.
And if the blockage is due to flesh grown in the ear or its canal, then remove it with fine forceps, and cut away that flesh vigorously until all of it is removed.
And if the blockage is in the ear canal, then take a thin, pointed stick and heat it slightly with fire, then carefully place it into the ear canal.
And therefore, if you have sensed a blockage that the patient finds difficult to hear through, ease the pressure gently, and be careful not to injure the nerves of the ear.
Then place a cloth, sized according to the width of the hole you've created, dipped in Egyptian ointment, over the ear.  Do this for several days until you are sure of the wound's healing, or take some crushed and powdered herbs, and use them.  If the ear is already inflamed, then you must remove the herb and replace it with a new herb wrapped in a compress made from warmed olive oil, until the inflammation subsides. Then continue treatment until it is healed.
But if bleeding occurs, then soak a sponge or cloth in cool water and apply it to the ear, and use other treatments to stop the bleeding, as described in the distillation tract.
Chapter 8.
Of the treatment of a swelling that forms on the eyelids.
Swellings that appear on the eyelids sometimes are moist, sometimes dry.
Therefore, you should hold them with forceps or tweezers, and cut them away from their roots, and then apply a compress to the area.
But if pain with a flow of blood occurs, then cauterize them with a thin, lens-shaped cautery.
And the best cauterization is close to the incisions, and many times they return when some cause remains of their roots; and when they are cauterized with fire, those roots are burned and do not return.
Chapter 9.
Treatment of swelling that comes to the eyelids of the eyes.
Often in the eyelids of the eyes some cause, which is similar to a swelling in its strength and hardness, and therefore swelling is called.
And it is a collection of thick moisture on the eyelid above and below.
Therefore, the operation for them is that you should then consider whether the swelling is arising from something visible on the eyelid and is spreading in all directions; and its cause is slight.
Then make a cut over that with a scalpel, and then slice it from all sides easily until it opens, and then suspend it with a forceps and cut it off.
And if the figure (the swelling) is large, then you should close it with sutures; and treat it until it is healed.
And if it is small, you will not encounter difficulty because the ointment will restore it and cause it to heal.
And if the size is extending towards the inside of the eyelid, towards the inside surface, then lift the eyelid, suspend the swelling with forceps, so that you can make an incision, and press it from all sides. If the eyelid is incised and spread open, this does not matter.
And after the incision, wash the wound with salt water; and treat the area with whatever promotes healing until it is healed.
Chapter 10.
Of the treatment of a tumour on the eyelid above the eye.
A tumour is a growth that develops in the layers of the eyelid above the eye, and is more common in children.  It aggravates the eyes of those afflicted and causes difficulty in seeing clearly in the morning.  They cannot look at the sunlight because the tears are drawn to it.
And because of this, you often see them lying on their faces at all times, and sleeping on their faces; and their eyelids below the eyebrows are damp, already covered in swelling, and the appearance of a tumor is evident in the eye; and when you press the area with your fingers, you feel the tumor within them.
And a certain method of operation is that the patient rests their head on your own, and you then place a cloth over them and warm it.  You then make a circle according to the size containing the tumor on all sides, and place this over it and press it with your fingers so that the tumor is contained within the middle of the circle.  Then, in the centre of that moisture, you create a small incision with a scalpel, just as in the incision made in a phlebotomy.
However, in the process, you must cut through the skin completely until you reach the tumor, for in most cases, the tumor forms a white, greasy substance through a fissure.
Then remove that with cloths that you have wrapped between your fingers on the outside and rub back and forth with your right and left hands until it disappears.
And be careful not to force the incision, so that with the scalpel you do not pierce the eye and damage it.
However, if the tumor does not appear at the beginning of the incision, but you must gently push into the incision until the tumor emerges; and then remove it as we have said; and then soak cloths in warm water and vinegar and place them on the affected area and compress them with powders.
And some rub salt and place it in the cavity of the incision, so that this may remove any remaining moisture.
And then treat it until it is healed.
But if there is a festering boil in the area, then treat it with soothing plasters until it is healed.
Chapter 11.
Methods of treating the eye.
When in the eyelids of the eyes there are growths beneath the natural skin and they are old, they then bother the eye and cause various ailments such as constant tears and softening of the eyelids and tissues, to the point that it causes destruction of the eye, which is called "tactimir of the eye," and it is treated in four ways: either by cautery with fire; or with a sharp medicine as previously described in the chapter on cautery; or by making incisions and sutures on the "tactimir"; or with canes as I will describe.
And therefore you should place the patient's head on your lap; then turn the eyelid with your left hand, and if it turns, good; but if not, insert a needle into the one in which there is a deposit just below the eyelid, and push the needle in with the deposit above, and this should be — near the edge of the eyelid where the hairs grow — near the hairs, and pull the deposit upwards with the eyelid and turn that with the ray.
Then, make incisions in the part inside the eyelid, below the hairs, with a sharp instrument from the larger tear duct to the smaller tear duct; and then remove the deposit and place small, powdered cotton or cloth below the eyelid, and then press the eyelid with a thread, so that it forms a shape like a myrtle leaf.
However, the shape must be according to the amount of the eyelid's swelling, for this varies in people, as some require a significant incision to the eyelid in proportion to the degree to which the eyelid is swollen.
And then make incisions with the instrument along the two lines you have marked, starting from the larger tear duct and going to the smaller tear duct. And if the incision is near the natural hairs, just as thick as the king's finger.
And then place the ointment on one of the two corners of the wound, and then scrape the entire area clean, and then stitch the two lips together with thread or fine wool, and clean away the blood.  Then, adhere any excess materials to the eyebrows with various medicaments if you wish, otherwise, do not bother.
And then leave the stitches in place for three or four days, and then treat the wound.
And if you wish, leave the wound without stitches and treat it with things that dry and constrict, because the eyelid is elevated towards the sealing of the wound and its adhesion; however, stitches are better.  And so say the ancient surgeons.
But nevertheless, there should be care for the patient, and it is a good operation, and there is no fear in it.
And there is another method in surgery, and it is that you draw on the eyelid a figure like a myrtle leaf, and then lift the eyelid with three separated and joined hooks according to this shape:
But if that is not possible, holding the hooks, and that is not appropriate, then take a needle with thread and place it in the middle of the figure, and insert the other stitch near the larger tear duct, and the second stitch near the smaller tear duct, and adjust the stitches equally between those two points, and then with those, raise your hand in a firm lift, elevating the entire eyelid on which the figure is drawn as we have described.
And then bring together the two edges of the wound with stitches, and treat it until it is healed.
But if an abscess occurs near your incision or fissure, treat that abscess with plasters and similar remedies, and with ointments.
And sometimes the eyelashes of the eyelid become inverted, in which case you should use what we have said about incisions; however, a suture in each case is more skillful/artificial.
To treat with cannas (likely a type of herb or medical material) is according to this method: And you should invert the eyelid and split the figure within as I have described; and then, skillfully, create two thin strips or sticks, whose length matches the eyelid's length, and whose width is less than the width of the gap. And you have already incised at the extremities of each part, where you have the threads/stitches.
Then, carefully attach each one to the excess of the eyelid, and tightly bind the strips at each part, and leave it for several days, because the excess flesh will die due to the pressure and will become softened and putrid until it falls off by itself.
However, if it has taken too long, then break it open with forceps, and then treat the wound until it is healed.
Thus, once it is healed, the eyelid is elevated and the skin is not sore.
And this is the method for two strips which you will make according to this pattern: and have a quantity of length and width neither more nor less.
Chapter 12.
Of raising painful skin in the eye with a needle when the skin is hard.
When there are unnatural, hard, rough hairs that prick the eyes, then the operation for them is that you take a fine needle and place it in that fine thread of silk and linen, and then adjust the ends of it, twisting each one very subtly. And the length of the threads should be about one palm's length.
And then you add another fine thread underneath that quickly, and tie the ends of that one if you want to.
And then place the patient's head on your lap, and keep it close to the sun so that your work is clear, for it is a subtle and delicate operation.
And then insert the needle into the root of the affected hair, which requires skill, and quickly pierce the eyelid until you pull the unnatural hair out from under the natural hair.
And then pull the hair out from under and place it in the container; and there should be one, two, or three hairs, no more.
And then remove your hand with the hair until the hair is pulled out from underneath the eyelid along with the natural hair.
However, if the hair isn't pulled out along with the foreign body, you will pull the foreign body outwards using the medicine you prepared for it, until the foreign body is expelled from the wound.
And you'll view this with the eye, for when you remove the foreign body and medicine, everyone washes and closes the eye, and leaves it closed for two or three days, until the hair adheres to its place and good flesh grows over it.
And if the hair is shorter, then you attach a long hair from the natural hairs, and raise it with that, or leave it until it has been extended to some space, and then you raise it.
Chapter 13.
Of the treatment of a wound which occurs on the upper eyelid.
When a wound occurs in the eye, and there is a contraction of the eyelid when it is drawn up, either on the right or left side, due to poor healing of a wound, or incision, or cautery, and it is called "leporine" (harelip). This wound, or ulcer, is either natural or accidental, and is caused by poor healing of wounds, incisions, or cauteries, or by similar poorly treated injuries.
The method of treatment in such a case is to break apart that scar tissue and separate the edges of the wound, and place a strip of linen between them, and tie them together until they are healed.
And you should not use treatments that are drying or constricting; for if you do this, the wound will return worse than it was before the injury.
Use remedies that soften it, such as fenugreek, and apply a poultice with water in which herbs and their seeds are steeped, or diachylon ointment, which has been liquefied with some oil. Soak the linen strip in it and treat with that.
And the key to your treatment is that you should break apart any unhealed scar tissue, restoring it to the shape it originally had.
And this operation, which we have described, is simply a rectification of the scar tissue, restoring the area to its previous form.
Chapter 14.
Of the treatment of a scar that is on the lower eyelid.
This scar on the lower eyelid, properly called a scar, can be either a natural or an accidental one.
But an accidental scar is caused by a wound, or a cut, or cautery, or other similar injuries.
And the method of operating on it is that you take a needle with a double thread, and insert it into the flesh, and make it pass from the left tear duct to the right tear duct, until the thread reaches the two extremities of the flesh.
Then spread the flesh apart with the needle and stitch it with the needle, and cut it with a broad spatula. And so if the eyelid shape returns as it should, good.  If not, take the thread and place it in the cleft/gap, and with that draw the eyelid together, and close the two fissures (splits) on the lower eyelid.
And let the extremities of the two fissures be two angles of the incision, which you have made until they meet, and let there be an angle formed by their meeting.
And this shape is the Greek letter: lambda.
And then hold back the flesh, to the extent that it is the sharp edge below it, which is the eyelid.
And then bring the separated parts together and bind them with wool thread; and then treat them with the softening medicines and poultices we mentioned until healed.
And if a raising occurs because of a fissure, suture, or cautery, then it is necessary that you dissect with a flat incision on the eyelid skin, according to what has been previously described. And then separate with a poultice between the two lips, as we have said.
In summary, the treatment for a raised swelling, whether above or below, should follow the operation, according to the type of swelling, and this is in a variety of forms.
And skilled artisans always prepare a device in every possible way until they restore the figure to its natural form, or as close as possible, and the patient, according to their needs, should be appropriately positioned for the operation and use of the instruments.
Chapter 15.
Of the adhesion of the eyelid to the conjunctiva or to the cornea.
When this adhesion occurs in old men, so that the eyelid is stuck to the white of the eye, hindering its natural movement and function, then you must insert the tip of the instrument under the eyelid and lift it up, or pull it away with forceps.
And then you cut the adhesion with a fine instrument, which should not be overly sharp, having made the cut shallow so that the patient is not disturbed by the operation, and remove the instrument so as not to injure the eye with its sharpness.
And your incision should easily separate that adhesion until the eyelid is restored to its natural shape and all the adhesion is healed.
And then you put salt water into the eye with which you wash it; or apply a distilled solution of lead dissolved in water.
And then separate the eyelid from the eye with a soft cloth, and place wool soaked in egg white over the eye, and then, on the third day, use healing substances until it is healed.
Chapter 16.
Of the incision of the nail and of the protruding flesh of the lacrimals.
Know that a nail is of two types, either it is nervous, and resembles a hard, subtle chip; or it is non-nervous, resembling frozen white moisture, which when a file touches it, or is forced to be taken with a forceps, is severed and the forceps does not become stuck in it.
And both types originate from the larger lacrimal gland, gradually extending to cover the eye and blocking the light and movement of the eye.
But the method of operating on the incision is that the patient places their head on your lap, and then open their eyes, and lift the eyelid with your hand, and then collect the nail with forceps with little bending, and extend it to the upper parts. And then take a needle and insert into it a hair of a horse or ox or cow, or similar, or strong thread, or gradually bend the tip of the needle and place it in the middle of the nail, and pierce it with the needle, and tie the nail with thread; and extend it to the upper parts, and scrape away the layer of the nail that covers the pupil with the hair. And thus you draw it [the nail] back with the hair until behind it.
And then you cut the remainder at the root of the lacrimal gland with a thin scalpel or small scissors, and leave the natural lacrimal tissue intact, so that the incision does not cause a continuous flow of tears.
And sometimes the nail, with forceps alone, or with thread, as we have said, and then scraped with a lion's-claw scalpel, of which this is its shape:
And be careful that with the scalpel you do not touch the cornea and cause a rupture, and that the pupil is pierced.
Then place a little crushed salt or a concoction of cinnabar in the wound, and leave it there until the next day; then treat it with whatever is necessary until it is healed.
And if the nail is not painful and you cannot insert a needle, or is not pierced with forceps, then often this type of nail is cured with medicaments, and is healed as I have recounted in the division.
And if you want to incise it, then you should open the patient's wound and take a sharp, thin lion's-claw scalpel, shaped like this: with skill/delicately/carefully. And if it is often inflamed, infected and has pus in the wound, then distill from your flask a concoction made with cinnabar or red cinnabar, or crushed salt, and cover the wound until the next day.
And then repeat the operation until everything that is part of it is removed, unless a hot abscess is in the wound; in that case, leave it and first treat the abscess until it is healed.
And then continue your operation on it with care until it is healed.
If the lacrimal flesh (likely referring to inflamed or swollen tissue around the eye) is prominent in the wound and causes significant pain, suspend it with a ligature; and cut away a portion, but do not complete the incision so as to prevent excessive tearing of the eye.
And then distill into the lacrimal [area] red cinnabar and cinnabar mixture until it is healed.
Chapter 17.
Of the incision of a boil/pustule and of that which has arisen from the accumulation of flesh in the eye.
Sometimes in the eyes of some, red flesh grows, and it overgrows until it covers the pupil, or it approaches or compresses the eyelids, and strongly presses the eyelids outwards, and it is similar to the roughness of a balustrade (or a parapet).
But the operation on him is that the patient rests his head on your lap; and then open the eyes of that one and gather all that flesh with suitable forceps, and hold it with a pair of forceps or shears; and then cut the flesh at the beginning until everything is finished with the scalpel, and be careful not to damage the eye during your operation.
And your incision should be made with the same instrument as used in the incision of a nail, or with small scissors, using the method described earlier in this chapter, depending on the appropriate shape of the affected area.
So, when your incision is complete and all that flesh is removed, then fill the eye with powdered salt, or sprinkle in red powder similar to that of corrosive medicines, and place a cloth soaked in egg white over the eye until it is protected from further inflammation.
And if any lingering infection or inflamed blood remains, and you fear further inflammation, then leave the eye and treat that inflammation with what will cause it to subside, and then repeat the operation until it heals.  Similarly, treat any additional flesh growth around the eye in this way.
However, you should avoid all treatment of the inflamed eye by natural or accidental means, using iron, and do not place your hand on any of these operations until you see that the affected part has endured the procedure.
Chapter 18.
Of the collection of knowledge about the eye.
Knowledge comes from the red veins that are swollen over the eye and hinder its function, and the eye should be cared for over a long period of time.
Therefore, it is necessary at the beginning that you consider if the eye in which the knowledge [i.e., pus] is present is strong and has no other illness besides pus; then you collect that pus.
And you instruct the patient to place their head on your lap, and then gently press those veins with one or two ounces, depending on your judgment; and that ounce should be of a fine, thin, double layer, in this form:
or two ounces gradually in one piece, in this form:
And then those veins should be gently collected with subtle force, and the blood should be wiped away little by little until you see those veins receding from the eye and being rolled back.
And be careful not to injure the eye with the extremities of the instrument; and if your operation is during the middle of the day before the sun, and be very firm in your operation so that you only cut those veins.
And when you have completed, then you distill green or red juice into the eye so that with its sharpness it corrodes what has been drawn back from the eye.
But if that is not possible for you to collect at that time, then you cover everything with something that relieves the pain, and leave it for a few days until the pain is calmed and a hot abscess is assured.
And then repeat the same procedure until it is healed.
And this is the way of the forceps:
Chapter 19.
Of the reduction of a nasal injury.
When you treat a nasal injury with cautery or a sharp, burning medicine, following the narration of it and it is not healed, then you are not succeeding. Instead, you should make incisions on the abscess, before its full maturity, and remove all the moisture and pus, until the bone is exposed.
And thus, when the bone is exposed and you see corruption or blackness there, then you scrape it with an instrument of which this is the form:
And it is called a sharp head, and it is made of iron, and the head is rounded, like a nail, which is made pointed by filing or by using a fine file (as in the following diagram).
And place that [sharp head/instrument] on the corrupted area of the bone, then rotate it between your fingers, and gently press with your hand, little by little, until you know that the corruption is scraped away.
And do this several times, then restore the area with drying and astringent substances.
Therefore, if the area is consolidated and healthy flesh has grown, and the body is free from pus and remains for 40 days, and it is not renewed, nor has an abscess formed, and no accident occurs there, then you know that it is healed.
And if not, then there is no remedy but to reduce the fracture to the shape of the nose, and in this manner:  and it is that you expose the underlying bone with iron or with a sharp medicine, and when you have exposed the bone, then you take a splint in this way:
Let the end of the iron be triangular, and the shaft be thin and tapered towards the end, like a wedge.
Then place this on the bone, and let it be near the lacrimal; and move your hand slightly away from the eye, and then turn your hand with the splint until it penetrates the entire bone, and the patient will feel air escaping from there as your hand does so.
Therefore, then restore the area with astringent drying medicines, as you have been taught.
Therefore, when the flesh has healed and the area has hardened, then the matter that had spread outwards returns to the nose, and this is therefore easier on the patient.
Chapter 20.
Of the reduction of the eminence of the eye.
When the eye protrudes completely and you do not observe any harmful or diminishing consequences in the sight, then you should let the patient rest, and gently follow (the eye's movement), and apply leeches to the neck without scarification, and allow good suction; and then apply a liniment to the eye made of acatra, aloe, and enses and sarcocolla, and then firmly press the poultice against the eye with more powder.
The method for the powders is to take thin linen cloths, and each cloth should be folded into four layers; and make many of those.
Then place those cloths one over the other, according to the amount the eye needs. Then press firmly on those with a hard cloth, with strong compression; and repeat the leech application with suction without scarification; and then remove the leeches, and leave the eye compressed day and night.
But if meanwhile the swelling has softened, then it should be very tightly bound.
And then remove the bandage, approximately day and night, as we have said.
And if the eye is already reduced, it is good; and if not, then repeat the plaster with the powders, and the compression and leeches, until it is healed.
Chapter 21.
Of the incision of the eminence of the uvea.
When there is a rupture in the uvea, and it is prominent, protruding beyond the eyelids like a bunch of grapes, and the shape of the eye is disfigured by this, and you wish to incise it, then the operation in that place is as we have recounted, that you enter the needle into the root of the uvea from the lower to the upper part, and then insert another needle with double thread from the lacrimal side, and let this penetrate and leave the first needle according to its position; then incise the place with the double thread and remove the part of the uvea in the circumference of the needle, and firmly grasp it.
And then remove the needle and place on the eye wool soaked in egg white and leave it until the thread comes out with the uva (grape-like part of the eye).
And then treat the eye with that which strengthens it until the wound is healed.
And sometimes, gathering from all sides with a circle of cloth, a large protruding swelling forms over the eye, and it is pierced with a thin probe that reaches the eye's edge, and the white fluid drains out, and the eye sinks down and immediately enters its socket.
And then hold it until it is healed.
Chapter 22.
Of the treatment of hawks.
This illness, called alconati, is nothing but a fluid that has collected in the eye, resembling descending water, but it is not that.
But the method of treatment is to have the patient sit on a prepared and straight seat, then take their head in your hands at two points and move it until you see the fluid coming to the parts below, and then let it dry and not descend, and stop the light, and the patient should see things as they normally do.
And if it does not descend, know that it is water.
But if the descent of the fluid is not prepared as we have said, then have the patient sit between your hands, and then take a subtle, fine sputa, and with it rub over the conjunctiva, a little near the junction of the conjunctiva with the cornea, (at the hollow part), until the fluid is expelled.
Therefore, when it is expelled, then you instill warm water into the eye, in which you have mixed honey or water in which you have boiled fenugreek and honey.
And then treat it with the other remedies until it is healed.
Chapter 22.
Of the treatment of water descending from the eye.
We have already discussed the types of water in the division, and which ones are appropriate to pierce with a sermo (or lancet) stating, then that according to the health.
Therefore, you should place the patient between your hands on a bed and tightly bandage the affected eye.
Then place your left hand near the eyelid of their affected eye, if the eye with the water is the left eye; or with your right hand, if the eye is the right eye.
And then, with your right hand (if the eye is the left eye), or with your left hand (if the eye is the right eye), take an almond.
And then place the tip of the almond near the eyebrow, along the thickness of the eyelid,  on the white part of the eye near the tear duct, and then gently press the almond with force and roll your hand with it.
And then penetrate into the white of the eye and feel that the almond has reached the hollow space.
And the distance from the almond to the place should be the distance between the pupil and the edge of the dark part of the eye – the eyebrow; for you will see the pupil of the eye with the vision of the eye through the clarity of the cornea.
And then place the almond in the location where the fluid is, and then pull it down a few times, and if the fluid descends quickly, then you will see the patient turning their sight quickly towards that which is now in the eye, and the almond is in its place.
And then rest for a little while; so if the fluid has descended, then you should rest again before the almond is removed.
And then, when it is dry and does not descend, you should extract the almond with ease, and gently rub it with your hand, and then dissolve a small amount of pure rock salt in water and wash the inside of the eye with it; and then place a bandage of cloth or a stopper or wool infused in rosemary oil and egg white over the eye and bind the eye with it.
But we and those of our time use a mixture of crushed cumin and egg white over that area.
And if your almond does not enter the eye easily because of its hardness — for in some people's eyes the eye is very hard — then it is necessary to take the ointment called *alberid*, of which the preparation is:
And thus, pierce that conjunctiva with it, and do not force your hand into the hole, but only make a subtle path for the almond to enter.
And then insert the almond as we have said.
And after completing your work, the patient should be placed in a well-made bed in a dark room, where they sleep on their back, and all movement should be forbidden.
And apply this to his body so that his nature may be calmed, and do not turn his head to either the right or left at all.
And let the ligature remain according to its disposition until the third day.
And then remove it in that dark room and remove the cold vision, and show him some things, and return the ligature until the seventh day.
And you should not do this during the time of the treatments or immediately after the infusion. Having this, you should avoid this, because water can easily be carried away by great and violent watching.
However, if a purulent abscess occurs, then you should remove the poultice before the seventh day, and treat it with whatever causes the abscess to subside.
Then you remove his vision, and place a mouth covering over his face through which his vision is controlled from below, for a few days, him being in the dark room.
And then gradually be brought out of that room and restored to his normal state.
And know that in a difficult case, the student is not excused from looking at it several times, and then you should be bold about the procedure.
And it has come to us from some who are at Artach, and someone said that a fire was made in Ayrac, a place where a magdaam was perforated through which water was drawn out.
However, I have not seen anyone in our land who has achieved this, nor have I read about it in any of the ancient books; and it is possible that this is something new.
And these are the forms of the species of magdaam, so that whoever is ignorant of them may understand them:
And they are made of iron or steel, properly, and their extremities are with this triangular subtlety, the pointed end thus like that is the shape.
Chapter 24.
Of the treatment of flesh growing in the nose.
When various fleshy growths appear in the nose, some of which are caused by something resembling a scorpion's stinger, or a fish-like polyp; and this illness is called polyps because it resembles that depicted fish. And of it is cancerous flesh, leprous, dark coloured; and of it is flesh like a lion, not dark in colour.
Therefore, in those fleshy growths that are not fraudulent nor cancerous, it is necessary that you place the patient between your hands, in the sun, and clean their nostrils, and pierce those growths with your lancet. And then pull that outwards, and then cut away what you have grasped of those with a sharp, thin spatula from one side until you know that all the flesh has been removed;  if any part of it remains from which further excision is possible, then cut that with one of the fine instruments easily until nothing more remains. But if it is swollen with blood or a hot abscess, then you apply what is appropriate; or if it is a malignant abscess, then you cauterize it until the blood is drained and all the cavities are cleared.
And then put vinegar and water, or wine, in the nose near the incision. But if the nose is open and moisture flows from it to the palate, then you know it is healed.
But if the moisture does not penetrate as it should, then you know that inside there is still corrupted flesh, or excess pus, on the bones of the nose to which the excision has not reached.
Therefore, then it is necessary to introduce a piece of lint to which some thickness is added, and place several pieces, placing the quantity of a finger or less between each piece.  Then, you should gently insert one end of the lint into the nose with a probe or other suitable instrument.
And after that is done, pull it [the lint] with its scent until it reaches the passages of the nose, and it comes out on his throat, for many times children in schools do this same thing, and it is an easy thing for whoever wishes to do it.
Then, place the two ends of the lint, one end coming out of the nose, and the other remaining inside the nose.  Then gently scrape away any flesh with the pieces of lint on the lint, and do so until you are sure all flesh is removed from the lint.
Then, remove the lint and place a poultice [or a compress] over the nose, near the area where the blood was removed, and do this for three days or longer until the poultice corrodes any remaining flesh.
And finally, place a lead cannula in the nose for a few days until it is healed.
But if you need a quicker cure, use this one.
And this is the form of the instrument for nose-blowing with which oils and medicines are distilled into the nose:
And make this of silver or brass, which should resemble a small, open lamp or a small shell, and the opening should be similar.
And if you wish, make a closed cannula like a tube, and the cannula of the nose-blowing instrument should be flat, uncovered; to which there should be a handle at its rear, with which you hold it when heating oil or water or other desired juices and subtle substances in it.
Chapter 25.
Of the ulcers found in the extremities of the nose.
Often a sore appears on the extremities of the nose, and it grows larger and worsens over several days until its condition is very noticeable.
And therefore, you should cut it out at the beginning of its appearance, and remove all of it. And then apply either a cautery or a burning medicine to the area.
However, if its removal is delayed until it has grown large, then consider if it is hardened, rough, dark-colored, and insensitive.  If so, do not touch it with iron, for it is a stubborn abscess; because often the one who cuts into this abscess may cause great harm to the person who had it.
And if the abscess is soft to the touch and not dark-colored, and if cutting into it is possible everywhere, then evacuate the patient and cut into it without fear, and treat the area with something that dries and constricts until it is healed.
Chapter 26.
Of the suture of the nose, lips, and ear, when the continuity is broken by plague or similar illnesses.
Know that when you encounter a break in continuity in one of these cartilages, you accomplish little in that operation unless you are a skilled practitioner.
Therefore, when you encounter any of these causes, consider if it is fresh plague with its blood, and if so, you should bring the two lips of the wound together with sutures, and then treat it until it is healed.
And if the edges of the break in continuity are already separated, and each is made whole, then you should scrape each part of its visible surface until blood comes out. And then bring the two edges together with sutures and tighten them, and sprinkle blood of dragon and crushed incense over them, and place a piece of diafinicon plaster, or another of the consolidating plasters, over the powder, and leave it bound for two or three days, and then remove it and replace the plaster, and leave it until the pus is separated, and then treat with ointment until healed.
But the method of suturing is that you join the break in continuity either with needles as we have recounted in the suturing of the abdomen, or join the break in continuity with glue as has been shown to you.
Chapter 27.
Of the removal of those things that come between the two lips in the inner parts.
Often, hard abscesses resembling grains of corn appear on the inner parts of some men's lips, and some of these are smaller and some are larger.
Therefore, you must turn back the lips and cut away each of those hardnesses from all sides, and then cauterize the area with a sharp cautery until the bleeding is stopped, and afterward wash the area with vinegar and treat it with something astringent until healed.
Chapter 28.
Of the incision of flesh adhering to the gums.
Often, flesh adheres to the gums, which the ancients called albulus.  Then you must detach it with a forceps or scissors, and cut it off at its base, allowing the pus or blood to drain.
And then apply a sharp cautery or other styptic or drying powders to the area.
And if that flesh returns, then cut it again, and cauterize it, for the cautery will now prevent its return.
Chapter 29.
Concerning the extraction of teeth with an iron instrument.
When on the surface of the teeth, both on the inner and outer portions, and between the gums, rough, hard, and sometimes dark, yellowish or greenish scabs form, and the gums are affected by this corruption, the teeth become loose.
And therefore, you should have the patient sit between your hands, place their head on your lap, and scrape the teeth where such scabs and similar gritty substances appear until nothing of them remains, removing the blackness, yellowing, and other discolorations until they are cleansed.
So if you have removed what was initially present in the process, good.  But if not, then you repeat the procedure on them the next day, and the second, and the third, until they reach the desired state.
And know that teeth require many different tools and shapes, according to what your procedure requires. And therefore, the scraper used to scrape the inner portion of the tooth is different from the scraper used to scrape between the teeth, in other forms, and these forms of scrapers must be prepared by you, which you will see soon.
Chapter 30.
Of the eradication of teeth.
You should treat the tooth's pain with all care and take your time in its complete eradication, for there is no cause that can replace its use when it is removed, for it is a valuable substance until it is extracted in the procedure of eradication.
However, when the patient needs that tooth extracted, you must be firmly certain which tooth is causing the pain, because many times the pain deceives the patient, suggesting it's in a healthy tooth, and you extract that one.  Then the pain does not cease until the diseased and painful tooth is extracted, for we have seen this through the practice of barbers.
Therefore, how should you be certain which tooth is painful, and knowing this, you should scarify the area around the tooth with a substance that has some medicinal virtue, until the tooth's connection to the gum is dissolved all around.  Then, carefully extract it with your fingers or with very fine scissors, little by little, until the tooth is loosened.
Then, if necessary use strong pliers for good grip or a strong lever, and place the patient's head between your knees to firmly hold them so they don't move. Then carefully pull out the tooth, in a straight line, in such a way as not to break it, and to not cause the patient any further pain.
And if it is not easily removed, then take one of those instruments, and place it beneath the tooth from all sides with ease, and apply force to remove it, as was done initially.
However, if the tooth is fractured or decayed, then you should cover the fracture with cloth and tightly wrap it with a thin piece of string so that it doesn't break when you apply the pliers.
And you must carefully scarify the area around the gum all around, carefully controlling your strength so you don't break it, and leaving a part of it attached.  Return to the patient carefully, so that the pain is not worse than the initial pain.
Beware that you do not do as some ignorant barbers do in their recklessness and audacity regarding extractions, without following what we have explained.  For many times they cause serious illnesses in people, which are harder to cure than if they were extracted correctly, with the roots of the tooth remaining whole, or some of the roots, or by pulling it out with parts of the jawbone, as we have witnessed many times.
And after the extraction, the mouth should be rinsed with warm wine or wine mixed with salt.
And if blood flows from this, as often happens, then place a small amount of alum and sprinkle it on the wound, and if that doesn't stop it, cauterize.
The shape of the forceps and delicate pliers, with which the tooth is initially grasped, should be long at the extremities, with a short and thick handle, so that they don't bend when using them.
And they should be like a thick handle so that when you tighten them, they don't bend, but have short extremities.
And they should be made of well-forged Indian iron with straight extremities, and on the ends of these are teeth that interlock and grip firmly with a strong constriction.  Sometimes the ends of these are shaped like the beak of a stork (or crane), that is, hooked, and are a strong grip.
Chapter 31.
Of the eradication of teeth and the extraction of bones from fractured jaws.
When you need to eradicate a broken tooth that remains for any reason, you should place a compress with a bandage on the area for a day or two until the area is softened; then insert forceps or pliers whose ends are shaped like the beak of a bird called a stork or crane (like forceps).
The ends of them (the forceps/pliers) are made smooth like a file or a rasp.
And if you do not succeed with these forceps or pliers, then you must dig into the root and expose all the flesh and insert the instrument called, well, a small lever whose shape is like this:
And it should have a short, thick end, and it should not be too thick so that it is not broken.
Therefore, if by this the root is completely loosened, it is good; and if not, use these other instruments, of which these are the shapes: the first instrument's shape is a triangular end with some thickness:
The shape of the second instrument is to have a triangular and more slender end.
And you will have helped with this instrument having two ramps whose shape is like this one after this: and with other instruments, which I will describe in a section on tooth extraction; for this instrument is useful, which resembles a large spoon, and this is its shape:
with a triangular, curved or short end, which has some thickness, and it should not be hollow so that it does not break.
And further know that the instruments for teeth are much like the other instruments.
But a skillful and subtle artisan in the art discovers for himself, according to what the operation and the various illnesses signify to him; for there are illnesses for which the ancients did not prescribe or use a specific instrument, due to the diverse forms of these illnesses.
However, if the bone of the jaw or other bones in the mouth are fractured, or if there is pus, then apply pressure to the fractured part in its place with what is appropriate from the instruments and forceps that we have described in the extraction of the roots of teeth, and help with a motion that is like this:
And there should be some small, gradual pressure applied, and it should be held or tightened with the mouth so that it does not escape or leak until the bone is completely set; then restore the area with appropriate medicines for this.
But if there is a small swelling on the bone, then cut away that swelling and its blackness, and treat it until it is healed.
Chapter 32.
Of the treatment of teeth that protrude above the others.
When teeth protrude beyond their natural alignment, and their form is unsightly, especially in women, and particularly in venerable young women; then you must consider: if a tooth is protruding against another tooth, and removal or binding is not possible, then remove it; but if it is not attached to another tooth, then you cut it with this instrument, whose shape is like a pig's snout; and it is made of Indian iron, with a very sharp point.
And make your incision so that you cut through the tooth's hardness over several days, and that it is not joined to the other teeth.
And if the protruding tooth is exposed for filing, then file it with an Indian iron file, of which this is the form:
And it should be entirely of Indian iron, easily sharpened; and it should have very small points, like the file used to make needles, with which the tooth should be filed little by little over many days with ease, so that no other tooth is joined and broken. And then bind it at the end, and remove its root with some razors.
And if a tooth has a broken part that cuts the tongue, then you must file it until the sharpness of that fracture is removed and smoothed, and it is filled so that the tongue is not injured and speech is not corrupted.
Chapter 33.
Concerning the restoration of broken teeth with gold or silver fillings.
When, due to a blow or impact, the teeth break or are displaced, and the patient cannot hold the missing portion, and your treatment with astringent medicines has not been successful, then, in order to fix those that are fractured, use gold fillings, and not silver, because silver turns green and begins to decay in a few days, whereas gold never changes.
And let the filling be of such fineness and thickness as is appropriate to the amount that can fit between the teeth; and the method of application is that you take the filling and place double its size between two sound teeth, and then you shape two curvatures of the filling between the fractured teeth, whether one or several, until you reach the sound tooth on the opposite side. Then repeat the placement until you reach the point where you started, and hold your hand with care and skill until it is secure.
And let your grip, with which you hold the filling against the tooth roots, be firm but not excessive.
Then cut off the excess ends of the filling with forceps or scissors, and place them in each gap with care, and shape them and conceal them between the healthy tooth and the fractured tooth so that they do not injure the tongue. And then leave it like that, tightly secured.
However, if it is loose or broken, secure it or them with another filling in such a way for all time.
And this is the method for teeth and the procedure for binding two healthy teeth and two broken ones, just as these are sometimes joined:
And when one or two teeth are returned to their proper place in the socket, and they are restored as we have described, and remain fixed.
And only skilled and knowledgeable artisans can do this.
And sometimes a piece of cow bone is prepared, shaped like a tooth, and placed in the socket where the tooth is missing, secured as we said, and remains in place and serves in that way for a long time.
Chapter 34.
Of the inflammation of the ligament which affects the tongue and prevents speech.
This ligament, which sometimes forms below the tongue, is either natural, present from birth, or accidental, arising from a wound that has already healed.
And the treatment for it is to open the patient's mouth, their head resting on your lap; raise their tongue, and then cut the nerve ligament along its width until the tongue is freed from its constriction.
However, if there is any hardness or knotting, and this is due to a healed wound, then you use a forceps and cut it along its width until you have severed the ligament and the knot is undone.
And be careful not to make a fissure in the flesh and to cut so deeply that bleeding occurs.
And then wash the incision site with water or vinegar or cold water; and then place a linen pad under the tongue; this is a compress that the patient must keep under their tongue every night so it does not heal again.
But if bleeding occurs, place powdered vitriol on the area; but if the bleeding continues, then cauterize the area with a blunt cautery appropriate for this. And then treat it with the other remedies until it is healed.
Chapter 35.
Of the extraction of a ranula (a cyst) under the tongue.
Sometimes a boil resembling a small grape develops under the tongue, hindering the tongue's natural function; and it grows significantly until it fills the mouth.
And the procedure involves opening the patient's mouth, sitting them facing the sun, and examining the boil.
And if you see it to be a dark colour, or black, hard, to which the patient feels no sensation, then do not touch that area, for it is cancer.
And if it is leaning towards white, in which there is moisture, then you place a lancet on it, and you cut it with a fine scalpel, and you sever it from all sides; and if blood comes out during your procedure, then you put crushed alum, or vitriol, over it until the blood stops.
And then return to your work until you have completely removed it, until it has been washed with sour wine and salt; and treat it with the further treatment for this until it is healed.
Chapter 36.
Of the extraction of abscesses from the ears, and of those that are in the throat, and of other abscesses.
When there is an abscess in the throat, these are glands that have come together, which have broken out and are called the tonsils; when you treat them with what we have said in the division and it is not healed, then you consider if the abscess is hard, dark-colored, and not very sensitive, then do not touch it with iron.
And if it is a reddish color and the root is thick, then do not touch it with iron for the sake of the flow of blood; before, let it ripen, and then either you will open it, or it will break open on its own.
And if it is white, smooth, and its root is subtle, then it is the one that should be incised.
And the procedure for it is that you consider, before your operation, if the abscess has already rested it with complete rest or if it has decreased with any reduction; and then make the patient sit facing the sun, and their head should be in your view, and open their mouth, and the attendant, taking between their hands, presses the patient's tongue down with a very noble instrument of which this is the form:
And it should be made of silver or bronze, and be thin like a knife.
So, as you press the tongue with it and the abscess is shown to you, and you apply your attention to it, then take an ounce and place it in the vessel, and pull it outward to the sides as much as you can. Furthermore, when you pull out any cause of the tissues, then cut that with an instrument of which this is the form:
Furthermore, when you pull out any cause of the tissues, then cut that with an instrument of which this is the form: and it is similar to forceps, but its ends are curved, so that the opening of each is opposite the other, very sharp, which should be of hardened iron.
But if this instrument is not present for you, then cut it with a scalpel of which this is the form: And it should be sharp on one side, blunt on the other side.
And after you have incised one opening, cut the other according to this same method of incision, and then the patient will recover from cold water.
However, if there is a flow of blood, treat it with water decocted from pomegranate rind or myrtle leaf and similar astringent remedies until the blood flow is reduced, and then care for it until healed.
And sometimes other abscesses appear near the throat or near those two ears, and cut them according to what I have said about the incision of two openings just now.
And I once treated a woman with an abscess that had formed in her throat, an abscess tending towards a dark color, with little sensitivity, which had already constricted her throat, and she was breathing with a constricted airway. She had already been forbidden from eating and drinking water, and she would have died if it had continued for another day or two.
And the abscess had grown so much that it had produced two ridges before it burst through two openings.
Therefore, I treated it surgically and placed a lancet on one of the openings, and pulled it out, and a large portion was pulled out.  Then I incised the opening that I knew connected to the other wound, and then opened the patient's mouth, and held her tongue down, and placed the lancet into the abscess.
And then I cut away a large portion of it, and only a little blood flowed from it. Therefore, the woman's throat was completely healed, and she immediately began drinking water, and then eating.  So, I did not stop cutting away from that abscess many times over a long period, and another abscess formed in that area, which I incised until it finally resolved.
Therefore, I managed to heal and cauterize the woman's throat, thus bringing about a cure; and then I wandered about and did not know what God had done through me on that occasion.
Chapter 37.
Of the incision of a boil when it is suppurating.
When a sore throat affects the uvula, and it is suppurating and long, then it is called a vertical sore throat; and if it is in the lower part, thick and round, then it is called a boil.
However, when it is cured with what we have said in the division, and you do not confirm your cure, and sometimes the boil that has already been treated and is small, then you should cut the one that is swollen and round; and if it is long, and is bloody, of a dark color or black, and is not painful, then you should test the incision, for in that there is fear for the patient.
And when you see it according to the way I have described, by its whiteness and length, you should have the patient sit down and press his tongue with an instrument that shows its shape, and then put the incision in the new one, and pull it down and cut it with one of the two instruments that are mentioned in the incision of two boils.
And you should only cut that which is joined to the natural boundary without addition, for if you cut more, you will injure the patient's speech.
And after the incision, use what we have described in the incision of two boils, and treat it until it is healed.
However, if the patient is frightened by the incision, you should use cauterization without fear, and the method of cauterization is only with sharp water.  You should position the patient's head on your lap, then press the tongue with the instrument we've described, and take the water, as described in the cauterization chapter, and apply it with a live ember.  Put it neither thick nor thin, and fill the concavity of the instrument, which has this shape:
The end of it should be concave, like the bowl of a spoon, and place the instrument with the medicine on the uvula.  The patient should lie on their side, so that saliva or mucus from the mouth is drawn by the medicine, so that no cause descends down the throat and damages it.
Then, apply your hand with the medicine and press it onto the uvula for half an hour until you see it blackened and settled by the medicine's action.
And if you wish, take cotton and wrap it around the end of the spoon, and soak the cotton in the medicine.  Then, insert the spoon with the cotton into a tube until the cotton adheres to the tube.  Do this repeatedly until you achieve the desired cauterization effect on the uvula.  Then allow it to dry and fall off after approximately three to four days.
And if you need to repeat the medicine, repeat it, and then, after cauterization, cleanse the area around the uvula with cotton soaked in broth.  Clean away any remnants of the medicine.  Wash with cold water, and treat externally with an embrocation and internally with remedies until healed.
And this type of treatment is safer than incision and less prone to fear.
Sometimes the uvula is cured with something more subtle than cauterization or incision, for it is treated with fumigation in this manner: take calamint, hyssop, origanum, rue, Arabic cicadas (likely a misspelling of "cicuta," a poisonous plant), chamomile, borage, and similar herbs, and mix all or some of them in a pot, then submerge them in sour wine and let them boil.  The pot should be securely sealed with a suitable lid, and a hollow, concave metal instrument should be placed in the middle of the pot, shaped in this manner; it should be made of silver or brass.
And place the end of the instrument into the patient's mouth until the vapor rises to the uvula through the instrument, until the uvula is significantly clouded.
And then repeat this many times until it's dry, and be careful not to perform this treatment at the start of an abscess, as it would only spread the abscess, and you shouldn't do this without the diagnosis of a mature abscess.
But if this instrument is not available, then take a reed and attach a hard-boiled egg shell to its end, so the patient's mouth is protected, because the egg shell prevents the vapor from burning the mouth.
And this treatment is good for health.
Chapter 38.
Of the extraction of thorns and things adhering to the throat and other such causes.
Often thorns or fishbones or some other thing adhere to the throat.
Then you should extract whatever of these is visible, upon which you focus your sight, after pressing the tongue with an instrument in front of a light, so that what is in the throat may be revealed to you.
And that which is not visible and hidden in the throat, you should make the patient vomit before the food is digested in the stomach, for if the cause stuck to the throat will be forcefully expelled by vomiting; or have the patient swallow a piece of bread or lettuce root or a piece of dry bread; or let the patient take a piece of dry sea sponge, tie it tightly with a cloth, and then have the patient swallow it, for as it reaches the place where the thorns are, it will be expelled. And further, take an eel and drink it with a cloth tied around it, and let it be placed inside and removed quickly; or take a leek and quickly put it in and quickly take it out.
But if it is not expelled by those methods we have mentioned, then use a lead instrument in this manner:
And let it be larger than a fingernail, and at its end be a cavity which you can easily insert into their throat.
And have them hold their head up, and be careful not to touch their throat bone, so that it does not hurt them, and with that push the bone or thorn, or have the physician do it with their hand.
But rather that the sick person themselves insert it, because of their knowledge of the location of the cause and push it downward, and pull their hand with the instrument upwards, all according to the amount which is prepared for them, until it is expelled.
Chapter 39.
Of the extraction of bloodsucker attached to the throat.
When a bloodsucker is treated with what we have described in the section on treatment with medicine and not with remedies, then consider the bloodsucker in the patient's throat toward the sunlight, after you have compressed the patient's tongue with the instrument we have described.
Therefore, if you see the bloodsucker, extract it with a small instrument or with subtle, skillful gestures.
And if it is not possible for you to remove it with that, then take a concave cannula and insert it into the patient's throat, and then place a heated iron in the concavity of the cannula, and do this repeatedly (until the bloodsucker is dead and detached from the throat) and keep the patient away from water all day.
And then take a vessel full of cold water, and open the patient's mouth and rinse the mouth with it; and let the patient not swallow anything and hold the water for another hour with your hand, because the bloodsucker, as soon as it feels the water, falls off.
But if it is not expelled by what we have described, then fumigate the patient with incense or asafoetida using the instrument we have described for fumigation of the uvula.
Do this, so that it falls off.
And another way of operating in the fumigation of that, is that you take a pan in which there are burning coals, and the pan is covered with a cover in the middle of which there is a hole, and the end of the instrument is placed in that hole; and then let the fumigation go; and let the patient place their mouth on the end of the cannula, and close their mouth so that the fumigation is not expelled until you know that the fumigation has reached the bloodsucker, for the bloodsucker will fall off as soon as it is reached.
And if it does not fall off, then you repeat the fumigation many times, and prevent the patient from drinking, and let them eat salty things and other foods, and do not let them drink water; and thus it is necessary that with this treatment it be expelled.
And this is the shape of the instrument with which the bloodsucker is treated when it is seen; and it is similar to forceps, in a similar way, except that it has some curvature. Which is placed on the bloodsucker, and its end is similar to a stork's beak, which is covered, on which is filed, so that when we grasp something, it does not slip.
Chapter 40.
In which is the summary of the discussion on abscesses and their incision.
Abscesses are of many kinds, in many ways, according to their appearance, each one discussed in this book.
And they are diverse in their puncturing and incision in two ways, of which one is through the nature of the abscess itself; and by what we grasp of the humors.
And the second way is according to the locations on the body where they occur, for an abscess in the head is different from an abscess in the buttocks; and an abscess in fleshy tissue is different from an abscess in a joint; and each has its own judgment for treatment.
And moreover, some abscesses should not be punctured until the pus has matured within them or they have reached fullness.
Some other abscesses should be lanced while they are inflamed and have not matured to their fullness, such as abscesses near joints, for when an abscess is near a joint, its presence prolongs until that which is in its vicinity has spoiled, and the ligaments or nerves of that joint are strongly corrupted, thus causing a contraction of that limb; or it is an abscess near a vital limb, and if you delay puncturing it until it has matured, it might harm the vital limb; or it is near the anus, therefore puncture it while unripe; and one should not pierce an unripe, incompletely digested one, but rather one near the anus, so as not to injure its lining and cause it to extend into the rectum, creating a fistula, or causing it to become permanently diseased. However, you must know the right time to pierce the abscess, and that is when it has matured.
And you know it has matured when there is a cessation of pain and fever, and a decrease in swelling and throbbing, and the sharpness of the abscess head, and the other signs.
And you must know that the incision should be made in the location of the pus, below the abscess and from the pus resulting from the healing of the elevation.
And the incision should always be made along the muscle or body tissue if the abscesses are in the parts of the hands or feet, and in the location of tendons, ligaments, nerves, or arteries; and, in general, in all places where there is no reflection; for in those areas that are reflective, use incision according to that particular limb.
However, when the abscess is in a fleshy area, it is better to let it be until the digestion of the area, according to the completion, has been confirmed, as we have said.  For if you incise it before, you prolong the course of its suffering and increase the amount of foul matter, and likely make the abscess walls harder and deeper.
But some abscesses are incised according to the width of the flesh or body tissue, due to necessity, or according to the requirements of the affected limb.
And you should administer a small incision for small abscesses, and a large, wide incision or multiple incisions for large abscesses, according to the varying size of the abscesses.
And others are abscesses where the pus pocket needs to be scooped out and incised, when done as described and the abscess is mature, like those occurring in clusters of boils and carbuncles.
And some are incised with an incision having three angles; and some are incised like a myrtle leaf shape, like abscesses of the armpits.
And some are treated with a circular incision and a crescent-shaped incision, and similar ones.
But those that are not like that, such as superficial lion-like abscesses, require you to pierce them with a superficial, or flat, incision only.
And when the abscess is large and has already collected much pus, you should pierce it and not be afraid to remove all the pus at once; after removing a portion, close the abscess until the next day, then remove a larger portion, and do this repeatedly according to a schedule until it is completely emptied.
Especially if the patient is weak, or a pregnant woman, or a young child, or an elderly, frail person, because the animal spirit is often weakened by the discharge of pus, and the patient is easily killed, and you open [the abscess] for them.
Observe this chapter with great care, and when you make the incision to open these abscesses, you must clean the wounds and then consider if the abscess wound is small, or a simple flat incision, then apply ointments of oil or old cloth; but if the abscess is large and the incisions are many, you must put a medicament in each hole until they meet together.
And if a part of the abscess wall has been cut away or hollowed out around its edges, you must fill it with old cloth or linen strips, as when you pull out bread dough or roots, without moisture; and keep that in place until the third day; and then, treat and heal it with appropriate ointments until it is healed.
But if you encounter a blood flow during your operation, then apply cool water and vinegar on a linen cloth, and place this over the bleeding area many times.
But if the bleeding persists, then you must apply the treatment and remedies that have been described in many parts of this book, and in its divisions.
But if it is wintertime, and the location of the abscess is close to many nerves, then you must mix powders in warm wine and oil, and apply that to the affected areas.
And if it is summertime, and the areas are fleshy, then you should apply powders mixed with water and oil, or with wine and oil, and keep it cool until the third day, as we have said. Then you must open the abscess, cleanse it, and apply the appropriate treatment until it is healed.
And this is what is necessary to know about the treatment of abscesses in general; however, according to the method of distinguishing each type of abscess, I have already described the specific treatment method for each in individual chapters.
Chapter 41.
Of the incision of abscesses that occur on the nape of the neck.
Small abscesses, and even some kinds of nodes, form on the nape of the neck, which contain tunics around them; and their various types are various.
And some of them contain pus, and some of that contain moisture similar to lime. And some contain moisture resembling dust, and similar to them; and some are stony, hard.
And in the incision of all of them, and in the extraction of those, there is no fear, as the extraction of those does not cause contrary harm.
The procedure for incising those is that you probe them with an instrument shaped like this, which is called a trocar, until you know what they contain.
If what it contains is moisture, then you cut it with an incision along the length, by a superficial incision, in this way:
And begin the incision at line B to line G.  Therefore, once the moisture is evacuated, then you scrape the skin that contained that moisture, and do not leave behind any cause for it, because it will often return if any cause remains.
Then soak cotton in Egyptian ointment, if available, and otherwise in water and salt; and fill the wound with that and leave it until the next day, because with this you corrode any remaining bits of that skin.
Then repeat applying Egyptian ointment to that cotton a second and third time, if needed, until you are confident that no remnants of the skin remain; then treat the wound with ointment until it is healed.
And if the abscess contains fatty nodes, then you cut it in this way: with an incision having the shape of a cross, and place hooks between the two edges of the incision and scrape it from every side, and exert your strength in extracting the membrane that contains it.
But if your effort encounters resistance, then do what I previously told you.
And similarly, do the incision and treatment for the calcified abscess as we have told you; and incision on a calcified abscess is easier, for it has little blood and little moisture.
And sometimes there are some of these abscesses, which are on the head in some men, in which there is no moisture at all.  The reason for this is that I once incised an abscess on the head of an old woman and found the abscess to be like hard, rough, white stone, which could not be broken, and if someone had struck it with that, it would have hurt them.
But in other abscesses that occur on the head besides this one, this is not the topic, like the abscesses that come to the heads of children and near the roots of the ears, but the incision of all of these should be a superficial incision.
And make the perforation in those from the lower part of them, so that the body is relieved of the pus towards the lower parts.
And then treat them with whatever is appropriate for their treatment.
Chapter 42.
Of the incision of scrofulas which occur on the neck.
Often these abscesses appear on the neck, under the arms, and in the armpits; and sometimes they occur in other parts of the body.
And those which occur on the neck, and many of them are generated among themselves, and every scrofula of them is within its own proper tunic, and thus, as in the nodes and abscesses of the head, as we have recounted.
And the types of these scrofulas are many, for some of them are stony, and some of them contain moisture, and some of them are malignant which do not yield to treatment.
Therefore, in that which you find to be well-disposed upon touch, whose manifest colour is similar to the colour of the skin, and is soft throughout, and is not attached to the neck's nerve, nor to the veins, nor to the arteries, and is not deep, you should incise it with a superficial incision from the upper part to the lower part of the body along the line from G to B, and drain it on every side, and spread the flaps of the skin with forceps, or with many forceps if necessary, as we have described for abscesses of the head, and extract it little by little.
And it is more important that the vein or nerve not be cut.
And if the pus is not very sharp, so that you don't use your hand with incision, or that it disturbs the patient, and that you do not cut what is not necessary to cut; for if you cut a vein or artery and your operation prohibits it, then put powdered vitriol or other powders which stop the flow of blood on the wound, and constrict the wound, and leave it until the sharpness of the abscess subsides and the wound softens and begins to suppurate. When the blood is separated (or removed).
Therefore, return to your operation until you have completed it.
And now you should check with your index finger if there are any other small sores/tumors, then incise and clean them.
And if a large vein is at the root of the swelling/sore, then you should not cut that swelling/sore from its root. Before that, you should tie it (the swelling/sore) with a tightly folded bandage and leave it until it falls off on its own without harm.
And then fill the wound with old wool, which you have already soaked in Egyptian ointment, and then heal it.
And if you cut the entire swelling/sore, then you should bring together the two edges of the wound and stitch it as soon as there is no excess fluid left.
But if you see that there is remaining excess fluid due to the size of the swelling/sore, then you should understand that you need to cut the root of that, and remove that and administer stitches and the other things that were said.
And for those swellings containing moisture, pierce it with a superficial incision where you see the place of maturation, and place the incision where the pus descends from the body, as we have said.
And then administer a poultice, some with ointments and similar things, so that it corrodes what remains of the corruption. And then, when you see the wound already cleansed, you should heal it with a flesh-generating ointment until it is healed.
Chapter 43.
Of the incision of the boil of an abscess that has occurred near the windpipe.
The ancients said this incision should be made on the boil, and no one in our land has seen it done.
And this is the written record of their teachings.
However, in people with back pain, the extraction of the boil should be avoided, as it will not be beneficial because all the veins and major blood vessels of the patient are located there.
However, in those who have hot abscesses in the mouth, windpipe, or ears, when the disease is not in the throat, one should use the incision of the boil to avoid the damage caused by cauterization.
Therefore, when we want to do this, we should incise the boil below the three or four circles of the boil's surrounding skin, with a small incision in the space between two circles.  The incision should be made in a circular fashion, not in the cartilage, as this spot is suitable for the incision because it lacks flesh and its blood vessels are further away.
And if the physician is cautious, then he should gently extend the membrane of the windpipe with a probe, and then cut the membrane until he reaches the canal, but avoid the blood vessels if he sees any.
And then cut the boil circularly as we described; and the incision on the canal is signaled by the pus that flows out from the ruptured area, and by the loss of voice.
And leave the wound open for a time.
Therefore, when the time has come in which the perforation is feared, bring together the two edges of the membrane of the wound and stitch them together, excluding the cartilage.
And then administer medicines that promote the growth of flesh until it is healed.
And Albucasis says that the summary of the procedure we have described, the explanation, is nothing more than to observe whether some of these abscesses have already blocked the patient's throat, and the patient has succumbed to death, and their breath is cut off, and some will then cut the epiglottis so that the patient breathes over the site of the wound for some respiration and so be saved from death.
And for that reason, I command leaving the wound open until the corruption of the illness is consumed; and this corruption lasts for three days; and then, at that time, I will command closing the wound, and treating it until it is healed.
And what I myself have seen is that a servant took a knife and inserted it into her throat and cut a part of her lung's airway with it, and I was called to treat her, and I found her breathing like a dying person, and I uncovered the wound and saw that little blood had come from the wound.
Therefore, I was told that she had not cut a vein or artery, and the wind escaped from the wound, and I treated her until she was healed.
And it did not happen to the servant if she did not have trouble with her voice, and after a few days, she returned to a better state of health.
And now I say that there is no fear in the treatment of epilepsy.
Chapter 44.
Of the incision of an abscess which occurs in the throat outside, and is called a hernia of the throat.
This abscess, called a hernia of the throat, is a large abscess according to the color of the body, and is common in women.
And it is in two ways, for it is either natural or accidental.
And in the natural case, there is no cure.
And the accidental case is in two ways, of which one is similar to fatty lumps, and the other way is similar to an abscess caused by the blockage of an artery, and in that case there is fear (of serious consequences). And one should not make an incision with an iron on it unless it is small. And you should test and investigate it with the probe, and if you find it similar to a fatty lump, and it is not connected to any of the veins, then you incise it like lumps, and extract whatever contains it from the skin and bandage; and if not, then the entire nature of the condition must be examined, and then treat the area with whatever treatment is necessary until it is healed.
Chapter 45.
Of the incision of the types of lumps.
There are many types of lumps, and I have already mentioned all the types of them in the division.
And it is necessary that I recount the difference between a lump and a fistula, as there is doubt.
Therefore, I say that with a fistula, there is heat, fever, and intense pain until the ebullition of the superfluity is calmed; and when the putrefaction is complete, the fever, pain, and heat cease.
However, with a lump, there is no heat, fever, or pain, and it resembles that particular lion which is in a proper pouch.
And it is according to the color of the body, and its beginning is like a boil and is made like a bladder, whether larger or smaller, and there are two types, either fatty and containing moisture, and the colours of moisture are many, according to what I said in the division.
Therefore, when you reach the treatment of a lump, you should investigate it from the start with the instrument called an *intromes*, as its form will be in the chapter following this one.
And it is a method of investigating abscesses and all lumps, and it is that you take this instrument and insert it into the moistest spot you find in the abscess, and you will rotate your fingers with it little by little until you know that the instrument has already penetrated the membrane.
And then, place your hand according to the size of the abscess, and then remove the *intromes* and consider what has come out on its surface.
And if the running moisture, of whatever color it may be, is expelled, then you cut it with a superficial incision, as I have said in other abscesses.
And if there is no moisture on the surface where the *intromes* touched, then know that it is fatty (or greasy).
And dry it with an incision in the shape of a cross, following this form: In the manner I have shown you, and suspend it with hooks, and carefully remove the skin from all sides, and if possible, keep the skin or sac over it and extract the pus with the forceps.
But if it breaks during the operation, it's not possible to extract the pus completely, and often this happens. Then you extract it piece by piece until nothing remains.
For if any part, small or large, remains, the forceps will return to the pus.
And if you see any small part remaining, then fill the wound with some sharp, corrosive powders, and tightly close the wound, and apply a poultice of hot, cauterizing substance, and heal it with the other remedies until it is cured.
And if it's a large wound, then you stitch the two edges together and treat it with what promotes healing.
But if there is a pulsating vein there, or one that isn't pulsating, then you cauterize and fill the area with crushed vitriol, and leave it there for two or three days until the wound might calm down and the blood's boiling subsides.  Then return to probing the wound.
Chapter 46.
Of the types of instruments necessary for cutting and piercing.
Of those which are the types of probes, and these are of three kinds, some are large, some are mid-sized, and some are small.
The form of the large probe is this:
The form of the small probe is this:
They should be made of iron, or bronze, with properly sharpened ends, so that they can easily enter abscesses.
And these are the forms of experienced practitioners, and they are called probes, and one of them is called a lancet.
And there are three types, for some are large, medium, and small.
The form of the large probe, its shape:
The form of the medium probe, its shape:
The form of the small probe, its shape:
It is appropriate that they [the probes] be used for those abscesses, fistulas, and buboes, because within those are bones and other things.
And those [probes] are made round, thick, pointed, like large needles with which saddles are stitched, and are made of citrus wood, or of horn, or iron, or silver.  And the best are those made of citrus wood.
And the probes are made of black lead, which it is agreed that through them fistulas are opened in whose cavities are reflections, which are reflected with their lightness through those reflections.
And they are of three kinds, for some of them are long, and others are medium, and others short, according to the amount of the fistula's width and its constriction.
Shape of the large lead probe:
Shape of the medium lead probe:
Shape of the small lead probe:
The shapes of the hooks are of many kinds, for some of them are simple, having only one curve, and are of three types: large, small, and medium.
And of them are also hooks with no teeth, and they are of three types.
And of those are hooks with two curves, and they are of three types.
And of them are also those with three curves, and they are of three types.
And all these are necessary in their place.
Form of a small simple hook, its form:
Form of a large hook with two curves: Form of a medium-sized hook with two curves: Form of a small hook with two curves:
Form of a large hook with three curves:
Form of a medium-sized hook with three curves:
And these are the forms of scalpels with which nodes and abscesses are cut and scraped, and there are three types, for there are large, medium, and small ones.
Form of a large scalpel:
Form of a medium-sized scalpel:
Form of a small scalpel:
The edges with which the incision is made are sharp, and the other edges are blunt, and they are not placed in such a way that the scraping of the nodes is done gently to avoid cutting a vein or nerve, so that the patient is healed and finds a little tranquility because of the burning sensation experienced around the scraping of the abscess.
And these are the forms of lancets, and they are of three types: large, medium, and small, as you will see.
They should be made of bronze and are similar in shape to a ray, with which alcohol is applied.
And it is at the pointed end hidden with a spatula, and in that it runs in parts inside and out, as you wish, as you see.
The forms of spatulas, which are hidden between the fingers near the opening of abscesses and are not perceived by the patients, and are of three types: large, medium, and small. And these are the forms of those:
The shapes of cupping glasses, with which the flow of blood is drawn, are of three types: large, medium, and small; their forms are:
They are made of citrus wood, round with some length, and are thin.
And it is necessary that these types of cupping glasses – large, medium, and small – be available, so that by means of them the flow of blood can be drawn quickly when needed, and then, at first, there is no medicine.
However, do not use them to draw blood from every part of the body, but only on fleshy areas, such as the muscles of the legs and thighs, the muscles of the arms, breasts, abdomen, and knees, and similar fleshy, moist areas.
And sometimes other small instruments like the skins of bladders are made from these, following this shape; by which blood is drawn when performing phlebotomy, or by incision of a vein or artery.
And sometimes they are made round, according to this form:
Chapter 47.
Of the treatment of male breasts that resemble those of women.
Sometimes the breasts of some men become swollen during sleep as they are beginning to grow hairy, and the breasts swell, resembling those of women, and become inflamed, painful.
And whoever sees this, should make incisions on those areas using a crescent shape, from the line of B to the line of G, and then scrape away all the swelling, then fill the wound with a flesh-healing medicine, and stitch the two edges of the wound together, and treat it until it is healed.
But if the nipple extends downwards and is softened by its size, as in women, then it should be split into two, with two crescent-shaped incisions, each contained within the other, such that the larger line encompasses the smaller, following the form of the lines B and G.  Then scrape away the tissue which is between the two edges of the wound, and remove the excess fat, and apply the previously mentioned suture and powders as necessary for treatment, until healed.
And if you do not complete the incision necessary due to the patient's discomfort or blood flow, then fill the wound with cotton soaked in a corrosive ointment, and leave it until it has corroded away any remaining fat, and then treat it until healed.
Chapter 48.
Of the puncture of abscesses that come from under the armpit.
These abscesses arising from under the armpit are a type of scrofulous, hard lump, which contains a pouch-like skin.
And some of these contain moisture; and those containing moisture should be incised with a lunar section along this figure: from line G to line B.  And when all the pus within the abscess has been evacuated, then you should fill it with old cloth and leave it until the next day.
And then the cloth should be removed and the wound treated with a suitable ointment until it is healed.
And if the abscess is of the type of nodes or of the scrofulas, then you should incise it in the same way as we described in the section on scrofulas as well.
And if the plague has spread to the point of ulceration, then apply a cautery to it as we previously described.
Chapter 49.
Of the incision of abscesses that occur from arrow wounds or vein wounds.
When an arrow wound is inflicted, and the surrounding tissue has become consolidated, often an abscess develops.  And the signs by which it is known that inflammation and abscess are from an artery or a vein: for when the abscess is from an arrow wound, it is long and drawn out along the body; and when you press the abscess with your fingers, you feel a creaking sensation there.
And the one caused by a vein wound is round and apparent on the body's surface.
And incision on this abscess is a mistake, especially if it is beneath the armpits, in the joints, in the neck, and in many other places on the body; and it is very dangerous, so its cure with iron should be avoided, and those on the extremities or head must be avoided.
But for those abscesses caused by inflammation of the arrow wound's opening, make a longitudinal incision into the surrounding tissue; and then open the incision with hooks and remove the arrow, and clear away the tissues until it is exposed.
And then insert a needle and make it penetrate to the other side, and pull the arrow out with a double-threaded cord in two places—which I learned from a teacher in the extraction of two arrows from Templars.
And then prick the area between the two ligaments with a spatula until all the blood is drawn out, and the abscess is dissolved.
And then administer treatment where pus is generated until the ligaments fall away; and then treat it with appropriate ointments until it is healed.
And if the abscess is due to a cut vein, then you should hold with your hand whatever part of the abscess is accessible from the surrounding area. Then, insert a needle below the area you are holding, and make it penetrate; and use a double-thread through it, until you extract it from the other side. Then, tie up the abscess with a ligature, as I have taught you regarding the grape-vine ligature, in two places with two ends of the thread.
But if you fear pulling out the thread, then insert the thread with the needle below the entire abscess, beneath the initial incision of the first needle, and tighten your thread in four places.
Then dry the abscess in the middle of the affected area until what's within it is released; then you cut away the excess flesh, and leave what's there bound.
And then place a poultice, soaked in wine and oil, on the area, and then administer the treatment made with herbs and ointments until it is healed.
Chapter 1 of the abscess that occurs due to nerve twisting.
Thus, abscesses occur in the arteries and veins, and similarly, abscesses occur in the nerves when they are injured by impact or excessive strain, and similar causes.
And it is most likely to occur in the area of the tendons or heel, or in any place where the joints are strained.
And it is a serious abscess, and it is similar in color to the rest of the body, and it is in the majority of cases without specific symptoms, and when it is severe and intense, the patient experiences a sensation of numbness.
And it is not an abscess spreading through the body, and therefore it is contained, and it is painful throughout and does not extend to the front or back parts of the body.
Therefore, those that are in the joints should not be lanced with an iron instrument, for this will easily cause contraction.
However, that which is on the head or forehead can be lanced with a lance. But if the abscess is small, then cut it out with forceps and remove it from the roots.
And if it is large, then suspend it with hooks, and scrape it, and then remove it; and close the wound with stitches, and treat it until it is healed.
Chapter 11.
Concerning the incision of an abscess that occurs in the part that corresponds to the belly.
Often, in the abdomens of certain individuals, and in other parts of their bodies, there are growths that are called fungi by resemblance to fungi, whose roots are subtle and whose heads are large; and their edges are bent inwards, and they vary in size, being sometimes small, sometimes extremely large.
And I have seen one, and in his belly were two growths that were more like fungi, and there was no difference between them, both being white with fine roots.
And their edges were inverted and split open, and moisture flowed from them constantly.
Therefore, I incised them and found one to be eighteen inches in length and the other six inches.
And the procedure for their incision is this:  Consider if the patient is weak and the color of the growth is white, moist, with fine roots.  Then you should make the incision with a broad scalpel. Have cauterizing irons nearby, heated in the fire, because often much blood is released during the cutting. If you notice blood flow, cauterize the area.
And if the patient is fearful and anxious, avoid incising with iron; instead, take freshly made lead solder and bind the growth with it, in the manner previously described. Leave it on for two days.
And then, tighten the lead thread firmly; thus, do not cease tightening the lead on the growth until it is severed and falls away of its own accord without effort.
But if the growth has thick roots, then in its incision there is some cause for fear and anxiety, especially in one located in the abdomen.
However, it is possible to cut it in half, and then cauterize the area to prevent it from returning.
And then treat it until the wound is healed.
And be careful not to presume to cut a growth that is dark in color, with little feeling, and of slow growth, for that is possibly cancerous.
And I will bring a remedy for cancer to address this.
Chapter 52.
Of the treatment of swelling of the navel.
Swelling of the navel is caused by various things; either by fissures in the diaphragm which is over the abdomen, and from which tissue or intestine protrudes as in other ruptures; or by blood flowing from a vein or artery, as previously mentioned; or by trapped wind within it.
However, if it is due to a fissure in the diaphragm and the protrusion of tissue, then the color of the abscess is similar to the color of the body; and it is painless, and appears in various locations. And if it is due to the extrusion of the intestine, then its location differs greatly from what we have described, and when you press it with your fingers it is concealed, and then returns; and it is very light in that location, and is noticeably elevated above the entrance to the bath and causes considerable distress.
But if it is due to moisture, then it is painless and is not hidden when you press it with your hand, nor is it constricted, nor is it swollen.
And if it is due to blood, then the abscess appears with the characteristic sign of a darkening.
But if it is due to dead flesh, then the abscess is serious, large, and hard, and is lodged according to a certain quantity.
But if it is due to wind, then the touch of it is painless.
And the treatment in such a case is to consider whether the swelling near the navel is due to blood from an artery, or a vein, or wind; in which case you should avoid treating it, for in that there is fear and dread, just as you have been taught in the chapter where I discussed abscesses caused by an artery and a vein.
And if the swelling at the navel is due to the intestine or the mesentery, then you should instruct the patient to hold their breath and be standing upright; and then feel around the entire navel with a probe, and then direct them to lie on their back between your hands, and then encircle the navel with a wide spatula around the area marked by the probe; and then elevate the half of the abscess upward with a large forceps; and then bind around the circumference with strong thread or linen in a proper manner of ligation.
And then open the middle of the exposed abscess over the ligament and introduce your instrument into that opening and search for the intestine; and if you have found and held the intestine by the ligament, then you extract it gently and push the intestine back into the abdominal cavity.
And if you have found the mesentery, then take it with forceps; and cut away the excess tissue.
But if it is an artery or vein, then encircle that spot, and then return to your procedure; and take two needles and put strong threads in them and insert the two needles into the circumference you made around the abscess in the form of crosses, making them penetrate; and then compress the abscess in four sections over the needles.
And if you wish, remove the needles and allow the exposed flesh to soften and fall away on its own; or cut away that portion once it has softened, and then treat the area with appropriate ointments until it is healed.
And if the swelling around the navel is due to flesh protruding or moisture, then you must open the abscess as we have described and remove the blood or moisture that you find there, and then treat it with appropriate remedies to consolidate the area.
Chapter 53.
Of the treatment of cancer.
We have already discussed, in the division, the types of cancer and how it is treated with medicine, and that iron is inappropriate for treatment because it does not heal the ulcer; and we have discussed cancer that arises in the mother and the precautions in treating it.
And the ancients said that sometimes cancer is in a place where it is possible to eradicate it, like cancer that is in the breasts or the groin, and similar growths located on the limbs, especially when it is small and in the beginning stages.
But when it is old and severe, it is not advisable to try to remove it, for I have not been able to cure it in any way, nor have I seen another who has achieved this.
And the operation, when it is located as we have said, is that you should first let the patient rest and cleanse them of black bile sometimes, and then bleed them if a noticeable congestion is found.
And then prepare the patient with the preparation in which the affected area is located for surgery, and then introduce hooks appropriate to the location; and then carefully scoop out with a spoon-like instrument to thoroughly search until no root of the cancer remains. And allow the blood to flow, and do not cut it lightly, and express the places, and wipe away the thick blood with your hand or an instrument that is at your disposal.
But if you encounter difficulty with thick blood, from a vein or artery incision, then cauterize it until the blood flow stops, and then treat it with other remedies until it is healed.
Chapter 148.
Of the treatment of dropsy.
We have already recounted, in the division, the types of water dropsy, and the symptoms of each type, and the treatment of them with medicines.
And that which is cured with iron is only the type of "althitas" (a type of dropsy), alone, and it is not treated with iron for the type of "timpanistres" (another type of dropsy) or the type of "yposarcha" (another type of dropsy), for that is fatal.
And when you have treated this type of tympanistres dropsy with medicines and your treatment doesn't improve it, then consider that if the patient is already weakened, or has another illness, such as another type of dropsy, or has a chest or abdominal illness, or similar to those, then be careful not to treat it with iron, for there is a fear of that.
But if you see the patient with an exuberant condition, and it is only dropsy and not another illness, and the patient is not a child nor an old person, then the method of treating them is that you raise the patient in your arms, and have an assistant press the patient's belly with their hand, expelling the water from below the ribs, and then apply a pointed instrument in this way:
It should be two-pronged, sharp, with a sharp tip like a lance, but nonetheless, let it be somewhat small and gradually shorter so that when you use it in the procedure, you do not pierce the intestines, and injure the patient.
And then consider if the dropsy originates from the intestines, for if so, you must, with the incision, move away from the navel by three fingers to the lower regions, to the right side over the ribs.
But if the dropsy originates from a liver ailment, then your incision should be to the left of the navel by three fingers.
And if its origin is from the spleen, then your incision should be on the right side.
And your incision should not be on the side where the patient will lie, lest the excess fluids run to that constricted area.
And then pierce the entire membrane with the instrument, and then insert into that incision, and lift your hand with a spatula between the membrane and the flesh, and scrape that; and if [the thickness is] the amount of a fingernail or thereabouts.
And then pierce the flesh until the spatula reaches the empty space, and that is the location of the water. And then extract that and insert an instrument of which this is the shape: and it resembles a fine silver cannula; it is made of silver or brass or lead, on which, at its lower part, is a small hole, and on its sides are three holes: two on one side and one on the other side; and its tip is sharpened in the manner of a feather, as you see.
And at its uppermost end is a little stopper, for when the instrument reaches the water, then that immediately closes over the instrument, so as to drain a medium amount of water, for if you drain more than is necessary at that time, the patient is strongly likely to die from the resolution of their vital spirit, or they will suffer a stroke leading near to death.
But drain it according to the amount indicated by its power and according to the indications given to you by the patient's condition, the strength of their pulse, and their general well-being.
And then remove the instrument, and retain the water – the reason for this is that it is immediately retained by the stopper that closes the hole above the part of which I have instructed you to puncture in this manner.
And then repeat the procedure the following day, if the patient tolerates it, and drain a small amount of water, and do this for several days with caution, and be careful of mistakes until only a little water remains.
But if you fear for the patient, and leave a large amount of water, then cure it by burying [the patient] in hot sand, and inducing sweating through bathing, and waiting in the sun for a long time; and cure it with drying medicines until it is healed.
And cauterize on the stomach, the spleen, and the liver after the draining of the water, as I have described in what precedes.
Chapter 55.
Of the treatment of children born with unperforated urinary passages.
Sometimes, a child is born from its mother's womb and the opening of its urethra is not perforated (or is a very narrow opening or not in its proper place).
Therefore, it is necessary to try to perforate it as soon as it is born with a very thin probe, following this method:
And then insert a thin lead pin into the opening, and leave it in place for three days or four.
And when it wants to urinate, it will be able to urinate; and then remove it.
And if you do not insert the lead, it is possible that the urine, which collects over the area, will not allow the opening to close.
But that of which the opening is narrow should be treated with a lead pin, as we have said, for many days until it is widened.
However, in those cases where the opening is not in its proper place, as described, and the cause is one of those where the opening is near the end of the penis's head, preventing urination within the parts, it is necessary to raise the penis with the hand to the upper parts.  This is not a generative issue, therefore the semen cannot reach the female according to the proper path, and is a very prolonged illness.
And the method of the operation in this case is to lay the patient on their back, and then pull the head of the penis with your left hand forcefully, and incise the foreskin from the opening with a sharp blade, like cutting a quill, or any other method needed, so that the opening returns to the proper place in the head of the penis as it should be.
And be careful during your surgical procedure, because frequently there's bleeding; apply something to stop the bleeding and treat the wound until it heals.
Chapter 56.
Of the whitening which occurs on the foreskin on the head of the penis, and of its corruption, blackness, and adhesion to the head of the penis.
Often this whitening occurs on the penis and is an eminence of loose flesh.
And of that one is malignant and the other is non-malignant.
Non-malignant, you should suspend it with a fine thread and cut it off until it is all gone; then apply a cloth soaked in Egyptian unguent; and then treat it with diaphinct unguent until it is healed.
And if the whitening is malignant, of a foul color, then you must apply cautery near its incision and its root.
But if the whitening is on the foreskin of an uncircumcised penis, and part of the whitening is inside the foreskin and another part is outside, then you must remove the whitening that is inside at the beginning until it is consolidated; and then treat the part outside, for when you treat both at the same time, you cannot be sure that the foreskin won't tear.
And if you observe blackness and corruption in the genitals and foreskin, then you must scrape away everything that has blackened and is about to rot or is already rotten; and then apply a paste made of honey mixed with ground pomegranate bark and crushed, sifted herbs.
And then treat it with the other treatment until it is healthy.
But if there is a flow of blood, then apply a lunar cautery according to this method:
for a helpful cautery is suitable for two conditions together, that is, for a flow of blood and for a plague when it is corrupted.
And if the head of the penis is eaten away and destroyed at once, then you must insert a lead cannula into the opening of the foreskin so that the patient can urinate through it.
In the adhesion of the foreskin to the head of the penis (and this adhesion only occurs in those whose foreskin is healthy, and circumcision is not required; and when adhesion occurs due to a plague or an abscess) you must scrape with a blunt spatula until the ligament is dissolved and the head of the penis is freed from all sides.
And if it is difficult to separate them precisely, then you must scrape with a spatula some part of the head of the penis and the foreskin, and this is because the foreskin, when thin, is easily perforated due to its thinness.
And then separate the foreskin from the head of the penis with thin strips of linen, which have already been soaked in cool water so that they do not adhere again.
And then treat it with astringent wine until it is healed.
Chapter 57.
Of the cleansing of children and the treatment of what happens to them during circumcision.
Circumcision is not a simple break in the skin like other wounds; however, since it's a procedure done by us, with our will, and specifically done on children, it's necessary that we assign the best and easiest procedure to achieve healing.
Therefore, I say that the ancients did not describe circumcision in any of their books, because they didn't use it in their laws, and it is only because we have acquired it through experience that I have found most craftsmen and barbers use circumcision and cleansing with a razor and other instruments, and use a bandage with thread and incisions with a fingernail.
And I have already tested all these methods, and I find no better cleansing with scissors and a thread bandage than cleansing with a fingernail, because often the wound heals from the outside, for the foreskin has two layers, and the inner layer is left behind, and force is needed for another incision which causes more pain. And with the cleansing done by application, and which is digital, as used by shoemakers, the incision of the end of the male member is not secure, because force is easily applied to the opening.
But in the procedure using a fingernail, it is easy to cause bruising and spoil the procedure. And the foreskin of a child is naturally short, and often born in such a way that it doesn't need cleansing, and I have seen that.
But the cleansing done with scissors and a thread bandage, the goodness, experience has shown me, because the scissors are for a proportional incision, since the sharpness on top is as much as the sharpness below; and therefore when you place your hand, there are two proportional sharpnesses, and it cuts according to a comparison in one moment; and a compression of the thread is done, shaping the foreskin of the penis in all directions, which prevents any mistake at all.
And the first way of the operation is that you should have the child held still, especially if they are one who understands little, so you should merely tie the thread to their penis and leave it there until the next day.
And then do this to make him happy in whatever way is possible for you to do, to receive his intelligence. And then have him remain still between your hands, carefully and quietly; and hide the scissors in your hand or under your foot, so the child does not see them or any other instruments.
And then place your hand on his penis and blow on the foreskin, and pull it back until the head of the penis is visible, and then clean that of any dirt that has accumulated.
The shape of the scissors for cleaning, this is the shape:
One end should be blunt and the other sharp, so that the nail's stem doesn't come out, and the length of both blades should be like the length of two handles, in addition.
But the mistake in the cleansing process is that too much of the inner foreskin, or part of it, is pulled away from the incision.
Therefore, you should spread that area of yours with your finger before the suppuration of the area and cut it along the equal part.
And if you can't hold it with your finger, then pull it out with forceps and cut it.
But if three days have passed, and that which is swollen under the penis remains suppurating, then you leave it until the suppuration has subsided, and gently drain it, and cut it as you have prepared.
And be careful of the head of the penis, for that will not benefit him.
And therefore treat it with what consolidates wounds from the powders we have described in the treatise on powders.
And if it is cut from the bone excessively, and you harm the surrounding parts, that will not benefit him.
And further treat it with what we have said until it is healed.
Chapter 58.
Of the treatment of urine retained in the bladder.
Retention of urine in the bladder is caused by blockage, either by stones or by congealed blood, or by pus or by flesh, and similar to those things that we have previously discussed regarding methods of treatment in the division.
And if it is not dissolved with what we have discussed, and a violent cause is acting upon the patient, then it is necessary to administer extraction with an instrument called a syringe, which has this form: It should be made of silver and have a subtly curved cone, like the quill of a bird's feather, with a slender, long, pointed end, about a palm and a half long, to which a small tube is attached at its tip.
And the method of extracting the urine with this is to take a folded sheet, and tie wool or cotton to one end for good binding; and insert the folded end of the sheet into the lower part of the syringe, and cut off any excess wool with shears, but insert it into the tube forcefully.  Then, coat the syringe with butter and egg white.
And have the patient lie on their back, and apply moist ointments, olive oil and water to the bladder and the penis.
Then gently insert the syringe until it reaches the base of the penis; then bend the penis upward towards the pubic area; then push the syringe into that; and then push it further until it reaches the bladder, and that shows the patient has reached the empty cause, and this is not done in this order, but [rather] in the meatus, which has a tortuous path.
Then pull out the sheet with the wool little by little, for the urine will soak the wool.
Then remove it and use the urine for treatment, and keep using the syringe until the bladder is emptied and the patient finds relief.
Chapter .lix.
Of the quality of bladder irrigation with a clamp and similar instruments that are suitable for this.
When an ulceration or abscess occurs in the bladder, or congealed blood is present, or the bladder is constricted, and you wish to distill water and medicines into it, then use an instrument called a *clampcedra* (or similar), and this is its form:
but its extremity is closed, that is, sealed. And in that (closed extremity) there are three holes: two on one side, like a 'V'.
At the beginning, there is a concave space, in which what is expelled is contained, and it should be according to the quantity that fills it, without addition, so that when any cause draws the humidity, it is drawn in, and when expelled, it is drawn in, and when expelled far, as the clampcedra with which naptha is introduced into naval battles.
Therefore, when you wish to introduce humidity into the bladder, insert the extremity of the clampcedra into the humidity, and draw with it that which is pushed towards the upper parts, for the humidity is drawn into the concavity of the clampcedra.
Then insert the extremity of the clampcedra into the penis as we have described in the *ciringua*; and then push the humidity with that which you push, for that humidity will reach the bladder immediately, and the patient will be cured from that.
Form of the subtle instrument with which the bladder is cured, and this is the form:
And it should be made of silver or lead, of which the head, the highest part, should resemble a small feather, and below it a channel inside it.
And then take a bladder, and put into it the humidity that you want to cure in the bladder, and then tie it between two with a strong ligature with a double thread, and heat that humidity over the fire.
And then insert the tip of the instrument into the penis.
And then press your hand over the bladder with the humidity, with a downward pressure, until the patient feels that the humidity has reached the bladder.
But if you do not have a bladder, then take a piece of parchment and make a circle from it; and pierce it all the way through its entirety; and then insert strong thread into those holes, turning it as you go; and then assemble the circle as if it were a container, so that you can put in the moisture, oils, and liquids you need.
And then you tie that to the instrument and do with it as you did with the bladder, and squeeze with your hand until the moisture reaches the bladder.
Chapter 60.
Of the extraction of stones.
We have already discussed in the division the types of stones and their treatment with medicine, and the difference between stones generated in the kidneys and stones generated in the bladder, and the symptoms of each.
And we have discussed the stones in which the operation is done by hand, and by incision.
And the stone generated in the bladder properly is the one that is lodged within the bladder.
And I am narrating this with clear exposition and brevity.
Therefore, I say that stones generated in the bladder mostly affect children; and among the symptoms is that the urine discharged from the bladder is similar to water in its subtlety, and sand appears in it; and the patient rubs their penis, often cries, and is drawn inward; and with this, many of them defecate forcefully.
And the cure is easier for children before they reach fourteen years of age; and it is a difficult cure in the elderly. But in young people, it is easier because it is amongst them. (or, more literally:  But in the young it is easier for that, for it is among them.)
And of those whose stone is larger, the cure is easier; and if it is small, it is the opposite.
Therefore, when approaching the cure for this, it is necessary at the beginning to cleanse the patient with a clyster that removes all the inflammation present in their bowels; for this inflammation sometimes prevents the stone from developing within the body.
And then the patient should be placed with their feet elevated and gently pressed upon and kneaded beneath, so that the stone descends to the bladder, or is moved from another location.
And then perform that incision between your hands, and the patient's hands are positioned beneath their thighs, so that the entire bladder is made to lean downwards.
And then extract that and all of that from the outside.
Therefore, if you feel the stone in the space, then you immediately cut into it.
And if it doesn't completely descend under your touch, then you should lubricate your left index finger with oil, if the patient is a child, or the middle finger if they are an adult, and insert it into their anus. And extract the stone until it is under your finger. And carefully move it little by little until it reaches the neck of the bladder.
And then press on it with your finger, and expel it outwards from the location where you cut it.
And order the attendant to press on the bladder with their hand; and order another attendant to, with their right hand, pull the genitals upwards, and with their other hand, hold the scrotum (or perineum), in the area near the location where the incision was made.
And then insert the instrument (or blade) properly into the incision, which has this shape: And cut through the tissue between the anus and the genitals, not in the middle, but towards the left thigh; and let the incision be on that stone and your finger be in the anus, and let the cut be transverse, so that the incision on the outside is wide and narrow inside according to the amount the stone protrudes, and no more, for forcefully pressing your finger in the anus against the stone near the incision will cause it to be expelled without success.
And know that there is some stone or obstruction which is angular or rough, making the extraction difficult due to this.
And that (part) is like a testicle, round, and is easily extracted.
Therefore, if it is one that is angular and rough, adjust it into the fissure.
And if it is not easily expelled, then you must either gently push upon it, or grip it with a suitable instrument, the end of which is like a file with which you press on the stone, and do not move it; or insert underneath a subtle curved instrument.
But if you cannot remove it, then you enlarge the opening a little, and if you see blood flowing, cut it (the stone)  firmly with crushed vitriol.
But if the stones are more than one, then at first you press your hand against the opening of the bladder, and then cut upon it; and then gently push on it; and do likewise if there are more than two.
And if the stone is very large, then it is unwise to cut it with a large incision, for you expose the patient to one of two outcomes: either death or a continuous flow of urine, because the area is not fully healed.
But administer an expulsion procedure until it is expelled, or carefully fracture it with forceps until it is removed in pieces.
So when you have completed your operation, then fill the wound with aloe juice and dragon's blood, and bind it tightly. And place over it a cloth soaked in oil and wine, or in rubbed oil and cold water, so that a hot abscess may be lessened.
And then lay the patient on their back, and do not loosen the bandage until the third day.
And when you have loosened it, apply water and a little oil to the area, and then treat it with diafinicon ointment and diabazilicon ointment until it is healed.
But if in the wound a hot, burning and corrosive abscess appears, and it resembles blood congealed in the bladder, preventing urination (and this is known by the presence of blood in the urine), then insert your finger into the wound and extract that blood, for if it remains it will cause corruption of the bladder and putrefaction of the organ.
And then wash the wound with sour wine, water, and salt, and with whatever else is suitable for its treatment until it is healed.
And it is necessary during all the treatment that you bind both thighs and apply the medicines that have been placed on the area.
And if the stone is small and is in the urethra, embedded within, and urination is also blocked, then treat it with what I recommended before to prevent reaching the need for surgery, for many times surgery is the result of this treatment; and I have tested this, and you should take a sharpened iron drill, of which this is the shape:
of triangular tip, sharp, fitted into a shaft.
And then take linen, and bind the penis below the stone so that it does not return to the bladder.
And then insert the iron into the penis, piercing easily until the drill reaches that stone. And you turn the drill with your hand against that small stone little by little, and you widen the hole until you make the other part penetrate; so that the urine is immediately released.
And then press your hand on the part that is broken off from the stone, on the outward part of the penis, since that is fractured and expelled with the urine, and the patient is healed.
But if this cure is not suitable for you for any reason that prevents it, then tie a piece of linen below the stone, and another piece of linen above the stone. And then apply a cauterization to the stone on the penis, between the two bandages. And then remove that. And then loosen the bandage and clean the congealed blood, which has formed in the wound.
And a bandage of linen below the stone is not necessary, except to prevent it from returning to the bladder; and the other bandage above, only because, when the linen below is loosened, the stone's expulsion causes the calculus to return to its place and heal the wound.
And therefore, when you loosen the linen bandage above, it is necessary for you to elevate the calculus upwards, or it will return to its original position, and thus heal the wound as we have said.
Chapter 61.
Of the extraction of stones from women.
Stones in women are rarely generated.
However, if a stone is found in any of them, then its cure is difficult and is approached in many ways.
One of them is that if the woman is very young (or a virgin).
And the second is that you do not find a woman well-informed enough to reveal herself to the doctor when she is chaste, or is one of the married women.
The third is that you do not find a woman well-versed in this art, especially the surgical procedure.
And the fourth is that the location of the incision on a stone in women is distant from the location of the stone, requiring a deep incision, and in that is danger/fear.
But if necessity compels you to do this, then you should take a skilled female physician, and few are found.
But if you are deprived of that, then seek a skilled and subtle male physician, or present a matron well-versed in women's ailments, or a woman particularly knowledgeable in this art.
Therefore, bring this woman forward, and command her to do everything you instruct her to do, from the examination for the stone at the beginning; this is to determine if the woman is a virgin, and she must insert her finger into the woman's rectum and feel for the stone.
Therefore, if she finds it, she should hold it with her finger, and then command that an incision be made above it.
But if she is not a virgin, then command the matron to insert her finger into the woman's vagina and search for the stone, then place her left hand on the bladder and compress it firmly.
Therefore, if it is found, then it must gradually be drawn out from the bladder opening, moving downwards with the force of her skill until it is brought to the root of the thigh.
And then make an incision at the top of the vaginal opening near the root of the thigh wherever it is lodged and extract the stone to that place, and the woman's finger must not be removed from the stone while she holds it.
And the incision should be small at first; and then insert the instrument into that incision, and if the stone is felt, then increase the incision according to the amount necessary to know that the stone will be expelled from that place.
And know that there are many types of stones: for some are small and large, and some sharp and rough, and long and round, and some with protuberances.
Therefore, you know how many types there are of them, so that you can specify what you want.
And if you see a flow of blood, apply powdered vitriol to the place and keep it there for an hour until the bleeding has stopped, and then return to your operation until the stone is expelled.
And ensure you prepare the instruments necessary for removing stones in men, so that they can help you in your procedure.
And if you see a flow of blood, and know that the bleeding comes from a cut artery, then you apply powder to the area and compress it with bandages and a tight dressing, and do not repeat this; and leave the stone and do not remove it, for the patient will likely die. And then treat the wound.
So, when the flow of blood has subsided after a few days, and the area has healed, then you resume your procedure until the stone is expelled.
Chapter 62.
Of surgery on a strangulated hernia.
An acute hernia is nothing more than a collection of moisture in the white sac, which lies below the groin on the side containing the testicles, and it is called the scrotum.
And sometimes it is in the natural sheath that the body has prepared in the area of the testicle, until there is a care that there is already another testicle; and it is the groin area between the white scrotum which we have mentioned, and this is nothing but a swelling.
And the generation of this hernia is due to weakness that affects the testicles, causing this matter to be discharged there, and sometimes it is caused by a blow to the testicles.
And this moisture has many colors, for its color is either tending towards yellow or blood-red, or red, or black and foul-smelling, or watery and white, and that is the most common.
And the signs by which one knows where this collection of water is are these: if it is in the white scrotum we mentioned, then the swelling is round, sloping slightly in length, like the shape of an egg, and the testicle is hidden, because the moisture surrounds it entirely.
And if the moisture is in the proper sheath, then the swelling is round with a portion like the testicle, and for this reason one thinks it is another testicle.
And if the moisture is between the groin of the testicles and the white scrotum, then it is felt deep down.
And if you want to know the color of the moisture, then you probe the color of the moisture in the swelling with a pointed instrument whose shape is known beforehand; and according to what comes out on the instrument's surface, judge what is inside.
Therefore, when we come to treating it with iron, then it is necessary to command the patient to be bled, if this is possible for you, and to observe the patient's body filled [with blood].
And then lay him on his back on a slightly elevated surface, and place many cloths beneath him.
And then sit on his left side, and command the attendant to sit on his right, who shall extend his staff to one of the two sides of the groin and the area of the navel of the belly.
And then take a broad knife and cut the groin from the middle point along its length, nearly to the groin.
And let the incision be made along a straight line equally distant from the line that bisects the skin of the groin, until it reaches the white tissue (likely a tendon or ligament).
And scrape away that area, and observe carefully, and be careful not to cut into it; and your scraping, with which you scrape away a part, should be as gentle and subtle as possible, scraping away in accordance with the quantity as possible for you.
And then pierce the water-filled tissue with a wide opening, and remove all the water.
And then separate the two sides of the incision with hooks, and extend the tissue outward; and do not touch the tissue of the groin, and cut the tissue in whatever manner is possible for you. And cut it (the tissue) completely or in pieces, and particularly its finer parts, for if you do not meticulously examine its incision, there is no guarantee that the water will not return.
However, if the fluid (pus or other substance) flows from that outside the groin during your operation, then when you have completed the incision of the tissue, return it inside, and then sew together the two sides of the groin tissue with stitches, and then treat it as you would any other wound, until it is healed.
And if you find the fluid (pus or other substance) corrupted by another illness, then you should tie off the vessels that are around the suspensory ligament, and remove the fluid, and then treat it as we have said.
But if the fluid is gathered in two separate places, for example, then know that there are two hernias; therefore, cut that part in the same way as you did the other swelling; and if it seems to you that it is one operation, then do it.
And then you clean the blood, and insert into the incisions wool soaked in oil or olive oil; and place outside another wool which you have soaked in wine and oil, and spread that over the groin and the abdomen; and place on top folded cloths and powders, and bind them together with a bandage that is in this manner:
And then two cloths are taken and filled with woven wool in this way; and their edges are secured with cotton or damp wool, and they are fastened with a bandage to the crotch of the breeches; and one end runs from the buttocks to the navel, and the other end runs along the thigh; and two more ends on each thigh and another two more ends on each calf; and the entire bandage should be secured to the crotch of the breeches.
And sometimes this hernia is treated artificially with cautery instead of cutting with iron; and you take a sharp, thin cautery knife, and with it cut the skin of the groin, and cauterize it according to what we have described until the white cyst containing the fluid is exposed; and then you take a cautery in this form: And it resembles a Greek letter.
And then pierce the cyst, and cauterize until all the moisture is expelled.
And then pull the cyst out with forceps, and scrape it with a sharp, hot cautery; and cut it as much as possible until it is eradicated; and be careful that the heat does not burn the surrounding tissue.
And know that this operation is safer and less prone to bleeding, and better than an operation involving cutting.
However, if you encounter an abscess, excessive bleeding, or other complications during the incision or cauterization, then you must treat whatever complications arise, with a treatment appropriate to the situation, as described.
But if the patient is weak and cannot endure a second operation because of its severity, then administer the puncture as I have recommended; and this is when you are certain, based on the signs we have discussed, that the hernia is acute.
Then you must have the patient sit on a slightly raised surface; then puncture the abscess at its lowest point with a wide spatula, and position the puncture along the patient's body length.
And make the opening wide enough so that all the fluid drains out.
And then apply a cloth to the area, bandage it, and leave it, so that the remaining fluid drains out. And then treat it until the wound is healed.
But if there is resistance to the fluid draining at that time, you puncture it.  This is done because the white membrane within the wound opening resists and prevents the fluid from escaping.  In that case, you should place a tool, like those used to drain fluid from dropsy patients, into the wound, which has a prescribed shape. Alternatively, make a small incision in the wound to alleviate the pressure.
And know that the fluid returns and accumulates approximately every six months or thereabouts; and when it accumulates, then it should be punctured in the same manner, so that the illness will pass its days.
Chapter 63.
Of the incision on a fleshy hernia and its treatment.
Know that incising this fleshy hernia carries a risk of harm in many situations; therefore, I see dismissal (or avoiding the operation) and a better chance of survival in such cases.
And I am recalling the operation on this and the types of abscesses.
Therefore, I say that abscesses arise in the parts of the body where the humors are gathered, and this is caused by various things: either by an acute, sharp superfluity, which is poured out in the humors, or by a blow.
And the color of the abscess corresponds to the color of the affected body part. If there is no pain, it is a serious abscess.
And a particularly difficult abscess is the petrified one, whose color is dark, and there is no sensation in it.
And sometimes it is caused by a blockage of the arteries, and by swelling of them, so that, just as we remember, or by swelling of the veins.
But that which is due to swelling of the arteries is recognized by the dispersion of the abscess when we compress it with our fingers; and it is not necessary for it to be touched.
But that which is caused by swelling of the vein is not dispersed by any means through compression with the fingers.
And it is possible that an incision be made on this type [of abscess] and on the surrounding flesh; you should incise the skin around the testicles, then carefully spread the scrotum outward, and extract the [affected] part from the white sac, and release the suspensory ligaments, and tie them, and cut the suspensory ligament after you have freed it from all the parts of the testicle.
Therefore, if the testicle is already hardened by those swellings, then it is necessary that you remove the testicle and cut it open.
And if there is an adhesion to anything within the sac, or between the vessels, then you must release all that adhesion and cut it with a circular incision.
But if there is a growth of flesh in the location of the adhesion, which is behind, then you must cut away everything that is there, and remove the testicle as we have said.
Therefore, when your operation is complete, fill the wound with wool infused in warmed oil and wine; and then treat it with further remedies until it is healed.
Chapter 64.
Of the treatment of inguinal hernia.
The inguinal hernia is a swelling enveloped by a tissue-like covering, with softening of the testicles, making movement and walking for the patient difficult.
And in the treatment of this illness, fear is a consideration that should be taken into account, remembering what preceded it.
However, it is necessary to describe the operation in the way that the first [operations] were performed.
And I say that it is necessary to have the patient sit on a raised surface; then pull the suspensory ligament of the testicles downwards; then grasp the scrotum with your fingers, using the instruments that are proven to grasp the penis; and have another assistant do the same, and stretch vigorously.
And then, using a sharp, broad spatula, cut transversely along the direction of the vessels until the vessels are exposed.
And then scrape away from every side, just as we have described in the extraction of arrows lodged in the temples.
And then insert a needle with a double point, and tie it to the first of the places where you made the incision, and tie it again to the back of them. And then cut them in the middle, cutting straight along the length of the body, and extract that which is accumulated of the foul and corrupted humors.
And then treat the wound with the treatment for other wounds in which you want suppuration to be generated, so that the vessels which nourished one of the two genitals will fall away, for that is not harmful.
But if you cut all the vessels, then the testicles must be removed or the testicles will be cut off with the vessels, so that they are deprived of all nourishment by the incision of the vessels, and they will wither, or they will die because of that, as they will no longer be nourished by them.
Chapter 65.
Of the treatment of intestinal hernia.
The occurrence of this hernia is due to a cut that occurs in the weakened area above the abdomen, on the side of the abdominal cavity's edges, thus releasing the intestines from that rupture and letting them fall into the abdominal cavity.
And this rupture is either of the weakened area or of a stretching of it, and these two types happen due to various reasons: either a blow, or a jump, or a loud noise, or the lifting of a heavy object, or similar actions.
And the sign of this, when it is due to a stretching of the weakened area, is that it occurs gradually over a long period of time, and not suddenly, and it swells inward towards the groin because the weakened area is compressing the intestines.
And the sign of it [the hernia] when it is due to a cut in the weakened area is that it initially causes sudden, intense pain; and a different kind of swelling appears under the area near the groin, and this is due to the protruding intestine and the body of the intestine being pushed out of the weakened area.
And sometimes, the intestine drags the membrane along with it, and this is called a circumferential intestinal hernia.
And sometimes it is caused by wind, and sometimes a tear occurs in the intestine, and it is trapped there, and this causes significant harm to the patient, and sometimes it causes severe pain, especially when pressed.
And in treating this type of illness with iron there is a risk, therefore the use of that treatment should be avoided.
And the method of the operation for this is to tell the patient to push the intestine back into its cavity with their hand if it returns willingly; and then it should be placed back into its place over their abdomen, and elevate their legs.
And then, separate the cord (the spermatic cord) above the testicles, and cut the spermatic cord all the way through; and then put hooks on either side of the cut, as needed to open the incision with them.
And if the incision is according to the amount that you are able to do so that the testicle is expelled from it.
And then scrape away the tissue beneath the spermatic cord until the hard white tissue of each part is exposed.
Then insert your finger into the area surrounding the testicle, which is between the white tissue beneath the testicle's cord and the tissue behind the testicle, and break away any adhesions on the back side of the testicle.
Then pull the spermatic cord outward with your hand, and with this, lift the white tissue up with your left hand, and elevate the testicle with the tissue toward the incision; and instruct the assistant to hold the testicle up, while you break the adhesions behind it with appropriate means.
And check with your fingers to see if there is any cause of the intestine being wrapped within the hard white tissue. But if you find any cause of this, then you push it back into the abdominal cavity.
Then cut into the area beneath the spermatic cord, making an incision through which blood and pus will flow, as we have described in what we previously stated.
And then apply wool soaked in oil to the wound; and apply the bandage we described (and sometimes the white tissue is cauterized, which we mentioned near the incision to stop blood flow, for frequently this happens). Leave the bandage until it falls off by itself.
But if the healing is delayed, then warm water should be applied and kept there until it falls off, as we have said.
And then treat the wound with other wound treatments until it is healed.
Chapter 66.
Of the wind-blown hernia.
In this hernia, I have not seen anything that has been successfully treated with cauterization using iron.
And the first [doctors] would say that it is done in the same way as we have described for a hernia filled with wind; that is, you tie the vessels near the incision with ease; and then dry the middle area around the abscess with whatever dries it open until the vessels collapse.
And treat the wound as we have said until it is healed.
Chapter 67.
Of the rupture that occurs in the joints.
Sometimes, a rupture occurs in the joints as we have said, and you should examine the area.
And do not leave any cause of the intestines in the groin; and if they do, it is little; and it returns at all times.
However, if the time is prolonged with this, a fissure is formed in the groin, until the intestine descends into the groin; and this happens due to the stretching of the groin in the joints, as we have said, which is why the groin is stretched, and soon softened and the area is inflamed and you examine it.
And the cure for it is with cautery, as was previously described.
And sometimes it is cured with an iron according to this method:  the patient lies on their back between your hands, and then dry the area of the rupture and abscesses, examining it with a cut across the width for about three days.
And then, press on the white groin that is under the hip until it is exposed.
And then take the probe and place it over the prominent area of the groin, and press it against the front of the abdomen.
And then stitch the two prominent areas on the probe's extremity of the groin, and join one to the other with a suture.
And then remove the probe's extremity, and do not cut through the groin completely, nor extend the wound, nor any other cause like this that I have to tell you about in the treatment of intestinal hernia.
And then treat that with the treatment of wounds, and as you dress the sores, cleanse it and restore the wound until it is healed; for the groin is contracted and the rupture's prominence is not corrected.
And cauterization is better in this location, for it is closer to healing.
Chapter 68.
Of softening the hardness of the testicles.
Often the hardness of the testicles in some men is softened because the tissues around them are softened, and this is why it is helpful to watch them.
Therefore, it is necessary for the one who is tasked with their care to have the patient lie according to their side, and to cut away all the hardened tissue which is on top of the natural tissue; and then to stitch together the two edges using sutures.
And if you wish, sew the excess of the softened tissue at the beginning with three or four stitches, and with firm sutures.
And then you make incisions between the sutures; and then treat with a treatment for other wounds until it is healed and the pus subsides.
Chapter 69.
Of castration.
Know that castration, in our law, is forbidden, but by reason of necessity, it is permitted to me to mention it in this book; and its mention is not necessary except in two ways.  One is so that a physician, when questioned about it, may understand the treatment of any such injury; and the other way is that we frequently have need of castrating other animals for our benefit, as with oxen, rams, pigs, and animals similar to them.
And therefore I say that castration is done in two ways: either by crushing, or by a fissure or incision.
However, in the method done by crushing, the procedure is to immerse the beast in hot water until its genitals are softened and relaxed and hanging. And then grasp them with your hand until they are broken and no longer appear beneath the touch.
But in castration by fissure and incision, you must hold the beast and press down on the scrotum with your left hand.
Then tie the suspensory ligament, and make an incision on each testicle, until both testicles are separated.
And then cut them further, once you have scraped each one. And do not leave behind any cause from the scrotum, but only the subtle membrane that is over the vessels.
And this method of castration, which is performed by attrition, is better, because strong attrition leaves no cause in the testicles for which the beast desires coition.
And then treat the wound until it is healed.
Chapter 70.
Of the treatment of hermaphroditism.
Hermaphroditism in men comes in two ways: one is when there appears in the space in the scrotum, between the two testicles, a figure like a woman's vulva, in which there are hairs.
And sometimes urine flows from that opening in the scrotum.
But in women it is a single type: and it is when the woman's vulva is like two testicles of a man somewhat hidden on the outer part, similar to a man's foreskin, and two testicles.
And the cure is of three types: for two types of men and one type for women. And it is necessary that you incise those adhering flesh until the swelling subsides, and then treat those with the treatment for other wounds.
And in the second type of man, for whom urine is in the scrotum, there is no cure or operation for it.
Chapter 21.
Of lentigo and protruding flesh caused by female conditions.
Lentigo, a mild swelling, is usually caused by natural factors until it becomes tight and the care is successful; and sometimes, in some women, it becomes so large that it spreads out like in men and extends even to the area around the genitals.
Then you should remove the excess lentigo with your hand or with a surgical instrument and cut it away.
And do not overdo the cutting, especially on the root of the tissue, so that you do not cause excessive bleeding.
And then treat that with the treatment for sores until it is healed.
However, flesh that has developed within the womb of the mother until it fills it, and has come out in a localized manner in the form of a mass (for this reason, some earlier practitioners called it "a disease of the mass"); therefore, it is necessary to cut it like we cut lentigo and to treat it until it is healed.
Chapter 72.
Concerning the treatment of elephantiasis.
Elephantiasis is a condition where the vagina of a woman is not perforated, or the opening is small. And it is either natural or accidental.
Accidental elephantiasis is caused by a preceding illness, which is either due to improperly formed flesh or a subtle or thick cyst.
And it occurs either in the mother's womb, or on her sides, or on the topmost part of her body, or the lowest, and you forbid cooking, contact, and childbirth, and especially strongly forbid menstruation.
And the diagnosis is made by observing the midwife, if the obstruction is apparent, promptly; but if it is not apparent, then you search for it with your words or with the instrument.
But if the obstruction is due to a subtle cyst, and is close to the two lips, then you should heat and break it open.
And you should place powders on both lips, and then place your index fingers of both hands gently on top.
And the woman should be on her back, her thighs extended, and then forcefully extend both lips until that subtle cyst is broken and the obstruction is opened.
And then take wool and soak it in oil, and place it over the area, and let her rest with a man that day so that the incision site does not become consolidated.
But if the cyst is large and thick, then it is necessary for you to cut it with a sharp blade or with a myrtle leaf.
But if the obstruction is due to flesh, then suspend that with a hook, and cut it.
And have with you the remedies that stop blood flow without causing bites, such as acacia, dragon's blood, and cinquefoil, mixed with egg white.
And then administer a wide lead cannula so that the wound does not heal too quickly.
And keep that for several days and apply a poultice of them.
And then let it be cured with other healing treatments until it is healed.
And sometimes it happens in the major nativity of other flesh, and then it is necessary to incise according to this method. But if this is due to a cranial abscess, no iron should be used in any way against the cranial abscess.
Chapter 73.
Of the treatment of hemorrhoids, and of the sore and red swelling that happens in the vagina of women.
Hemorrhoids are a collection of many small veins from which much blood flows continuously; and when hemorrhoids are longstanding and painful, they are considered to be 'theils' (possibly a type of ulcer or painful lump).
And I have already discussed the types and signs of these [ailments], and will now describe those that are curable and those that are not curable.
Therefore, I say that hemorrhoids and painful lumps, when they are deep inside and not apparent to the touch, should not be treated with iron.
But those which are at the opening of the anus and can be felt, are those which can be cured.
And you must place the woman in a cool place and then carefully remove the [painful] lump with scissors, or a rough cloth, and cut them off at their roots.
And then sprinkle on them the flow of blood from one of the incised powders, without biting, like acacia and similar things.
And then soak their feet for an hour, and then place that [affected area] in cool water.
And if the flow of blood persists, then make that [affected area] sit in a decoction of pomegranate rind, quince rind, and similar things.
And then take barley flour and mix it with honey and sour wine, and make a poultice with this and place it on their back.
And if the blood is stopped, it is good; and if not, apply two leeches, and to the breasts without incision.
And then take wool, and soak it in coriander juice, or juice of arnagloza, or juice of guarravier mixed with diluted wine, and apply it to the affected area; and then treat the area with ointments until it is healed.
And treat that until it is healed.
Chapter 74.
Of the perforation of an accidental abscess in the breast.
Many kinds of abscesses accidentally occur in the breast, such as cancerous ones, stony abscesses, ulcers, boils, carbuncles, fistulas, hemorrhoids, sores, ulcers, and other abscesses. And I have already discussed these illnesses and their types, their signs, and their treatments in the division.
And it is necessary for me to discuss in this treatise the hot abscess that arises in the breast when it is one of the abscesses that collects pus, and if you wish to know how the operation is performed on it with an iron.
Then you must consider if the pain of the abscess in its beginning is sharp with throbbing, phlegm, and fever, and sometimes redness, and if, when pressing on it, you feel sensitivity, then do not proceed with puncturing it, but treat it with whatever aids maturation until the sharpness of the symptoms subsides.
And then you must have the woman lie down on a table with two supports;  and she should lie on her back and position her feet towards the lower part of the abdomen, and her thighs should be spread apart, and place her arms under her elbows, and bind each one with a suitable bandage.
And then the midwife, standing on the right side, administers the instrument with which the opening in the breast is made, the shape of which will be evident in the subsequent procedures.
And when you wish to administer this instrument, you must insert, with the handle, the nipple of the woman's breast, and what enters the breast from the instrument should be no more than the nipple itself, and ease the patient's suffering. But if the instrument is larger than the nipple, then you must place powders on the texture of the nipple to prevent any instrument from entering the nipple.
And you must place the liquid that is on the instrument's handle on top, and let the practitioner hold the instrument and turn the liquid until the breast opening is revealed.
And when the discharge appears, and it is touched by the hand and is leathery and moist, then you must dry that area around the head with a linen cloth.
And when the discharge is evacuated, then you must place a piece of cloth soaked in rose oil or green oil (in which some kind of medicinal substance is present) on the affected area and apply a compress on the section of the nipple.
And place outside the breast, and over the areola, clean wool soaked in water in which mallows have been boiled.
And it should be treated for approximately two days with an ointment suitable for this purpose until it is healed.
And sometimes the breast and the affected area are washed in a mixture of water and honey, and then with water in which lily root or long aristolochia has been boiled, and subsequently returned to the ointment treatment.
And if the affected area is hidden deep within the breast, then you must refrain from treating it with iron, instead treating it with what we have discussed in the division [of treatments].
Chapter 75.
To teach the midwives how to treat stillborn babies when their condition deviates from the natural order.
It is necessary for the midwife to recognize the natural birth pattern from its signs.  When you see the woman pressing downwards and eager to breathe air, and she is relieved by the weight of the birth, and hastens the delivery of the baby, then know that this birth is following a natural pattern.  The delivery will be of the baby's head first, and the placenta with it either hanging or suspended from the navel.
Therefore, when you see these signs, the woman's abdomen should be compressed to allow the baby to descend easily, as when it descends headfirst, it releases the placenta, and it is cleansed of those superfluities with proper care.
However, a birth that differs from this is unnatural and undesirable, for when the baby emerges feet first and its body exits before its head and feet, or one hand, or the foot is foremost, or the head emerges, and the hand, or belly and the whole body is turned unnaturally to the side.  These are considered bad signs.
Therefore, it is necessary for the midwife to be knowledgeable and perceptive in all these matters, and to guard against error and deception.
And I am showing all the forms of these, and what kind of ingenuity is in them, so that it can be understood and what has been observed.
When the birth occurs headfirst in a natural manner, and the process is difficult for the woman, and the woman's strength is already weakened, then apply this treatment, or what women should have, and vaporize her brow with fennel seeds and moist oils.
And then the midwife should insert her finger between the baby's shoulders and crack the afterbirth, or cut it with her nail until that moisture within is expelled. And press the woman's abdomen until the afterbirth comes down.
But if it does not descend, then the woman needs to be treated with a poultice of ptilium and a poultice of fennel seed with cumin.
And then command her, or the attendant, to be pressed and make her sneeze with a concoction; and cover her mouth and nose for an hour, for the afterbirth will be expelled quickly.
And if the two halves of the afterbirth are expelled at the beginning, then you must gently reduce them, little by little. But if you do not succeed in the process, then place the woman on a stool and raise her feet up, and then lower the stool to the ground; and the woman must be held so that she does not fall during the movement.
And if the halves are not returned and the afterbirth remains, then cut them and extract the remaining part of the afterbirth, or bind the body part to the woman's hand with a cloth and extract it gently, for that will be expelled.
When the afterbirth is on its feet, then you must push it up, and then turn the afterbirth gently, and then swallow it, and then take one of its legs and extend it gently.
But when it has emerged into the thighs, then you command him to strain, and make him sneeze with a condition, for it will be expelled if God wills it.
And if it is not expelled by what we have recounted, then you return the afterbirth gently until you put it back in its natural position, for it will then be expelled with ease.
And if it is not expelled by all of that which we have recounted, then take marshmallow and dissolved gum, and pound them well in a mortar, then apply this mixture to the vulva of the woman, at the lower part of her abdomen. And then apply this compress in lukewarm water, until it reaches the hypochondria.
And when the parts below him are soothed, then apply a fumigation of myrtle and then place it over him. And when the fumigation has been in place for an hour, then you place him on a stool, and make him sneeze and hold his mouth shut, and remove the compress, and press the lower part of his abdomen gently, for the afterbirth will be expelled soon.
The expulsion of the afterbirth, hanging lengthwise by one of her hands. Be clever in reducing the hand, but if you cannot reduce it, then lift the woman and make her go.
And if she cannot go, then make her lie down on the bed, and beat her thighs with forceful blows, and then administer bandages which I and recommend made of mucilage.
And if labor has begun, then make her sit on a stool, and then study the reduction of the hand, and pull the afterbirth in a natural manner, and make the woman sneeze and instruct her to push until it is expelled.
The afterbirth is on the mother's bottom, with her hands spread out above it, and her face is towards her mother's. The midwife should hold the hand of the afterbirth and gradually turn it, and remove it with ease.
And when it is pulled out, then place on her navel what we have recommended of oil and mucilage.
Then instruct her to move slightly, and when you have done this, have her sit on a stool and tell her to lean on her right side, and then tell her to press; and make her sneeze with some condition. The prepared fetus (or foetus) is placed on its side.
When the mother is delivered of the afterbirth in this manner, consider, and then you cut the placenta with your fingernail until the moisture is drained away.
And if the fetus is hanging by the face and neck, then you cut the umbilical cord so that it is not retained and dies.
Then push the fetus into the parts inside until you have placed it where it should be, and tell the woman to press herself a few times, and it will be expelled easily, if God wills it.
Delivery of twins or multiple fetuses. Know that twins are born frequently, and sometimes three or four, but this is rare and quickly dies; however, this is for reasons outside of nature, and not to live.
And, count them, whether they are numerous, one by one, and separate them by separating the ligaments at the navel of each, and sometimes they are expelled in the same way as a single fetus, easily, and sometimes in a less praiseworthy way, as we have recounted.
And if some of them are difficult to deliver, and arrive at the point we have discussed about unnatural figures, then you treat them in the same way as we have recounted.
And if the midwife is skillful and does this with ease and subtlety, and with slowness, and is ingenious according to every possible figure, so as to prepare the way for health.
A recollection of what is formed in the womb from embryos and [what is] aborted.
Sometimes one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, and even ten are formed in the mother's womb, and it has been verified by me that one woman aborted six, and another ten, all fully formed.  The cause of this was determined by measurements of the glorious wise men.
And all this must be within the knowledge of the midwife, for it is very easy for her to recognize this slight resemblance, and therefore she should proceed with what is necessary.
Chapter 76.
Of the extraction of the fetus when it is dead.
When you treat the dead fetus with what we have discussed in the division of medicine, and it has not been expelled, and you are forced to use manual procedures, then you must consider whether the woman is of sound constitution and is not suffering from any of the conditions that lead to fear of her demise.
Then the woman should be positioned on the bed on her side, with her head lowered and her thighs raised.
And the attendant should hold her in two places or bind her to the bed so that her body does not move during the extraction of the fetus.
And then, moisten the mother's mouth with soothing oils and with mucilage of marshmallow, fenugreek, and linseed.
And then, the midwife should anoint her hand with those oils and mucilages, and then gently insert her hand into the mother, and then search with her hand for the place where she can hook her fingers onto the fetus.
And in suitable places: then consider if the fetus is ready to descend headfirst, and then hook your fingers into its neck, or head, or mouth, or palate, or under the chin, or in its armpits, or at the sides, or under the ribs.
But if the descent is feet-first, then in the groin, or in the middle of the back.
And the midwife should hold the fingers with her right hand, and rest their curve in the place between the fingers of her left hand, and gently insert her hand and hook her fingers into one of those places we mentioned, until reaching the empty space.
And then place and insert another finger, or a third if necessary, in opposition to the first, so that there is a drawing-in, and not a pulling-out only according to its own resistance.
And this should be done gently on all sides, so that the delivery is eased as is done when a tooth is pulled out.
And it is necessary in the area between them that the stretching should be softened; and if any part of it is held back, then the midwife should anoint some of her fingers with oil and insert these carefully and roll with those fingers that which is held back.
Therefore, if the part of the fetus is expelled, then the fingers should be moved to the location higher up; and do this until the entire fetus is expelled.
However, if one hand emerges before the other, and it is not possible to return it by compressing it, then it is necessary that a cloth be wrapped around it; and then pull it out until the whole is expelled, and cut it either at the joint of the hand or at the elbow.
And thus it is necessary to do the same for the other hand and the two feet.
But if the head of the fetus is large, or you encounter resistance in the expulsion, or water is accumulated on its head, then it is necessary to insert fingers between the spinal bones and to break the head open and drain the water, or to break it with an instrument called "alundat," the form of which will be found with the other instruments in the chapter near this one.
And similarly, do this if the fetus has a large head by nature.  Then it is necessary to cut it with a scalpel, or to extract it with an alundat as we have said; and then remove the bones with forceps.
And if the head is emerged and is constricted towards the pubic area, then it should be split open until the moisture which is in the feet is expelled.
But if it is not complicated, nor resisting the expulsion, then you cut the head as soon as possible.
And if the lower part of the belly is swollen with pus or is hydrops, then you must pierce it until the moisture inside it drains out.
But if the fetus is positioned on its feet, then the pulling of it is gentle and its direction toward the mother's mouth is gentle.
But if it is constricted towards the belly and the feet, then you must extract it with a cloth that you will have wrapped around your hand, and you must cut the belly and the feet until whatever is in those areas is discharged.
However, if the other limbs have been removed and the head remains, then the midwife should insert her left hand; but if the mother's mouth is open, then she should insert her hand into the vagina, and seek the head with it, and pull it with the fingers towards the mother's mouth, and then insert a finger or two into it and pull it with those.
And if the mother's mouth is constricted by a hot abscess that has developed inside, then it should not be poked at; instead, it is necessary to administer an application of fatty, moist substances beforehand. And administer poultices; and keep the patient in waters that soften and moisturize.
And if the fetus is on its side, then if possible, it should be turned; and what we have said about a living fetus should be administered.
And if that is not possible, then it should be cut into pieces and removed.
And it is necessary that you leave no cause within the afterbirth.
And when you have completed all your operation, then administer what we have said about the treatment of abscesses that occur in the mother.
And if a flow of blood occurs, then you should place it in astringent water and administer the other treatment.
And I have already seen a woman in whose womb a stillbirth had been made, and then again pregnant, and a stillbirth followed. An abscess occurred on his navel a long time ago; and it swelled until it was opened, and began to discharge pus.
And I was called to treat him, and treated him for a long time, and the wound was not healed.
Then I applied some strong-drawing plasters to him, and a bone came out of him, and after a few days, another bone came out; and I was very surprised, as there are no bones in the belly.
And then I thought they were bones from the stillborn child.
So I cleaned the wound, and removed many bones from him, the woman remaining in her usual condition, and she lived in this way for a long time, recovering a little from the pus.
And I did not consider this strange, but rather that this is knowledge and helpful in what the skilled doctor administers with their hands for healing.
Of the forms of instruments necessary to extract the fetus.
Form of vertigo with which the mother is opened:
This is the form of constriction in which the books are bound, with two twists on the two ends of two cords. However, this twist should be more subtle than a constriction, and be made either of linen or of wood.
And the width of each cord is about two fingers, and the margin of each about one finger, and the length of each is one and a half palms; and in the middle of the two cords there are two attachments of the same cord, already fixed, whose length is half a palm plus a little more, and the width of each is about two fingers, or a little more.
And these two attachments are inserted into the mother's mouth so that it is opened with them when you rotate the two prescribed twists.
Another form, similar to the more subtle and lighter one:
Be made of linen or wood, in the manner of forceps. However, at its extremity, there are two attachments, just as before, and the length of these attachments is about one palm, and the width of each is two fingers.
And when you wish to open the mother using these, then you make the woman lie on her back, her feet hanging down, opening the space between her thighs. And then open your hand with the instrument, just as you would with scissors, according to the amount you want, assessing the opening of the mother's mouth until the midwife does what you want.
The form of vertigo, which the ancients described:
Form of impulse by which the fetus is pushed:
Form of friendship/assistance with which the large head is contained.
And it resembles forceps, having teeth at the extremity, as often happens, and sometimes it is made long, like forceps, in this manner, as often happens, having teeth, like the teeth of a saw, with which it is incised and contained. Form of slight assistance/help:
Form of a hook having a spine/point:
Form of a hook having two spines/points:
Form of a spatula having two extremities with which the head is severed.
Form of two wide spatulas.
All those instruments are used, and the more the varieties of them are multiplied and prepared by the craftsmen, the lighter their operation is and the more valuable they are to men because of their quantity.
And do not neglect those instruments, wherever they may be needed by you, for the necessity of them is inexcusable.
Of the extraction of the afterbirth.
When the afterbirth is retained after childbirth, then you should command the patient to hold their breath, and then make them sneeze forcefully, and press your hand over their mouth and nose, and if by this it is expelled, it is good.
And if not, then take a bowl, pierce a hole in its cover, and place in it herbs such as mugwort, rue, anise, chamomile, arabic cicely, cassia wood, and yarrow.  Place it over the mother's open mouth, as a compress. All these herbs, or some of them, should be immersed in water in the bowl, and place that bowl over the fire.
And then place a reed cannula in the mother's mouth, and hold it there until the vapor reaches the mother's cavity.
And then make her sneeze as we have said, and the afterbirth will be expelled quickly.
But if this treatment remains ineffective and the afterbirth has not been expelled, then instruct the midwife to immerse her left hand in sesame oil or marshmallow decoction, and then insert it into the vagina and try to grasp the afterbirth with it.  Once found, gently pull it out slowly.  However, if it is adhered to the mother's womb, insert her hand as previously described.  When the afterbirth has been located, gently remove it bit by bit, as instructed, so that the mother is not subjected to excessive traction. Previously, it is necessary that it be moved easily from side to side.
And if the mother's mouth is constricted, we have already described the treatment using sneezing and medicating with herbal infusions.
However, if it has not been expelled by all the methods we have described, be careful not to tire yourself out by trying to remove it further.  Instead, whatever has come out of it into the mother's mouth, place it on the woman's thigh. Then, apply ointment and a four-ingredient medicine to it, as this will cause it to decompose over a few days, dissolve, and be expelled.
But when it decomposes, a foul odor rises from the head and stomach, making the patient ill.  Then, fumigations and appropriate remedies must be administered.
However, some of the ancients already tested fumigation with burnt mint and dried figs.
Method of instrument with which the woman is fumigated for retained menses and afterbirth:
It should be made of glass or earthenware.
And place the narrow end in the container and the wide end over the fire, and the fumigation is placed over the flames of the fire.
And let it remain until the fumigation is consumed, and then renew another.
Concerning the treatment of an unperforated child's anus.
Many children are born with their anuses unperforated, which are very narrow and closed. Then it is necessary for the midwife to perforate that narrowness with her finger; and if not, to perforate it with a sharp instrument, and be careful not to touch the intestines.
And then place over it wool soaked in wine and oil; and treat it with ointment until it is healed.
But if you fear that it is blocked, then place a tube in the opening for many days, and remove it when the child wishes to pass stool.
And blockage of the anus sometimes occurs due to the consolidation of a plague or an abscess; then it is necessary to incise that consolidation, and then treat it with what we have mentioned about the treatment and the lead.
Of the treatment of the fistulas that then develop below.
The fistulas that develop in the lower part, swollen and thick, which appear near the anus or in the space between the parts.
And it is a fistula or many.
And when that swelling is old and comes from moist, whitish moisture or subtle putrefaction, and sometimes these fistulas are even penetrating.
And those penetrating ones are known because of what comes out of them through discharge and windiness; and sometimes the patient experiences discharge, and often worms come out of them.
And sometimes these fistulas penetrate into the bladder, and into the urethra; and some of these penetrating ones reach the hip joint and even the marrow of the thigh bone.
And the way to know if a fistula is penetrating into the anus and not penetrating is that you put your index finger into the anus, and gently insert a thin probe of bronze or iron into the fistula, if there is no twisting.
But if there is twisting in it, then insert a thin probe of lead or horsehair until you feel the probe or the hair on your finger.
And if you feel nothing at all, and no discharge, worms, or windiness proceed from the opening, as we have said, then know that it is non-penetrating, and then proceed with the treatment.
And when the fistula is penetrating into the bladder or into the urethra, then the sign of it is the discharge of urine from that place and prohibition of it, so that the area may be healed with medicine.
But if it is penetrating into the joint of the thigh or into the bone, and the surrounding area is painful, then the sign is that the probe passes directly into the bone, if there is no twisting within the bone, and pain in the surrounding area; and that it may remain so for a long time; and that medicine is of no value there, nor will it be healed with ointment.
And in all those penetrating fistulas, there is no complete cure, and the treatment of those is the work and futility of foolish physicians, upon which you should be wary.
But in that which is not penetrating and not old, healing with iron is expected, as I will tell you, and what I have already tested.
And it is that the patient lies on their back with their hands under their sides, and raise their legs up, with their thighs inclined towards their belly, and then insert a lead probe, or an iron one if there is twisting in the fistula, until you know the location where the probe passes through.
And if that touches the patient around the anus, then you should insert your finger into the anus.
And if you feel the probe itself penetrating through your finger, or something else besides the flesh, then know for certain that it is penetrating; and then do not work on it, for there is no cure for it, as we have said.
But nevertheless, some might say that it is healed in some men slowly.
And the treatment by which healing is expected in this case is that you heat a thin cautery according to the width of the fistula, as was previously described, and insert that heated cautery into the fistula until it reaches around the anus; and then repeat this two or three times until you know that all the flesh around the fistula that resembles a bird's feather quill has been cauterized.
And then treat it with something wrapped in a bandage until all that burned flesh is healed, and then treat it with flesh-generating and strengthening remedies, and if it is healed, good; and if not, then it will not be healed at any time by any other treatment.
And if the probe enters, but does not penetrate right through your finger into the anus, and between it and the probe is a thick layer of flesh or tissue, and the fistula is in the area where the surface of the anus is, then cut the anus at the beginning of the fistula, and you shall cut it with the probe, and place it within the fistula until the incision reaches the point where the probe's end reaches, and through the probe, it is released and falls out.
And then cleanse that fistula-ridden flesh, which is like a bird's feather quill, and do not leave any cause behind.
But if a flow of blood often occurs during your procedure when you cauterize those tissues, then the best and easiest instrument is to cauterize with fire or with a sharp medicine, for cauterization with fire provides two good habits: that is, the burning of those tissues, and the cutting off of the blood and excess moisture.
And then treat it with dressings wrapped in bandages or lint until the wound heals, and then treat the wound with ointments that generate and strengthen tough flesh.
And those medicines contain astringency and excision; when it is thus restored, it is already healed and you need not fear a recurrence.
But if the fistula has already reached the anus and is distant from the body's surface, then insert your finger into the anus and investigate with it.
And if you find the opening and between you and it there is a veil of cicatrix or flesh, and it is close to the penetration, then there is no surgery there but rather a way of trust and hope.
This condition can be treated in one of three ways: either cauterize it as we have said; or excise it until you reach its cavity, so that you can insert remedies and treatment is readily available; and do not excessively excise, lest you injure the underlying tissue, and the patient suffer from involuntary pain; and then treat it with what we have said, for a strong remedy will quickly heal; or, extend that veil, and cleanse the pus, removing it towards the anus as we have said, either with a probe or with another instrument with a sharp end, and subsequently treat those fistulous tissues resulting from the incision, in a way which allows you to use a crust; then, endeavor to restore the entire wound by excision, and if the opening above is not healed, and the fistula remains open in the anal region, it will be more easily tolerated by the patient. And sometimes the fistula ends in this way: when you insert the probe into the fistula, and it is situated in the folds of the anus around the body's surface and on the edge of the anus, then take a probe with a perforated tip, which is like a needle for preparing the skin in this manner:
and insert it into that fold, wrapped in five or around those folds; and then insert the probe with the thread into the fistula until you reach its cavity.
But if it penetrates the edge of the anus near the interior, then you remove the thread from that hole as you would insert your finger into the anus; and you pull out the end of the thread and join the two ends together, tightening each one, and leave it for a day or two.  And whenever you cut the thread into the flesh, firmly tighten it until the tissues that lie between the two ends of the thread are cut and fall away.
And then treat the wound until it is healed and sound.
But if the opening of the fistula is not penetrating, then make it penetrate, in whatever manner you have prepared, but not too much on the perineum, for you should not do this so as not to cut the sphincter; and then treat it until it is healed.
The shape of the spatula with which the fistula is opened: one curve is very sharp, and the other part is blunt, so that it does not cut what is unnecessary, as sometimes happens.
Of the suturing of hemorrhoids in which blood flows in the incision of those.
Hemorrhoids are of two types, for either they are between the buttocks like bunches of grapes, or they are like bunches of raisins. And they are small or large, and whether blood flows from them constantly or is single, or multiple, and are outside the anus, and at its extremities.
However, those that are outside the anus are according to the times of little moisture, from which flows yellowish water or a little blood with a continuous substance, and according to the color of the substance.
And the treatment of those inside the anus is that you command the patient to sit and press until the anus is stretched and the hemorrhoids appear to you. Then you grasp and lift them with forceps or nails, and then cut them off at their roots.
But if the forceps are not able to hold them due to their moisture and softness, then take them with a rough cloth or cotton or wool floss, and pull them out with your fingers, and then cut them and sprinkle some hot powders onto the cuts, to be instead of cautery; or cauterize them according to what is described in the chapter on cauterization. And then treat them with the other treatment until they are healed.
And if the anus does not yield to evacuation, then prick the patient with a cautery in which there is a small bite, and wash it with what is in the anus, so that it yields to evacuation easily when the patient is straining.
But if the hemorrhoids are outside the anus, then the cause is slight, and you should grasp them with your finger, or forceps, cut them, and then treat them as we have said until they are healed.
And whoever has made incisions, must stitch them in this manner: take a thin thread and insert it into a needle, and then pull the hemorrhoids apart on both sides, and make the needle pierce into the other side, and tie both ends of the thread to the lower section of the needle, and do it horizontally; and tightly constrict the hemorrhoid with the stitch, and then knot the thread and pull out the needle.
Do this to all of them, and leave one, do not stitch it, so that the excess blood flows from that one.
Then place a cloth soaked in warmed oil or ointment on the anus; put it on the area and tell the patient to rest. And then leave it until it is set; and when it has set, treat them with ointments or other remedies until healed.
And if they are old and no longer responding to that medicine, then you must scrape them with the tip of a spatula or your fingernail until they are moist and the scab of pus on top is removed, which prevents them from healing; and then treat them until they are healed.
Then you scrape them with a more forceful scraping than the first until much blood and they are scraped; and then treat them until they are healed.
Know that a certain ailment, this is important, and it is not anything other than a reddish spot according to the color of the body, like a nail head, and it is found throughout the body, but especially in the parts below the feet and fingers, and is frequently followed by pain due to its presence.
And then it is necessary to cut what is in the surrounding area of the ailment, and hold it with shears or tweezers, and uproot it from its root; and then treat that area.
And if you wish, cauterize it according to what is prescribed in its chapter.
But a wart is a small, rough, fistulous, round elevation on the surface of the body, and it often appears on the hands of children.
And its treatment is to scrape and cut it, or to squeeze it with a file or a needle until it bursts. And if you wish, cauterize it, as we have said, with fire or with a sharp medicine.
However, a pimple is a small, ulcerated or fistulous, large elevation on the body's surface, often found on the face.  When the cold touches it, a sensation similar to an ant bite is felt, and it is often distributed around the body.
And its treatment is to take a hollow quill from a bird of prey (like a hawk or a vulture), a strong one, and place it over the pimple, until the affected area is contained within the quill's circumference;  then rotate your hand with the quill until you have cut through the material surrounding the pimple, and place it on the skin, and remove the pimple from its root.
And if you wish, do this with a quill of iron or steel, according to this method:
The part of the quill above the opening should be thin, closed (meaning not perforated), wrapped so that the grip on it is easy and the rotation is smooth.
And if you wish to cauterize the pimple, do so as described earlier in the section on cauterizing ulcers in the chapter on cauterization.
Concerning the instruments that are used for giving treatment.
Sometimes treatment is done with silver or brass or molten or hammered iron; and sometimes it is done with those instruments, small or large, depending on who is receiving treatment, for the one used in treating small children should be small, and those for whose bottoms are sore or painful, the treatment should be applied with small tools.
The form of large and small treatment (or instruments):
The head of the cannula, on top of which the pouch is tied, should be wide in this way; and should have a distinct area where the pouch is tied, just like before.
And the lower end, which is inserted into the rectum, should be completely closed (i.e., not open) very finely tapered; and on one side there should be two holes, and on the other side one hole, and the size of the holes should be according to the thickness of the rays and slightly bigger ones are smaller.
And the pouch, in which the bladder medicines or sheepskin is placed, should be a palm's width in length.
And it should be perforated with many holes, in the same way it is rolled; and if the space between the holes is the thickness of a finger.
Then insert into those holes strong, thick bile, perhaps ten parts, or around that; and attach the pouch to that.  And when the pouch is in place, tighten the head of the container tightly between two dividers with strong constriction, and then fasten each hole with that.  However, the manner of fastening with it is that you fill the pouch with the medicine, which should be heated according to the patient's tolerance; and be careful that it is neither too hot nor too cold.
Then have the patient lie on their back, raise their legs, and place a cloth or a sheet under them; and then anoint the end of the cautery with oil or egg white or fenugreek mucilage or something similar; and then insert that into the rectum with ease.  Then the attendant takes the pouch and squeezes it with both hands forcefully until all that is in the container is evacuated into the bowel; and then remove the container, and the patient lowers their legs to the wall.
And if the medicine forces the movement this way, keep it in place as long as possible; and if they sleep with it for an entire night, it is more effective in providing relief.
However, if you use this method for ailments of loose bowels and expulsion from the body, then you should repeatedly use the cautery until it is healed.
And if there are hemorrhoids or festering sores in the rectum, then the container should be very small and thin, like the containers used for children's treatments.
Concerning the treatment of plagues.
I have already stated in the division of the treatment of plagues what was appropriate for the book, and I thus state the treatment of those ailments with hands and with medicines according to their completion.
Therefore, I say that plagues are diverse depending on how the plagues are caused and depending on the location on which the plagues manifest.
And the causes for which plagues are often caused are like the throwing of stones, or the cutting with a sword or knife, or a blow with a spear, or with a club, or with an arrow, or similar to those from many causes.
However, the plagues that occur in various parts of the body are like a plague that strikes the head, or the neck, or the feet, or the belly, or the liver, and similar to those affecting other limbs.
And I am recounting the treatment of some plagues so that you might apply that reasoning and rule to other plagues.
And I will begin with the simple plagues of the head, for the recollection of the compound ones will come at the beginning of the third chapter.
Therefore, I say that when a simple plague occurs on the head, and it is not a fracture, then consider: if it is from a thrown stone or similar, and the skull is merely cracked and is a serious wound, and you fear the development of a festering boil, then you should quickly lance and bleed the cephalic vein immediately.  Do not delay; and remove from him the blood according to his strength, if there is no other reason forbidding bloodletting, especially if the blood flowing from the wound is little.
And the bloodletting should be on the opposite side of the wounded area; and keep the patient from overeating and consuming heavy foods and drinks.
But if some reason prohibits the bloodletting, then the diet should be lessened, and he should avoid meat and wine.
And if a festering boil develops on the wound, apply a compress soaked in heated, perfumed oil or wine with astringents.
But if a festering boil is certain, then apply to the wound, if it's recent, its own blood, and if the air hasn't altered the powder which I'll describe shortly.
And if the air has already altered it, then apply some ointments until it heals.
But if the wound is large, or caused by a cut or similar injury, and the edges aren't brought together with stitches, then bring them together with stitches, as I will describe concerning their suture.
But if the wound has already exposed the bone and sinew, and there's no retention of the bone but a small suspension, then cut that away and treat the wound with medicines and restore the flesh to its proper place, and command the patient to eat foods rich in strength: heads of various kinds of vegetables and similar items until it is healed.
And if you find putrefaction in the bone and it is not adhering to the bone, then you cut away all that which is rotten and discard it, and then treat it further.
But if in these wounds there is an artery or vein from which blood might flow, and it is not severed by medicine, then you search for the artery, and if you find it unsevered, then you cut it with a spatula, or tie it off; and if necessity compels you that what we have said is not appropriate, then you cauterize it until the blood is stopped.
And if these wounds are simple and small, then the cause of them is slight;  so that you may powder those wounds with this powder, which will solidify them before the air alters them.
And the method of the powder is this: take one part of oil of rosemary, two parts of dragon's blood, and three parts of unquenched lime;  have them all finely ground and sifted, and apply the powder to the wound, and bind it tightly until it adheres well, and is coagulated with the blood.
And then bind it with bandages and leave it, and do not remove them until it is no longer inflamed, for the medicine is not eradicated from there until it is healed.
And sometimes it does this alone, when you do not have rosemary and dragon's blood readily available.
And you do this same procedure on large wounds when it is necessary to apply it and bandage them, and on fresh wounds with their own blood, which the air hasn't yet altered.
And if the air has altered them, especially in summer, then this powder application is not appropriate. Instead, treat them with what we have already mentioned, or apply digestive ointments, or dust them with flour of barley mixed with water and honey until a scab forms; then continue with the other treatment until they are healed.
But if a wound happens to have a fractured bone, and it is small, then you extract it with a gesture.
And I will describe the treatment of head fractures in what follows.
Of wounds to the neck.
But if the wound is on the neck, there is no difference in treatment between a wound to the head when it is simple.
But if the neck wound involves an incised nerve or artery, if it is a nerve, there is no good treatment for it other than avoiding any treatment that causes severe astringency, like using zinc and vitriol, and things similar, for they harm the nerves and contract them. And do not apply any cold substance to the wound, for the substance of the nerves is cold, and their continuation is with the brain, which is the highest of all the members.
And if this is treated with mild medications, such as washing with fresh water, sometimes infused with rose oil or unperfumed oil, and  using poultices when washed with fresh water and other softening stones according to this method, and moist ointments.
But if the wound is large, then administer sutures, or close its edges, and then treat it with powders until it is healed.
But if the wound is deep, or if the injury is in the lower part of the flesh, then pierce it in the most depressed location.
But if an artery is already cut in the wound, and blood is flowing, then separate or tie it off, or cauterize it if necessity compels you to do so.
But if the vertebrae of the neck or the entire neck have been cut, and the veins of the neck are preserved, then you should close the edges of the wound with sutures on the neck's bone and do not touch it; first align it and return it to its natural form, then strengthen it with appropriate binding, and leave it for some days; then treat it with ointments that are astringent and stimulating until it is healed.
But if the wound has affected the bone, then you should clean it, and if there are bone fragments, remove as many as possible; and what you are unable to remove, leave it until the wound begins to suppurate, and is separated, and the discharge is eased.
And if the wound is recent, then sprinkle powder on it, the powder that has been recommended to you. But if a fistula has formed in the wound, then treat it with what the recollection will provide in its relevant chapter.
If it is a blow from a spear or a knife, and you assess its depth, then consider if there is windiness [or gas] when the patient breathes; if so, know that the wound is fatal.
And if there is no depth to it, and the wound is fresh with its own blood, then you put powder on it in the first hour, and do not press it so that the blood is not trapped in its depths and returns to the heart and kills the patient, but instead, apply a drawing ointment, and apply it again twice a day.
And if the ointment is not available to you, then put old wool in the opening of the wound so that it absorbs any moisture; and have the patient lie on the wound so that whatever is concentrated there may drain out.
But if three days or more have passed since the wound, and you observe no spasms, tremors of the heart, or constriction of the windpipe, and other good conditions are present, then know that the wound is salvageable; and then treat it with cauterization and other remedies until it is healed.
But if healing is not possible, and the wound is permanently open, then know that a fistula has formed; therefore, treat it according to the appropriate chapter [of medical procedures].
And if the wound is from a cut with a scalpel or knife, and is simple on the surface of the foot or back, then treat it with sutures if it is large, or with powders if it is small.
But if it has already penetrated the bone, and you have already cut out pieces of it, then you should probe the wound and try to extract those pieces, if they are separated. But if they are not separated, then leave them until the wound can heal, because their removal is made easier.
And for other wounds occurring on other limbs, the method of treatment is the same as what we have described.
Of wounds of the belly.
The ailment which afflicts the belly is either severe, or slight, or moderate.
A small rupture is difficult to mend by another method, and if the reduction of the protruded parts is not done immediately, the process becomes more difficult, because the opening enlarges and the return of the parts becomes difficult.
Therefore, a moderate rupture is best, for in it the reduction of the intestine is not difficult, unlike the two types previously mentioned.
And know that the suturing of the abdomen is according to four methods, but two sutures are common and appropriate for the suturing of other parts of the body.
And two other sutures are specific to other parts of the body, yet they are particularly suitable for suturing the abdomen.
And I will explain each to you with explanation and declaration.
Therefore, I say that when the wound is small and some part of the intestine has protruded through it, and it is difficult to return it, then this is in one of two ways: either due to the smallness of the rupture, as we have said, or when the intestine has become inflamed due to the coldness of the air.
And therefore, when this is the case, you should warm it in such a way that you immerse a sponge or damp cloth in lukewarm water alone, or that you gather water with mint, cyperus, and spikenard, and apply that to the intestine until the inflammation is resolved.
And sometimes, it works better with some astringent added, and it is better than water alone in resolving the inflammation.
And therefore, when you see the inflammation resolved, then you moisten the intestine with water in which mallows and althea have been boiled, for by this the inside of it is relieved with little difficulty.
But if the inside is not adequately relieved by this treatment, then you should carefully cut the rupture slightly with an instrument with which hemorrhoids are incised.
And the first treatment is better, when it is suitable, rather than incision, and there should be no attempt to dry it out when there is need and deficiency.
Of the instrument, take note of its shape:
One part of it is sharply curved, and the other part is not sharp, and the tip is thin, and it should not be as thin as a spatula; rather, it should be slightly blunt.
And therefore, when the wound is enlarged and the intestine protrudes, then its return must be according to its natural shape, into its proper place, if possible, for this is better.
But when the rupture is wide, and is in the lower part of the belly, then you must have the patient lie on their back, and raise their legs higher than their head; and if it is in the upper part of the belly, then you place their head and feet higher than the lower parts.
And similarly, if the rupture is in one of the two parts of the abdomen, then constantly focus your attention and consideration on this, so that the part where the wound is higher than the other.
And thus you must administer this in large wounds and in medium-sized wounds.
And in small wounds, place what you have prepared, and then have the assistant hold the rupture entirely with their hand and bring the edges together, and then determine whether there is a suture or some other remedy needed.
And this is the common method of suturing: take a needle, or several needles depending on the size of the wound; and then insert it at the edge of the rupture near the ring finger, and carefully push the needle through, and, without putting pressure on the two ends of the thread, together with the two ends of the stitching thread beneath the thread of the inner parts, until you make it penetrate from that side; and you have already brought together two ends of the thread and two ends of the stitching thread, and this makes four sutures.
Then tighten with a double thread around the needle, sometimes from two sides at once, and then bring the edges and the wound together in a proper manner; and then leave the thickness of the finger and insert another needle into it, and then tie it with thread as you did with the first needle; and do not cease to do this with needles if necessary until you have completely closed the wound.
And the needles should be medium in size, neither too thin nor too thick, because thin needles easily pierce the flesh, and thick needles are difficult to insert into the thread, and therefore they should be medium in thickness and fineness.
And the needle should not be inserted into both ends of the thread too close together, so that the flesh is not easily pierced and the wound breaks open before it has healed.
And the sutures should not be too long, so that the wound is not prevented from healing.
And then cut the ends of the needles so that they don't bother the patient while they are sleeping; and place powdered substances spread around, covering the ends of the needles; and leave them until you know that the wound has already healed.
And this type of suturing with needles is most suitable for small wounds, for in their suture, one or two, or around that number of needles suffice.
However, the second suture is more common:  and it is that you suture the four ends (of the thread) and two ends of the bandage, all at once, with a needle that is finely wrapped around it in terms of both fineness and thickness.
And then, when you have pierced these four ends with the needle, pull the needle back from the same place you started, so that the thread is retracted from the most superior part of the wound,  so that the suture is like a cloth stitch, with the cloths being tightly bound.
And place the thickness of a little finger between each stitch.
And this suture is known to men (or, more literally and perhaps more accurately: This suture is known by men).
And with this suture, I closed the wound that had occurred on a man's belly, which had been wounded with a knife.  The wound was a disruption greater than a palm, and about two palms of the intestine had protruded from the middle area, and the rupture was in the middle of the member; and then I returned that which had been outside the wound (the intestine) after it had been outside for twenty-four hours.
And the wound was consolidated within fifteen days or thereabouts, and I healed him, and he is healthy; and after that he lived for many years, and he remained in his proper disposition (or: recovered his normal state).
And the other physicians had judged that he would not recover; and by a miracle it was, for I did not heal him with an ointment, for it was in a place where no ointment or medicine was found, but I placed old wool on the wound twice a day and diligently washed it with honey water until he was healed.
But I will tell you two kinds of sutures, appropriate according to the narration of Paraula.
And it is that you begin with a suture of the cord (or thread), and insert the needle from the outside to the inside.
And thus, as the needle penetrates the cord (or thread) and in that same laceration, according to its shape and length throughout the body, and leaves the end of the thread where you have inserted the needle; and make the needle penetrate from the inside to the outside at the other end of the wound.
And when you have made that penetration, then you make it penetrate again in that same wound from the outside to the inside; and leave the end of the thread that is in this wound, and insert the needle at the other end from the inside to the outside.
And make that penetration with your penetration, which you make into the thread at the wound's end, which is on its side, until all of that is penetrated.
And then, starting from this same side, sew it with the end of the thread on the other side, and remove the needle from the thread which you penetrated, and then return it to that thread and sew the end of the thread that is on the other side with this end of the wound; and remove that from the thread that is on that side.
And do this once and again, and do this once more and again until you sew everything on the outside according to that example.
And the sum of this way of sewing is that you sew with a skin stitch, with which you sew skin, in such a way that you sew the thread once from the end of the thread, and you leave it another time until you have completed it.
However, the second type of appropriate suture, which you rightly call "Gualia" – and this is according to his and for him recounted advice – is that you stitch it according to a similar method by which some healers stitch it, in such a way that they join each part to its corresponding part appropriate to its nature; and they apply the end of one to the end of the wound, and this is done as I have instructed you.
You must put the needle into the end of the wound close to the external part, and make it penetrate to the inner part in that single place, and leave both ends of the thread; and then turn the needle and make it penetrate from the outside to the inside in both ends of the thread.
And then turn each of those, and make each penetrate from the inside to the outside in two other ends of the wound, on the opposite side.
And this method of suture is better than the ordinary superficial suture, and is the suture of which a previous recollection has been made.
This is the teaching of Gualia.
And moreover, some might say that the suture of the abdomen is rectified with two needles, meaning that you insert a thread into each of them, and begin with the insertion of the needle from your side, and make it penetrate to the other side according to the suture of those who know how to sew skins equally.
And know that when a rupture is in the middle part of the belly, then the suture there is more difficult than in other parts of the belly.
But the judgment of the treatment of plague is a judgment like that of other plagues.
Which means that when you get the recent plague with its blood before the air alters it, and you return the intestines and sew it up and treat it properly, then you should place the flesh-promoting powder on it.
And if the air has already altered the plague, then place on it some poultices that are available to you until they form a hard crust, and the pus falls out, and are healed firmly and watched over; then treat it similarly to the treatment of other plagues until it is healed.
But if the medicines are not available to you, then apply it immediately, after it starts to form pus, a thick cloth, and change that twice a day, as you have been taught, until it is healed, for you will not need other medicine in many situations when the plagues are simple.
But if you fear that the plague might spread to the main limbs, then you should soak lion's wool in tempered olive oil, or in rubbed olive oil, and place it around the areas between the armpits and under the armpits.
And if you feel pain or putrefaction in his bowels, for this often happens, then treat that with strong, black wine, and especially if the pus has reached the intestines and has made a penetrating exit into their cavity.
And know that that which is in the large intestine is easier to heal than that which is in the small intestines.
And it is difficult to heal, for the intestine called "jejunum" does not receive healing from the plague that strikes it at all; and this is due to the large multitude of veins within it and the magnitude of those within, and the subtlety of its structure, and because of its proximity to the nature of the nerves.
But if what is proceeding from the plague is the lining of the intestines, and you find it recently affected, reduce it according to your method for reducing the intestines as well.
But if it has spread to the surrounding areas and is already green or black, then you should apply a strong pressure with a cloth over the discolored area, so that blood flows, because the tissue contains veins and arteries.
And then, cut what is beyond that ligament, and suspend the two ends of the cloth from below the affected area, so that you relieve the pull from the affected area away from the tissue damage and the spreading of the plague.
A reminder of the plagues when they occur in the intestine.
When a rupture occurs in the intestine, and it is small, it is possible that it might be restored in some cases.  Therefore, I witnessed a man who had been afflicted in his belly by a lance thrust, and the plague was on the right side of the stomach, and the plague had become an established fistula, and it expelled gas and wind.
Then I considered the treatment of him, although I wasn't confident in his recovery, but I still tried to carefully tend to the wound until it healed and the area was consolidated.
And after I saw the area had healed, I considered the possibility of further illness affecting his belly; however, no further illness occurred and he remained in his normal state, eating and drinking, and afterward, he went bathing and resumed his activities.
And some experienced people have said that when a small rupture occurs in the intestine, it should be bound in this way: you should take large ants; then you should bring together the two edges of the wound and place one of those ants with its mouth open over the two edges of the wound; so, when it bites them and closes its mouth, you should sever the ant's head, as it has adhered and will not be dislodged.
And then place another ant next to the first, and continue doing this with ants, one next to another, according to the size of the entire wound.
Then you reduce and bind the wound; and those ant heads remain attached to the intestine until it is healed; and no harm comes to the patient.
And it is also possible to bind the intestine with a fine thread made from the intestine of an animal, once it has been put on a needle; you should take the end of this thread, which should be very thin, and tie the end of the thread to the thread, wrapping it.  Then, push that thread through needles and bind the intestine with that thread, returning it to its place within the tear/rupture.
And this method of suturing with ants is only by way of trust and hope.
But if the wound is large and extensive, especially if it is on one of the delicate intestines, because then it is only a refinement, and not a complete healing of it.
Of the treatment of ulcers and fistulas.
Know that any wound or abscess, when it ages and becomes chronic, and is an ulcer that does not heal and continues to discharge pus constantly and is not excised, then, in any limb, is universally called a fistula, and we call it an ulcer in this case.
And a fistula, according to truth, is a hard, white, fibrous growth, without pain, and having a cavity similar to the hollow of a bird's beak; and for this reason it is called a "knotty ulcer", that is, a "beak".
And in some people it is moist, which discharges pus; and often the moisture is easily excised in a few hours. And sometimes this moisture is thick, and sometimes thin, and sometimes large, and sometimes subtle.
I have already shown all those causes, and the signs of them, and their treatment with medicine in the division.
And it is necessary that I make you understand the treatment of a fistula, which is done through surgery with a hand.
And know that fistulas occur in all parts of the body; for there are fistulas that reach large veins and arteries, or nerves, or the spinal cord, or the intestines, or the bladder, or to one of the ribs, or to some of the vertebrae of the spine, or to any of the compound joints such as those of the hand and foot; and those that are close to the main limb and similar parts.
Therefore, those fistulas that occur in this manner are among the difficult-to-heal illnesses, and they do not receive a cure, and attempting treatment is labor and ignorance.
And if any of the fistulas has a depth that does not reach the places I have mentioned, and you hope and trust in its cure, and wish to gain knowledge of it, then take a probe or a iron rod, and if the fistula is going in a straight direction, you will find it with it.
But if the fistula is winding, then investigate it with a probe of fine lead, for lead, due to its lightness, is easily bent towards the winding path.
And if the fistula is very deep, it is not possible for you to determine its location with a probe.
Then irrigate the openings through their openings, for the moisture you irrigate will flow towards the other openings and run from them.
And then inquire thoroughly, in whatever way is possible for you to understand if there are bones or nerves present, and if the fistula's cavity is deep or close, or if it is a fistula with many openings and that all is present there with the full extent of your strength, through your questioning, with which you question the patient, and the discovery of the pain through your pressing with your hand on the affected area, and noting the signs and the accidental causes of an abscess.
And when you have considered all these factors with true understanding, then proceed to the treatment according to your judgment:  and consider whether the fistula is an apparent near-surface one, or is in a saline area, far from a joint, or nerve, or artery, or vein, or one of the locations that I have told you about.
Then you dry the fistula as previously described, removing the filtering material and the corrupted flesh, and whatever has grown within the opening of the flesh, or tissue, or similar things, and heal it until it is healed.
But if the fistula is of deep origin, and as is appropriate, then it is necessary to cut it open as much as possible, and then clean it thoroughly of all its corrupt flesh; and then apply some bandages containing sharp medicines, and introduce them into the cavity of the fistula, which you have opened with an instrument.
And do this repeatedly until the sharp medicine has corroded everything that remains within the fistula cavity from the corruption.
And then restore it with ointments that generate healthy flesh until it is healed.
But if it is not healed by this, then you cauterize it as we have described.
But if the cause of the fistula is bone, and you have confirmed this, then you should examine and dry it as we have described, if you do not find any vein, nerve, or major limb impediment as we have said.
But if the bone is exposed and there is corruption or blackness on it, then you scrape it until all the corruption is removed; and then heal it with something that produces flesh until it is cured.
And if it is not healed and still discharges pus, then know that you have not completely eradicated the corruption; and then, you should expose it again thoroughly, perform a further scraping and cleaning of it using your strongest tools, and then restore it.
And if it is healed, well and good; but if not, then know that that corruption is in a deep, remote part of the body, which has not been reached, and then there is no remedy for you but to leave it be.
And if the corrupted bone is small, or it is possible for you to pull it out, then you should pull it out with delicate forceps suitable for this purpose.
And if there are many bones, then thoroughly remove all of them, and leave no part of them behind using your strength.
But if you encounter any difficulty due to the humors, and in their incision there is no fear or error, then cut through those ligaments or flesh if they are present, and free the bones.
But if you are not prepared to remove the bones immediately, then apply something to the wound that might close it, and leave it until it is surrounded by those bones, flesh, and ligaments, and keep the wound from healing, and make sure the incision you made in your operation is constricted.
Furthermore, if you fear this, apply to it cotton soaked in crushed oil, or cotton soaked in Egyptian unguents, or in other green ointments, for when those ligaments soften, and the bones are separated from them, the removal, and the pulling of them will be eased.
However, if it is a large bone, such as a leg bone or thigh bone, or similar to these, and only the surface of it is corrupted, then scrape that with a scraper only from behind until that blackness and corruption are removed, and then restore the wound.
But if the corrupted portion is large, and the corruption has reached the bone marrow, then it is necessary to cut that entirely, severing it down to the place where the corruption has reached, and then treat that until it is healed.
And I will tell you what happened to a man in his thigh, so that you may use it as an example and aid in your operation.
There was a young man, about 30 years old, who experienced pain in his thigh.  The internal parts of the body were affected by the matter spreading throughout, so that the matter had reached the thigh, and it was a large abscess, an internal abscess, and it was not an external cause.
And then the time was prolonged by the error of the physicians, until the abscess opened, and a lot of matter flowed out, and his healing was delayed until the leg became fistulous, and many openings were created in it, which all discharged pus and bodily fluids.
Then, a multitude of physicians treated him for about two years, and none of them were skilled in the art, until I was called in.
And I saw his leg and the matter flowing from those openings in large quantities; and the man's body was already emaciated, and his complexion was yellow.
Then, I inserted a probe into one of those openings, and the probe reached the bone.
And then I examined all the openings and found them extending throughout the leg from all directions.
Then I probed and incised one of those openings until I exposed part of the bone, and found it corrupted, already rotten and blackened; and a part of the leg had already become corrupted, having penetrated to the marrow.
Then I cauterized what I had discovered of the exposed bone.
And I judged that it was not in the bone itself, but that corruption that I had excised and cauterized, and I had already cauterized it.
And then I applied restorative medicine to the wound for a long time, but it did not heal.
And then I probed again and discovered, on the second layer of the previous discovery, further corruption along with the bone.
And I cauterized what appeared to me to be that corruption, and then I was forced to perform the healing and restoration of it, but it has not been restored.
And then I discovered it again, and I did not cease to cut the small bone little by little, seeking its restoration, and it was not restored until I cut about a palm's width of it, and I removed it with its marrow, and then I restored that with medicine, and it was slightly consolidated and healed.
And no further probing or cutting is needed in its operation, except for the weakness of the area, its little tolerance, and its fear of death, for it had seizures throughout the hours due to a surplus of a bad fainting-type evacuation.
Therefore, it is healed completely, and nothing is in the place of bone but hard flesh; and its condition in its body is good, and its strength has returned; and it has been restored to its functions, and I did not find any impediment in its walking or harm in any way.
However, if a prominent bone is located in a previously injured part of the body, then you should cut it in this way:  You should take a ligament and tighten it at the extremity of that prominent bone, and order someone to pull on it; then place a thicker wool ligament over the first one; and then tie that over the flesh beneath the bone, pulling the extremity so that you draw the flesh back, revealing the area you want to cut so that the cut doesn't harm the flesh.
And place a piece of wood or a board under the bone properly, for when you do this, the saw is not prevented from cutting the corrupted flesh.
And the sawing should be done on the corrupted area little by little, for if the corruption is in the cavity of the bone and does not appear in its visible parts, then the sawing must be repeated.
And if the bone is corrupted but not prominent, with one part continuing to the other, and the corruption is in the middle or a part of it, then you must uncover all the surrounding flesh; and then place wood underneath, and saw from one side to the other where the corruption is until the sawing is continuous on the other side.
And the sawing should be done along the area of the corruption a little at a time, as we have said.
And if the corruption is in the joint, cut that corrupted joint, and saw the bone where it continues from the other side.
And if the corruption is in the continuation of two joints, then it is not a rational problem, but rather a deceitful one.
And if the corruption is in the bone of the hand or foot, it is very difficult; however, you must investigate the corruption in whatever manner appears to you, and that you should expose and cleanse it according to any possible disposition, and by any means possible, so long as it does not affect any vein or nerve.
And know that the tools for cutting and sawing these bones vary according to the bones' location, their preparation, their thickness, their subtlety, size, and smallness, and their hardness and rarity.  Therefore, you must prepare suitable instruments for each type of operation.
And know that this operation indicates to you the type of instrument you need; when great study, long experience, and knowledge of the methods of this art, and observation of illnesses, are yours, then you will know what instruments are appropriate for each illness yourself.
And I am now presenting at the end of this chapter the list of instruments you will need, along with their basic uses, with which you will proceed with your surgical procedures which you will then put into practice on other patients. Shape of saw:
Shape of another saw:
Shape of a large saw:
Shape of a ray: Let the head of this ray be shaped like a star-shaped keyhead, and its points be shaped like those of a star.
And it is not fitting except that with that [the ray] the heads of the joints are rubbed when they are corrupted, or the mouth is large and wide.
Shape of a smaller razor:
Shape of a lateral razor:
The shape of another saw, properly made:  Let it be an arc, most superior in its position, and the sharpness of its iron edge, and let its wooden part be a properly made stabbing blade/knife. Form of it/that:
Shape of a razor with a concavity:
Another, more subtle, shape of a razor:
Shape of another razor with a curved tip:
Shape of a small razor resembling a tendril/whip:
Shape of another, smaller, cutting instrument:
Shape of another cutting instrument; this one resembling a ray, and its tip is like a saw, and it is used in many places in the treatment of bones:
Shape of a ray which is suitable for the treatment of that which is pierced/perforated by the bones:
And its tip is triangular and sharply pointed.
And it is made of Indian iron, and similarly, all the instruments we have mentioned – razors, cutting instruments, and saws – should be made of the same.
Of the cutting edges and the sawing of bones.
The extremities can be affected either by intrinsic or extrinsic causes, or if your treatment with those medicines fails to cure the corruption, or if the corruption extends to a limb unaffected by any apparent cause, then you must cut into that limb until the corruption is exposed, so that the patient escapes death or more serious harm to the limb.
And the sign of the affected area is that the limb becomes black, as if fire has already burned it, or the blackness will spread until the hardness that has penetrated the limb and spread throughout the body; and therefore cut into it with a cutting instrument.
And similarly, if the cause of the corruption is the sting of some poisonous creature, such as a scorpion, a viper, or a toad, and the like.
And if the corruption or injury is in the extremity of the finger, then you cut the finger and do not allow the corruption to spread into the hand.
And similarly, if it affects the hand, then you cut it from the base of the forearm, and do not allow the corruption to spread into the arm's forearm.
And if instead, it affects that area, then cut the arm up to the elbow at the joint.
And if the corruption passes beyond the elbow, then in that case, death is the patient's fate; and administering any other remedy for this is a waste of effort.
And similarly, for the foot, when corruption affects the toe, then you cut it down to one of the joints.
And if it takes hold of the sole of the foot, then you cut off the entire foot. But if it ascends to the knee, then you cut the leg up to the knee joint.
And if the corruption has already reached above the knee, then there is no cure, only resignation, and leaving the patient to death.
And the method of cutting or severing the limb is that you tighten the ligament in the area just below the part you want to cut, and tighten another ligament above the area; and the minister extends a ligament to the parts below, and the minister extends another ligament above; and you separate the flesh that is between the two ligaments with a sharp instrument until all the flesh is exposed; and then it is cut or severed.
And it is necessary that a cloth be placed on all sides so that the area does not touch anything, and that the patient receives a carefully applied wound dressing and a cautious abscess.
But if you encounter a flow of blood while working, then you cauterize the area thoroughly, or place some blood-stopping powders on it; and then return to your treatment until it is completed.
And then bind the injured limb with suitable bandages, and treat it until it is healed.
And I relate to you what happened to a man on his foot, this same accident which I and you have recounted, which is that blackening occurred on his foot due to a burn similar to a fire's combustion.
And that corruption first occurred in his toe until it spread to his entire foot.
And then that man prepared himself, knowing that the treatment would affect the limb with the intensity of the pain and burn he experienced, and he incised that foot down to the joint, and the burn healed.
For a long time, that same corruption occurred in the index finger of his hand.
And then he came to me, and I was compelled to address that excess with what I placed upon his hand, as part of cleansing his body; and the excess was not dispersed, and it began to affect the other fingers until it spread throughout the hand.
And he urged me to cut open his hand, but I did not want to do that, hoping for the dispersal of that excess, and fearing that the hand would die because of the incision, for the patient's strength was failing.
And after he left me, he returned to his land, and later I heard that that man prepared himself and cut his entire hand open, and it healed.
And I have related this story only so that it might help in understanding this illness, and to signify how it should be understood and treated.
Of the treatment of sinuses and the quality of enemas with medicinal substances.
When an abscess occurs on any fleshy part of the body, and the space of the abscess enlarges until it collects pus, and then it bursts and is pierced, and the pus is released, and the area remains empty like a vessel, and the skin over it is thin like a fine cloth, and it has not progressed to a deeper corruption, and it does not affect the bone, nerves, or ligaments, it is called a sinus, and not a fistula.
However, if the space continues to enlarge until the corruption penetrates some body part, then it is called a fistula, and not a sinus.
And the treatment of it is to cut away that entire skin, just as it has receded, especially when it is thin and like a cloth, and to ensure that it does not adhere to the area because of its corruption.
But if you suspect the skin will adhere and that the corruption hasn't yet reached deeper tissues, and the skin has become inflamed on the surface, then treat it with an enema.
And if you are considering a sinus, and if it is large and the discharge has a foul odor, then inject that with an Egyptian medicine, which is of oil, sour wine, and vinegar in equal parts, mixed in a vessel and simmered over fire until the medicine turns to a reddish color and reaches the consistency of honey.
Then take what is necessary of this, dissolve it in water and honey; and inject it into the sinus with that, and compress the opening, leaving the medicine there for two hours.
Then, remove it with gentle pressure; and do this for as many days as it takes until the sinus is cleansed and the foul odor is gone.
And sometimes it's injected with water from ashes, when this medicine isn't available to you; and you should take the ashes of wood, and place them in water; and then strain that and inject the sinus with it until you are sure the sinus is now healed.
And if the patient cannot tolerate the Egyptian medicine or the ash water, then inject it with water and honey, and vinegar finely ground, and inject it with wine and honey mixed, because honey's property is to cleanse and wash, and wine helps adhere the sinus, especially when the wine has an excess of astringency and dryness.
And when you have done this several times and are sure the sinus is healed, then inject it with something that promotes flesh growth there.
And you should take diafinicon ointment and dissolve it with rose oil and astringent wine; or you should inject it with other medicines and ointments that have the properties which I have already written in the treatise on ointments.
And if the opening of the sinus is narrow, so the enema tube cannot be inserted, then you should widen it little by little with a small iron instrument, and apply a poultice wrapped in Egyptian or basil ointment until it is widened.
And similarly, if the opening is wide, then you should bring the lips together with sutures and leave it of such a size that the enema tube enters without difficulty.
And if the opening from which the branch [of the sinus] extends is elevated to the upper parts, then you should lower it to the lowest point possible so that the branch runs downwards, because when the branch is constricted at the depth of the sinus, flesh will grow there.
And if it is not possible for you to lower the sinus to the vicinity of the lowest bone as desired, then you must prepare the member with a preparation that allows the branch to run easily according to your equipment, and that no cause retains the branch within it.
But the one over the sinus's opening, which remains in place at all times to prevent anything that is joined to the branch from coming out. And so that you may know if what flows from the branch is much or little, or is digested or not digested.
And by this, you consider the location of that sinus; whether the patient feels pain there, and if it is an abscess.
And as your treatment continues in this manner, and you see that the matter discharged over the sinus opening has already adhered, or is about to adhere, then on the third day, you remove the adhesion.  When you remove the scab, change the cloth and renew the ointment.
But if from the sinus a subtle, spreading virus emerges, then do not despair of the adhesion, for its healing will happen eventually.  For there are some people in whom the generation of flesh takes a long time in their wounds, and for others, the opposite is true.
And if from the sinus, undigested matter has been discharged for many days, then know that the sinus will not adhere; and if the sinus's adhesion is delayed and the cause is prolonged, then you must adjust the drying nature of the medicines.  If the medicines are humid in their substance and virtue, they should be dried, like a diaphanous ointment, when the excess of the added substance has been adjusted.
The final step in the treatment is to take diaphanous ointment, dissolve it in rosemary oil, and add to it aged wine, until its substance is infused. Then combine these ingredients and use the resulting mixture.
And you can do something similar when there is no pus—using diaphanous ointment, honey when it is thick enough, and apply it; or take myrrh, aloes, and incense, grind everything into a powder and mix it with honey that has been heated until it is thick.  Then apply this mixture to a cloth and compress it over the sinus; or apply the thickened honey, powdered and mixed with a cloth, and compress it on the sinus.
Sometimes, aristolochia root and the roots of white lilies (and they are white lilies), and the flour of eryngo and centaury are administered with it. Grind these herbs and strain them, powdering them over the previously described honey; then use the mixture.
And if the sinus persists, and is not healed by this treatment, then know that the corruption is in the bone, or in other hard parts or ligaments; then treat it with a fistulous treatment, as described above.
Concerning the treatment of whitlows, damaged nails, the incision of a swollen finger, and its subsequent sectioning.
A whitlow is an abscess that arises under the nail of a finger of the hand or foot, though it frequently arises on other fingers.  When it persists and its treatment is less successful, or it becomes an abscess from a hot abscess, or is corrupted, it produces pus until it corrodes the root of the nail, and often corrupts the entire nail.  The corruption often spreads to the bone, producing a foul odor, and causing the fingertip to become blackened, its color turning dark.
And therefore, when you have done as we have said in the division and your treatment is not effective, then you should cut away all the excess remains of the nail with an iron, and then cauterize the wound, for a cautery is very helpful in this.
However, if the bone is sound and the nail is healthy, and the nail bed is already pressing against the flesh underneath, causing it to become inflamed and sore, then you should place a thin piece of a sharp instrument underneath the corner of the nail that is pressing on the flesh, and pull that flesh upwards, and cut that flesh with ease.  Then apply the remaining flesh to the corrosives and burning medicines until it is all removed; then treat that with ointments until it is healed.
But if the corruption has already reached the bone, then you must cut into the bone and remove it, for a corrupted bone will never heal.
And if the corrosion and corruption spread to the joint, then you should cut it open at one of the joints, according to its expected recovery, and then treat it until it is healed.
However, if the nail has suffered impact or abrasion, and there is intense pain, then you should initially bleed the patient, and then carefully trim the nail with a sharp instrument in a crosswise cut from top to bottom.  Be careful that the cut does not reach the flesh beneath the nail, for you will cause the patient intense pain, and it will lead to the growth of excessive flesh in the area; then treat the area with whatever alleviates the pain.
But a swollen joint, which is frequently found in the hands of some men, is easily fleshy, and easily located on the bones, or easily located on the nails.
And some of them arise at the base of the joint, or their origin is in certain joints of the fingers. However, that which arises in certain joints of the finger is not severe, and that which arises in the joints is easily severe.
And of those that are fleshy growths, the incision is gentle, and you should cut it away from its base with a broad blade.
But for that which arises at the base of the joint, the cure is difficult; therefore, be cautious of its removal.
But for that which is grown on the finger near the joints, you must first cut the flesh with a circular incision until you reach the bone, then cut it off with one of the appropriate saws for this, and then treat it until healed.
However, if a hardening occurs on the fingers, either frequently or due to the person's birth, or from a wound, burn, or similar cause, then you must remove this hardening until the fingers return to their natural shape.
Then place between them cloths soaked in rubbed oil, so they don't heal too quickly, and separate them or put a thin lead sheet between them until they heal correctly.
And similarly, if hardening occurs on any finger with the palm, then you remove this hardening according to its preparation and the member's proper shape.
Of incisions of veins, these are varicose veins.
Veins are varicose veins, and they are swollen, thick veins full of melancholic superfluities that appear in many parts of the body, and mostly in the legs, especially in the legs of travelers, laborers, and those who carry heavy loads.
Therefore, you should administer purgation of the body of black bile several times with strong expulsion, and then bleed the patient from the basilic vein.
But the cure for them with iron is according to two methods: one is that they are incised and that black blood is drawn out, and the other method is that the vein is raised and entirely extracted.
The section of it is done in this way: first, soak the leg in very hot water until the thick, phlegmy blood from the leg is resolved, then tightly bind the patient's leg from the upper thigh area down to the area below the knee with a bandage.  Then, cut the vein in one, two, or three places with a wide incision, and then elevate the black blood with your hand from the lower part of the leg upward and downwards, until the amount of blood you desire has been extracted, which will remove the effects of the illness.
And then tie it up, and command him to abstain from foods that generate black bile.
And repeat the cure by phlebotomy when the veins are filled and this is noticed by the patient.
But the raising of them is done in this manner: you raise the patient's leg, if there are many hairs on it, then put him in a bath and soak his leg in hot water until it turns red and the veins are prominent; or, if a bath is not available, exercise it by strenuous exercise until the limb is heated.
And then dry the skin directly over the vein by cutting it lengthwise or behind the knee, or at the very bottom of the leg below the ankle.
And then open the skin with hooks and scrape the vein from all sides until it appears, and it is towards the appearance that you will see that redness turns to blackness.
And then, as you squeeze, from the skin you see a white thread-like thing.
And then you place a poultice under it until it is raised and pulled out of the skin, and suspend it with a hook or a lion's claw.
And then make another incision near that incision every three days, and then scrape the skin above the vein until it appears.
And then lift that [affected part] and cut it in a second incision towards the heel, and then pull it out and lift it until it comes out through the second incision, and then pull it out from the incision above that.
Do this until you remove that [affected part] from the incision that is highest or most prominent of all the incisions, until it is all out; and then cut it open.
And if you are unable to extract and lift it, then insert a needle with a strong, double-edged blade, and cut it, and pull it out, or insert a poultice under it and move your hand in all directions until it is thrown out. And be careful not to cut it; for if it is broken, it is difficult for you to lift that much and it has become a harm to the patient because of that injury.
And when that has been completely removed, then place on the affected area wool soaked in wine and oiled and unoiled, and treat it until it is healed.
And if the vein is constricted, having twists where it is wrapped around parts, and it is not straight as we have said, then you must cut across those twists and wrapped parts, and then suspend it with hooks until you lift it all up.
And be careful in your cutting not to cut the vein and not to harm it, for it will be difficult for you to lift it; and use your prudence in this.
Form of the incision with which the vein is cut:
It is not so sharp as the hooks, nor does it have a sharp tip so that it does not injure the vein; and it is of strong flexibility, like a lion's, for if it were delicate, it would cut the vein due to its delicacy; therefore, it has an unnecessary thickness, as we have said.
Of the extraction of the vein of the leg.
This vein is generated in the legs in hot lands, like in the land of the Arabs, and in the hot and arid lands of India, with little moisture, and in which no grass or tree grows.
And it is readily generated in other parts of the body besides the legs.
And its formation is from putrefaction arising from under the skin, like serpents, worms, and maggots that breed between the skin and the flesh.
And a sign of the onset of this vein is a vehement inflammation in the leg; then the area becomes blistered; and then the vein begins to emerge from the area of the blister, appearing like the root of a plant.
And then, when the extremity of it appears, you should wrap a lead weight around it, of which the weight is one drachma, or two drachmas, and bind it, leaving the lead weight suspended from the leg.
And whenever any cause of it is found externally, wrap that in lead and bind it. And if it is prolonged, then you should cut off a part of it and wrap the remainder; and do not cut into its root until it has come out completely, for if you cut into it, it will retract and enter the flesh, causing abscesses and possibly a severe ulcer in the area.
Therefore, it must be treated gently and extracted little by little, until it is completely expelled from behind it, and no part of it remains within the body.
And from this vein, there have been cases in some men where it has reached a length of five palms and ten fingers, and I have been informed of one case reaching twenty palms.
And if it is incised during its treatment, then insert the instrument into its opening and pierce through it with a long instrument, until everything contained within the material is evacuated.  Then, treat the site for a few days with medicines to address the putrefaction, and subsequently heal it like any other abscess.
And this vein sometimes has many branches, especially when it appears at the joint of the foot or on the foot itself, and emerges from many openings, with each opening having a branch.
Therefore, treat it in the same way as we have described in the division and with the previously mentioned methods.
Of the incision of worms generated under the skin, and it is called the bovine disease.
This illness is called "bovine disease" in some lands near us, because it often affects cattle, and it is a small worm that is born between the skin and flesh, and travels throughout the body, ascending and descending, and is sensed moving from limb to limb until it bursts through the skin and comes out.
And its generation is due to the putrefaction of certain humours, in the same way that worms, serpents, earthworms, and ascarids are produced in the belly.
And it is feared because of its malice, for when it travels through the body and reaches the head, and arrives at the eye, it then often causes intense inflammation, enters and destroys the eye, and this happens frequently.
And therefore, when you wish to cure it and extract it, it is only done by following its movement and appearance as sensed, and then you must tightly bind and constrict that which is above and below it, and then carefully cut around it and extract it.
And if it is embedded in the flesh and you cannot find it, then you apply a cautery with fire to the area until it dies, and the greatest feared consequence is its corruption, which corrupts the area as we have said.
And if you see that being near the eye, then tightly bind the area above the eyebrow with a firm constriction, and then carefully cut around it, and extract it; and it is necessary that the patient use remedies to cleanse their body of the bad putrid humours, and guard themselves from foods that cause putrefaction.
Of the section on the illness of the nose.
This illness is called "nafir" in our land, and is a pain that comes to some limbs, and then moves from limb to limb.
And I have already seen that as I told you. I was called to a sick woman in a village, and I examined her arm and saw a small swelling in the vein of the arm, and after I stayed for an hour, I saw that swelling move about like a worm climbing, but more swiftly than a worm might, like a bit of living silver moving from place to place.
And then the pain went to that spot and settled in the muscle, and then I stayed there for an hour.
And then it moved to the other limb until it reached the other arm.
And then it continued to move around her whole body as I watched; and I was very amazed by its movement from one limb to another and its speed. And I had seen this before with my own eyes in that manner, but I have seen many instances where pain moves from one limb to another. But I did not see it with my eyes in such a way as in the woman.
And I did not think it was anything else, except that the woman was old, with dry body and exposed veins, and in this condition the movement of the air became apparent to the senses.
And it is necessary that this kind of reaction not appear in those who are delicate, with moist bodies and hidden veins.
And if you want to cure him, and the patient feels that pain, then it is not apparent to the eye as we have said.  Then you should gently and subtly press on it until the trapped air is released, and cauterize the affected area.
But if you do not see it with your eyes, then treat it with an emetic to expel the air, and use remedies like foul-smelling pills, or pills of serpentine and similar things.
Of the extraction of arrows.
Arrows are diverse according to their types and the parts of the body they are aimed at, for their variety is such that some have large points, some small, some concave, and some blunt; others have three angles; and some have tongues; and some have barbs.
And the signs of the brain injury, when an arrow strikes it and pierces the skull, are sudden violent pain, and dizziness, vertigo, pain in the eyes, inflammation and redness of the tongue, spasms and confusion of the mind, vomiting of bile.  The ability to speak is lost and the voice is destroyed.  A white, powdery moisture similar to pus leaks from the wound, and the area around it has the appearance of rotting flesh.
Therefore, if you see these signs, then refrain from treatment and the extraction of the arrow, unless it is protruding from the body.
However, the signs of an arrow striking the heart, especially if it's near the left breast, are that the arrow feels firmly lodged in a solid place, not a hollow space; and the movement of the arrow is readily felt, similar to the pulse, and black blood flows from the wound.  The extremities feel cold, the body sweats cold, and there are fainting spells.  Therefore, know that death will certainly follow.
And the signs when the arrow has struck the lung are the outflow of frothy blood from the wound, and the vessels near the neck become inflamed.  The patient's complexion changes, they breathe heavily, and crave cool air.
And if the arrow strikes the membrane around the foot, the pain is near the small ribs.  There is a significant tremor with intense pain and sighing, and all the muscles of the limbs are affected.
And if the arrow strikes the stomach, then food will soon come out of the wound, undigested.
And if the arrow strikes the abdomen, and is lodged there, there will be some opening in the wound, or the tissue or intestines will be torn.  There is no hope of a cure without removing the arrow.
And if the arrow strikes the bladder, and urine comes out from the wound, and some cause for the external parts is present, and pain is soon upon the patient, then know that it is fatal.
However, the other limbs, such as the face, neck, throat, shoulders, the extremities, the vertebrae of the back, the collarbone, the hip, and the leg and their similar members, are saved according to the greater provisions if the arrow does not strike a vein or artery, and it is not a poisoned arrow.
And I tell you this, which I have seen concerning these arrows, so that you may use it in your own treatment.
Which is, because in a man an arrow struck the tear duct of his eye, at the root of his nose, and I extracted it from the other side, below the ear, and he was healed, and no harm occurred to his eye.
And I extracted another arrow from a Jew, which struck him in the eye's socket, below the lower eyelid, and the arrow was already embedded, and only a small tip with which it adhered to its shaft was recovered. It was a large arrow of the sharp arrows of the Turks, with a lion's head on it, which had no fletching.
And the Jew was healed, and no harm came to his eye.
And I extracted another arrow from a Christian man, which had lodged in his throat. It was an Arab arrow, the kind with fletching.  It was already embedded deep in his throat.  I then carefully worked around it, and extracted it, and the Christian man was healed.
And I extracted another arrow from a man, which had lodged in his abdomen, and I thought he would die from it.  However, after thirty days had passed, and no change had occurred in his condition, I cut into the arrow and worked around it, and he was healed, and no further harm befell him.
And I saw another man in whom an arrow lodged in his back, and the wound healed over it. But after approximately seven years, the arrow emerged from the root of his thigh.
And I saw a woman in whom an arrow lodged in her abdomen, and the wound healed within her, and there was no change in her condition, and the woman did not suffer any harm to her natural functions.
And I saw another man in whom an arrow lodged in his face, and the wound healed and the arrow remained, causing not much pain, and many similar cases like this.
And I extracted the arrow from the king's prince, which had lodged in the middle of his nose, and had already slightly deviated to the right side, and the entire arrow was concealed.
And I was called to treat him approximately three days after the arrow struck him.
And then I found the arrow wound very tight; and then I probed it with a thin probe, and I felt nothing; but he felt a prick below his right ear, and then I suspected that this prick was from the tip of the arrow.
And I applied a plaster to the area, one with attractive and digestive properties, trusting that the area would become suppurative so that the arrow wound would appear, and thus heal over it.
And no significant event occurred at the site, that the arrow had actually penetrated that spot; and I continued with the plaster on it for many days, and no accident occurred; and the wound meanwhile consolidated, and the patient remained from the extraction for many days, until one day he felt the arrow inside his nose, and reported this to me.
And then I applied a sharp, corrosive medicine to the wound for many days until it opened up, and with the probe I examined it, and found a thin arrowhead, still attached to the shaft.
And then I applied the corrosive medicine to the wound, so that the arrowhead became visible, and I dealt with this over a period of about four months.
And then, since the wound had become aggravated, and it was possible for me to insert forceps into it, and it remained, and did not yield, then I did not cease to devise and work on it with mechanical methods, until one day I began, by applying expertly crafted forceps, (as will be described in the conclusion of this chapter) to extract it; and then I healed the wound.
Some doctors thought the cartilage of the nose would not be restored, but I restored it, and the wound consolidated, and the patient recovered completely and suffered no further harm.
I am telling you about the extraction of arrows so that you may understand and learn from this what I have not yet said, for the parts of this art and the definitions thereof cannot be fully grasped from my narrative or contained within this book.
Skilled craftsmen compare the small with the large; and the present with the absent; and discover novel operations and instruments to remove foreign objects from the body when accidents occur.
Therefore, I say that arrows are not driven from the members into which they are lodged except in two ways: either by pulling on the place where they entered, or by pushing them out from the opposite side.
That which is driven out from the place where it entered, or is an arrow lodged in fleshy tissue, is pulled out and removed.
And if you do not adhere to this procedure at the time of extraction, then you should leave it for several days until the surrounding flesh has healed, and the pulling and removal are facilitated.
Similarly, if it is lodged in bone and you do not follow the procedure, leave it for several days and repeat the pulling and movement each day, and it will eventually be removed.
And if you do not follow the procedure for several days, then you must perforate the area around the arrow in that bone from all sides with a fine tool until the area surrounding the arrow is enlarged, and then remove it.
But if the arrow is hidden within the body, and is hidden from feeling, then you should search for it with a probe, and if you sense it, then pull it out using tools suitable for the extraction.
And if you cannot reach it because of the tightness of the wound and the length of the shaft, and it is not over a bone, nerve, or vein, then you should work on the wound until it is widened and the arrow can be extracted.
And if it is held by the ears with which it is lodged, then you must free the flesh in which it is lodged from all sides with all the skill you can; and attempt this, and if you cannot do so with the freeing of the flesh, fracture the ears and twist them until it yields.
And when you perform the extraction of the arrow in whatever location it is, then you should use twisting of your hand with forceps on all sides until you make it yield; and skillfully, with delicate care, ensure that the arrow is not broken, and that you have an easy pull and extraction.
And if you cannot remove it at the time, then leave it for a few days until the surrounding parts can heal, and then repeat the attempt when it is less painful. But if you encounter excessive bleeding, then you should administer the treatment we have discussed in its chapter.
And exercise caution in cutting a vein or nerve, or tendon, and apply your skill in every possible way to removing the arrow; and do this with ease and tranquility, with slowness and firmness, as I and you have recorded.
And therefore, position the arrow in a way that the patient's body is in the same position that the arrow struck them, because this is most helpful. But if that is not possible for you, then you should administer what is possible for you according to the positions.
But if the arrows are protruding from the opposite side, or if some part of the arrow is already outside, or if the arrowhead is crooked as perceived by the section above the closest tendon and sometimes even the one that projects out; then you should cut at that point; and let the incision be according to the amount that the forceps take; and then pull it out, for it will be easily released.
But if it is lodged in the bone, then you should twist the blade in the opposite direction until the arrow moves into the bone, and pushes itself out, and then remove it.
And if not, leave it for a few days, and then try again until it comes out.
And if the shaft of the arrow is inside, then you push it out with it.
But if the shaft has fallen and you want to administer an impulse, then you insert it, if it is blunt, with a concave instrument so that the concavity enters the arrow's head, and then push it out with it.
But if the arrowhead is concave, then you push it out with a strong instrument entering it, for the arrowhead is loosened by that.
And if the arrowhead is poisoned, then you must hollow out all the flesh in which the poison is, if it is possible for you to do so, and then treat it with whatever remedies are appropriate.
And if the arrowhead pierces the foot, or the belly, or the bladder, or the side, and it is close enough so that you can touch it with a probe, and it is possible for you to cut around it, then cut around it and be careful not to injure a vein or nerve, and remove it, then dress the wound if necessary, and treat it until it is healed.
Form of forceps with which the arrows are pulled out:
Their ends should be like the beak of a bird, shaped like a saw, so that they grip the arrow and don't let go.
And of these, many types are made, large, small and medium, according to the size of the arrow and its smallness, and the breadth of the wound, and the patient's strength.
like a ray, so that the insertion of it into the concave arrowhead is eased and it is pushed with that.
Of phlebotomy of the veins.
The veins for phlebotomy, of which there are a customary thirty, are mentioned in chapter sixteen.  These include two pulsating veins near the ears, called *alhasisain*; two veins in the temples, *apparentz*; two veins in the tear ducts (of two eyes), called *aspicientz*; the vein in the middle of the forehead; the vein at the tip of the nose; two veins at the neck; two veins in the upper lip; two veins in the lower lip;  and—these are the veins called *algelic*— two veins beneath the tongue. However, the veins that are to be bled in the arms are five. One is the cephalic vein, located on the outer side of the arm, and is called "the head vein" by the common people.  It's superficial, a middle vein, composed of a branch from the basilic vein and another branch from the cephalic. The people call this "the vein of the whole body." The basilic vein is located on the inner side of the arm, and is called "the vein of the stomach" or "citillar" by the common people; it runs along the inside of the arm, near the elbow; and the vein that is bled from (and which appears prominently).  There's also the "salvatella," the vein between the thumb and the little finger, and it's located in two folds.
And in the foot and leg there are three veins. One of these is located below the bend of the outer knee; the second is the *sophena*, located beneath the inner side of the leg; and the sciatic vein, located beneath the outer side of the leg.  There are other similar veins in the leg.
The bleeding of veins near the ears is for headaches, migraines, fever, and old, bad sores of the head.
And the method of bleeding those veins, as I recommend to you, is as follows:  place a cold cloth on the patient's head, and rub the patient's head in the occipital region where both veins lie, with a wide cloth, applying firm pressure.  Press the patient's neck firmly with a bandage until the two veins and their locations near the ears, in two indentations of the head, are visible; feel for them with your finger, and if you feel the pulse of those veins with your finger, then proceed with the lancet.
Now take the lancet, which is the sharp instrument, and insert it under the vein into the fold until the bleeding reaches the bone. Then lift your hand with the vein and the fold upward and cut the vein with a sharp incision. And the length of the incision should be about the width of two fingers; let the blood flow out as much as you want.
And then apply powders and leave it until it is healed.
And the incision of those and their cauterization have already been previously described at the beginning of the book.
But of the two arterial veins that are in the temples, the relief from phlebotomy is for ancient migraines, often evil, and persistent ophthalmia, and discharges of acute superfluities into the eyes.
And the method of performing phlebotomy on those veins is as I instruct you: press the patient's head firmly until the two veins are palpable through obvious appearance and the pulse of each is felt beneath your finger; then you apply the lancet.
Then, raise the skin above the vein with your index finger, and insert the lancet underneath and lift the vein upward; and incise it just as you did the other two veins; and let the blood flow according to your needs.
Then, release the patient's grip, and place your finger on the vein for an hour, and then apply bandages and powders and compress it tightly, and leave it until it is healed.
And the recollection of them, and the incision, and the extraction, is already described at the beginning of the book.
Therefore, the benefit of phlebotomy of the frontal vein is suitable for phlebotomy of the cephalic vein in cases of old facial ailments, migraine, stiffness, and foul-smelling ulcers.
And the procedure for the phlebotomy is as I recommend to you:  the patient should hold their head together with a bandage until the vein appears; then, take the instrument called the 'fossor' (which is of this shape):
Place the pointed end of the fossor on the vein and pierce it with a hammer or similar tool, in the manner described, and let the blood flow according to the desired amount; then release the patient's grip and compress the wound until healed.
And sometimes it is opened with a lateral phlebotomy, however, the phlebotomy should not be with a sharp point as with other phlebotomies, but with a blunt edge, and phlebotomize it across, for the bone is nearby and very strong, and the phlebotomy would break there if it were too thin.
However, the benefit of the two veins situated near the lacrimal glands is for scabies of the face, stiffness, and inflammation in the eyes, and other facial ailments.
The procedure for the phlebotomy is that the patient should hold their neck together with a bandage, and then the phlebotomy should be performed, and you should be standing over the patient's head.
And the phlebotomy should be made across the length, with a shallow incision, for there is little flesh at that location; and if the phlebotomy is too thin, the instrument's end will likely break.
And then allow the blood to flow as much as necessary, and apply cloths there, and keep them pressed for a night, and then loosen them.
However, phlebotomy of the nasal vein is beneficial for acute fevers and violent headaches, and for facial ailments, migraines, and inflammation that occurs on the face, especially when it is chronic.
The procedure for nasal vein phlebotomy is that the patient should hold their neck, and you should hold their nose with your left hand.  Take a long, thin lancet and insert it into the middle of the nose's bridge, in a straight line, because the vein is not clearly visible there.  Once inserted, blood will start to flow immediately.
You should use the small lancet carefully, and let the blood flow as needed; and then bind it up for a night, for the area will heal quickly.
However, the benefit of phlebotomy on both sides helps with breathing difficulties, the onset of leprosy, many illnesses, skin sores, corrosive ulcers, and shingles.
And the procedure for phlebotomy on those sides is that the patient should grip the neck on both sides with a bandage; the physician should stand over the patient's head, and the patient should be seated on a chair.
Then, carefully and gradually lance the vein along its length with a wide lancet; and draw out blood in a measured quantity or as much as is needed; and then do the same to the other vein.
Then remove the bandage and bind the two veins together with a moderate constriction to prevent the patient from being suffocated, and leave it until morning because the wound will heal.
And the benefit of phlebotomy on the veins in the face is effective for small abscesses and pustules of the mouth and gums, bad ulcers and fissures, and bad ulcers on the nose and its surrounding area.
The procedure for phlebotomy on those areas is to have the patient sit before you, and tie their neck with a bandage, then pull back their lips and locate two veins, one on the right lip and the other on the left; their location is shown by their dark color, for there are many small dark veins surrounding them; then cut into each one with a careful incision.
But if you have doubts and cannot tell which is which, then proceed with an incision on the largest and most clearly visible of those veins.
And do the same with the two veins that are on the upper lips.
But for two veins that are beneath the tongue, the remedy is to perform phlebotomy on the cephalic veins (in the neck area) for conditions affecting the uvula and the mouth.
And the procedure for performing phlebotomy on those veins is to have the patient sit between your hands, facing the sun, lift their tongue, and look underneath it, where one vein is on one side and another on the other side, and the color of each is tending towards blackness.
And then phlebotomize each; and be careful not to cut too deep when phlebotomizing those veins, for beneath them are arteries.
And the veins that are phlebotomized in the elbow are common to all men, and their phlebotomy is done in two ways: either with a phlebotomy lancet or a small olive-shaped lancet; or with a phlebotomy knife, called an *alnessil*, and this is its form:
Its blade should be like this, and it is suitable for opening concave, full, and visibly large veins, and for those that contain thick, clotted blood.
And this phlebotomy has a smaller width and a more slender tip, and it is suitable for phlebotomies of thin veins that contain thin, citrus-colored blood.
However, the benefit of phlebotomy of the basilic vein, which is one of three veins, is that it extracts blood from ailments located below the throat and neck, and from those affecting the feet and belly.
And it is suitable for the phlebotomist, when performing phlebotomy on that vein, to be very careful and cautious, because there is an artery below it.  If they err and misplace the phlebotomy puncture, they will cut this artery and cause a flood of blood, so it is necessary that you do not phlebotomize it with a pointed lancet, but rather with a cutting lancet, like a lancet with a bevel.
And if the basilic vein is not clearly visible, then you must leave it and move to another, or search for one of its branches; or phlebotomize on the outer part of the arm, because that is visible; and cut it with a bevel-edged lancet, as we have said.
But if you want to phlebotomize the same vein, then before constricting the arm, you must touch the area until you locate the pulse point, and then press on it with your thumb. Then, bind the arm and cut the vein with a concave-edged lancet, like the bevel-edged lancet we mentioned before. Be careful that the incision avoids any space near the artery.
And when you, by tightening the ligature, see swelling at the point you marked with your thumb, then that swelling is swelling of the artery, and therefore avoid that area.
And if you see the blood flowing during the phlebotomy like a child's urine, and the blood is thin and red, then know that it is arterial blood.  Then you should stop and place your finger over it for a long space of time; then remove your finger, and if the blood has stopped, because many times it stops, then you tighten the arm and leave it.
And watch the patient closely, and let them be careful and don't move that area for several days until it is healed.
But if the blood does not stop, and you realize you don't have the right medicine for this, then you should cut into the artery, if it seems necessary to you; for its extremity is constricted, and the blood will stop; or you can take a fig bark, crush it, and take half of it, pressing it over the vein area with a tightening bandage and with powders until the next day.
And if the blood has stopped, then good; but if not, then treat it with whatever was used previously to remember the place of the powders that stopped the blood flow.
And the stopping of the blood flow is difficult in many situations because of the small size of the wound and the possibility of the arm being tied up.
However, for the vein (vena fusca), phlebotomy is helpful by drawing blood from the upper part of the head and the lower part of the body; because it is composed of a branch of the basilica vein and a branch of the cephalic vein, as we have said.
And it is important for the phlebotomist to be cautious during the phlebotomy, because below that is a nerve; and if, during the puncture, the phlebotomist hits the nerve, it will cause the patient to be stunned, and healing will be difficult. Often, the patient will not be fully healed.  This nerve is sometimes noticeable, and if it's hidden from some people and is subtle and not immediately apparent, then you must use the phlebotomy instrument with careful cutting, and use your strength to avoid the nerve.
And if the vein is between two nerves, then you should cut the vein along its length.
The benefit of phlebotomy on the cephalic vein is that it draws blood from the head and relieves illnesses of the eyes.
And in this case, if you wish to make a phlebotomy puncture, use an olive-shaped or myrtle-shaped phlebotomy instrument; for it is the safest of all veins, as it is neither below an artery nor a nerve.
However, in some men, a boil is quite likely to form if not treated by phlebotomy on the first attempt, but you should not injure that abscess.
The first of these is that you should know that phlebotomy is performed only for the preservation of health and for the hope of preventing illnesses.  Phlebotomy should be done on one of the veins in the elbow, namely: cephalic, basilic, and median cubital; and that it should be performed at the beginning of spring, on an empty stomach in spring and autumn, and in winter close to mealtime, when signs of fullness appear.
And phlebotomy should be done on the third day or the first after three hours have passed.
However, phlebotomy should be administered, when there is a suitable reason and necessity for it, whether by night or by day, at any hour and at any time.
A child should not be bled until they are fourteen years old, and a pregnant woman should not be bled until the fourth month, and the elderly, those who have passed sixty years, should not be bled.
And if someone wants to be bled, in any way, it is necessary that they cleanse their bowels before the phlebotomy with a cleansing enema, if they have much retained waste.  This is so that the veins do not draw the superfluities from the bowels, which are unclean, and which will not harm the main members [of the body].
Patients suffering from nausea, vomiting, or indigestion, or recovering from illness or drunkenness, should not be bled until these conditions have subsided.  Nor should patients with dropsy be bled.  Furthermore, phlebotomy should be avoided in cases of colic, vomiting, abdominal distress, or excessive sexual activity, hard labor or exertion, fasting, or vigils, and any other activity that weakens the body's or soul's strength.
And one should consider the subtlety of the humors beforehand.  If the blood is thick, use food and drink, and if possible, medicines to thin it.
And if no reason forbids it, one should enter a bath, or engage in some exercise, to thin the blood.
And perform the phlebotomy on the patient in the morning, around the third hour (of the day), as we have said.
Ensure that the patient's feet are protected from all harmful animal spirits that day, such as anxiety, anger, fear, and all bodily discomforts, such as excessive exertion, pain, sexual activity, and similar afflictions.
And in his presence, apply substances, customary for humans, with aromatics, scents, balsams, and similar things, according to the possibilities.
And have the phlebotomist sit on a cushion higher than the cushion of the person who is to be bled.
And then, the phlebotomist should stretch out their arm, and rub the area with their hand two or three times; then, they should tighten the bandage with a strap and wrap it around twice.
Let the constriction be moderate, for when the constriction is not sufficient, or is excessive, then you should prohibit the flow of blood; or if it is with softening, then you should also prohibit the flow of blood.
And now, the person to be bled should rub their hands together until the veins are swollen and visible.
And now, the phlebotomist should anoint their lancet with a little of the best oil; and then place their left index finger over the vein, below the spot where they want to make the incision, so that the vein recedes slightly, and the percussion is stopped. For the veins are like a fleeing cord towards the incision, and those are full of air.  When you place the lancet on that one, it contracts towards the incision, and the phlebotomist knows whether the incision is on the vein or not; and if the lancet doesn't open the vein, that is the wrong one.
Therefore, for this, the phlebotomist must be careful and diligent in all these matters.
And then place the lancet, but if the vein is opened in one attempt, then it is good; and if not, repeat this procedure a little below or above that spot with haste, if the area is not inflamed.
And if the area is inflamed, or the patient is afraid, then you leave it for a day or two, and do not bind the limb tightly, for that will draw the inflammatory heat inwards, nor allow him to bathe.
And then repeat the phlebotomy if necessary.
And if the incision is small and blood flows subtly, and you fear that not enough blood will be drawn, then you repeat the phlebotomy in that same place, slightly adjusting the incision, and do this quickly before the area becomes inflamed, because many people develop inflammation from small incisions.
But if the area is already inflamed, then do not repeat the procedure there, for it will not benefit you at all; and place a piece of oil cloth over the affected area, for that will ease the flow of blood. And it is better to use this oil than other oils in this situation.
And similarly, apply a linen bandage after every phlebotomy, for phlebotomizing veins to reduce blood flow is done with the help of  tyria,  alfadoc and sagzenea (presumably different types of substances) when applied to the affected area, because the blood is thinned and is slowed when it is thick.
And if a large abscess forms at the site of the phlebotomy, which often happens, especially for someone who hasn't been bled before or if the vein incision was shallow, then you should apply a compress;  place a sponge soaked in warm salt water on the area and hold it in place for an hour, because that will dissolve the inflammation.
And you should do this near the point where blood is released from that vein, or a supplementary vein.
And if a dark or greenish discoloration remains in the area for a few days, don't be alarmed; if you wish, apply a mixture of aloe and myrrh, or some juice from mint or balm, or something similar.
And many times, abscesses and swellings occur after phlebotomy of the basilic vein.
And therefore place your hand on it, and if you find softness under your pressure, then that swelling is dangerous and bad; and then be careful not to apply anything mentioned before, for blood will easily flow from the artery.
Make a poultice of something astringent, so that the area hardens, and then cure it with other remedies until it is healed.
And it is necessary to draw blood from each person according to their constitution and according to the color and appearance of the blood.
For if the blood is dark, then you let it flow until it is red; and similarly, if you find it thick, then you let it flow until it is thinned; and similarly if it is sharp, until its sharpness is lessened.
And it is necessary for someone who is full, strong, and requires bloodletting in one sitting, that the phlebotomy on the vein be extensive and the incision be wide.
And for someone who is weak, the opposite should be done, and it is necessary to draw blood from them in smaller amounts, and the incision should be narrow.
And the best method in venesection is a transverse incision, not a puncture.
And this method of venesection is safer from blood flow and nerve injury, and is more praiseworthy and safer than venesection along the length or width of the vein.
And for those who are prone to fainting during venesection, you should treat them beforehand with a small piece of bread soaked in wine with pomegranate or simple warm honey; and draw off a little blood in three or four sessions.
And if there is coldness in the constitution, then before venesection, the patient should consume bread soaked in myrrh syrup, or honey syrup flavored with spices like pepper, cinnamon, ginger, and similar spices, or a strongly scented aromatic syrup.
And if fainting occurs during venesection, and is caused by the loss of a lot of blood, then they should drink water infused with meat and a very fragrant subtle syrup; and use aromatic herbs, such as chamomile, and soak their feet with it.
And use the other remedies mentioned in the section on fainting due to evacuation.
And whoever wants to heal their arm and dissolve their blood a second time, should be aware that venesection is a powerful evacuation, and its virtue is slow, evacuating blood gradually, according to the amount of the virtue over continuing days.
But if someone wants to heal their arm, and release their blood a second time, and their body is strong, then do this approximately seven or nine hours after the first venesection.
But if someone wants to draw their blood from the part of their body where it is accumulating, it is necessary for it to be healed on the second or third day.
However, if the body has already heated a lot of blood, is inflamed and causes a fever, it is necessary to drain a large quantity of blood at once, amplifying the procedure until fainting occurs, provided that you have maintained all the conditions of the venesection; and that you place your hand over the patient's pulse near the blood vessel, so that death ensues instead of fainting, for this frequently happens when the phlebotomist is ignorant and careless.
And when you want to heal the arm and drain blood a second time, once the vein's opening has been closed and the blood flow has become difficult, do not press on it forcefully, and do not extend the arm too much, for this is very bad.
Leave it until the arm is healed from a second bleeding; or deal with the blood clot forming in the vein opening by applying a poultice of theriac or saffron and compress lightly until the blood has come out.
And if the vein is infected, then leave it alone and do not touch it until the infection subsides.
And if necessity compels you to drain blood a second time, and there is no excuse, then you bleed from that spot, or from the other arm, from another vein.
And the vein called "the cord of the arm" is bled from the location of the cephalic or basilic vein, when these are not found or hidden, for it is made up of those.
And the method of bloodletting from him is that the patient should immerse their hand in warm water until the vein reddens and becomes clearly visible.
And then compress it gently with a moderate pressure; and then bleed from the vein along the short cross-section, neither laterally nor lengthwise.
And if the opening is wide, make your incision slightly above the joint of the hand.
And if the flow of blood is prohibited, then you should re-immerse the hand in warm water and allow the blood to run into the water until you achieve your desired result.
But if you are during the summer days, then you are excused from re-immersion of the hand in warm water; and in winter, the body is placed in warm water.
And bleeding from this vein is safer than from any other vein, for below it there is no pulsating vein or nerve.
And phlebotomy of the vein in the right hand's wrist is beneficial for liver ailments.
And the technique for phlebotomy there is to hold the hand with a bandage or your hand, after you have placed it in warm water, until the vein is inflated and clearly visible; then make a transverse incision; and if you cut it all the way through, that will cause no harm.
And be careful not to go too deep with the phlebotomy, for below that are the nerves of the exposed fingers.
And then return the hand to the warm water and allow the blood to flow from it, for if you don't return it to the warm water, the blood will clot in the opening of the vein, and flow will be prohibited.
And when the blood has been drawn to the necessary amount, then you should apply oil and salt to the vein so that it does not close up too quickly; and similarly, you should do this for every incised branch.
However, the benefit of phlebotomy on the left hand is that it is effective for ailments of the spleen.
And do likewise in the phlebotomy of the other hand as you did in the first.
And the benefit of phlebotomy of the saphenous vein is for ailments in the lower part of the body, such as uterine illnesses, and retention of menstrual blood, and ailments of the kidneys and old sores and ulcers of the thighs and legs, and similar ailments.
And the procedure for phlebotomy involves the patient immersing their foot in warm water and applying friction until the veins appear clearly; then bind the joint of the foot with a strap; and the location of the vein, clearly visible near the said point, and from that point many branches extend along the surface of the foot.
And therefore, phlebotomize the widest vein, either below the leg towards the heel or at its junction, for that is better and more beneficial.
And if you phlebotomize that on the surface of the foot, then be careful of the nerves that are beneath it on the foot's surface, and make your incision with the lancet across it, as if you were intending to cut it through.
And let the phlebotomy be done skillfully.
But if bleeding is prohibited, then you should re-immerse the patient's foot in warm water and allow the blood to flow from it until it is evacuated.
And if the phlebotomist errs in the first attempt, then repeat the phlebotomy a little further along, for the area is safe; and do not fear harming him, but rather be careful of the nerves, as we have said.
And similarly, do the same for the sole of the other foot as well.
And for the sciatic vein, the location, as we have said, is below the heel, beneath the bone of the outer side.
And the benefit of phlebotomy for him is in relieving hip pain when caused by hot blood.
And the method of phlebotomy for him is that the patient enters a bath, and quickly and tightly binds his thigh from the groin area upward to above the heel with a long, thin bandage for four days, as it is only apparent through this.
And then, when it appears, you perform phlebotomy on that area, according to whatever method is possible for you and appropriate to the vein, preferably; either incise it with an incision, or excise it through a resection, because the area for him is healed.
And it is very hidden in many men; and if you find it, and it doesn't appear in all its entirety, then phlebotomize a branch of it, and this is the one that appears on the back of the foot, between the so-called auricular and annular veins.
And be careful of the nerves, and draw off the amount of blood you desire.
And then loosen the constriction and place a poultice on the phlebotomy site and bind the area tightly, for it will heal quickly.
Of cupping and the qualities of using them.
Cupping is of horns, or of clay, or of glass.
And cupping is done in two ways: one of them is with scarification and the extraction of blood, and the other is cupping without scarification.
And this cupping without scarification is done in two ways, for it is either with fire or without fire.
And for cupping that is administered with scarification and blood extraction, there are fourteen locations on the body.  One is at the back of the head; another is in the middle of the neck; cupping on the chin, below the jaw; cupping below the mouth; on both shoulder blades; on the elbow; on the forearms (or "two arm-pits"); on the two kneecaps; and on the two thighs.
And cupping does not extract blood from major veins, but rather from smaller veins scattered in the flesh.  Therefore, it does not deplete the body's vital forces as bloodletting does.  Likewise, cupping with or without fire should not be done for any illness caused by fullness until the entire body has been evacuated.
But if need compels cupping for an illness or a continual condition, administer it at any time, at the beginning of the month, at the end of the month, and in the middle of the month.
Therefore, when any of these conditions occur, especially in the middle or third of the month, we recommend cupping be done after two or three hours have passed.
Cupping the neck is beneficial when it alleviates heaviness in the head and that which obscures the eyes; however, it must be part of a general evacuation of the entire body.
And this cupping is in the location of a phlebotomy of the cephalic vein.
And it is not recommended for use by those with a cold complexion, or those with a catarrh, as it would cause significant harm to them.
Therefore, it is not appropriate for use by the elderly, or those with cold illnesses in their heads.
However, for those who are continually suffering from this, the treatment is ineffective; therefore, you should instruct the cupper to place their hand slightly below the cupping glass on the lower parts, to avoid the generation of oblivion.
But cupping with alcohol is performed at the location of phlebotomy of the vena fusca and basilica veins: and therefore it is beneficial for asthma, and for the constriction of the lungs and the splitting of the lung tissue, and for coughs and fullness.
And the cupping glass with alcohol should be raised slightly, for if it is placed too low it will generate weakness in the body and stomach.
And cupping with *alhagdahan* is beneficial for accidental head pains, and for ophthalmia, and migraine, and fever, and toothache; and it is a substitute for phlebotomy of the basilica vein.
And you should instruct the cupper not to press their hand with the scarification tool, so that they do not cut the artery and cause a flow of blood.
And cupping under the chin is beneficial for inflammation in the mouth, and for corruption of the gums, and for similar mouth ailments, and it is a substitute for phlebotomy of the veins located on the two lips.
But cupping on both shoulder blades is beneficial for *caphatan*, which is caused by an excess of heat.
And cupping on the two areas inside the armpits is beneficial as a substitute for the phlebotomy of three veins, namely the basilica, cephalic, and basilic, because it draws blood from all the smaller veins in the flesh, and those small veins draw from the larger veins until the drawing is directed toward the three named veins.
And instruct the cupper not to proceed too deeply with the scarification, for the area is thin on flesh, and beneath it are nerves and arteries.
And a cupping that is applied to the buttocks is beneficial for hemorrhoids and ulcers in the lower part of the anus.
And it is necessary to instruct the cupper to use a large, bronze cupping, for the area requires strong suction; and small, delicate cupping is ineffective and should only be scarified with a specific scarification technique.
However, cupping of the legs is less effective due to its obvious limitations, as it draws blood from the entire body and is beneficial for old pains in the kidneys, bladder and uterus; it induces menstruation and benefits boils and tumors; and it serves as a substitute for the phlebotomy of two or more superficial veins and veins.
However, it greatly weakens the whole body and causes fainting in many people.
And the benefit of cupping to the corresponding areas is similar to the benefit of cupping on both legs.
And the proper application of cupping is to place the empty cup at first and create moderate suction, and do not prolong the application of the cups, but place them gently, and remove them carefully, allowing the humors to return to the area naturally. And do not stop repeating this process until the area becomes red and swollen, and the redness of the blood appears.
And then you make incisions and repeat the suction gradually, and then consider the condition of the body.
For that person with delicate skin, and prone to fear, you should make incisions only once, so that the area is not ulcerated.
And instruct the cupper to increase the incisions slightly, and moderate the suction with ease.
And if the blood is thick, then you should make incisions twice, for in the first instance, you open the path for the blood and its moisture to be drawn out. But in the second, to further investigate the removal of the thick blood.
And if the blood is very impure, then a third incision should be made so that the final removal is achieved.
And finally, when we want to remove the blood slowly or a little bit, a single incision is enough for us.
And if we want to extract a lot of blood, we make many incisions; and if we know that the blood is thick, then we should make deep incisions.
And the term for incision in which the depth is only the length of a fingernail.
And if the affected area has thick, hard, dark skin, and its pores are tight, the places where the cupping vessels are to be placed should be treated with softening, opening, and resolving ointments.  If it is summer, use almond oil, violet oil, gentle chamomile oil, or prickly poppy seed oil; and if it is winter, use narcissus oil, lily oil, camomile oil, or bloodroot oil, and similar preparations.
And if the excess is thick and cold, then the oil should be arnica oil, balm oil, almond oil, dill oil, and similar oils.
But if the area to be cupped has large pores and soft flesh, then oil should be avoided.  Instead, the areas around the cups should be washed with herbs, or with cold spring water, or with poppy, or with borage water, and similar preparations.
And if the person's blood is of a moist nature, wash their cupped areas with sour wine, or with water mixed with myrtle and sumac, and similar liquids.
And for those whose excesses are thick, wash the cupped areas with old wine, or with water infused with yarrow (which is marjoram), or a decoction of dill or chamomile, or similar preparations.
And the cupping should be done before a bath; if done afterwards, it should be administered shortly after the bath for an hour or two, and the patient should rest/sleep after the cupping.
What is it that should be regulated before cupping or bloodletting?
One must consider at the outset: if the person being cupped or bled is choleric and has sharp, inflamed blood, then they should take cooling things, such as sour milk, endive in sour wine, lettuce, secanabin, julep, and similar remedies.
And give them food like barley, and the flesh of small birds, and foods seasoned with vinegar, and similar things.
And for the one whose constitution is cold, they should drink almiara syrup, or alsecanabin seed syrup, and sumac, and moderately sweet wine;  and let it be recommended to them to use little food and drink, and let their food be barley, hemp, small birds, and pigeons.
And it is necessary that on the day of cupping and bloodletting, the drink should be more plentiful than the food.
And it is necessary to give certain men some theriac, or musk-based remedies, or alcelita, before the cupping or bloodletting, or shortly afterward, so that the main parts of the body are strengthened and the blood is refined; and they should not take those remedies when they are hot.
But the cupping, without scarification, should be placed over the liver, the spleen, gout, the navel, the knee areas, and the kidneys, for these parts of the body do not tolerate scarification on their surface.
And it is sought in these cases not for the drawing of blood from a part of the body, just as we place a cupping glass on a breast in a disease of blood from the nose; but we use this to dissolve the cold, viscous air from the part of the body, like when we place the cupping glass on the abdomen and navel; for it rarefies the part, warms it, and alleviates the pain, because it resolves the air.
And it is placed upon the temples when there is obstruction or phlegm in those parts, for by the virtue of strong suction, it easily opens the blockage and eradicates the phlegm from its location.
And similarly, it works when placed upon the liver and spleen to relieve air trapped within them.
And these cupping glasses are administered empty, with suction alone; and sometimes they are administered with fire.
And sometimes they are administered full of warm water in illnesses of the spleen.
And this is so that the cupping glass is filled and made larger, either with warm water alone, or water in which herbs suitable for this purpose have been boiled.
The form of cupping administered with fire: let the width of the opening be two fingers, according to how we have shaped it; and let the quantity of the heating be half a palm; and let it be on the patient's back, in the area that is in the center of the back; the hole should be small, just enough for a needle to enter.
Let it be made of a red or citrus wood, with thick edges,  lion, and rounded and smooth surfaces so that it does not damage the patient's limb, preserving its position on the body part.
And there should be a transverse rod of wood or iron in the middle, on which a candle with fire is placed.
And this cupping should be larger than the one previously described; and the smaller one should be smaller, adjusted to the illnesses and age of the user.
And the cupping for children and the weakened are different from the cupping for young people and those with strong bodies.
And the method of applying this cupping with fire to the limb is to light a fire with good wood,  using a small beeswax candle, and placing it on the middle of the transverse rod in the center of the cupping device, so the fire is ignited around the lower part, preventing the patient's body from being burned.
And then it should be placed on the patient's limb, and the finger should be on the opening we mentioned, until, when we have the cupping devices and we do not want the finger to show and the vapor to escape through that opening, the cupping will quickly be dissolved.
And relight the fire according to its method, and repeat it if necessary.
But a cupping used for the illness of pleurisy, with water, in which there is no transverse rod or opening, and is not administered except to be filled with water and placed on the limb alone.
And this is the manner of it:  The larger this cupping, the better, so that it can receive a greater quantity of water.
Chapter 97.
Leeches are not administered to many members, but only to those members where cupping is not possible, due to their small size, like the foot and gums, and similar parts; or to a limb devoid of flesh, like the finger and nose, and similar parts.
And the quality of using those leeches that you have found in the clear, shallow waters of muddy areas.
And then they [the leeches] should be left in fresh water day and night until they are hungry, and no food remains in their bellies.  And then, initially, blood should be evacuated through phlebotomy and cupping; and then, the patient's limb should be rubbed until it reddens; and then, the leeches should be placed on it.
And when they [the leeches] are full and have fallen off.
And if suction from the area with a cupping vessel is possible, it is better afterwards for healing.
And if not, then wash the area with vinegar and then with plenty of water; and it should be rubbed and squeezed.
And if the flow of blood from the area around the leeches' bite is prolonged, and is oozing, then you should dip a cloth in cold water and place it over the area until the oozing is stopped.
And if the blood is excessive, then sprinkle powdered vitriol, or other similar astringent substances, over the area until the bleeding stops; or place the roasted halves of beans on the affected area and leave them until the beans adhere to the area, and the bleeding is stopped.
And if necessary, repeat the application of leeches, when possible to change them.
And if the use of leeches is forbidden or suspended, then the area should be rubbed with fresh blood or a needle should be inserted into the area until blood flows; and then [the leeches] should be placed, because they adhere to the area as soon as they feel blood.
And when you want them to fall off, sprinkle a little powdered alum, or salt, or ashes, over them, and they fall off quickly.
Thus begins the treatment of the third part: of restoration. This chapter is very necessary in the art of medicine; and it is the restoration of fractures and dislocations of accidents in the bones.
Oh, son, know that foolish and vulgar physicians, and those who have never consulted the books of the Ancients nor read a single letter from them, boast about this chapter.
And for this reason, this manner of science in our land is private; and I have not forgotten this at any time entirely; and I have not adopted this that I have learned, but by the length of reading the books of the Ancients and studying their meaning, until I extracted the science from them.
And I have devoted myself to experiment and study throughout my life.
And I have already described in this chapter everything that contains my knowledge and upon which my experience has passed; since I have summarized this for you and freed you from the labor of elongation; and I have abridged it at the end of the abridgement; and have demonstrated it at the end of the declaration; and have formed in this many forms of the instruments that are administered in it, as is done by adding a declaration, just as I have done in the two preceding chapters.
First Chapter.
A summary and collection of the nature of bone fractures, and the necessary preliminaries before we begin to remember broken limbs and their various types. Therefore, let us state at the beginning of this chapter the summaries of the discourse; and the chapters whose understanding is initially required for the craftsman and to stand on the truth of those; this is you and those who are ready to learn this noble art, either themselves or from you.
And therefore I say that when an accident occurs such as a fracture, dislocation, twisting, or blow, then it is necessary for you to begin with bloodletting or to reduce the swelling, or both, if no cause forbids it, such as weakness of the body, or if the person affected is a child, or an elderly person in decrepitude, or if the time is of intense heat or intense cold.
And then, let their diet consist of cool herbs and the flesh of birds and rabbits; and forbid fatty meats and overfilling with food, and any food that fills the veins with blood, until you are certain of a hot abscess, and if you do not fear a discharge of matter to the limb.
And then return the patient to their initial state of health, with which they were accustomed.
And therefore, as the broken bone begins to be restored, then it is necessary for the patient to eat nutritious foods, thick, heavy, and viscous foods, such as foods made from boiled wheat with water, and rice, and dumplings, and the belly and insides of cows, and eggs, and fresh fish, and thick wine and similar to these, and with this regimen the fracture heals more quickly and better.
And know that broken bones in the elderly and the decrepit, in their first injury, cannot be healed and made whole according to their nature, due to the drying up of their limbs.
But nevertheless, nature adjusts and brings about a glue-like substance, thick and adhering, around the broken bone, until it is completely joined and bound together, until it reaches the point of strength and firmness, just as with fire at the beginning until no external force hinders its work.
And for this reason, it is necessary that the patient consumes foods that are heavy, viscous, and thick, as we have said.
And know that the types of fractures are diverse according to the diversity of the limbs, for a fracture of the leg bone is different from a fracture of the head bone; and a fracture of the foot bone is different from a fracture of the arm bone; and similarly, all the other limbs have different types of fractures.
And I will now come to a recollection of every type of fracture, explained in its own distinct chapter.
There is a diversity of fractures in themselves. And the types of bone fractures themselves are diverse; for there is a curved fracture, and one that occurs in star-like patterns; and sometimes a fracture runs along the length of the bone: and these are the fractures of the bone, jagged, splintered, and proceeding or non-proceeding, just as is the case with the pen when it is prepared for writing, and there is a fracture with a groove and rupture in the head, and there is a small fissure fracture.
And for every type there is a specific treatment or remedy in restoring it, as will be recalled distinctly in their proper places.
A sign of a bone fracture. And by this a fracture of the bone is known: it is the twisting of it, and the prominence and appearance of it to the touch, and this is felt when you press it with your hand.
Therefore, when there is no apparent twisting in the location, nor is it felt by your touch when you touch the bone with pressure and the patient does not experience significant pain, then there is no fracture here.
However, it is possible that there is a twisting or a small crack, so it is not necessary for you to examine it with your hand and with all the pressure; instead, place upon it the remedies of which the memory is relevant to that moment, the appropriate ones to the location, and then tightly bind it with a subtle bandage.
And know that when the location is bent but not split in two or otherwise damaged in such a way as to prevent proper alignment, when the whole part of its shape is restored, then you must begin immediately to straighten it, lest there be a harmful abscess.
And if there is a harmful abscess there, then leave it for several days until the abscess subsides; and then heal it by any means you can with gentleness and ingenuity.
And know that the restoration and healing of the soft tissues is easier than that of the bone, which has sustained damage.
And then bind it according to the memory of what is required.
But if the bone is fractured, then the fractured limb (whether hand or foot) needs to be extended by two parts, or with your hand if the limb is small, or with two ropes or one rope and your hand.
And be sure to position the limb in the correct natural shape, while the parts of the fractured limb are being stretched, then you must endeavor to return those additions to their places by skill and any means possible.
And be careful, through your treatment, not to cause pain or injury to the patient.  Strive to your utmost to put one bone back together with its fellow in their best alignment.
And it is necessary that at that time you skillfully touch it with your hand, and if you encounter any unusual cause, correct it and make it whole to the best of your ability.
Avoid excessive stretching and compression, as some foolish doctors often cause abscesses or contractions in the limb through their treatment, as we have seen in their many instances.
The proper support for a calmed limb is what I recommend; so that you know that broken limbs vary in their size, their breadth, and in the manner in which they are broken.
For those that are small, such as an arm, finger, or similar parts, then a wrapping of fine, soft cloth is necessary.
However, for larger limbs such as the thigh or leg, a firm, strong wrapping is necessary, for a firm binding connects the large limb tightly and firmly, so that no swelling occurs.
Then begin, after your treatment, to apply a suitable bandage to the fracture site, using three or four wraps, depending on the limb's needs; and gently tighten the bandage.
And then, with that, move to the highest part of the fracture site, and tighten the bandage less than you did on the fracture site itself. Then slowly loosen the bandage on the fracture site a little, and gradually relax the tightening, until you have reduced the swelling by a large amount.
Then take another bandage and wrap it again over the broken site, and then move the wraps to the lower part of the fracture; and your procedure should involve tightening and loosening the wrapping in the same way as described in the first wrapping above.
Then place between the wraps a linen or cloth pad to support the irregularity of the fracture, if there is any; if not, do not place anything there.
Then place another bandage over these neatly wrapped layers immediately, if there is no inflammation or hot abscess in the area.  If there is, place on it something that will relieve the abscess and reduce the inflammation. Leave that in place for several days, and then tighten the layers over it.
Let the splints be of half-cane, or of fine, well-formed wood, or of palm ribs; and let the width of each splint be according to this shape and form:
However, the splint placed over the fracture should be slightly larger and thicker than the others, and its length should correspond to the size and smallness of the limb; then, tighten the splints with another bandage, following your initial method of tightening.  Finally, tie it securely with thread, as previously described in terms of tightening.  The tightness should be greatest over the fracture site, and the tightness should diminish the further away from the fracture you go.
And the threads should be medium in thickness and fine, and made of linen; and if the threads are thick, as I have seen in the operations of some foolish people using twisted rope for threads, that is a major error, for it will disrupt the proper tightness.
Likewise, excessively fine threads are not suitable, for you will not achieve the desired tightness with them.  There should be at least a finger's width between each splint.
And if the patient complains of the edges of the splints pressing on their sensitive areas during the tightening, then place padding of soft wool or linen under those areas to prevent injury.
Sometimes a fracture is accompanied by a wound, and a dislocation occurs in the joint.  I will address this in the second chapter on unique cases.
And know that not every fractured limb is immediately fastened with splints; the reason is that when the limb is large, you should not apply splints until about five or seven days, or longer, depending on your assessment of whether a suppurating abscess might form.
This is the method of plasters with which the ancients treated fractures, dislocations, and twists.
A method of a common plaster for fracture repair, suitable for many constitutions, especially women and children, as it does not produce heat or cold: take pulverized flour, specifically the pith of the flour that remains on the walls of the mill after grinding.
And mix it like this, but sift it with egg white, and make the mixture neither too thick nor too thin; and then apply it.
Another method of plaster for treating fractures, dislocations, and twists: take asafoetida, opoponax, acacia, enula, and wild chamomile root (all of which should be a drachma each), myrrh and aloe (five drachmas each), aloes (twenty drachmas), all ground, sifted, and mixed with warm water or egg white if the patient's constitution is hot; then apply this plaster, as it is a good composition and heals slightly fractured bones, and is helpful to many people.
Another method of plaster helpful for fractures and twists: take wild chamomile and white marshmallow root (each a drachma), myrrh and aloe (five drachmas each), acacia (six drachmas), and Armenian bole (twenty drachmas).
All are ground in a mortar with thorough grinding, sifted, mixed with water or egg white, and applied.
Method of plaster for joints and bones separated from their place, and for accidental pain there, and for fissures and fractures: take wool, soak it in sour wine and cooked oil, and place it on the affected area.
However, this plaster does not have the virtue of restoration, but rather relieves hot abscesses and expels pain effectively.
Another method of plaster to restore a broken bone: take leaves of wild fig and leaves of wild poppy; grind them together and make a plaster from them.
A quick plaster for the restoration of a broken bone and when you want resolution of a remaining abscess: take roots of marsh mallow, chamomile, violet flowers, and elderberry flour; grind them all into a powder; mix it with wine, if the limb is not inflamed.
But if it is inflamed, then mix it with damp coriander water or with water and use it.
Another, stronger plaster for resolving a stubborn abscess that hinders the limb's restoration: take roots of marshmallow, linseed, elderberry, melilot, marjoram, violet flowers, chamomile; mix them into a paste; all ground into a powder and mixed with willow water, or fresh water, or wine, depending on the quality of the limb and the color's condition.
However, Hippocrates did not say in his book that a plaster should be placed on a broken limb for its restoration, but rather a cerate made of wax and oil, and nothing else; and he recommended it to be of medium thickness, neither too thick nor too thin.
But in Gaul, it is observed that plasters are placed on a broken limb to aid its restoration, and in cases of desiccation with a slight warmth, such as myrrh, incense, and similar things to the ones previously mentioned.
A plaster for wounds and pain: take equal parts of honey, human skin (or the skin of an animal), marshmallow root, and salt; grind them into a powder, sieve it, and form a plaster.
However, the length of time the bandage should remain in place, and when it should be removed, depends on whether pain, inflammation, or a bone fracture or dislocation occurs.  If none of these occur, then do not remove it for several days. And if severe pain, inflammation, or swelling occurs at the site, then you should loosen or remove it immediately and remove the plaster.
And take a clean cloth and a moistened marine sponge, and immerse it in lukewarm water, and use it to wash the area until the inflammation subsides and the pain is relieved; then let the limb rest for an hour.  Then place a piece of wool soaked in vinegar and olive oil (or just warmed olive oil) over it, and bandage it overnight, ensuring that any potential inflammation or pain is reduced or resolved, and that the swelling of the limb subsides.
And then apply a thin, small plaster, not as tightly as your initial application, and use it until the area is healed.
And if, at times, the abscess, swelling, pain, inflammation, and all the other symptoms are completely gone, and you no longer require the plaster and bandage, then you should apply another one, in the same way as you did initially.
And if no symptoms from those we have mentioned occur in the limb, then do not remove the bandage for three, four, five, or seven days; and sometimes it is left for twenty days, as indicated by the treatment of the limb, as we have stated, until the fracture heals and the flesh around it solidifies.
Then, make the bandage tighter than your first one, and increase the patient's intake of nourishing food, as dictated by the patient's recovery.
But if you find the fractured area already drying out and weakening more than necessary, understand that nourishment cannot reach it.  Therefore, bathe that area with lukewarm water every time you remove the bandage, and do so for three days.  Loosen the bandage slightly, and through this procedure, nourishment flows to the limb, facilitating quick healing.
However, what those foolish bone-setters do, restoring the limb fracture a second time when it was not initially set correctly, and setting it crookedly, is an error in their procedure and a great danger. If they were correct, the ancients would have written about this in their books and would have used this approach.
And I have not seen anyone of them do that, which makes it more reasonable that it should not be done.
Second Chapter: Concerning fractures when the head is injured.
The types of fractures are numerous, and their shapes are diverse, and their causes are distinct, for some fractures are caused by a blow with a blunt object, and the blow crushes the entire bone up to the spinal cord, which is beneath the bone, just as it does to a tree trunk; and therefore, this type is called a comminuted fracture; or the blunt object cuts a part of the bone and cuts the flesh and does not penetrate to the back of it; and this type of fracture is called a simple fracture.
And the severity of these two types of fractures can be great or small, and the fracture may be a crushing or a grinding type; and the cause is a blow with a rock or a fall on a stone, and similar causes.
And this fracture is either penetrating, approaching the membrane beneath the bone; or it is on the surface of the bone, and the severity of these two types of fractures is either great or small.
And there is a fracture that is hidden within the bone, in the smallness of a hair's breadth, and therefore this type of fracture is called a hairline fracture.
And there is a fracture that is caused either by a fall or a blow from a stone, and similar things, that causes a portion of the bone to be pushed inward, and it is made in the concave area, just as happens to the ribs when they are hit, and a portion of them is driven inward.
And this happens more often in the soft bones of infants' heads.
And in all these types of fractures, there are fragments, like separate pieces of a broken star. And I shall come with a remedy for all of this, returning it to its place.
And we recognize all these types of fracture by examination of those areas and by investigating them with probes and examination of the corrupt flesh on them.
A particular type of fracture is recognized because it is exposed on the bone, and is scraped clean and probed, for the fracture appears black.
But in the treatment of a fracture, consider first the patient's symptoms, and if you see through the symptoms that they signify a dangerous condition, such as vomiting, diarrhea, loss of consciousness, loss of voice, fainting, acute fever, and swelling and inflammation of the limbs, and similar symptoms in the most serious cases, without a doubt, it is not going to be a successful recovery.
And if you see symptoms that are not severe, you hope for recovery, then you begin the treatment.
The reason for this is that if the injured person comes to you at the beginning of the illness, as when afflicted during the winter days, then you must study the condition of the bone by the fourteenth day, according to the overall prognosis.
And if it is during the summer days, then you must try to set the bone by the seventh day, before the area under the bone is damaged by the tissue, and the symptoms we have described occur.
And if the fracture has already reached the tissue covering the brain, and is with small pieces and attrition, then you must cut away the broken and damaged pieces, as I will explain to you.
And you are to shave the head of the injured patient, and uncover the bone according to custom and method as best you can, according to the nature of the injury, and be gentle with the patient.
And if you encounter a detection of bone, blood flow, or a hot abscess, then you must counter it with what is necessary, and you should fill the area with cloths soaked in wine and rubbed oil, and let the injury rest until the abscess is calmed and the blood flow ceases; and then begin with the circulation of the bone and the removal of it.
And this will be according to one of two methods of operation.
And one method is that you cut the bone with a narrow scalpel, and this is its form: And then apply another scalpel to it, a little further out than that one; and this is its form:
And then apply a scalpel further out than the second one.
And you need to have several different scalpels, some wider than others, and some shorter than others, with their sharpened ends at the back, and made of tempered or hardened iron.
And use them with care in percussion on the scalpel so that it does not strike the head and break it.
And if the bone is strong, hard, then it is necessary to drill a hole around it before applying the scalpels with the drills, which are called non-deepening drills.
And they are not called this way except because those do not reach the surface of the skull bone near it, because the drill has a round end or edge on that which is under the head, sharp like an edge or a small circle, which prevents being submerged and going through the thickness of the bone.
And it is appropriate that you take a large number of these drills, each suitable for the thickness of each bone, so that you have on hand in all cases of the skull a tip that is sharp, the length and shortness are according to the thickness of each skull.
And this is the method for three types of drills:  The method for drilling around the fractured bone is to place the drill on the bone and turn it with your fingers until you know that the bone is already penetrated; then, change the drill to another location, and place that which is in between each hole at the thickness of the ray or approximately that.
Then, cut with scalpels what is between each hole in the bone, and make it as thin as possible, so as to achieve a lightness, as we have said, until you remove the bone, either with your hand, or with some other means using tools you have prepared for this, like pliers and delicate forceps.
And you must take great care that the scalpel does not touch any part of the spinal column.
And therefore, after you have drilled around the bone, and if it is connected to the spinal column, separate it, and remove it.  You should then rasp and smooth the rough edges of where it was attached to the bone, using a tool similar to a scalpel, but it must be thinner and finer than the other scalpels.
And if any small pieces of bone remain and are loose, then remove them easily with the tools you have; and then treat the wound with liniments and ointments as we have described.
Another method of operation is gentle, free of fear, which, as the great Galen said, is beneficial and worthy of praise.  This is his advice:  For you to begin, it is necessary to uncover the portion of the bone at the most severe and obvious fracture point, until you have exposed that section and placed the tip of a slow and light scalpel, in this manner...
Its blade is shaped like a lentil, and does not cut anything, while the sharp edge of the blade has two sides extending lengthwise, as you see, in such a way that the lentil-shaped part of the blade fits against the spinal column, with the sharp edge of the blade in contact with the bone.
Then strike the scalpel at that point with a small mallet until you easily cut the entire bone as it is turned.  Be certain of the safety and that there will be no accident that you fear in any way.  And if the physician were the most foolish of all men, and the most ignorant of them; certainly, even if he were asleep.
Then, if any part remains attached to the bone, in any part of the bone, cut it from the bone with the lentil-shaped tip of the scalpel and remove it easily, for it is detached without harm or fear.
And if the fracture of the bone does not penetrate the flesh, and what is cut off or removed from the bone is the surface of it, and there remain roughnesses and tiny irregularities, then it is necessary to smooth out those roughnesses and eliminate those irregularities with the fine scalpels you have prepared, of various sizes so you can apply the most suitable ones to every part and place them correctly depending on the position and the shape of the broken bone and its fracture.
And you must use the widest of those scalpels in your initial scraping of the bone, and then progressively use the finer ones, and do not stop doing this until you arrive at using the finest and most delicate of them all.
However, for each of the other small, capillary fractures and subtle breaks, you must provide treatment according to what you find necessary for their repair.
And this is a cause that is not hidden from all who study this art. And this is what we have written about in large fractures.
And if the skin is pulled back when you expose the bone, then you must take a cloth of linen the size of the wound, and soak it in warm oil, and place it over the wound opening; and then take another cloth, folded double or triple, and soak it in wine and warm oil, and place that over the linen cloth, and do this as gently as possible so that you do not press too hard on the flesh; and then apply a thick bandage, and do not tighten it except for the amount necessary to simply hold the wound closed.
Leave it with this treatment for a day or two until you are sure there is no festering; then remove it and administer medicines to counteract any dryness, such as linen roots and flour of herbs, and powders of fennel and aristolochia, and similar things.
And you should make a powder from these medicines, pulverized and dry, and sprinkle it on the wound.  In general, apply any medicine whose property is to cleanse but not to cause irritation.
And be careful, according to your skill, that the wound in your treatment remains clean; and do not allow any suppuration or other corruption to build up there; nor allow the virulence to increase; for when it is concentrated on the skin of the brain, it corrupts and poisons it, and this will cause serious harm to the patient.
And it causes harm to the flesh of the head, especially when the bone is exposed and the treatment is neglected, and there is blackness on its surface; and therefore, if you observe in the patient the symptoms we have described, know that it is dangerous without a doubt.
And if the blackness is not from the medicine applied, but rather a result of the medicine's properties, then you should take one part honey and three parts of rubbed oil, and with these, moisten a cloth, and place it on the flesh; and then treat it with the appropriate healing spices until it is healed.
Chapter 3.
Of the restoration of the nose when it is broken.
Know that the nose is not broken in two separate, supremely important parts, or even in one in some cases, because there are two bones in it, for the lower part is cartilaginous and is not fractured.  It is only bruised, twisted, and bent.
However, if one of the two parts is fractured, then you should insert your little finger into the nose, and push that fracture inwards with your index finger, and the thumb outwards, until the nose returns to its natural shape. And do this easily, and be careful not to cause further pain to the afflicted person by your actions.
And if the fracture is in the most important part of the nose, and the finger cannot reach it, then it must be straightened with the tip of a tool with a small amount of thickness.
And if the fracture is in two parts, then you do likewise.
And strive for the patient's restoration on the first day of the fracture, if possible; and if not, then around the 7th or 10th day, apply a cautious poultice.
And then insert a piece of linen cloth into the tip of the nose, if the fracture is in one part, or place two bandages, if the fracture is in two parts, and the thickness of the bandage should be sufficient to fill the nasal cavity.
And some of the ancient healers say that the bandages should be soaked in water and changed daily, but I do not see the need for that; rather, I say that the cloth should be soaked in a mixture of egg white and powdered mortar; and leave the bandage in place until the bone has set and the cartilage has hardened.
And sometimes, instead of a bandage, a small amount of bird's down wrapped in linen is inserted into the nose; this is appropriate if the nasal fracture is severe and the patient is not prohibited from breathing.
And this method is not necessary for you; and if you wish, do it this way, and if you wish, do it with bandages.
And if there is another abscess or inflammation, plaster the nose with cerot or cotton soaked in sour wine and oil of roses, or with diachylon.
But if there is no inflammation or abscess, then you must plaster the exterior with sesame flour and powdered incense mixed with egg white; then place a linen bandage over it, and do not bind the nose with anything else.
But if the nasal bones are fractured or broken into small pieces, then you must dissect them, and remove them with appropriate instruments. Afterward, close the fracture and heal it with things that cause healing and consolidation, and with appropriate plasters.
And if there is a wound inside the nose, then you must treat it with bandages and administer lead cannulas until it is completely healed.
Chapter 4.
Of the restoration of the jaw when it is broken.
When the lower jaw is broken and the fracture is not accompanied by an open wound, observe if the fracture is only displaced, and not broken in two but bent inward, then its repositioning is easy.
And therefore, if the fracture is on the right side, you must insert your left index finger into the patient's mouth; and similarly, if the fracture is on the left jaw, then insert the said index finger of your right hand; and with that, push the displaced part of the fracture gently outward, with your other hand on the outside of the bone; with that, gently reposition it.
And if the fracture of the jaw is already separated into two, then it is necessary to apply traction to both parts along a straight line until the repositioning of the parts is possible.
And if you encounter tooth damage along with a break, then tie those teeth which you expect to remain with gold, silver, or silk thread; then place a compress on the broken jaw, then place a doubled cloth over it, and then place a large, properly made bandage, or a single piece of gauze equal to the length of the jaw; and then bind it as your bandage application allows, until it is no longer damaged.
And command the patient to use rest and tranquility, and give him nourishing, easily digestible food.
And if you estimate that the shape has already been altered in some way, then you attend to it and loosen it on the third day; and then you rectify whatever is altered and cover it with powdered chalk, egg white, or ground flaxseed, after removing the compress, and place a soft wool bandage over the plaster.
And then, when that plaster is firmly fixed and the position of the bone is not altered, leave it, do not loosen it until it is healed and the fracture is strong; for often this fracture is mended in three weeks.
And if another time a painful boil arises, then administer what we have often said for its calming until it is healed, and the boil is gone.
And if the fracture has a wound, then consider if it is a piece of bone separated or splinters; then you must carefully remove those splinters with whatever is appropriate for their removal from the instruments.
And if the opening of the wound is narrow, then you enlarge it with leeches according to the amount you need.
And when you have removed those splinters, and nothing remains of them, then you close the wound opening if it is wide; and if not, place one of the suitable plasters on it and allow it to heal until it is sound.
Chapter 5.
Of the restoration of the furcula when it is broken.
Many times the furcula is broken in the part before the muscle, and this fracture occurs in one of three ways.
When it is broken, or separated, or separated into two parts without splinters, it is easy to restore; or it is such that splinters are present, and its restoration is difficult; or it is such that the fracture is with a wound.
And the operation in that case, when the fracture is without a wound, is that you have two assistants present, so that one holds the fractured furcula and the other extends the collar towards that area.
And then approximate the fracture with your fingers until its shape is as it should be, and is neither overly prominent nor concave.
And if you need more extension, then you must place under the patient's armpit a pad of cloth or wool, and its size should be according to your needs; and extend and elevate the furcula and compress the pad with your hand until the fracture is approximated as needed.
And if you cannot pull the fracture's extremities outward, because it has become stuck (or impaled?), then the patient must be laid on their back, and place a cushion of moderate size on their muscles.
And the assistant presses the muscles underneath to elevate the furcula bone that is stuck upwards, and then you straighten the fracture and approximate it with your fingers.
But if you feel splinters of the furcula and they are sharp, then you must cut over them and remove those splinters easily.
And if it is lodged in the bone, then you create an incision there with one of the scalpels you have prepared for this, after you have placed the tool that serves to hold the furcula underneath; and this tool is of wood or iron, of which this is its form:
And it is similar to a spoon, of which this is the concavity; and its width should be according to your need, according to the size of the bone or its smallness.
However, its length should be as possible for the operation; it should have two ends like this, and one end should be wide and the other narrow.
And if the opening of the wound you have incised when extracting the splinter from the bone is wide, and you are sure of a suppurating boil, then you should bring the two edges of the wound together with stitches.
And if the opening is small, or you fear a suppurating boil, then you should fill the wound with cloths and powders according to the size of the wound's opening.
And if a suppurating boil occurs, then soak a cloth in vinegar, olive oil, and wine, and place it over it.
And make sure the bandage does not move off the broken bone.  Therefore, you must examine the patient daily, and when you see the ligament has softened or the bandage has slipped, then you should adjust it and tighten the binding.
And then place the patient's head on their neck, and place a small cushion under the patient's chin to elevate the upper arm from the side, thus elevating the fracture of the collarbone, and so the patient's arm is tied to the neck.
Do not loosen the bandage if a suppurating boil or similar swelling occurs in the area, for up to twelve days.
And then renew the plaster if you have seen a change in the affected area, and adjust the tightness and restore it, and leave it until the fracture of the collarbone has been restored and has coagulated.
And it is strengthened and comforted according to the month, in 28 days, and sometimes in some men it is done in less time than that.
Chapter 6.
Of the restoration of a fractured shoulder.
The shoulder blade is broken in its lateral location, and it is not broken *from* him/her, but rather, the edges are broken.
And therefore, when the location is broken—and it is broken in the middle of the location—and it is only known through touch, then, according to the figure of the fracture, prepare it and reduce it to its natural shape by every manner of ingenuity possible.
And then apply powdered mastic with egg white and stop-leon; and then apply a folded cloth; and then place a thin, flat piece of lead over it, equal to the size of the entire shoulder blade, or slightly larger.
But if, beneath the lead, there is a hollow in any part of the shoulder blade, then fill that hollow with stop-leon, and then raise the lead to an equal level.
And then hold it firmly in place with a long bandage, with proper constriction, and with the firmness of the lead until it is no longer displaced from its position.
And observe the bandage every day; and every time it has softened, bandage again and tighten it, and adjust the lead if it has been displaced from its position.
And let the patient lie on their sound side.
And the shoulder blade will be restored in 20 or 25 days.
And therefore, when this number of days is complete, then you dissolve the bandage, and be sure that the connection is secure between the bones, so that their disunion is not feared.
And if you proceed from the location of the injured bone and place a splint under it, then you should cut over it, remove it, and act as we have described in the fracture of the furcula, or treatment of a boil, or if an abscess occurs there.
Chapter 7.
Of the restoration of the fracture of the foot.
The foot is sometimes broken in the middle, and this is often severe; but its extremities are often more severely crushed and splintered.
And the consequences of the fracture in the middle of the foot include deviation to the sides, great pain, difficulty in breathing, coughing, severe weakness, and vomiting of blood; and the cavity in the broken bone is revealed, not hidden from the feeling/perception.
And the restoration of the foot involves laying the patient on their back, placing a cushion between their shoulders; then pressing on their muscles, and adjusting the bones with the hands on both sides, carefully and meticulously in the operation and according to every possible and suitable way, until the bone returns to its proper shape.
Then apply a poultice and bandage and place a thin sheet of willow or reed or similar lightweight material over that, wrapping it in cloth; then carefully bind it around the broken bone so it doesn't move; and tie it around the back in a circular manner sometimes, and tighten it properly; and then check the bandage frequently, and when softened, tighten it further.
And if the bandage causes ulceration, pus, pain, or an abscess in the area, then you loosen and remove it and remove the poultice and rectify what was caused by it with the proper treatment; and then you reapply the poultice, or if necessary, the dressing; and maintain the tightness until it heals.
Chapter 8.
Of the restoration of broken bones.
Know that fractures of the ribs occur only in the thick parts, which are the middle sections; and on the outer edges, or front parts, damage is not caused in the same way, as those sections are cartilaginous. And knowledge of this is not hidden from the feeling of it through examining it with words.
And the restoration should be such that the fracture is brought together with the fingers in the most possible way, until it is held together as necessary, and then apply a poultice and bind the broken bone with a bandage, if needed.
And if the fracture of the ribs is situated towards the internal parts, then the patient experiences severe pain and stabbing, similar to the stabbing that comes with pleurisy, and this is because the bone pierces the membrane; and it causes difficulty breathing, coughing, and vomiting of blood; and this is a difficult condition to treat.
And the ancients were ingenious in dealing with that with many clever methods.
And of their methods, they say:  it is necessary to withhold foods from the patient that engender inflation and windiness, so that the belly remains inflated and stretched, and the fracture is pushed outwards.
But we would avoid this, as it is not a light matter to generate a hot abscess, if it doesn't happen; and if it does happen, then we'll address it.
And some of them would say that a cupping glass should be placed over it and forcefully drawn; and it seems a reasonable approach, but nevertheless, it is feared that the cupping glass will draw the superfluities to the area due to weakness.
And some of them would say:  the area should be covered with wool that has been immersed in hot oil, and powders should be placed between the ribs until it is filled, so the dressing fits the rounded shape; and then the patient should be treated with pleurisy cures, both dietary and medicinal.
And if a severe cause afflicts the patient, who cannot bear it, and the bone pierces the membrane with a harmful puncture, we fear for the patient, then it is necessary to cut open the area, expose the broken rib, and then place an instrument on it to hold the fractured piece in place, a procedure preceded by a memory/rehearsal, and cut the bone with ease, removing it.
And then, if the wound is large, we should bring together the two sides of the wound with stitches, and treat it with plasters until it is healed.
And if an abscess occurs inside, then you should mix powders in rubbed oil and apply it to the area, and the patient should be treated with whatever is appropriate for the internal abscess.
And let him lie on his side on which he sleeps, until he is healed.
Chapter 9.
Concerning the restoration of a fractured vertebra of the back and neck.
Sometimes fractures occur in the bones of the neck, and sometimes their attrition, and similarly in the vertebrae of the back. And when this happens to someone, and you want to know if they will be healed or not, then consider this: if you repeatedly touch their muscles, which are already softened, numb, dead, and cannot be moved, stretched, or tightened, and when you press them with your fingers or prick them with a needle, they do not feel any pain, then know that they are not healed, and in this state of affairs they are in mortal danger.
And if you move them and feel constriction with your fingers and pricks, then know that the bone's integrity is preserved and that the patient will recover with treatment.
And if you see the same signs in the neck vertebrae and want to know if they will be healed or not, then consider the patient's feet.
Then if you see that they are already softened, similar to what happened in the muscles, and when they lie on their back, they have involuntary wind and bowel movements, and sometimes they are lying on their back wanting to urinate and cannot, then know that it is fatal, and therefore do not bother with their treatment.
But if you do not see any of those symptoms, the cause is better and more easily treatable.
And the treatment for this is to apply a poultice to the inflamed vertebra, using either oiled or roasted herbs, or even boiled egg whites.  Apply this several times a day until the inflamed area subsides.
And then apply a comforting and soothing plaster, and bind it firmly.  Order the patient to rest and remain calm, and not to sleep on the affected area until it is healed.
And if you observe signs of bone breakage or some other separation from the surrounding tissue, then it is necessary to dissect the skin over the bone and remove the displaced bone; then rejoin the two edges of the wound, with sutures if it is large.  Then treat it with some kind of healing ointment until it is healed.
But if the bone at the back of the hip is fractured, and it is at the end of the thigh bone, then you should insert the index finger of your left hand into the buttock, and align the fractured bone with the other hand as much as possible by aligning the ends; then apply a plaster and bandage, if necessary, and firmly bind it.
And if you find any broken pieces in it, then you should remove them, and treat the wound with the previous treatment until it is healed.
Chapter 10.
Of the restoration of the [broken] width/breadth.
The bones of the hips are often fractured, and if they break, then the fracture of them is only a communication at their extremities, and they are cut lengthwise and deviate inwards; and the patient experiences pain and a puncture in the area, and the leg is numb when fractured.
And the restoration of it is that you should extend your hand over it until it is upon the fracture, which is its form.
And if the fracture is only at one end, then you should bind it in accordance with the instrument that you have prepared for aligning it until it is restored to its natural shape.
But if the fracture is along the length or already deviates inwards, then you should have the patient lie on their stomach until you are prepared to restore that fracture. And then, once you have bound it, apply a poultice, and afterwards place a splint of wood or bone, and apply pressure firmly, so that you do not fear the piercing of the fracture or the movement of the splint.
And bind the hollow with that which fills it, so that it maintains a firm hold equally, and command the patient to sleep on their back or on their healthy side.
But if a painful abscess arises, then you should cease the extension and restoration until the painful abscess is soothed, and apply whatever soothes it as previously described.  Then return to the restoration and bind it as necessary.
And if splinters or fragments of bone arise, then you should remove them.
Chapter 11.
Concerning the restoration of a fractured limb.
Adjutori" is that which is between the elbow and the shoulder (joint).
And if it is broken, then its restoration is in one of two ways, of which one is that you take a piece of wood of medium thickness in this way:
And two ligaments are tied to its two ends, and then it is suspended from a raised position.
And have the patient lie on a stretcher; and then place the patient's broken arm on the wood until the bend of the arm is in the middle of the curve of the wood.
And then place some heavy object on it, or the attendant extends it downwards; and then the doctor holds the fracture with his hands together until the fracture returns as is proper.
The other method is for the patient to lie on their back, and tie the arm of the patient's neck with a bandage.  Then, instruct two attendants that one of them should hold what's above the fracture with their hands; and the other hold what's below it; and each should pull in their direction.
And if you want the extension to be stronger, then you tighten the bandage over the fracture and another bandage on top of that, and each of the two attendants pulls in their respective direction.
And therefore, if the fracture is close to the end of the muscle, then it is necessary that half the bandage be placed on the bend and the other below the fracture towards the elbow.
And similarly, if the fracture is near the elbow, then it is necessary to place the bandage over that spot and over the elbow itself.
Apply it easily and without effort, and then, once it's bandaged correctly and applied well, tighten it if there is risk of a suppurating boil.
But if a hot abscess arises, then leave the tightness until the seventh day, and place wool soaked in sour wine and rubbed oil over it until the abscess subsides, and then you tighten it.
And the way to tighten it is to place a plaster over the fracture, then place a wrap of clean cloth over the plaster; then adjust the arm over that support, and place their open hand over their own muscle.
And place the cloth and tighten the support on the arm so that the arm is in its proper position, unless some aspect of the broken bone prohibits this.
And then use splints.
And you should place on the fracture the splint that is widest and strongest of the other splints; and place between each splint the width of a finger, and let the length of the splints be according to the break, with an addition of three fingers on each side.
And then tighten the splints with the tightening method I mentioned at the beginning of the chapter.
And ensure your tightening on the fracture site is more tight. And the longer the fracture, the less tight the tightening should be.
And thus adjust the positioning of the splints and the tightening as we have described, at the time when you restore the limb to its proper position, then you do so.
And if you fear a suppurative abscess, then leave the tightening and splints in place for seven days, as we have said.
Then consider the ligament in all parts for three days, so that no bruising or inflammation occurs in the area; or food should be withheld from the limb due to excess tightening; and therefore, correct all of this according to what we have said.
But if you are confident that no cause for this will arise, then do not loosen the binding until approximately three days, or longer.
And let the patient's sleep be on their back, with their hands on their stomach.
And place a full, oiled, wool-filled pad beneath the support, and take care at all times of night and day that the shape of the broken limb is not impaired, or that the ligament is softened; then correct all of this with your skill.
And give the patient food according to the order we previously described, so that the food is subtle at first until the tightening has begun; and then it is necessary to increase the amount of food.
Because, according to the custom of supporting and bandaging the limb, it is to be bound tightly for forty days; and then it is necessary that it be loosened, and a bath administered, and medicated with ointments that correct the condition.
And if the fracture is severely damaged, then you do not release the ligament and splints from it for a month or even two months.
Chapter 12.
Of the restoration of a fractured arm.
The arm is composed of two bones, which are called two "foci" (or, perhaps, "sockets"); one of which is small, and it is the one that sits near the said elbow, and the other is large and it is the one situated below the small one, in the lower part.
And frequently the larger "focus" is broken alone, or the smaller one, and frequently they are both broken together.
And when the smaller "focus" is broken above, then the restoration of it is easy, and its healing is easier.
And when the "focus" is broken below, then the fracture is serious, and its healing is difficult.
And even worse than that is when both bones are broken together.
Therefore, if the bone that is broken is the smaller "focus" above, then it is suitable for the physician, in order for its restoration, to apply a small extension with ease until it is healed.
But if the large "focus" is what is broken, then it is necessary that a more forceful extension be applied.
And if both "focuses" are broken together, then it is necessary that you apply the pressure much more strongly.
And it is necessary that you place the shape of your hand for the restoration of it and the extension of it spread out over a cushion, and the palm of the hand should be at the upper parts, higher than all the other fingers, and the thumb should be lower than the other fingers, and the patient should be resting on a padded bed.
And there should be a cushion in front of him at his height, so that the patient does not experience trouble.
And then the attendant extends the arm of the lower part with their hand or a bandage, and another attendant extends the upper part similarly.
And then the physician manipulates the bone until it is returned to the best possible position.
And if in the fracture of the bone there are obstructions, then you must endeavor to return every piece to its place with your skill.
And if there appears a separated obstruction that prevents the bone from mending and you are not hopeful about restoring it, then you should perform on it and remove it in the manner we have described above.
But if the fracture is with a wound, I have already made a separate chapter on this, and therefore take care of that.
And if you encounter a suppurating abscess at the beginning of your restoration, then you should apply a cloth with a plaster made of roasted oil and white wax, which should be moderate in its consistency and subtlety, and tightly bind the cloth over it with fine strips until the abscess subsides; and then remove the plaster and apply a prepared poultice of powdered moly with egg white, and then place strips; and let the strip placed over the fracture be the thickest and strongest.
And know that the name of the splints for the arm is used in the major arrangements, or that is, a fracture in one compartment or in two compartments together.
And then apply your strips to the fracture site with as much strength and vigor as possible, and if the strips are placed above or below the fracture, then place the strips a little more loosely, just as the recollection of it was done earlier in the chapter.
And the cloths wrapped around the fracture should be very damp cloths, and not hard or rough, and the bandage used to bind them should be of a medium consistency, neither too thin nor too thick, as we have already described.
And consider the limb and its ligaments for a few days. And if any cause arises that necessitates correction, such as inflammation occurring on the limb, then you should soak the limb in hot water until that inflammation subsides.
And leave the limb unconstrained until it rests, and then reapply the bandages.
And if the constriction has softened and the bone has rejoined and appears as it should, then rectify everything with your skill.
And further consider if nourishment is prevented from reaching the limb due to excessive constriction, for then it is necessary to soften that a little and leave it for a few days until nourishment flows to it, and then bind it tightly again.
However, if the patient does not have any of the causes we have mentioned, then it should not be untied for about 20 days or thereabouts.
Then the patient's hand should be suspended by its own power of active movement, and make the patient sleep on their side.
And know that this fracture is restored in 30 days or 32 days, or a very slight one is restored in 28 days, and all this is according to the disposition of the body's constitution and the strength of the healing process.
Chapter 13.
Of the restoration of fractures of the wrist and fingers.
Know that fractures of the wrist and the joints of the fingers often occur, and they are not always caused by accidents but often by overuse.
And when a fracture or overuse injury occurs to the hand, then the patient should be placed lying down and the hand should be placed on the extended arm in a straight line.
And then the attendant extends the broken bones, and the doctor binds them together until they are properly aligned.
Then it is necessary to apply a plaster and bandage, if not a boil is developing; and then place a splint over the area according to its size, and you should already have wrapped it in linen.
However, if the fracture is in the parts closer to the palm of the hand, then make a bandage-like shape, and tell the patient to grip it with their injured hand; afterwards, wrap it firmly with a long bandage.
And let the splint be of leather with linen over it so that the leather touches the palm; and wrap it as needed.
However, if the fracture is in the outer parts, then it is necessary to place a splint over it and another splint under the palm of the hand, so that the hand is open and straight; then apply a bandage, as the hand is wrapped back towards the fingers with ligaments.
And if a fracture occurs in any of the knuckles of the fingers, then if it is the thumb, it should be bandaged as needed; and afterward, it should be wrapped with the palm, and if you wish, place a small, straight splint on it to keep the fracture elevated and prevent movement.
But if the fracture is in the other fingers, such as the middle finger, or the index finger, or the ring finger, or the pinky finger, then it should be bandaged and bound with the finger adjacent to it; or all the fingers should be bound together, which is better; or place a small splint on it, as we said for the thumb.
And consider, in your restoration, and afterwards, the placement of a hot abscess and its opposition – with your operation – with what is necessary when any of these conditions occur, as described in the account of it.
Chapter 14.
Concerning the restoration of a fractured thigh bone.
The thigh bone is often broken and is recognised by the feeling that it has shifted forward and to a more superior position.
And the restoration of it is done by tightening a bandage over the fracture and another bandage beneath the fracture, and the patient is laid prostrate on their stomach and on their face.
And then the attendant extends all the bandage to its proper position, when the fracture is in the middle part of the bone.
But if it is near the root of the thigh, then the bandage should be near the knee in the direction of the hip joint, so that the extension takes place in that direction, and the other bandage is below the fracture.
And similarly, if the break is near the knee, then the bandage should be applied near the knee, and the extension should be in the directions below.
And then the physician aligns the bone with both their hands until it returns to its natural shape and the bone is joined with a good union; then it is necessary to apply a poultice and a bandage, otherwise the limb will develop an abscess. But if an abscess develops there, then you leave it for a few days until the hot abscess subsides, and then return to your treatment.
The bandage should be applied like this: you must wrap a hard bandage around the fracture, and fold it two or three times, removing any excess; and then wrap the leg until it reaches the ankle and the root of the thigh.
And insert a long splint between the thigh and the leg near the knee, in the lower directions, and bring the ends of the splint from the highest point on both parts, and then cover the leg and thigh with any excess bandage material.
And then place splints on the thigh over the fractured area, and place one splint over the bone of the leg.
And then fill the spaces between the leg and thigh with soft cloths, so that the fracture is consolidated.
Then begin with a strong bandage in the middle over the fracture area with three or four wraps, and as you move away from the fracture site with the bandage, your bandage should become smaller, lighter, and softer.
And then extend the two ends of the splint downwards until it reaches the ankle of the foot, and hold both ends of the splints on the other side, so that the bandage does not shift from its position.
And then leave the bandage on it, so that no ulceration, abscess, or inflammation, or similar ailments occur in the limb; and if any of these occur, then remove it carefully and correct what occurred immediately, as we have said many times.
But if there is a piece of bone protruding, then you must push it back in as much as possible; and if not, leave it alone and treat the surrounding area of the affected spot until it heals.
And sometimes this fracture of the thigh or other similar injuries are held together with splints, as we have said in the treatment of the arm.
However, in the restoration done in this way, the patient does not develop limping; and if it is restored alone, or if the other leg is applied to it, then it is necessary that the one that has always limped does so.
And know that the thigh is splinted for 40 days or a little more or a little less, and all of this depends on the diversity of the constitutions and other dispositions.
Chapter 15.
Of the restoration of the fracture of the kneecap (patella).
Know that a fracture of the kneecap is often severe, but it sometimes results in a lot of abrasion/friction.
However, if it is a fracture, then it is merely a crack or hole in its parts, with or without a wound, and this is all according to the feeling/sensation.
And the restoration of it is such that what is broken in its parts is bound together with ligaments until it is joined and connected as much as possible by means of adjustment and ease and manufacture.
And then apply a plaster and place it over that round shape, if needed; and compress it firmly with suitable tightening.
And now consider all the treatments we have described in other fractures, similarly, as with abscesses and similar conditions, to counteract any accident with what is appropriate for it until it is healed.
Chapter 16.
Of the restoration of a fractured leg.
Know that the leg has two bones, one of which is thick, and is called the thigh bone; and the other is slender, and is called the shinbone.
And the treatment for any type of fracture affecting these two leg bones is similar to the treatment for arm fractures; therefore, the method of restoration is the same.
And if both bones are broken at once, the leg is deformed in all directions.
And if the thinner bone is broken, the leg is deformed forward.
And if the thicker bone is broken, you find that one beneath, and it is among those things that are not hidden from you.
And then apply extension, straightening, and bandaging to the splints, according to that same method.
However, if the fracture of the leg is extensive, with many splinters, the extension should be less and gentler, and alleviate it with your skill.
And if there is any need for surgery on the arm in connection with the leg, and after you have set the splints and completed your procedure, then you will take pieces of wood from a tree, which are placed under the splints which are placed in bandages and likewise made of palm branches; choose those of a small thickness and not at all large, and make their length according to the length of the leg, from the knee to the lowest point.
And then wrap each splint in two layers of cloth according to its length, and place one on the leg on one side, and the other on the other side, extending from the knee down to the lowest part of the foot.
And then tie the two splints in three places: at the two ends and the middle.  For with this binding, the leg is prevented from bending to either the right or left side, and is kept in a good position.
And now a small wooden splint, matching the length of the leg, has been placed on it so that the leg is held in place, preventing movement.
And this is especially necessary to do in cases of fracture, and when there is a wound properly.
And from now on, check the leg daily and monitor it closely, looking for signs of abscess, inflammation, or other similar problems. If any such condition arises, apply what is needed until it is healed.
Chapter 17.
Of the fracture of the heel and bones of the foot and toes.
A fracture of the heel bone itself is not common, but sometimes fractures occur in the bones of the foot.  Fractures of the toes are uncommon, and they mostly just experience friction or bruising from their position.
And if a fracture occurs in the bones of the foot, and those bones are displaced, the patient should place their foot flat on the ground, as if walking.
Then place the other foot on whatever is raising those bones, and gently press and push them until they return to their proper places.
Then apply a plaster and bandage over it, and place a small, flat board with two padded ends under the sole of the foot.
Then firmly bind that area with downward pressure, since you have wrapped it with cloth and other materials as needed.
And after three or four days, then loosen the bandage, for you will find the bones rejoined, or broken, or dislocated, and the procedure for those cases is as you know.
But if any bones are broken, then set them, and rejoin them in the same way as I have described to you in the setting of the fingers of the hand. And then place a splint along the length of the broken finger, slightly wider than the finger itself; and then place the board described earlier under the foot, and bind it with downward pressure.
But if the broken bones are two, three, or more, then you place a splint of appropriate size over each finger, wrapped in linen; and secure the board at the bottom of the foot, and place one end of the board outside the belly of the foot, to hold it securely.
And it is important that you do not forget that you must consider all the points discussed regarding other fractures and accidents, and prepare yourself for any accident with the necessary means.
Chapter 18.
Of the fracture of the hip joint, the hip bone, and the penis in men.
When the hip joint of a woman is fractured, then make a splint, carefully shaped; then gently incline it towards the back a little, and keep it held behind.
And then the midwife fills the joint with wool, shaping it into the joint's shape, and the woman should be laid, gradually raising her back, until the fractured joint and bone are realigned.
Then place pillows on her back, and when she wants to urinate, the wool will be removed easily and she will urinate; and reposition and return it to the initial method; then return to her original pillows.
And do this for seven days or thereabouts, for then it will be restored.
And if you wish, take a sheep's bladder and insert a reed cannula into its opening; then place the entire bladder inside the joint, and gently blow air into the cannula until the bladder is inflated inside the joint, for this will help the fracture to mend.
And then fill it with wool and leave it for several days as previously stated, until healed.
And when the hip bone of a man or woman is fractured, then administer for its restoration and setting what we have described for a fractured hip bone.
And what is correct is not hidden in these immediate fractures and those that heal slowly, especially for someone who has studied and used and understands this my book's words; for this fracture signifies to you, in the most opportune ways, the proper method of restoration and tightening, so understand well.
But in the case of a fractured penis, take a bird's wing, place it on the penis; then place a cloth bandage over that and wrap it around.  Let it remain there for three days or thereabouts, and it will heal.
Chapter 19.
Of the restoration of fractures of the bones when there is a plague.
It is appropriate for someone who suffers a fracture with plague, especially if the bone is large, like the bone of the thigh or the shin, or similar to those, that you bleed them (perform phlebotomy) immediately if the conditions for phlebotomy are as we have stated above.
And if the plague causes blood to flow, then you should apply a constricting bandage to stop it, and if there's nothing else available, sprinkle powdered crushed rock on it.
And then begin to restore the fracture on the same day, and do not delay this, unless there is an abscess developing.
But if a severe abscess develops, then you should leave the restoration until the ninth day, until the abscess subsides, and do not approach it in the third and fourth days, for you will cause bad accidents.
But if the broken bone is prominently protruding from the skin, then you must carefully reduce it and hold it in place with your hands using gentle force and little stretching.
However, if you are not prepared to gently manipulate and reposition it with your hands, then you reduce it with your hands using this instrument; and this instrument is made of iron, its length is seven or eight fingers, and its width is according to the extent of the injury; and therefore, it is necessary for the physician to use three or four of them, depending on the quantity needed for the treatment of any kind of fracture.
And let it be round, and of little thickness, so that it is not pressed or bent on the affected area during the operation.
And it should have a sharp tip, with edges on its ends; and it should have a thick middle part, tapering towards the ends.
And this is its shape:
And it is called in Greek "labre volentz atelarem,"  which is a small spatula.
Therefore, it is necessary that the sharp end be placed raised above the prominent bone edge.
And you push it in one go until the bone returns, and it is aligned with some equation (or, more literally, "with some consistency").
Therefore, strive to align the fractured ends, and if the broken end is fragile, and does not accept the instrument well, then it is necessary that you cut the end of that bone until the instrument has the power to do so.
But if you cannot fully reduce the bone with what we have described, then cut it with what is suitable for bone cutters, as we have mentioned; or saw it with one of the saws, in whatever way is possible for you.
And then smooth out anything rough or with small scales that remains on the bone.
And when the bone is reduced, and after the reduction the patient experiences intense pain, then know that the bone has not returned to its natural place; and then do what you believe will greatly benefit the patient.
When your restoration of the bone is complete, then soak a cloth in black astringent wine, and especially if it is summer, and do not put a plaster or any oily substance on the wound, so that it does not cause suppuration and corruption.
And then apply splints at the time of your completion of the bone's restoration, and leave the wound uncovered, so that you cut the opening with scissors and use bandages according to the size of the wound.
And be very careful not to compress the wound with the fracture, for many times foolish doctors have done this, and caused death or a corrosive or wasting illness in their patients, which is to say gangrene. And if your constriction is slight, soft, different from the constriction of other fractures.
And if the wound is large or a bad wound, and you fear any of the bad accidents that we have recounted, and you find pain in the area, then you should not put splints on it, but rather make a bandage of hard cloths instead of splints and bind it tightly with these.
And when approximately one or two days after the wound has begun to fester, a scab has formed on it, then you remove the cloth you had placed over it with wine, and then apply some ointments, with which, according to our custom, we medicate wounds, such as tetrafarmacon ointment and similar ones.
And you should loosen the bandage and examine the wound every morning and evening until it is healed and closed, and the limb should be prepared in such a way that the pus flows from it to the lower parts with ease.
If the wound has passed many days and is not healed nor is the scab detached from it, then you should know that there are obstacles to healing, for which it is necessary to examine the wound with probing. And of those obstacles, those that are separable should be removed and extracted; those that are not separable and are causing the limb pain, force you to cut them, according to what is possible for you.
And if pus or other kinds of corruption or putrefaction occur in the wound, that is, inflammation, then you should apply to that part whatever is appropriate for the treatment described in the relevant chapter of the cure.
And in this, where my discourse should end and you should apply your skill: when a large bone is fractured, support the limb as you would support the thigh bone and similar to large limb bones, and do not attempt to pull or remove it, because often death results from that.  Leave it until it can set, for it will often fall into place on its own after about 20 or 30 days; and then treat the wound if it is needed, but otherwise leave it alone.
Chapter 20.
Of the treatment of swelling that occurs in the area of a broken bone.
Often this swelling occurs in the area of healing from a fracture, especially when near joints, and it disfigures the shape of the limb; and it greatly hinders the limb's natural function.
Then consider if the swelling is recent and administer medicines that have astringent properties, such as alum, vinegar, myrrh, cerate, and similar things; use some or all of these, and mix them with astringent wine, or egg white, or sour wine, and place this mixture on the swelling over a bandage, and bind it tightly.
And leave the binding in place for several days without loosening it; and then loosen it and apply another, until the swelling is gone; or apply a lead sheet firmly over it, for lead has the property of reducing any swelling in the limbs.
However, if the swelling has already become hard and dense and it is necessary to remove it forcibly, then cut it through the most prominent part, and remove the excess or cut it with sharp instruments until it is gone; and treat the wound until it is healed.
Chapter 21.
Concerning the restoration of a fracture when it is restored and afterwards the limb remains weak and frail, not according to its natural state.
When a broken bone is set, and afterward the limb remains weak and frail, this is not due to a single cause, but rather multiple factors: one being the excessive loosening or improper binding; or an excessive tightening of the ligaments, obstructing the flow of nutrients to the limb; or excessive application of poultices; or unnecessary movement at the wrong time; or a deficiency of blood in the patient's body and their weakness.
And the treatment for this is to give the patient nourishment and to make their body gentle until the blood is replenished; and administer baths; and introduce cheerfulness and joy into their life.
And then apply a poultice to the limb, so that the poultice draws more nourishment to it, or continue applying warm water poultices until the nourishment flows and returns to its natural form.
Chapter 22.
Of the treatment of broken bones when they are improperly set and the necessary operation is prevented.
When the limb, already treated, shows signs of crookedness and protrusion of the broken bone and swelling, and this causes deformity of the limb, but nonetheless the limb is not prevented from its natural function, then you should not accept the assertion of someone claiming that the limb is newly broken.
But many foolish physicians and bone setters have done this in our land; and this practice is greatly to be condemned, leading to great fear, the sign of which is deadly.
But if lameness and swelling are recent, then they should be bathed in lukewarm water in which soothing herbs are steeped, such as marshmallow leaves and root, melilot, and similar ones; and a softening poultice should be applied, such as well-made diachylon; or a mucilage of marshmallow root should be made by mixing it with henbane seed or beeswax oil, and applied as a poultice; or fatty figs should be crushed with pigeon dung, and similar medicinal ingredients known for their healing properties.
And sometimes it is dissolved with persistent gentle friction using damp hands, and movement of the limb should be administered in all directions at all hours.
But if the crookedness has progressed and become firm, hardened, and resistant to treatment, then it is necessary to stop the pus, dissolve the continuation of the bone, and cut away any excess swelling from the bone itself using sharp instruments, and administer relief carefully and diligently.
Chapter 23.
Concerning the treatment of dislocation.
Dislocation is the displacement of any joint from its proper place, preventing movement, distorting the shape of the limb, and causing the patient great pain and injury.
Therefore, when a dislocation occurs, it is essential to act quickly to reduce it, and not delay the reduction, for if delayed, the joint becomes inflamed and hardened, making dislocation reduction difficult.
And therefore, it is not appropriate to move or stretch it during inflammation, for it often causes spasms and prolonged pain.
But when this occurs, you should apply leeches to the inflamed area of the patient, and it should be left until the inflammation subsides; and then the limb should be soaked in warm water and oil, and then reduced with ease.
And every limb is thus healed, from which the recollection will return to its place.
And I have already ordered the chapters on dislocation, following the precedent in fractures; from the most superior part of the body to the lowest part.
Chapter 24.
On the treatment of dislocation of the lower jaw.
So, if both jaws are dislocated, and the dislocation is done in one of two ways: either they are displaced from their places by slight movement, and are slightly softened; or they are dislocated by complete dislocation, so much so that they are softened at the joint point, to the point where the patient is drooling and unable to hold their mouth shut, and their tongue is wrapped up in their mouth.
However, when the dislocation is slight, then in most cases it returns by itself with little effort.
But if the dislocation is complete and severe, then a gentle reduction must be administered immediately, and not delayed at all.
And let the attendant hold the patient's head, and let the physician place the index finger of one hand into the site of the jaw dislocation inside the patient's mouth, if the dislocation is on one side; or that he insert both thumbs together, if the dislocation is on both sides, and the other fingers of his hands should be outside to assist; and command the patient to move their jaw and pull it from each side; and the physician should grasp the jaw and push the jaw until it returns to its place.
And if the reduction is difficult, especially if both jaws are dislocated, then administer vaporization with hot water and oil, so that the reduction of both jaws is made easier and do not delay the reduction of both at all, as we have said.
And thus, when they return and are grasped, and the patient's mouth is closed and not softened, then place over them cloths with a cerot (plaster), made of wax and rubbed oil; and then be bound with ease with soft bandages.
And let the patient sleep on their back, and let their head be supported between two pillows, so that it does not tilt to the right or left; and do not force them to chew anything; let their food be soft and easy to consume, until the pain subsides and the jaws are healed, then let them eat whatever they wish.
And this should be administered with ease, and do not exert pressure on opening the mouth for eating, drinking, or breathing, until the jaw is healed and sound.
And if the reduction of the two jaws, when dislocated at any time and not returned to their places, often causes fevers and persistent sweating, and the patient's stomach is very easily upset, and there is a lot of vomiting of pure bile.
And when you see this, then know that it is a sign of death; and often the one who experiences this dies within a few days.
Chapter 25.
Of the reduction of the dislocation of the collarbone and the extremity of the muscle.
The collarbone is not dislocated inwardly by its connection with the foot; and sometimes it is dislocated outwards, and this is evident to the touch.
And the restoration is that the patient lies on their back and extends their arms. And then press the area firmly with your palm, for it will return.
And then apply a poultice and powders, and compress that.
However, the extremity that is connected to the elbow and continues from it is not dislocated in a single day; therefore, it must be reduced and bound according to what we have said and according to your equipment.
And then apply a poultice, powders, and a bandage, and command the patient to maintain quietness and rest until he is healed.
And with this same treatment, the extremity of the muscle is reduced when it is separated from its place.
Chapter 26.
Of the reduction of muscle dislocation.
Know that the muscle is not dislocated, but in three ways, of which one is that it is dislocated at the upper part and the other at the lower part.
And the second is that it is dislocated at the upper part of the muscle, and this is done hard; and it is not dislocated behind by the shoulder; and it is not dislocated in front by the nerves.
And most often it is dislocated and comes out at the lower parts towards the upper part, and especially in those whose flesh is sparse, it is easily dislocated; but in those with a lot of flesh, it is difficult to get it out.
And often, men suffer a blow or injury, and their muscle becomes inflamed with a hot abscess, and is swollen because it is already dislocated.
Therefore, you should examine this thoroughly, and then proceed with its treatment.
And the dislocation is recognized when it is in the lower parts towards the clavicle; so that you distinguish between the dislocated and healthy muscle, for you find a clear difference between them; and you find a hollow at the head of the muscle, and below the clavicle, near the head of the muscle, approximately like an egg, and the patient cannot bring their hand to their ear, nor can they move it at all.
If it is dislocated towards the feet or upwards, and you then find a clear touch, and it is not hidden.
And a mild reduction of this dislocation is possible when it is fresh and the patient is young.
And its reduction is that the physician raises the patient's hand to the upper parts; then place your fingers under the patient's clavicle, and raise the joint forcefully back into its place, and the physician raises the patient's hand and extends it upwards; then place it underneath, as it will return easily.
But if, despite what we have said, it does not return, and it has been a long time since the dislocation occurred, then the patient must be bathed in warm water and be given a poultice that softens and smooths, as if made of the roots of marshmallow, fenugreek, and melilot in water, and it should be applied.
And then the patient should lie on their back, and a wool pad that is firm yet loose be placed under their clavicle.  Then the physician places their heel on the pad and lifts the head of the muscle with force, and pulls the patient's hand so it does not move downwards.  Another physician should hold the patient's head so that it does not move down, for the dislocation will quickly return to its place.
And if you wish, reduce it in this way:  Have a man present who is taller than the patient, and have him stand on the affected side.  He should place his arm under the patient's clavicle and lift the clavicle upwards until the patient is suspended in the air, while another person pulls the patient's hand away from the lower part of their torso. But if the patient is light, then something else should be suspended with the patient to weigh them down, so the dislocation returns quickly.
And it is easily reduced in another way: a long, roughly cylindrical post, like a mortar pestle, neither thick nor thin, is placed on the ground beneath the patient.  Over the post's top are placed heavy cloths, and the patient stands in a line with the post.  The patient's hand is then extended downwards, and the patient's body is pulled strongly to the opposite side, and the joint returns to its place quickly.
And if the reduction is difficult by all the methods we have mentioned, then use this treatment: take a post measuring approximately two arms in length and four fingers in width, and its thickness should be slightly wider than the width of the clavicle in this shape:
And over the rounded top, heavy cloths should be tied so that the post does not injure the patient.
And then place it under the patient's collarbone, and extend the arm or hand downward toward the post, securing the post to the support, arm, and hand.
Then the arm should be placed on a stepladder according to the width, the hand extended downwards, and the other side of the body suspended from the opposite side, so that the joint quickly returns to its place.
And when the reduction is complete, in any way possible, then you should place wool padding under the patient's collarbone; then apply a prepared plaster of ground powder with wine and egg white over the entire muscle, wrapping it securely, and then firmly bind below the collarbone with a proper bandage; and the bandage should be wrapped over the plaster, and the patient's hand should be bound to the collarbone.  Leave it undisturbed for seven days.
And the patient's diet should be light, until the limb is strengthened, for this is the best way for their recovery.
And then the diet should be gradually increased, after seven or five days, and exercise should be introduced; and if it is then firm and not softened, then it is healed.
But if the joint has been dislocated many times due to moisture or another cause, then cauterization with three holes should be administered, as described previously in the chapter on cauterization.
And if all this is done and after seven days the bandage is removed and the joint is not firm, and the plaster and bandage are reapplied several times, but it is still not firm, and the arm cannot be raised above the shoulder, then understand that the nerves, which are at the head of the muscle, are now cut, stretched, or softened, and know that the joint will never return to its proper position.
For dislocations of the foot and ankle or the back, reduction is achieved by pushing and pulling with the hands until it returns to its place.
And another bandage should be applied to that area and treated until healed.
And if after healing there is heaviness in the limb and slowness in movement, then the patient should use baths frequently until the heaviness is relieved and it returns to its original natural state.
Chapter 27.
Of the treatment of elbow dislocations.
Know that the elbow joint is dislocated with difficulty and similarly returns with difficulty; and it is dislocated in all directions, and more so in the front than in the back, and its dislocation is not hidden from you, for it is evident under the sight or the touch, depending on how it is dislocated, and when you adjust the dislocated elbow with your hand, this is clearly evident to you, for the joint is hollow and cannot bend the arm, nor touch its muscle with it.
And it is necessary that you treat it, and reduce the dislocation as soon as possible before it becomes acutely inflamed, for if it becomes acutely inflamed, the reduction is difficult, and the limb is not completely healed; and more so when it is on the back part, for it is worse than all other types of dislocations, and more painful, and often results in death from it.
And the restoration of it, when it is possible to reduce it, is that his hand is extended with two hands, and his arm is stretched out, and the physician's hands are on the elbow and underneath it, and he presses the joint with the thumbs of his hands together, or with the base of his palm until it returns to its place.
But if the dislocation is in the front, then it returns by bending the hand with his hand, until he strikes the elbow with the base of his palm.
And if the dislocation does not yield to reduction, then administer forceful extension and strong pressure.
And it is that two assistants extend the arm, and hold that extension so that it is not pulled away from the extension.
And then the arm is turned in every direction, as it is wrapped in a long doubled cloth over his hand, or bandage.
And when the physician touches the joint with his hand, anoints it with some oil to aid in lubricating the joint with ease; and then he presses the joint with forceful pressure until it returns.
And then, after the reduction, a compress containing astringent and egg white should be applied, it should be bound tightly, and the arm should be suspended from the neck and left there for several days.
And then it is released; and if the joint is now properly formed, then remove the bandage and leave it alone.
And if you see the joint is not sufficiently tightened, then you reapply the plaster and bandage, and leave it for several days until it is tightened; and then release it.
But if, during the reduction of the joint, the condition worsens, and the movement of the injured part is restricted, then apply moist heat, gentle friction, and compression, until it is relieved; or place a soft, oily substance over the joint; and then bind it, and leave it on the affected area day and night. And then remove it, and place it in a bath; and when it is soaked, then rub the joint with moderate friction, and then reapply the oil-based substance, once, and the second, and the third time. with intervals of bathing, until it is healed.
And if you wish, place a warm, damp cow's hide over the affected area and bind it tightly; and do this several times, for this is moist and restores the area to its proper position.
Chapter 28.
Of the treatment of dislocations of the malassen, that is, of the joint between the arm and the hand.
Dislocations of the hand sometimes occur, and the reduction of its dislocation is relatively easy; the opposite is true for other joints. However, speed is required in its reduction when it is dislocated, before the area becomes inflamed or a harmful abscess forms there.
And the reduction of the dislocation is that you place the patient's hand joint on a table, and the assistant extends the hand, and the physician places their hand or palm on the area of the joint, and pushes it until it returns to its proper place.
However, it is necessary to consider if the palm has already been turned toward the back of the hand, in which case the patient places the back of their hand on a table to facilitate the extension and reduction; and if the dislocation is toward the back of the hand, then the position of the patient's hand must be on the table in such a way that the physician's hand can be placed over that joint area.
And if it returns quickly, that is good; but if not, then gently apply a bandage to prevent inflammation and leave it; and do not repeat this, for otherwise, it will not tolerate nor be possible to effect the reduction after several days have passed.
However, if the joint remains in its twisted position, and the patient doesn't feel any cause for this, but rather that the hand is weakened and cannot grip anything, then know that the nerves are severed or torn, and in this case, there is no remedy but to cauterize the affected area with a cautery iron, and apply a strong pressure bandage.
Therefore, once the injury has been reduced, place the bandage we described on it, and allow it to remain applied and compressed for five days. Afterward, it should be removed and left alone, and the patient's hand should be exercised.
But if the movement of the injury is obstructed and you experience some weightiness, then you should alleviate this with warm water and some friction several times, until it is eased.
Chapter 29.
Of the treatment of dislocated fingers.
Sometimes the fingers are dislocated in any direction.
And when one of those fingers is dislocated either to the side of the palm or to its underside, then straighten the finger and push the dislocation away using your fingers until it returns to its place.
And then support the head of the finger, and suspend it over the side to which it was dislocated, and leave it for two days.
And then suspend and extend it until it is properly aligned in its socket.
And when night comes, bandage it according to that description, and do not cease unbandaging it during the day and exercising it with movement, and bandage it at night; and do this for a few days until it is straightened.
And do the same if it is dislocated to the underside of the hand, and bandage it to that side and do your first procedure until it is healed.
And similarly do this when it is dislocated to the other parts of the body.
Chapter 30.
Of the treatment of dislocations of the vertebrae of the back.
When a complete dislocation occurs in any of the vertebrae of the back or neck, and the affected vertebra remains significantly displaced from its place, then in that case there is no cure, for death awaits the patient.
And a sign of this is that the patient's bowels are expelled involuntarily, and cannot be retained; and often some limbs of the patient, or two legs or two arms, or one of those, are paralyzed, or a vertebra remains out of place, for many times it is displaced, and often the displacement occurs at multiple points.
Therefore, this is already displaced in the posterior parts and is called a sprain.
But the treatment for this is that you must consider if the sprain occurred due to childhood injuries, for then in that case there is no cure, nor is the complete healing of it possible.
However, for sprains that occur due to accidents, or impacts, or similar causes, the ancients have described detailed methods of treatment, from which the most beneficial can be gleaned. But I have abbreviated this, avoiding the lengthy discussion, due to my proximity to the intention of my explanation, with which I have now presented and structured this information using various tools, through which I will demonstrate and expand upon this.
And of those, only the one that occurs on the back specifically, with what I recommend, is curable.
And it is that the patient be laid on their face, near a wall, and be supported beneath them with a soft material so that their foot is not disturbed.
And then a straight piece of wood should be placed, fixed into the ground at the edge of the wall near the head, and another piece of wood similarly placed at the other edge of the wall beneath the patient's feet.
And one attendant should hold the first piece of wood, and it should not be fixed in the ground; and another attendant should hold the other piece in a similar fashion.
And then wrap a bandage around the patient's head, and firmly tie it to the bolster (or similar support).  Extend the end of the bandage to the wooden support near the head and tie it there; then tighten the other bandage around the patient's hips and legs; and finally, tie all the bandages to the other wooden support beneath the patient's feet.
And now, each attendant should stretch the bandage towards the wooden support, and the two supports and the bandages should remain in their respective positions, though they should not be fixed as we have described.
And now the physician places their palms on the spine with strength until it returns to its proper position, or places a table beneath it, and then adjusts the patient's feet on the table until the spine returns to its proper position.
But if it doesn't return in this way, then take a table whose width or length is approximately three arms' length, and carve a recess in the wall mentioned, near the patient, into which the end of the table will fit. And then place the middle of the table upon the spine, and the physician places their feet on the other end, and presses firmly until the spine is compressed and returns to its proper position.
And if you wish, turn the mechanism that is held in your hand; and you shall place on the ground, behind the patient's head, two pieces of wood, each one arm's length long, and behind the patient's feet, two similar pieces of wood; and the distance between each piece of wood shall be a palm; and already a hole has been made in each piece of wood through which the mechanism can be passed, and each shall be firmly secured to the ground so that they do not move.
And a round piece of wood, on which the mechanism is placed, should be turned in the two holes of the two pieces of wood.
And at the end of that is a hole in which the piece of wood is fitted, the length of which is a palm, along with the mechanism; and in the other two pieces of wood is a similar hole.
And then tighten the bindings you have placed around the patient's feet in the hole behind their head, and the bindings you have placed around their thighs in the mechanism behind their feet.
And then, next to each mechanism, a helper should turn the mechanism with their hand, while the physician aligns the vertebra as we have described.
And then, once the vertebra is returned and the area is aligned, you should apply a thick plaster of egg white, then some strips of cloth; then place a wooden splint over the plaster, whose width should be about three fingers, and its length sufficient to cover the area of the swelling, and extend over the affected part of the vertebra.
And then bind it with the bandage as described, and provide the patient with subtle nourishment until they are healed.
And if any lingering issue remains in the area at the end of healing, then medicines that soften and soothe should be administered, with the method of the table (as previously mentioned), for a long time; and a lead plate should also be applied to that area.
And sometimes, a protrusion occurs in the lower vertebrae of the spine, caused by that dislocation;  and it is that bone that is protruding, so you should not use this remedy on it, for it will likely cause your death.
Chapter 31.
Concerning the treatment of a dislocated hip.
Know that the hip joint and the muscle joint can only be dislocated, and what happens to other joints with slight movement and concavity does not happen to them.
And the hip joint is dislocated in four ways, for it is dislocated inwards, or outwards, or forwards, or backwards.
And it is mostly dislocated inwards, and less so forwards or backwards.
A sign of an inward dislocation is that when you adjust the patient's healthy leg with the affected one, the affected leg is longer and the knee is more prominent than the healthy one, and the patient cannot bend their foot towards the groin, and the area where the groin is swollen is hot and inflamed, because the head of the thigh bone has already reached that spot.
The sign of a dislocation outwards is that the symptoms are opposite to this one.
A sign of a forward dislocation is that the patient extends their leg to its fullest, but cannot bend it without pain in the knee, and if forced to go forward cannot do so without pain in the front.  The patient's urine is retained and their groin is inflamed, and they experience difficulty walking on their heel.
A sign of a backward dislocation is that the knee does not extend, nor can the patient bend their knee to reach their groin, and the affected leg is shorter than the other, and the groin is swollen, and the head of the thigh bone is in that area.
However, the reduction of these types of dislocations requires you to consider if the dislocation is old and longstanding, having already been present for a while, then you administer a reduction;  if it remains in the same position after reduction, then the treatment is not complete, and no presumption should be made about its success.
However, for one whose dislocation is recent, and is one of the four types, you must work to return the joint, extending it both inwards and outwards, and gently to the right and left, for if it returns easily, it requires no further treatment.
However, if it does not return in this manner, you must prepare a strong assistant and extend the patient's leg from the lower part, either with the patient's own hands or with a bandage wrapped around the leg above the knee;  another assistant should extend the patient's upper hand so that the patient's hand is under their armpit;  then tighten a strong bandage around the root of the thigh, and a third assistant should hold the end of the bandage.
And the extension should be either from the inside of the knee to the groin area, or from the back to the back area (buttocks).
And apply this extension in all directions until the patient is lifted off the ground by their body weight and hangs suspended.
And this type of extension is a common procedure for all four (types).
And therefore, if the dislocation returns with what we have said, it will be good; but if not, then it is necessary for all cases to consider the specific treatment.
In the specific reduction of a dislocation, when it is dislocated and the dislocation is on the inner side, the patient should be laid on their right side; then place the bandages over the root of the thigh, in the area between the thigh's head and the area below the groin; and then extend the bandage from the groin area up to the highest part of the groin.
And then another strong assistant should take the patient's arms, and firmly hold the thick part of the affected thigh and extend it outwards with strong pulling, for that will return it to its place.
And this type is easier to cure, with which this limb is reduced, than the other types.
But if you are excused from and do not comply with this method of treatment entirely, then it is necessary to tie the patient's two feet together with a strong, light bandage, around both ankles and both heels.
And let the length of each be about four fingers' width, and let the affected leg be extended more than the other by about two fingers' width.
And then the patient should be suspended from the top of a pole, and that should be indoors; and the distance from the ground should be about two arms' length.
And then command a strong young man to grasp the head of the thigh, and let another young man, holding the patient, and the other young man pulling the thigh with strength, push; for the joint returns to its place quickly.
But in the proper reduction, when there is a dislocation outwards, it is necessary for the patient to lie on a pillow, as we have previously recounted regarding a bent knee; and let the bandage be tight around the affected leg and on the patient's feet.
Then two poles should be placed, one at the patient's feet and the other at the head; and then poles should be placed fitted in the middle of a hill upon which damp cloths are wrapped, so that the patient is not harmed because the pole is between their thighs, so that the extension to the lower parts is not pulled.
And then each attendant should extend in their direction, and the physician, with his hand, guides the reduction according to the art.
And when the dislocation is in the anterior parts, then it is necessary that the leg be extended slightly, and it is according to this same procedure on a hill; and the physician places the palm of his right hand on the affected limb, and then grasps it with his other hand, and with this grasping, he extends it downwards towards the side of the injured area.
And if the dislocation is in the posterior parts, then it is not necessary that the patient be extended downwards, but rather elevated above the ground; it is necessary that they be placed on a hard surface, just as it is necessary for the extraction if their shoulder is dislocated outwards, according to what we have said about their lying on two pillows; and they are on their face and their ligaments are stretched, just as we have said, not much.
And it is necessary that compression be administered with a cloth over the area where the joint is.
Therefore, when the reduction is complete, as is necessary – and the sign of its reduction is not hidden from you, and it is that you extend the patient's two legs, and when you see them equal and the patient grips their leg and extends it without excuse, then know that the limb, as is necessary, is returned – and then you align the two sides and apply a bandage and tighten it with a bandage so that the shoulder is not moved in any direction; and keep the patient at rest for three or four days.
And then remove the bandage and the splint, and compare one leg with the other.
Now, if you see those equalities (or congruencies) in appearance, then know that the dislocation has already been fixed, and then allow the patient to go.
And if you see any cause of softening, then you return and bandage that, and tighten it according to your original method of tightening, and leave it for three days.
And then remove it, and have the patient walk with support for a few days, until it is strong again.
Chapter 32.
Of the treatment of a dislocated knee.
The knee is dislocated in three ways, for it is dislocated outwards, inwards, and downwards,  but not backwards, and not forwards.
And the sign of its dislocation is that if you tell the patient to bend their leg at the thigh, then you will know that the knee is dislocated.
And the restoration in all these cases is to have the patient lie down straight, so that they extend their leg as far as possible; grasp their leg close to the knee, and place the patient's foot between your feet; then grip the patient's knee with your palms, holding them between your fingers firmly on the knee, and another assistant should push down on the foot until the knee returns to its proper place.
And the sign of its reduction is that their leg will bend at the thigh with a smooth, effortless movement.
And then bandage that area and bind the leg to the thigh with a bandage for three or four days, and then unbind them.
And do not allow the patient to walk for several days until they are healed and strong.
But if the reduction is beyond your ability, then administer strong traction with the supports which were previously described in the treatment of the hip.
Chapter 33.
Of the treatment of the dislocation of the heel.
The heel is sometimes dislodged by a small movement, and sometimes dislocated completely, and the dislocation is either inward or outward.
And the sign of its dislocation is that sometimes the heel swells on the side towards which it is dislocated.
But the treatment for the small displacement is a gentle repositioning; it should be extended easily with the hands and held until it returns to its place.
But in treating a complete dislocation, you should have the patient lie down straight, and have a strong and capable assistant stand behind the patient's legs, in the middle of the affected area.
Then you, with your right hand, take the foot from the highest part, and with your left hand, from the lower part of the foot, in the area of the ankle.
Then pull the foot towards you with your right hand, and then with the left hand, twice, and then extend with the left; and push the foot with the right towards the leg without effort.
And do this twice, as we have counted.
And then push the foot of the leg a third time, and you are at the ankle.
Therefore, if it returns in one or two attempts using this method, and if you see the foot swollen, that is good; and if not, then repeat the procedure, because that one [the foot] returns.
However, if you are unable to reduce it with what we have described, then have the patient lie on their back on the ground, and place a tightly fixed piece of wood on the ground between their thighs, and you have already covered them with a cloth so that the patient does not injure themselves.
And then the attendant holds the patient's thighs, and another attendant extends the leg with their hands or a bandage tied around the leg's joint; and then each attendant pulls against the other's pull, and the piece of wood is stretched between the patient's thighs, holding that part, so that the patient's body is not pulled in directions below their extension.
And then the physician reduces the dislocation with their hands, and another attendant holds the healthy thigh in the lower areas, for the dislocation returns with ease.
And therefore, when the dislocation returns and the success of the reduction is clear to you, then apply a plaster and bind it firmly with bandages, and bandage the foot to the leg.
And you must be careful or guard against the nerves which are behind the heel, so that the bandage on that area is not too forceful and injures it severely.
And then leave it for two or three days; and if the bandage is softened, tighten it.
And then loosen it on the third or fourth day, and prohibit the patient from movement for 40 days. But if he is forced to walk before that time, there is no guarantee that the dislocation will not be re-displaced and corrupted, and that he will not receive a cure.
And if a boil occurs there, then you must apply to it what was previously described in our narrative, in another location for treatment and poultice, until it is gone.
Chapter 34.
Of the treatment of dislocation of the toes of the feet.
He who is dislocated must be gently straightened without effort; and this is not difficult, rather it is easy.
But if the dislocation is in some bones of the foot, then you must have the patient place their foot on a flat surface on the ground or a table, and be positioned as if they were walking.
And then you stand, and place your foot on what you believe is the dislocated joint, and then press down gently on it with your foot until it returns to its proper place, and you see that it is now straightened and no longer appears out of position.
And then place a board under the sole of the foot, that supports the entire foot, with two ends, and then secure it with a decent and firm bandage for three days; and then loosen it and allow the patient to rest from walking for many days, until the joint is healed and the return to normal movement is assured.
Chapter 35.
Of the types of dislocations that occur with a blow, or a fracture, or both.
When any of these causes occur, and you exert yourself in the treatment and restoration, many times death ensues.
Therefore, one should not presume to treat such a condition, but only those skilled in the art, with long experience, compassionate and patient, slow, neither rash nor presumptuous; and who, at the beginning, should use only soothing medicines for the inflammation, leaving the patient to divine judgment, unless there is hope of recovery from the sickness, and some prospect of relief from the disease. Then endeavor to perform the reduction as soon as possible, before the inflammation becomes severe.
And if the limb returns as desired, then administer a regimen that reduces inflammation and treats the injury with the appropriate desiccant ointments.
And if the dislocation is accompanied by a fracture and the bones are separated, then you must treat their separation, and do in this case what we have said in simple illnesses of similar previous cases.
And, according to your ability, avoid intrusion into the paths of fear, as my teaching has guided you; for this is more beneficial to you from your Creator, and more enduring for your glory, and more salutary for your true self in your time. Thus ends the words of Albucasis, perfectly, for which may God be praised. Amen.
