Of the dislocation of the knee  
The knee dislocates in three ways: namely, inwards, outwards, and backwards; and it does not dislocate forwards.  
And the sign is that you command the patient to bend his leg to his thigh, and if it does not attach to his thigh, know that it is dislocated.  
And the treatment for all is to have the patient sit up straight, and extend his leg if he can, and place your back against his face, and place his foot on your feet.  
Then take his knee in your palms, and pull between your fingers, then press the two sides of the knee firmly; and another assistant extends his foot, until the knee returns to its place, and the sign is that he can bend his leg to his thigh easily.  
And apply the plaster, and bind the leg to the thigh, and tie them together tightly for three or four days, then untie it; and do not let the patient walk until the limb is strengthened.  
And if the limb is not right, apply strong extension, as we have said in the treatment of the hip, until it is healed.
