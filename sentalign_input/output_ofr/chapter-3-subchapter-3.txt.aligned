Know that sometimes both parts of the nose above are broken, or one of them alone, for these are two bones; and the one below is cartilaginous, and does not break, but only bends or twists, and then heals.	You should know that the only portion of the nose that can break is the upper portion in its entirety or in one of its two parts; for it consists of two bones. The lower portion is cartilaginous and unbreakable; what can happen to it is contusion, twisting, or flattening.	0.8343532
And if one of the two parts is broken, you must insert your little finger into the nostril, and with your index finger and thumb from the outside, gently realign the fracture; do this gently, and be careful that the patient does not feel pain from your work.	If one of the two (upper) parts be broken you should pass your little finger into the nostril and straighten out the fracture from inside, with your index and thumb outside, until you reduce the nose to its natural shape; do it gently, and take care that you do not cause the patient pain in doing it.	0.84337056
And if the break is in the upper part of the nose, and your finger cannot reach the place, then you should straighten it with the end of a somewhat thick stick.	If the fracture be in the upper part of the nose and your finger does not reach it, it should be evened by means of a probe with some thickness to it.	0.8324593
And if the break is in two parts, do the same, and hurry to restore it the first day if you can; if not, after the seventh or tenth day, when the hot swelling has subsided, then insert tents of linen cloth into the end of the nose, if the break is in one part.	If the break be on both sides, follow the same course. Haste must be made to set it on the first day if possible; but if not, after the seventh or tenth day when the effusion has subsided.	0.7966316
Or insert another one on the other side, if the break is there; and the tents should be so large that they fill the nostrils.	Then introduce into the nasal foramen a linen pad, if it be a unilateral fracture, or two pads if it be bilateral; the pads should be thick enough to fill the nasal foramen.	0.54090935
And some restorers say that the tents should be moistened with butter and changed every day. It does not seem good to me, but they should be moistened in a mixture of egg white and mill dust; then leave the tent in place until the bone is firm, and the cartilage hardened.	Certain of the ancient bone-setters suggest that you should soak the pads in butter and change them daily, but I do not think so; you should rather soak them in egg-white made up into a paste with mill-dust; then leave the pads in until the bone is firm and the cartilage hardens.	0.83640015
And sometimes goose feathers are inserted into the nose instead of tents, with a soft cloth around them, which holds the break in place, and the patient breathes through them; now do whichever you prefer.	Sometimes, instead of pads, the stems of goose-quills are introduced into the nose after being wound round with a piece of soft cloth, so as to make a stronger support for the fracture of the nose and not to hinder the patient's breathing. This is not absolutely necessary; do it if you prefer; or, if you prefer, put in pads.	0.7302616
And if hot abscesses develop in the nose while you are working there, apply cerate or cotton moistened with rose oil, or a little diachylon.	If during your operation an abscess occurs, apply to the nose a wax plaster or cotton wool soaked in vinegar and oil of roses or a little diachylon ointment.	0.8419768
And if hot abscesses do not develop, apply a cooling plaster made of sesame flour and incense powder, mixed with egg white, then put light compresses on top, and do not bind the nose; and if the break of the nose is small, and it is broken into small pieces, extract them with suitable instruments, then stitch the wound, and treat it with things that generate flesh and promote healing, such as suitable plasters and ointments; and if there is no wound inside the nose, treat it with tents, and insert lead cannulas until it is healed.	If no abscess occurs you should apply externally a plaster of white flour and frankincense made into a paste with egg-white; then put on top some soft tow, but do not bind up the nose at all. If the nasal bones are broken into small pieces or crushed, you should cut down upon them, remove them with a suitable instrument, and then suture the incision and dress with suitable ointments which encourage granulation and scarring. If there occur an internal wound of the nose, you should dress it with pads and employ leaden tubes until it heals.	0.8601358
