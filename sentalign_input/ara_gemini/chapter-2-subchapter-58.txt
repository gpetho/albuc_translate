Chapter fifty-eight on the treatment of urine retained in the bladder
The urine retained in the bladder is due to its blockage from a stone, or clotted blood, or pus, or growing flesh, and so forth.
So if you treat that with the types of treatment described in the classification that we mentioned, and the urine is not released, and you see that its retention is from a stone that has become lodged in the neck of the bladder, then it is appropriate to make the patient kneel on his knees, squatting.
Then a man rides on his back and extends his belly to his back, and the patient holds himself as much as he can, thus forcing the neck of the bladder to push the stone backwards, so the urine is released.
But if it is not released by what we mentioned, and the matter intensifies for the patient, it is appropriate to resort to extracting it with the instrument called a catheter, which is pictured here:
It is made of silver and is thin, smooth, and hollow like the tube of a bird's feather in the thinness of the الميل, long about a span and a half, and has a delicate funnel at its head.
And the way to draw urine with it is to take a doubled thread and tie at its end wool or cotton with a good knot and insert the end of the thread into the bottom of the catheter and cut with scissors if any of the wool remains so that it enters the tube, plugging it like a button.
Then grease the catheter with oil or butter or egg white and sit the patient on a chair and anoint his bladder and urethra with moist ointments or oil and lukewarm water.
Then insert the catheter gently into the urethra until it reaches the base of the urethra, then bend the urethra upwards towards the navel, then push the catheter inside it until the urethra is bent, then push the catheter inwards until, when it reaches near the anus, tilt the penis downwards with the catheter inside it, then push it until it reaches the bladder and the patient feels that it has reached something empty, and it is made in this manner because the passage in which the urine flows is crooked.
Then pull the thread with the wool gently, for the urine will follow the wool.
Then take it out and the urine will pour out.
And reinsert the catheter and continue doing this until the bladder is emptied and the patient feels relief.
