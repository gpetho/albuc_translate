When apoplexy is chronic and you treat it with the remedies we have mentioned and the medication does not help and the patient does not have a fever, then cauterize with four cauteries: on all the horns of the head; with a cautery iron in the middle of the head as we have described; and with a cautery on the nape of the neck. The method of cauterization is done as previously described.	When an apoplexy has lasted a long while and has been treated by those methods we have given and your treatment has been ineffective but the patient has no fever, then burn him with four cauterizations: one on each frontal prominence; one in the middle of his head as we have described; and one at the back of the head as has been said.	0.8602017
