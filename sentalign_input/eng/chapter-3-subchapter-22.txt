 CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO.
On the treatment of fractured bones when they mend crooked and are inhibited from their proper functioning.
When a limb that has been set has some distortion after healing, or the bone that was broken has some prominence or callosity, so that the limb is deformed, but there is nevertheless no limitation of its natural movement, then you should not listen to those who think that the bone should be broken again.
In our parts there have been many ignorant doctors and bone-setters who have done this.
The operation is most blameworthy and leads to great dangers, death itself not being the worst possibility.
But if the distortion and callosity be recent you should massage it with an infusion of the herbs that have an emollient quality, such as leaves and roots of the marsh mallow, and melilot and the like: and apply one of the emollient plasters such as carefully prepared diachylon.
Or take mucilage of the root of the marsh mallow and beat it up with chicken fat and oil of sesame, and let a cataplasm of these be applied.
Or take a fat fig and beat it up with pigeon's dung; and the like remedies that are termed 'inhibitors of scarring'.
Sometimes also the callosity is resolved by long-continued gentle friction with the hands; and constant movement in every direction should also be applied.
But if the deformity be long-standing and fixed and hardened and you are compelled to treat it operatively, you will have to cut down on it from above, and free the junction of the bone, and with fine chisels cut away the redundant callus or bone; be gentle in this, with diligence and care.
Then treat the wound with the means previously described until it heals.
