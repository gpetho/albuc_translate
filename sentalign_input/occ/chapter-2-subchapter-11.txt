On methods of treating 'tactimi' of the eye.
When hair grows on the eyelids under the natural lashes and becomes hardened, it irritates the eye and causes conditions such as constant tearing and softening of the eyelids, which can lead to eye damage called 'tactini.' It is treated in four ways: by cautery with fire; with sharp medicine as previously described in the chapter on cautery; by making incisions and sutures; or by using canes, as I will describe.
Rest the patient's head on your lap, turn the eyelid with your left hand, and if it turns, it is good; if not, insert a needle with a thread from below the eyelid, penetrate the upper part, near the eyelid margin where the hairs grow, and pull the thread up through the eyelid.
Make an incision on the inner part of the eyelid below the abnormal hairs from the major to the minor lacrimal, then extract the thread, place small powders of cotton or cloth under the eyelid, and suture the eyelid in a shape like a myrtle leaf.
The shape should correspond to the elevation of the eyelid, which varies among people, as some require a large amount of the eyelid to be incised according to the extent of the softening.
Then make the incision along the two marked lines, starting from the major to the minor lacrimal.
And your incision near the natural hairs should be as thick as a king's hair.
Then place the hook in one of the two corners of the cut, scrape it entirely, align the two edges with a thread or fine wool, wipe the blood, and adhere the excess threads to the two eyebrows with a sticky substance if desired, otherwise don't bother.
Leave the stitches for three to four days, then treat it.
If you wish, leave the wound without sutures and treat it with something that dries and tightens, as the eyelid will elevate due to the wound sealing and fluid accumulation; but suturing is better. This is what the ancients say about 'taxanir.'
Be attentive to the patient, it is a good procedure, and there is no danger in it.
Another method in 'taxmir' is to mark a myrtle leaf shape on the eyelid, lift the eyelid with three separated and gathered hooks as follows:
If it is not possible to use the hooks, take a needle with a thread, insert it in the middle of the shape, another thread near the major lacrimal, and another near the minor lacrimal, hold the threads evenly, and lift the entire marked area as described.
Then stitch the two edges of the wound and treat it until it heals.
If an abscess forms near your incision or wound, treat it with plaster and ointment.
Sometimes the eyelid hair turns inward, then you should use the described incision method; but suturing is more skillful.
Treating with canes follows this method:
Turn the eyelid and cut the described shape; then make two thin canes or slivers with a length matching the eyelid and a width less than the incision.
Make incisions at the ends of each part where you hold the threads.
Gently place each cane over the excess eyelid tissue, bind them tightly, and leave them for several days; the tissue will die and fall off by itself.
If delayed, break it with forceps, and treat the wound until it heals.
Once healed, the eyelid will be lifted, and the hairs will not irritate.
This is the method of making two canes as described:
They should be the correct length and width, no more, no less.
