Praefatio.	Preface.
Postquam compleui uobis o Filii, librum hunc, qui est postremus scientiae in medicina cum complemento ipsius, et consecutus sum finem in eo, ex expositionibus eius, et ipsius declarationibus, uisum est mihi, ut compleam ipsum uobis cum hoc Tractatu qui est pars operationis, id est, chirurgiae cum manu.	Having completed for you, children, this book, which is the final treatise in medicine with its completion, and having reached its conclusion by its explanations and its statements, it has seemed good to me to complete it for you with this treatise, which is a part of surgery, that is, of surgery by hand.
Quoniam operatio cum manu prostrata est in regione nostra, et tempore nostro priuata omnino: donec fortasse periit scientia eius, et abscissum est uestigium eius: et non remanserunt ex ea, nisi descriptiones paruae in libris antiquorum, quas mutauerunt manus: et accidit eis error et haesitatio, donec clausae sunt intentiones eius, et elongata est uis ipsius: Visum est mihi, ut uiuificem eam cum ordinatione huius Tractatus in ea secundum uiam ex positionis, et declarationis, et abbreuiationis: et ut ueniam cum formis ferramentorum Cauterii, et reliquorum instrumentorum operis: cum fit ex declarationis additione, et ex properatione eius quod est necesse.	Since surgery by hand is fallen into disuse in our region and in our time, entirely private; until perhaps its knowledge perished and its trace was severed; and nothing remained of it but small descriptions in the books of the ancients, which were altered by hands, and error and hesitation befell them, until its intentions were closed and its vision distanced; it has seemed good to me to revive it with the arrangement of this treatise, according to the way of exposition, explanation, and abbreviation, and to come with forms of cautery instruments, and the other surgical instruments; with the addition of explanation, and with the haste of what is necessary.
Caussa autem propter quam non inuenitur bonus artifex eius cum manu sua in hoc nostro tempore, est: quia ars medicinae est longa, et oportet auctorem eius exercitari ante illud in scientia anatomiae, quam narrauit Galenus, donec sciat iuuamenta membrorum, et ipsorum formas, et eorum coniunctionem, et separationem, et habeat cognitionem ossium, et neruorum, et lacertorum, et numerum ipsorum, et eorum egressionem, et uenarum pulsatilium, et quietarum, et locorum exitus earum.	The reason why a good craftsman is not found with his hand in this time of ours, is: because the art of medicine is long, and its author needs to be practiced beforehand in the knowledge of anatomy, which Galen described, until he knows the aids of the limbs, and their shapes, and their connections, and their separation, and has knowledge of the bones, and nerves, and tendons, and their number, and their exits, and the pulsating and still veins, and the places of their exits.
Et propter illud dixit Hippocrates, quod nomen cum nomine est multum, et cum opere est paucum, et praecipue in arte manus.	And because of that, Hippocrates said that name with name is much, and with work is little, and especially in the art of the hand.
Nos uero iam diximus de illo in introitu huius libri.	We however have already spoken of that at the beginning of this book.
Quoniam qui non est sciens, quod diximus de anatomia, non euacuatur, quin iam cadat in errorem, quo interficiuntur homines: sicut ego uidi multos ex illis, qui formantur de hac scientia, et iactant se de ea absque scientia, et sine experimento.	Since he who is not knowledgeable about what we have said about anatomy is not excused from falling into the error by which men are killed; just as I have seen many of those who are formed in this science, and boast of it without knowledge and without experience.
Quod est, quia uidi medicum stolidum secuisse apostema scrophulosum in collo mulieris, et incidit quasdam arterias in collo: quare fluxit sanguis mulieris, donec cecidit mortua inter manus eius.	That is, because I saw a foolish physician cut an abscess on the woman's neck, and he cut some arteries in the neck, so that the woman's blood flowed until she fell dead between his hands.
Et uidi medicum alium, qui praesumpsit ut extraheret lapidem uiro, qui processerat in aetate, et lapis erat magnus.	And I saw another physician, who presumed to extract a stone from a man who was advanced in age, and the stone was large.
Peruenit ergo ad eum, et extraxit ipsum cum frusto uesicae.	Therefore, he reached it and extracted it with a piece of the bladder.
Quare mortuus est uir in tertio die.	Therefore the man died on the third day.
Et ego quidem iam uocatus fueram ad extrahendum ipsum: et uidi ex magnitudine lapidis, et dispositione infirmi, quod moriretur.	And I myself had already been called to extract it: and I saw from the size of the stone, and the condition of the sick man, that he would die.
Et uidi medicum alium, qui accipiebat stipem apud quendam Ducum terrae nostrae propter medicinam: et accidit eunucho nigro, qui erat apud ipsum, fractura in crure eius prope calcaneum: et properauit medicus cum ignorantia sua, et strinxit fracturam super uulnus cum puluinaribus, et astellis strictura forti, et non dimisit uulneri expirationem.	And I saw another physician, who was receiving payment from a certain Duke of our land for medicine: and it happened to a black eunuch, who was with him, a fracture in his leg near the heel: and the physician, in his ignorance, hurried and bound the fracture over the wound with pillows and small stones with strong constriction, and did not allow the wound any breathing space.
Deinde absoluit eum secundum desyderia sua.	Then he discharged him according to his own desires.
Postea dimisit eum diebus aliquot, et praecepit ei, ne solueret ligamentum: et stetit sic donec apostematum est crus eius, et ipsius pes, et peruenit ad perditionem.	Afterwards he dismissed him for a few days, and ordered him not to loosen the bandage: and he stood thus until his leg and foot were ulcerated, and reached destruction.
Vocatus sum ergo ad eum: et properaui ad soluendum ligamentum: et consecuta est tranquillitas, et euasit a doloribus suis.	I was therefore summoned to him: and I hastened to loosen the bandage: and tranquility followed, and he escaped his pains.
Verumtamen corruptio iam confirmata erat in membro: et non potui refraenare ipsam.	However, corruption had already become firmly established in the limb, and I was unable to restrain it.
Pon ergo cessauit corruptio perambulare in membro, donec periit.	Therefore, the corruption ceased to spread through the limb, until it perished.
Et uidi medicum alium, qui perforauit apostema cancerosum: et ulceratum est post dies, donec magnificata est malicia eius cum domino ipsius.	And I saw another physician, who pierced the cancerous ulcer: and it ulcerated after days, until its malice increased with its master.
Quod est, quia quando est cancer purus ex humore melancholico, tunc non oportet ut perueniatur ad eum cum ferro omnino, nisi sit in membro quod toleret, ut abscindatur totum eius.	That is because when cancer is pure from melancholic humor, then it is not necessary to reach it with iron at all, unless it is in a limb that can tolerate having all of it amputated.
Et propter illud o Filii, necesse est uobis, ut sciatis, quod operatio cum manu diuiditur in duas diuisiones: scilicet, operationem cui associatur salus: et operationem, cum qua est periculum in pluribus dispositionibus.	And therefore, my children, it is necessary for you to know that surgery, with its hands, is divided into two divisions: namely, surgery to which health is associated; and surgery with which there is danger in many dispositions.
Et ego iam excitaui in omni loco huius libri, in quo uenit operatio, in qua est terror et timor.	And I have now aroused in every place of this book, in which surgery comes, in which there is terror and fear.
Quare necesse est uobis, ut caueatis illud, et dimitatis ipsum: ut non inueniant stolidi uiam ad loquendum, et dehonestandum.	Therefore it is necessary for you to beware of that, and to cut it short, so that fools may not find a way to speak ill of it and dishonor it.
Accipite ergo mensuram cum sollicitudine et protectione, et infirmos uestros cum facilitate et firmitudine, et utimini uia meliore perducente gratia Dei ad salutem et successionem laudabilem: et dimittite aegritudines terribiles difficilis sanationis: et tollite animas uestras ab eo quod facit uos timere, ut ingrediatur super uos haesitatio in fide uestra et commodo uestro.	Therefore, receive the measure with care and protection, and your sick with ease and firmness, and use the better way leading by God's grace to health and a laudable succession; and leave the terrible sicknesses of difficult cure; and remove your souls from that which makes you fear, so that hesitation may enter upon your faith and your advantage.
Est enim magis remanens ad gloriam uestram, et sublimius in mundo isto, et postremo ad quantitates uestras.	For it is more remaining to your glory, and more sublime in this world, and finally to your quantities.
Galenus enim iam dixit in quibusdam suis admonitionibus.	For Galen has already said in some of his admonitions.
Non medicetis aegritudinem malam: ne nominemini medici mali.	Do not treat a bad illness, lest you be called a bad physician.
Iam autem diuisi hunc Tractatum secundum tria Capitula. ¶	Now I have divided this Treatise into three Chapters.
Capitulum primum.	First Chapter.
De Cauterio cum igne, et Cauterio cum medicina acuta, capitulatum, et ordinatum a capite usque ad pedes, et formis instrumentorum, et ferramentis Cauterii: et omni quod necessarium est in operatione. ¶	Concerning the cautery with fire, and the cautery with a sharp medicine, chaptered and ordered from head to foot, and the forms of instruments, and the implements of the cautery, and everything necessary in the operation.
Capitulum secundum.	Second Chapter.
De sectione et perforatione, phlebotomia et uentosis, et uulneribus: et extractione sagittarum, et similibus illius: et totum capitulatum, ordinatum formis instrumentorum. ¶	Concerning section and perforation, phlebotomy and cupping, and wounds, and the extraction of arrows, and similar things to it: and the whole chaptered, ordered by the forms of instruments.
Capitulum tertium.	Third Chapter.
De restauratione, et dislocatione, et curatione torsionis, et similibus illius: capitulatum, ordinatum a capite usque ad pedes, et formis instrumentorum.	Concerning restoration, and dislocation, and the treatment of twisting, and similar things to it: chaptered, ordered from head to foot, and the forms of instruments.
Soli Deo Gloria.	To God alone be glory.
Liber Chirurgici Albucasis.	Albucasis's Surgical Book.
Pars I.	Part I.
¶ De Iuuamento, et Nocumento Cauterii: et quibus complexionibus conueniat, et quo tempore: et si cum ferro, uel auro.	Concerning the benefit and harm of the cautery: and in which temperaments it is suitable, and at what time: and if with iron, or gold.
Caput I.	Chapter 1.
Sed Ante Quidem Quam rememorer operationis cum eo, oportet ut dicam qualitatem Iuuamentorum eius, et Nocumentorum ipsius: et in qua complexione exhibeatur.	But before I recall the operation with it, it is necessary to say the quality of its benefits and harms, and in what temperament it should be used.
Dico ergo, quod sermo de qualitate iuuamenti Cauterii, et nocumenti eius, est sermo prolixus, et subtilis, scientia, et secretum occultum.	Therefore I say that the discussion of the quality of the cautery's benefit and harm is a lengthy and subtle discussion, a matter of knowledge and hidden secrets.
Etiam locuta fuit in eo multitudo sapientum, et dissenserunt in eo: et mihi quidem sufficit parum ex sermonibus eorum, timens prolongationem.	Many wise men have spoken on it, and disagreed, and for me a little of their words is enough, fearing prolixity.
Dico ergo, quod Cauterium confert uniuersaliter omni complexioni, quae est cum materia, et absque materia: excaeptis duabus complexionibus, quae sunt complexio calida absque materia, et complexio sicca absque materia.	Therefore I say that cautery is beneficial to every temperament, whether with matter or without matter, except for two temperaments: a hot temperament without matter, and a dry temperament without matter.
In complexione autem calida et sicca cum materia dissenserunt.	However, they disagreed in the hot and dry temperament with matter.
Quidam enim dixerunt, quod Cauterium iuuatiuum est in ea.	For some said that cautery is beneficial in it.
Et dixerunt alii contrarium illius, scilicet quod Cauterium non est conueniens in aegritudine, quae est ex caliditate et siccitate: quoniam natura ignis est caliditas: et inconueniens est, ut sanetur ex agritudine calida et sicca, cum calido et sicco.	And others said the opposite, namely that cautery is not suitable in a sickness arising from heat and dryness, because the nature of fire is heat; and it is unsuitable that one should be cured of a hot and dry illness with something hot and dry.
Et dixit ille qui dicit contrarium illius: quod per Cauterium fit iuuamentum in omni aegritudine calida et sicca, quae accidit in corporibus hominum: quoniam quando tu comparas corpus hominis, et humiditates eius, ad complexionem ignis, inuenis corpus hominis frigidum.	And he who says the opposite stated that cautery is beneficial in every hot and dry illness that occurs in human bodies, because when you compare the human body and its humours to the temperament of fire, you find the human body to be cold.
Et ego quidem dico per sermonem eius: quia ex perimentum iam detexit mihi illud aliquotiens.	And I, indeed, say through his speech, that through experience it has revealed that to me several times.
Verumtamen non oportet, ut ueniat super illud, nisi qui iam probatus est, et exercitatus in capitulo Cauterii exercitio ultimo, et cognouit diuersitatem complexionum hominum, et dispositionem aegritudinum in se ipsis, et caussas earum, et accidentia ipsarum, et spacium temporis earum.	However, it is not appropriate for anyone to undertake it unless they have already been proven and practiced in the final exercise of cautery, and have knowledge of the diversity of human complexions and the disposition of illnesses within themselves, and their causes, and their accidents, and their time span.
Ex reliquis autem complexionibus non est super uos timor: et praecipue in aegritudinibus frigidis et humidis.	However, there is no fear concerning the remaining complexions, and especially in cold and moist illnesses.
Iam enim conuenerunt omnes medici super eas: et non dissenserunt in iuuamento cum Cauterio in eis.	For already all physicians have agreed on them, and have not disagreed on the benefit of cautery in them.
Et scitote filii, quod ex secreto curationis per Cauterium cum igne, et bonitate eius super Cauterium cum medicina comburente est: quoniam ignis est simplex, cuius actio non peruenit, nisi ad membrum quod cauterisatur: et non nocet membro alio coniuncto cum eo, nisi nocumento paruo.	And know, children, that the secret of healing through cautery with fire, and its goodness over cautery with burning medicine, is this: since fire is simple, its action does not reach beyond the limb that is cauterized; and it does not harm another limb joined to it, except with a small harm.
Medicinae uero comburentis actio peruenit ad illud quod elongatur ex membris: et fortasse facit accidere in membro aegritudinem difficilis sanationis, et fortasse interficit.	However, the action of burning medicine reaches that which is distant from the limbs; and perhaps it causes illness of difficult healing in the limb, and perhaps kills it.
Ignis autem propter subtilitatem suam et bonitatem substantiae suae, non facit illud, nisi superfluat.	But fire, because of its subtlety and goodness of its substance, does not do that unless it overflows.
Iam uero innotuit nobis illud per experimentum, propter longitudinem seruitutis et studii cum arte, et stationem super ueritatem rerum: et propter illud excusor a longitudine sermonis.	However, this has now become known to us through experiment, because of the length of our service and study of the art, and our standing on the truth of things; and because of this I am excused from the length of speech.
Et si non esset, quia non licet huic libro meo, afferrem uobis secretum occultum in igne, et qualitatem operationis eius in corporibus expulsionis suae, qua expellit aegritudines sermone philosophico demonstratiuo, qui acueretur a mentibus uestris.	And if it were not so, because it is not permitted to this book of mine, I would reveal to you the hidden secret in fire, and the quality of its operation on the bodies of its expulsion, by which it expels illnesses, demonstrated by a philosophical, demonstrative discourse, which would be sharpened by your minds.
Et scitote filii, quod ipsi dissentiunt in tempore, in quo conuenit fieri cauterium, et ponunt melius tempus ueris.	And know, children, that they disagree on the time in which the cautery should be performed, and they put a better time as spring.
Et ego dico, quod cauterium conuenit in omni tempore: propterea, quod nocumentum accidens propter tempus submergitur in iuuamento, quod attrahitur cum cauterio.	And I say that cautery is suitable at any time; because the harm that is accidental due to the time is submerged in the benefit that is drawn with the cautery.
Et praecipue si cauterium est propter dolores ex doloribus necessariis, fortibus, festinis, qui non tolerant tarditatem: propterea quod timetur ex eis, quod accidat malicia quae est maior, quam paruum nocumentum intrans propter tempus.	And especially if the cautery is for pains from necessary, strong, urgent pains, which do not tolerate delay; because it is feared from them that a greater harm may occur than the small harm that enters due to the time.
Et non cadat in mentibus uestris o filii illud, quod non extimant, nisi uulgus et stolidi medici, scilicet quod illi aegritudini quae sanatur per cauterium, non est reditio semper: et ponunt illud consequens, et res non est sicut putant: propterea quod cauterium non est, nisi loco medicinae, quae alterat complexionem, et exiccat humiditates quae sunt caussae, quare accidunt dolores.	And do not let it fall into your minds, O children, that which only the common people and foolish physicians fear, namely that the illness which is cured by cautery does not always have a return; and they posit that as a consequence, and the matter is not as they think: because cautery is not, unless in place of medicine, which alters the complexion and dries the humours which are the causes, why the pains occur.
Verumtamen cauterium superfluit super medicinam per uelocitatem ualetudinis suae, et uirtutem suae operationis, et uehementiam dominii sui: et possibile est, ut redeat aegritudo hora aliqua temporis secundum complexionem infirmi, et locationem aegritudinis suae, et uirtutem eius: et quod praeparatur in corpore eius ex aggregatione superfluitatum in eo: et quod peruenit ad ipsum in acquisitione sua ex cibis, et similibus illis ex caussis, nisi fit aegritudo, in qua administratur cauterium.	However, cautery is superior to medicine by the speed of its health, and the power of its operation, and the vehemence of its dominion; and it is possible that the illness may return at some time according to the patient's complexion, and the location of their illness, and its power; and that which is prepared in their body from the accumulation of superfluities in it; and that which comes to them in its acquisition from foods, and similar things from such causes, unless an illness occurs, to which cautery is administered.
Aegritudo subtilis in membro paucarum superfluitatum, et humiditatum, sicut cauterium dentis, propter dolorem, et similia illi, possibile est enim, ut non redeat in eo ille dolor.	A subtle illness in a limb of few superfluities and humours, like the cautery of a tooth, because of the pain, and similar to it, for it is possible that that pain will not return to it.
Sed illud fit in paucis.	But that happens in few cases.
At uero sermo uulgi iterum, quod cauterium est postremum medicinae, est sermo rectus: non ad illud quod ipsi intendunt in illo: quoniam ipsi credunt, quod non est curatio quae conferat cum medicina, neque cum alio post occasum cauterii.	But truly the common people's statement, that cautery is the last of medicine, is a correct statement; not in the sense that they intend in that, because they believe that there is no cure which can compare to medicine, nor to anything after the cautery has passed.
Res autem est econtrario illius, et intentio, quod cauterium est postremum medicinae, non est, nisi quod quando nos administramus modos curationis in aliqua aegritudinum, et non conferunt illae medicinae: deinde administramus in fine rei cauterium, et confert: tunc inde cadit, quod cauterium est postremum mediciuae, non secundum intentionem quam intelligunt uulgus et multistolidorum medicorum.	However, the matter is the opposite of that, and the intention that cautery is the last resort of medicine is not unless that when we administer methods of treatment for an illness, and those medicines do not work; then we administer cautery at the end of the matter, and it does work; then from this it follows that cautery is the last resort of medicine, not according to the intention understood by the common people and many foolish physicians.
Antiqui autem dixerunt, quod cauterium cum auro est melius, quam cauterium cum ferro: et non dixerunt illud, nisi propter aequalitatem auri, et sublimitatem substantiae suae: et dixerunt, quod non facit pus locus cauterii.	However, the ancients said that cautery with gold is better than cautery with iron, and they did not say this except because of the equal nature of gold and the nobility of its substance; and they said that the site of the cautery does not cause pus.
Verum non est illud absolute: quoniam ego iam probaui illud, et inueni, quod ipsum non facit illud in quibusdam corporibus absque aliis.	However, that is not absolutely so, because I have already tested it, and found that it does not do that in some bodies without others.
Et cauterium cum ipso est bonum, et melius quam cum ferro, sicut dixerunt.	And cautery with it [gold] is good, and better than with iron, as they said.
Verumtamen quando tu ignis cauterium in igne ex auro, non declaratur tibi, quando ignitur secundum quantitatem quam uis, propter rubedinem auri: et quando properat ad ipsum frigus, et si addis super ipsum ignitionem, liquescit in igne, et uertitur in laminas.	However, when you make a cautery of gold in fire, it is not clear to you when the fire reaches the desired amount because of the redness of the gold; and when it quickly approaches cold, and if you add further fire to it, it melts in the fire and turns into sheets.
Quare cadit artifex ex illo in occupationem: et propter illud fit Cauterium cum ferro apud nos uelocius et propinquius, ex rectitudine ad operationem.	Therefore, the craftsman falls from that into occupation, and because of that, cautery with iron is faster and more suitable for us, by virtue of its suitability to the operation.
Et ego quidem iam ordinaui hoc Capitulum in Cauterio, secundum capitula: et ordinaui ea a capite usque ad pedes: ut alleuient quaerenti illud quod uult ex eo.	And I have indeed already arranged this chapter on cautery, according to chapters, and arranged them from head to foot, so that they will relieve the one seeking what they want from it.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Caput in commissura coronali.	Concerning the method of cauterizing the head at the coronal suture.
Caput II.	Chapter II.
Confert hic cauterizatio ad dominium humiditatis et frigiditatis super cerebrum: quae duae sunt caussae sodae, et multitudinis fluxus humorum ex capite ad partes oculorum et aurium, et multitudinis somni, et doloris dentium, et doloris gutturis: et uniuersaliter omnis aegritudinis, quae accidit ex frigiditate, sicut paralisis, et sodae, epilepsiae, et apoplexiae, et similia illis ex aegritudinibus.	This cauterization benefits by controlling moisture and cold upon the brain:  which two are the cause of headaches, and the multitude of flowing humors from the head to the eyes and ears, and of much sleep, and toothache, and throat pain; and universally all illness that arises from cold, such as paralysis, and headaches, and epilepsy, and apoplexies, and similar illnesses.
Modus cauterizationis est, ut praecipias infirmo: ut euacuetur in primis cum medicina solutiua mundificante caput tribus noctibus, aut quatuor, secundum quod exigit uirtus infirmi, et eius aetas, et consuetudo eius.	The method of cauterization is, that you prescribe to the sick person, that he be evacuated first with a cleansing, dissolving medicine, for three or four nights, according to the strength of the sick person, and their age, and their custom.
Deinde praecipe ei, ut radi faciat caput suum cum nouacula.	Then prescribe that he make his head bare with a razor.
Deinde fac eum sedere inter manus tuas quadratum, ita quod iam posuit manus suas super pectus suum.	Then make him sit between your hands, squared, so that he has already placed his hands upon his chest.
Deinde pone radicem palmae tuae super radicem nasi sui inter oculos suos.	Then place the root of your palm upon the root of his nose between his eyes.
Vbicumque ergo peruenerit digitus tuus medius, signa locum illum cum incausto.	Wherever, therefore, your middle finger shall arrive, mark that place with the cautery.
Deinde igni Cauterium Oliuare: cuius haec est forma.	Then apply the olive-shaped cautery to the fire.
Deinde pone ipsum super locum signatum cum incausto, descensione, qua constringatur manus tua paulatim, et tu reuolues ipsum.	Then place it upon the place marked with the cautery, descending, with which your hand is gradually bound, and you shall revolve it.
Deinde leua manum tuam uelociter, et aspicias locum.	Then quickly lift your hand, and observe the place.
Quod si uides iam detegi ex osse quantitatem capitis alkiel, aut quantitatem zeuherbi, tunc eleua manum tuam.	If you see now a quantity of head of alkiel, or a quantity of zeuherb, detached from the bone, then raise your hand.
Et si non, itera manum tuam ferro ipso, aut cum alio ab ipso si infrigidatur: donec uideantur ossa, quae dixi tibi.	And if not, repeat your hand with the iron itself, or with another of it if it grows cold, until the bones are seen, which I told you.
Deinde sume aliquid ex sale, et solue illud in aqua, et imbibe in ipso cotum, et pone super locum: et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus.	Then take some salt, and dissolve it in water, and soak the cloth in it, and place it on the place; and leave it for three days.
Deinde pone super ipsum cotum imbibitum in butyro, et dimitte illum super locum, donec destruatur eschara ignis.	Then place the cloth soaked in butter on it, and leave it on the place until the scab is destroyed by the fire.
Deinde cura illud cum unguento tetrapharmacon, usquequo sanetur.	Then treat it with the four-drug ointment until it is healed.
Iam dixerunt, quod quanto uulnus plus remanet apertum, emittit pus: quare est melius et magis iuuatiuum.	They have said that the more a wound remains open, the more pus it emits: therefore it is better and more helpful.
Et dixerunt quidam eorum, ut cauterizetur cutis usque ad os: et teneatur Cauterium, donec aduratur quiddam spissitudinis ossis.	And some of them said that the skin should be cauterized down to the bone, and the cautery should be held until something of the thickness of bone is burned.
Deinde radatur post illud quod adustum est ex osse, deinde curetur.	Then shave off that which has been burned from the bone, then treat it.
Et dicunt alii, quod oportet ut cum cauterio perueniatur ad ultimum, donec imprimat in os impressionem for tem, ita quod cadat os, quod fit sicut forma kirate: aut instrumentum quod mulieres ponunt infuso alphabeti parui: et extimant, quod exspirantur ex hoc loco uapores capitis, et dimittatur uulnus apertum tempore longo.	And others say that it is necessary to reach the ultimate point with the cautery, until it imprints a hollow form in the bone, so that the bone falls off, which is done as a kind of kirate shape: or an instrument that women use when applying small alphabetic infusions.  And they believe that vapors of the head are expelled from this place, and the wound should be left open for a long time.
Deinde curetur, donec consolidetur.	Then treat it until it consolidates.
Mihi autem non uidentur hae duae species Cauterii omnino nisi in quibusdam hominibus secundum uiam timoris.	However, these two types of cautery do not seem to me to be suitable for everyone, except in some cases, according to the way of fear.
Et dimittere ipsum, apud me est melius cum salute ipsius.	And to leave it, in my opinion, is better with the safety of the person.
Debilitatur enim caput ex solutione continuitatis ipsius naturalis: sicut testificati sumus in reliquis membris: et praecipue quando caput infirmi debile est natura: et species quidem Cauterii prima est magis salua et melior apud me, et ea utor: operare ergo cum ea in salute.	For the head is weakened by the disruption of its natural continuity, as we have seen in other members; and especially when the head of the weak person is naturally feeble.  And indeed, the first type of cautery is safer and better in my view, and I use it; therefore operate with it for safety.
¶ De modo cauterizandi capitis in dolore totius capitis.	Concerning the method of cauterizing the head in pain of the entire head.
Caput III.	Chapter III.
Quando in toto Capite accidit dolor chronicus: et prolongatur illud in infirmo, et utitur hyeris, et cochiis, et caputpurgiis, et oleis, et empleumatis.	When chronic pain occurs in the entire head, and it is prolonged in the sick person, and he uses leeches, and cupping, and head purges, and oils, and plasters.
Et praecipue si iam cauterizatum est cauterio uno, quod narrauimus, et non confert ei aliquid ex illis: tunc considera.	And especially if it has already been cauterized with the one cautery that we have described, and none of those things help it, then consider.
Nam si caput infirmi est fortis creationis natura, et non est debile, et inuenit frigus uehemens: tunc cauteriza cum cauterio alio sub illo parum.	For if the sick person's head is of strong natural constitution, and is not weak, and encounters violent cold, then cauterize with another cautery beneath the first slightly.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum super omne cornu capitis sui cauterio, do nec pertranseat cutis, et discooperiatur ex osse quantitas, quam narrauimus.	Then cauterize it on every horn of his head with a cautery, but not so that the skin is pierced and a quantity of bone is exposed, as we have described.
Et cauteriza ipsum cauterio uno in occipitio capitis sui, in loco qui nominatur uas: et est locus in quo ponitur uentosa: et eleua matum tuam in hoc, et non discooperias os.	And cauterize it with one cautery on the back of his head, in the place called the *vas* (vessel), and it is the place where a cupping glass is placed; and raise your cautery there, and do not expose the bone.
Infirmus enim inuenit propter illud dolorem uehementem, et diuersum a dolore reliquorum cauteriorum capitis omnium.	For the sick person experiences a violent and different pain because of that, from the pain of all the other cauteries on the head.
Et ego dicam hoc Cauterium in loco suo: et oportet quod sit cauterium, quo cauterizantur cornua capitis, et occiput eius subtilius cauterio, quo cauterizatur medium capitis.	And I will say that this cautery should be in its proper place; and it should be a cautery for cauterizing the horns of the head, and the back of his head with a finer cautery than that used to cauterize the middle of the head.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in hemicrania, tam cum medicina adustiua, quam cum ferro.	Concerning the method of cauterization in a hemicrania, both with a cauterizing medicine and with iron.
Caput IIII.	Chapter IV.
Quando accidit in parte capitis dolor et soda, aut extenditur dolor usque ad oculum, et euacuatur cum medicinis mundificantibus caput, et administratur reliqua curatio, quam dixi in diuisionibus aegritudinum, et non confert illud totum: tunc cauterizatio in eo est secundum duos modos: aut cauterizatio cum medicina acuta comburente: aut cum ferro.	When pain and throbbing occur in a part of the head, or the pain extends to the eye, and it is relieved with cleansing medicines for the head, and the remaining treatment, as I have described in the divisions of illnesses, is given, but it all does not help: then cauterization is performed on that part in two ways: either by cauterization with a burning, sharp medicine, or with iron.
Cauterium autem cum medicina acuta comburente, est, ut accipias dentem unum allii, et excortices ipsum, et abscindas extremitates eius ex duobus lateribus.	The cautery with a burning, sharp medicine is to take one garlic clove, peel it, and cut off its ends on both sides.
Deinde scinde locum doloris in tempore cum phlebotomo lato, donec fiat in eo locus sub cute, in quo dens capitur.	Then, with a broad lancet, incise the painful area until a space is created beneath the skin in which the clove is placed.
Intromitte ergo eum in ipso sub cute, donec occultetur: deinde stringe super ipsum cum puluillo constrictione decenti, et dimitte ipsum quantitate quindecim horarum deinde solue eum, et extrahe allium, et dimitteuulnus duobus diebus, aut tribus: postea pone super ipsum cotum submersum in butyro, donec locus efficiat pus: deinde cura ipsum cum unguento usquequo sanetur.	Then insert it into the space beneath the skin until it is hidden; then bind it over with a suitable constriction pad, and leave it for fifteen hours. Then release it, remove the garlic, and allow the wound to heal for two or three days. Afterward, apply a poultice soaked in butter until the area produces pus. Then treat it with ointment until it is healed.
Et si uis fac illud cum quibusdam medicinis comburentibus, quas ego scripsi in tractatu duodecimo, de Medieinis adurentibus.	And if you wish, do it with some burning medicines, which I have written about in the twelfth treatise, on Burning Medicines.
Cauterizatio uero eius cum ferro, est secundum hunc modum.	The cauterization of it with iron, is according to this method.
Igni Cauterium, cuius forma haec est.	A cautery of fire, whose form is this.
Et nominatur Clauilis: quoniam forma capitis eius est sicut forma claui, in quo est quiddam curuitatis, et in medio eius est quaedam eminentia parua.	And it is called a Clavil, because the shape of its head is like the shape of a nail, in which there is something curved, and in its middle is a small eminence.
Deinde pone ipsum super locum, et retine manum tuam: et tu reuolue ferrum paulatim cum uelocitate: et sit quantitas quae aduritur ex spissitudine cutis, sicut medietas eius.	Then place it on the area, and hold your hand, and you turn the iron slowly with speed, and the amount burned should be, from the thickness of the skin, as much as half of it.
Et eleua manum tuam, ut non aduratur arteria, quae est inferius, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	And raise your hand, so that the artery, which is below, is not burned, and a flow of blood occurs.
Deinde imbibe cotum in aqua salis, et pone super locum, et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus: deinde pone cotum cum butyro: postea cura cum unguento usquequo sanetur.	Then soak a cloth in salt water, and place it on the area, and leave it for three days; then place the cloth with butter; afterwards treat with ointment until it is healed.
Et si uis, cauteriza hanc hemicraniam cum extremitate cultellari secunda Cauterii.	And if you wish, cauterize this hemicrania with the second cautery's knife-like end.
Et caue ab incisione arteriae in hac hemicrania, non antiqua proprie.	And beware of cutting the artery in this hemicrania, not properly ancient.
¶ De modo cauteriezandi in hemicrania antiqua.	Concerning the method of cauterizing in ancient hemicrania.
Caput V.	Chapter V.
Quando curas hemicraniam, cum eo quod diximus ex curatione praecedente, et quod diximus in diuisionibus aegritudinum, et non confert curatio: et uides ex aegritudine, quod non sufficit ei quod diximus ex cauterio primo cum medicina, aut cum cauterio cum igne, tunc oportet ut ignias Cauterium cultellare, donec albificetur postquam signas super locum doloris cum linea, cuius longitudo sit medietas digiti, aut quasi illud: et depone manum tuam uice una, et stringe eam donec incidas arteriam, et peruenias usque ad os.	When treating hemicrania, with what we said from the previous treatment, and what we said in the divisions of diseases, and if the treatment does not help, and you see from the disease that what we said about the first cautery with medicine, or with cautery with fire, is not sufficient, then it is necessary to heat the knife-like cautery until it is whitened after marking the site of pain with a line, whose length is half a finger, or about that; and place your hand in turn, and press it until you cut the artery and reach the bone.
Verumtamen necesse est tibi, ut caueas a continuatione mandibulae, quae mouetur apud masticationem, ne aduratur latus, aut neruus qui mouet ipsam, unde accidat spasmus.	However, it is necessary for you to beware of the continuation of the jaw, which moves during mastication, lest the side or nerve that moves it be burned, from which spasm may occur.
Et esto super custotiam, et cautelam de fluxu sanguinis arteriae, quae abscisa est.	And be on guard, and careful of the flow of blood from the artery that has been cut.
In abscisione enim eius est timor, et praecipue ei qui ignorat illud quod facit, et non est studiosus, nec expertus: et dimittit operationem cum eo in primis.	For in its cutting there is fear, and especially for him who is ignorant of what he does, and is not studious nor experienced, and abandons the operation with that in the first place.
Et ego ueniam cum rememoratione regiminis fluxus sanguinis accidentis ex arteria secundum modum suum, et in loco suo huius libri.	And I will come with a reminder of the regimen of the blood flow that occurs from the artery according to its manner, and in the place of this book.
Quod si uides ex aegritudine, quod non sufficit ei hoc Cauterium, et uides corpus infirmi tolerans cauterium in medio capitis, sicut narrauimus, cura uulnus, donec sanetur.	If you see from the illness that this cautery is not sufficient for him, and you see the body of the infirm tolerating the cautery in the middle of the head, as we have narrated, treat the wound until it is healed.
Et si uis, administra Cauterium, quod diximus in capitulo extractionis arteriae cum Cauterio habente duos cultellos.	And if you wish, administer the cautery, which we stated in the chapter on the extraction of the artery with a cautery having two knives.
Est enim cauterizatio melior hac et magis conferens.	For cauterization is better than this and more beneficial.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in dolore Aurium.	Concerning the manner of cauterization in earache.
Caput VI.	Chapter VI.
Quando accidit in Aure dolor a frigore, et curatur cum solutiuis, et reliqua curatione quam diximus in diuisione, et non remouetur dolor, tunc igni Cauterium: et est illud quod nominatur Punctum, cuius forma est haec.	When earache arises from cold, and is treated with remedies, and with the other treatment which we mentioned in the division, and the pain is not removed, then cauterize with fire: and that is what is called the Point, whose shape is this.
Deinde puncta cum eo post eius ignitionem in circumitu auris totius, sicut reuoluitur: aut in circumitu utriusque, si simul dolor est in utrisque.	Then apply the points, after its ignition, in a circuit around the entire ear, as it revolves; or in a circuit around each, if the pain is in both at the same time.
Et elonga te cum Cauterio a radice auris parumper, postquam signaueris loca cum encaustro: et sit cauterii quantitas decem punctorum in omni aure, et quasi illa.	And move the cautery slightly away from the root of the ear, after marking the places with ink; and let the quantity of cautery be ten points in each ear, and approximately like that.
Deinde cura loca, donec sanentur.	Then treat the places until they are healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Tortura.	Concerning the method of cauterization in Torture.
Caput VII.	Chapter VII.
Tortura quae curatur cum cauterizatione, non est nisi ex speciebus, quae accidunt ex phlegmate, secundum quod diximus in diuisionibus aegritudinum.	The torture which is treated with cauterization is only from the species that arise from phlegm, according to what we said in the divisions of diseases.
Et deuita cauterizationem speciei, quae accidit ex exiccatione, et spasmo nerui.	And avoid cauterization of the species that arises from dryness and nerve spasm.
Quando curas hanc speciem torturae cum hyeris, et caputpurgiis, et gargarismis, et non confert curatio tua, tunc oportet ut cauterizes infirmum tribus Cauteriis: uno apud radicem auris, et secundo parum inferius a timpore suo, et tertio apud coniunctionem duorum labiorum.	When you treat this species of torture with emetics, and purges, and gargles, and your treatment is not effective, then you must cauterize the afflicted person with three cauteries: one near the root of the ear, and a second slightly lower from its time, and a third at the junction of the two lips.
Et pone Cauterium tuum ex contrario partis infirmae.	And place your cautery on the opposite side of the afflicted part.
Quoniam mollificatio non accidit, nisi in parte quae apparet sana.	Because softening does not occur, unless in the part that appears healthy.
Et forma cauterizationis est, ut cauterizes ipsum Cauterio in directo extremitatis auris superioris sub cornu capitis parum: et alio in timpore: cuius longitudo sit secundum longitudinem pollicis.	And the form of cauterization is that you cauterize it with a cautery directly at the extremity of the upper ear below the horn of the head slightly; and another at the temple; whose length should be according to the length of the thumb.
Et depone manum tuam cum cauterio, donec comburatur quantitas medietatis spissitudinis cutis.	And hold your hand with the cautery until a quantity equal to half the thickness of the skin is burned.
Et haec est forma Cauterii, et est species ex cultellari, cuius forma praemissa est: uerumtamen non est subtilior ea parum, sicut uides: et oportet ut sit cultellus in eo superfluae grossitudinis parum.	And this is the form of the cautery, and it is a kind from the surgical knife, whose form is as described; however, it is not much finer than that, as you see; and it should be a knife with a little superfluous thickness.
Deinde cura loca, cum eo quod praecessit: donec sanetur.	Then treat the places, with what preceded, until they are healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Apoplexia antiqua.	Concerning the method of cauterization in ancient apoplexy.
Caput VIII.	Chapter VIII.
QUando antiquatur Apoplexia, et curas eam cum eo quod diximus, et non confert medicatio tua, et infirmus non habet febrem, tunc cauteriza eum quatuor cauteriis super omne cornu capitis sui, et cauterio in medio capitis, sicut diximus, et cauterio in occipitio capitis, secundum quod praecessit: et modus cauterii sit secundum quod praecessit.	When apoplexy has become chronic, and you have treated it with what we have said, and your treatment is not helping, and the sick person does not have a fever, then cauterize him with four cauteries over each horn of his head, and with a cautery in the middle of the head, as we have said, and with a cautery on the back of the head, according to what went before; and the method of cautery should be according to what preceded.
Etiam cauterizatur cum Cauterio super os stomachi: et est magis ultimum.	Also, cauterize with a cautery on the mouth of the stomach; and this is more of a last resort.
Deinde curetur, cum eo quod praecessit.	Then, let it be treated with what went before.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Obliuione.	Concerning the method of cauterization in cases of oblivion.
Caput IX.	Chapter IX.
Oportet ut in potu dentur in primis infirmo hyerae magnae, et pillulae mundificantes cerebrum.	It is necessary that large doses of hyerae and pills that purify the brain be given to the sick person first in the drink.
Deinde rade caput infirmi totum, et pone super occipitium eius emplastrum de synapi descriptum in tractatu emplastrorum: et pone ipsum aliquotiens.	Then shave the entire head of the sick person, and place on their occiput a plaster of synapis as described in the treatise on plasters: and apply it several times.
Ipsum namque est modus Cauterii: et fac illud secundum ordinem eundem, quem dixi illic.	For this is indeed the method of cautery; and do it according to the same order as I have said there.
Si ergo sanatur per illud, bonum est.	If therefore it cures by it, it is good.
Si non: tunc fac ei cauteria tria in posteriori parte capitis sui, quae sint descendentia a superiori parte capitis usque ad inferiorem partem oculi: et pone inter omne cauterium grossitudinem digiti.	If not: then make three cauteries on the back part of his head, which descend from the upper part of the head to the lower part of the eye: and place the thickness of a finger between each cautery.
Deinde cura Cauterium, cum eo quod praecessit.	Then treat the cautery with what preceded it.
Si autem uis additionem, et infirmus est tolerans illud: tunc fac ei Cauterium in medio.	If however you wish an addition, and the sick person is able to tolerate it, then make a cautery in the middle.
Quod si uis additionem: tunc cauteriza ipsum super duo cornua.	If you wish an addition, then cauterize him above the two horns.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur: sitque Cauterium oliuare secundum formam, quae praemissa est.	Then treat him until he is healed: and let the cautery be olive-shaped, according to the form that was previously stated.

Deinde rade caput infirmi: postea cauteriza ipsum cauterio in medio capitis, et cauterio super omne cornu capitis, et cauterio super posterius ipsius, et tribus super spondiles colli.	Then shave the head of the sick person; afterwards cauterize it with a cautery in the middle of the head, and with a cautery on each horn of the head, and with a cautery on its back, and with three on the vertebrae of the neck.
Si autem indiges in aegritudine mollificatione corporis pluribus illis, et infirmus est tolerans, et aegritudo est fortis: tunc cauteriza ipsum quatuor cauteriis super spondiles dorsi, et ultima cum cauterio, donec comburatur ex cute plurimum eius, et eleua manum tuam.	If however the sickness requires the softening of the body with more than those [previously mentioned], and the sick person is tolerant, and the illness is strong: then cauterize him with four cauteries on the vertebrae of the back, and lastly with a cautery, until most of his skin is burned, and raise your hand.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur: et sic cauterium Oliuare.	Then care for him until he is healed: and thus the cautery of Olives.

Oportet ergo ut mundifices cerebrum eius in primis cum hyeris, et cum reliqua curatione quam diximus in diuisione: quando infirmus est magnus, aut est tolerans in accaeptione medicinarum.	Therefore, it is necessary that you first cleanse his brain with leeches, and with the other treatment that we have mentioned in the division, when the sick person is strong, or is tolerant in accepting medicines.
Si autem est puer, qui non tolerat medicinas, tunc administratur gargarisma, et masticationes mundificantes cerebrum, ante illud diebus multis cum bonificatione ciborum.	However, if it is a child who does not tolerate medicines, then a gargle and brain-cleansing mastications are administered, beforehand for many days, along with the improvement of foods.
Deinde rade caput eius, postea cauteriza ipsum Cauterio uno in medio capitis, secundum quod praecessit in modo: et cauterio alio in occipitio eius, et super omne cornu capitis sui cauterio.	Then shave his head, afterwards cauterize him with one cautery in the middle of the head, according to what has been mentioned before in the method, and with another cautery on his occiput, and with a cautery on every horn of his head.

Et si caussa melancholiae est superfluitas decliuis ad melancholiam, et est corpus infirmi humectum, tunc da ei in potu quod mundificet cerebrum eius, secundum quod praecessit in diuisione: deinde rade caput infirmi, et fac postea tortellam decenter factam ex lino, sicut circulum.	And if the cause of melancholy is an excess of inclination to melancholy, and the patient's body is moist, then give him a drink that will cleanse his brain, according to what preceded in the division; then shave the patient's head, and afterward make a properly made roll of linen, like a circle.
Deinde pone ipsam in medio capitis: et infirmus sedens quadratus teneatur ab omni parte.	Then place it in the middle of the head; and the patient, seated upright, is to be held firm on all sides.
Deinde praesenta linimentum.	Then apply the liniment.
Et est dignius ex butyro ouium antiquo.	And it is better made from old sheep's butter.

Deinde euacua ipsum in medio capitis eius in circulo, et dimitte ipsum donec infrigidetur.	Then apply it in a circle in the middle of his head, and leave it until it cools.
Fac illud infirmo omni hebdomada semel, cum reliquo regimine eius bono, donec sanetur.	Do this to the sick person once a week, with the rest of his good regimen, until he is healed.

When you are shown the beginning of water in the eye through the signs I have described in the division, then begin to give the weak one something that will cleanse his head.
Et custodi ipsum ab omnibus humiditatibus, et fac eum sedere in balneo, in ieiunio diebus aliquot.	And keep him away from all moisture, and make him sit in a bath, fasting for several days.
Deinde praecipe ei, ut radat caput suum, et cauteriza ipsum in medio capitis sui.	Then command him to shave his head, and cauterize him in the middle of his head.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum super duo timpora duobus cauteriis, si est incaeptio descensus aquae in duobus oculis simul: aut ex latere uno, si est incaeptio aquae in oculo uno: et abscinde cum cauterio omnes uenas et arterias quae sunt sub cute: et sint cauteria in ea longa in latitudine timporum: et caue a fluxu sanguinis.	Then cauterize him above the two temples with two cauteries, if the descent of water has begun in both eyes simultaneously; or on one side, if the beginning of the water is in one eye; and cut with the cautery all the veins and arteries that are beneath the skin; and let the cauteries be long in width to the temples; and beware of the flow of blood.
Quod si uides aliquid ex eo, tunc abscinde eum statim cum quacumque medicina est possibile: et ego ueniam cum sapientia, quae est in extractione arteriarum, et abscisione earum, et cautela a fluxu sanguinis.	If you see something from it, then cut it out immediately with whatever medicine is possible; and I will come with the knowledge that is in the extraction of arteries, and the cutting of them, and the caution from the flow of blood.

Quando lachrymae oculorum sunt antiquae, assiduae: et sunt super uenas, et arterias quae sunt in manifesto capitis exterius, uerificatur quod illud est ex superfluitatibus frigidis, phlegmaticis: tunc cauteriza cauterio eodem quod narraui in incaeptione aquae descendentis, cauterio in medio capitis, et duobus cauteriis super duo timpora, et duobus cauteriis in ceruice sub duobus ossibus.	When the tears of the eyes are chronic, persistent; and they are above the veins and arteries which are in the visible exterior of the head, it is verified that it is from cold, phlegmatic superfluities; then cauterize with the same cautery that I have described at the beginning of descending water, a cautery in the middle of the head, and two cauteries above the two temples, and two cauteries in the neck beneath the two bones.
Et si indiges additione, tunc cauteriza ipsum in omni latere caute oculi, super extremitatem supercilii cum cauterio paruo.	And if it needs further treatment, then cauterize it on every side of the eye carefully, above the extremity of the eyebrow with a small cautery.

Quando mollificatur Palpebra oculi ab aegritudine, aut humiditate: tunc cauteriza Palpebram cauterio uno, cum hoc cauterio lunari.	When the eyelid of the eye is softened by illness or moisture, then cauterize the eyelid with a single cautery, with this lunar cautery.
Et si uis, cauteriza ipsum supra duo supercilia parum duobus cauteriis in omni parte: et elongentur a duobus timporibus: et sit longitudo omnis cauterii, secundum longitudines supercilii: et non ultimes manum tuam cum cauterio, imo secundum quantitatem quod aduritur tertia palpebrae.	And if you wish, cauterize it above the two eyebrows slightly with two cauteries on every side; and let them be distant from the two temples; and let the length of each cautery be according to the length of the eyebrow; and do not bring your hand with the cautery to the end, but according to the amount that the third eyelid is burnt.
Et haec est forma cauterii secundum hunc modum cauterii lunaris.	And this is the form of the cautery according to this method of lunar cautery.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Palpebram cum pili inuersantur pungentes oculum.	Concerning the method of cauterizing the eyelid when the hairs are turned inward, irritating the eye.
Caput XVII.	Chapter XVII.
Cauterium in eo est secundum duos modos: aut cauterium cum igne: aut cauterium cum medicina comburente.	The cautery in it is according to two methods: either cautery with fire, or cautery with a burning medicine.
In cauterio autem cum igne, praecipe infirmo ante illud, ut dimittat pilos suos, si est ex illis qui mundant eos, donec prolongentur et aequentur.	In cautery with fire, first advise the patient to remove his hairs, if he is one who cleans them, until they are extended and even.
Si autem pungunt eum apud ortum suum: tunc constringe oculos eius cum uitta, ut non moueantur, donec nascantur.	If, however, they irritate him at their origin, then bind his eyes with a bandage so that they do not move, until they grow out.
Cum ergo nascuntur et aequantur, tunc pone caput infirmi in sinu tuo: deinde signa super Palpebram oculorum eius cum encaustro, signo quod sit secundum figuram folii myrti: et sit principium signi prope pilos.	When therefore they grow out and are even, then place the patient's head in your bosom; then mark on the eyelid of his eyes with encaustic, a mark that is according to the shape of a myrtle leaf; and let the beginning of the mark be near the hairs.
Deinde pone cotum imbibitum in albumine oui: aut in mucilagine psilii super oculum.	Then place a cloth soaked in egg white, or in psyllium mucilage, on the eye.
Deinde igni cauterium, cuius forma est haec.	Then apply the cautery, whose shape is this.
Deinde cauteriza super figuram, quam signasti paulatim in uicibus multis, donec comburatur superficies cutis, quae est sicut figura folii myrti, totam apparentem proprie.	Then cauterize over the figure which you marked, gradually in many stages, until the skin surface, which is like the shape of a myrtle leaf, is entirely burned away.
Et signum sanitatis operis tui est: ut si uideas Palpebram oculi iam contrahi, et pilos eleuari apud puncturam oculi.	And the sign of the success of your work is, that if you see the eyelid already contracting, and the hairs rising near the puncture of the eye.
Eleua ergo manum tuam tunc: et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus.	Therefore raise your hand then, and leave it for three days.
Deinde pone super ipsum Cotum cum butyro, donec eradicetur eschara.	Then place on it a cloth with butter, until the eschar is removed.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with ointment until it heals.
Quod si redeat aliquod ex pilis post horam, et mollificetur palpebra: tunc itera Cauterium super illum locum, sicut fecisti in primis.	If any hair returns after an hour, and the eyelid softens, then again cauterize that place, as you did at first.
Si autem pili sunt in inferiori: tunc cauteriza ipsam, donec eleuetur ad locum suum naturalem: et aequetur ut non pungant pili oculum.	If however the hairs are in the lower part, then cauterize it until it rises to its natural place and is even so that the hairs do not prick the eye.
¶ De modo cauterizandi cum medicina comburente in eodem casu.	Concerning the method of cauterizing with a burning medicine in the same case.
Caput XVIII.	Chapter XVIII.
Est ut praecipias infirmo, ut dimittat pilos, donec prolongentur et aequentur.	It is to instruct the sick person to let the hairs fall until they lengthen and become even.
Fac ex charta de panno formam folii myrti.	Make a form of a myrtle leaf from paper and cloth.
Deinde accipe ex sapone cognito, et ex calce non imbibita ex unoquoque pondus uncia I aut quasi illud: deinde tere ea simul contritione bona, et fac illud cum festinatione, ut non infrigidetur.	Then take from known soap and from unsoaked lime, one ounce of each, or nearly so; then grind them together thoroughly, and make it quickly so that it does not grow cold.
Deinde ex pande ex eo super chartam quam fecisti sicut formam folii myrti, et pone ipsum super palpebram oculi unius, aut duorum.	Then spread some of this over the paper that you made in the form of a myrtle leaf, and place it over the eyelid of one or two eyes.
Et pone sub oculo cotum imbibitum in albumine oui: et caput infirmi sit in sinu tuo.	And place under the eye a cloth soaked in egg white; and let the sick person's head be in your bosom.
Et pone digitum tuum indicem super medicinam, et preme ipsum parumper.	And place your index finger on the medicine, and press it for a little while.
Et tu moueas ipsum quotiens sentit infirmus mordicationem medicinae: quoniam inuenit eius mordicatio sicut ignis.	And you should move it whenever the sick person feels the medicine's biting, because its biting is found to be like fire.
Dum ergo perseuerat hoc quod ipse inuenit mordicatio, tunc dimitte medicinam, et moue ipsam cum digito tuo.	While, therefore, that which he finds biting persists, then remove the medicine, and move it with your finger.
Cum ergo quiescit mordicatio, tunc remoue medicinam, et ablue oculum cum aqua.	When therefore the biting subsides, then remove the medicine, and wash the eye with water.
Et considera tunc, si uides palpebram eleuari, sicut eleuatur apud contractionem cum igne, aut cum incisione, est bene: et si non, tunc itera super ipsam ex medicina super locum, in quo non imprimit medicina, et non denigrat, donec aequetur operatio tua, et contrahatur oculus.	And then consider, if you see the eyelid being raised, as it is raised with cauterization or incision, it is good. And if not, then repeat the medicine on the area where the medicine doesn't take hold, and doesn't blacken, until your operation is equalized, and the eye is contracted.
Deinde pone super ipsum Cotum cum butyro, donec eradicetur cutis adustionis.	Then place upon it Cotum with butter, until the skin of the burn is eradicated.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento diaphinicon, aut alio, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with diaphinicon ointment, or another, until it is healed.
Et necesse est tibi apud operationem, ut custodias ultima custodia, ne in oculum cadat aliquid ex medicina.	And it is necessary for you in the operation, that you guard the last safeguard, so that nothing of the medicine falls into the eye.
Quod si mollificatur palpebra post dies, et pugnat ex capillis aliquid in oculo, tunc itera medicinam super illum locum, qui mollificatur ex palpebra proprie, sicut fecisti in primis.	If the eyelid softens after days, and something from the hairs fights in the eye, then repeat the medicine on that place which softens from the eyelid itself, as you did at first.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then treat it until it is healed.
Et haec est forma folii myrti.	And this is the form of the myrtle leaf.
Et scias, quod oculi hominum diuersificantur in magnitudine, et paruitate.	And know that the eyes of men differ in size and smallness.
Ergo secundum illud sit consideratio tua: et non occultatur uia rectitudinis illi, cui est studium de hac arte.	Therefore, according to that, let your consideration be: and the path of rectitude is not hidden from him who studies this art.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Fistula lachrymali.	Concerning the method of cauterizing in a tear duct fistula.
Caput XIX.	Chapter XIX.
Quando curas Fistulam, cum eo quod diximus in diuisionibus aegritudinum, et non confert curatio tua: tunc, oportet ut cauterizes ipsam secundum hunc modum.	When you treat a fistula, in accordance with what we have said in the divisions of illnesses, and if your treatment is not helping, then it is necessary that you cauterize it according to this method.
Praecipe infirmo, ut ponat caput suum in sinu tuo, et teneat caput eius minister inter manus suas taliter, ut non moueatur, neque agitetur cum capite suo.	Command the sick person to place his head in your lap, and let the attendant hold his head between his hands in such a way that it does not move or shake with his head.
Deinde pone Cotum infusum in albugine oui, aut in mucilagine psilii super oculum eius: deinde igni Cauterium, cuius forma est haec.	Then place a heated poultice of egg white, or in psyllium mucilage, over his eye; then apply the cautery, whose shape is this.
Sit concauum, sicut forma cannae pennae uulturis ab extremitate una, cum qua fit Cauterium: et si uis sit penetrans usque ad extremitatem aliam, et si uis sit sursum sic tenta.	Let it be concave, like the shape of a vulture's wing feather from one end, with which the cautery is made; and if you wish it to penetrate to the other end, and if you wish it to be held upward in that manner.
Verumtamen hoc concauum est melius ad opus tuum.	However, this concave shape is better for your work.
Deinde exprime fistulam, si est aperta, et extrahe ex ea saniem, et exicca ipsam: et si non est aperta, tunc aperi eam, et extrahe pus eius.	Then express the fistula, if it is open, and extract the pus from it and dry it; and if it is not open, then open it and extract its pus.
Deinde pone tunc super eam Cauterium, quod fit ignitum ualde.	Then place the cautery, which is made very hot, upon it.
Et tene cum eo manum tuam parumper apud Cauterium ab oculo, ad partem nasi, ut non erret manus tua, aut inquietetur infirmus: et ponas Cauterium in adipe oculi, et corrumpas ipsum.	And hold your hand with the cautery for a short while near the cautery, from the eye to the part of the nose, so that your hand does not stray or the sick person is not disturbed; and you shall place the cautery on the fat of the eye and corrupt it.
Si ergo peruenis in principio Cauterii tui usque ad os, erit bene.	If therefore you arrive at the beginning of your cautery up to the opening, it will be well.
Et si non: tunc itera Cauterium semel, aut bis, si indiges illo: et dimitte illud tribus diebus.	And if not, then repeat the cautery once or twice, if you need it; and leave it for three days.
Deinde pone Cotum cum butyro, et cura ipsum cum unguento exiccatiuo, donec sanetur.	Then place a cloth with butter, and treat it with a drying ointment, until it is healed.
Quod si praeterierint ei quadraginta dies, et non sanatur: tunc pone super ipsum medicinam acutam corrosiuam, donec detegatur os: et rade ipsum secundum quod uenit in capitulo suo.	If forty days pass and it is not healed, then place upon it a sharp corrosive medicine, until the opening is exposed; and scrape it according to what is in its chapter.
Et est modus alius Cauterii fistulae, quem quidam primi dixerunt.	And there is another method of cauterizing fistulas, which some of the first ones said.
Intende ad locum fistulae, et finde ipsum: deinde pone in ipsam fissuram camahan subtile, id est, Cannulam subtilem, cuius forma haec est.	Direct yourself to the place of the fistula, and split it open; then put into the fissure a fine camahan, that is, a thin cannula, whose form is this.
Et funde in ipsum quantitatem drachmae ex plumbo liquefacto, et tene manum tuam cum Canna retentione bona, et non moueatur infirmus omnino, ut non currat, uel perueniat plumbum liquefactum ad oculum eius.	And pour into it a drachma's worth of molten lead, and hold your hand with a good retaining cannula, and let the infirm person not move at all, so that the molten lead does not run, or reach his eye.
Et oportet ut ponas super oculum infirmi cotum infusum in albumine oui, aut in aqua.	And it is necessary that you place on the eye of the infirm a poultice infused in egg white, or in water.
Plumbum enim comburit locum fistulae, et sanat ipsam sanatione mirabili.	For lead burns the place of the fistula, and heals it with a wonderful cure.
Quod si sanatur fistula, cum eo quod diximus ex Cauterio, et curatione, est bonum.	If the fistula is healed with what we have said about cautery and treatment, it is good.
Et si non, tunc necesse est administrare foramen nasi, et reducere fistulam ad cursum nasi, secundum quod ueniet in loco suo sibi proprio.	And if not, then it is necessary to administer a nasal opening, and to reduce the fistula to the course of the nose, according to where it will come to its proper place.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in fissuris Labiorum.	Concerning the method of cauterizing in lip fissures.
Caput XX.	Chapter XX.
Multotiens accidunt in Labio fissurae, quae nominantur Pili, et praecipue in labiis puerorum.	Often fissures occur in the lip, which are called "pili," and especially in the lips of children.
Cum ergo tu curas has fissuras, cum eo quod diximus in diuisione aegritudinum, et non confert curatio, tunc igni cauterium paruum cultellare, secundum hanc formam.	Therefore, when you treat these fissures, as we have said in the division of diseases, and if the treatment does not help, then a small knife cauterium, according to this form, should be used.
Et sit concauitas eius secundum subtilitatem cultelli.	And its concavity should be according to the sharpness of the knife.
Deinde pone ipsum ignitum festinanter in ipsis fissuris, donec perueniat cauterium ad profundum fissurarum.	Then quickly place it, heated, onto the fissures themselves, until the cauterium reaches the depth of the fissures.
Deinde cura ipsum cum caeroto, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with a cautery, until it is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in fistula Oris.	Concerning the method of cauterization in an oral fistula.
Caput XXI.	Chapter XXI.
Quando accidit apostema in radice gingiuae, aut in palato, aut in radicibus dentium: deinde facit pus, et rumpitur: postea antiquatur, et currit pus, et fit fistula: deinde curas ipsam, et non confert in ea curatio, tunc oportet ut ignias cauterium secundum quantitatem, quod capiat in fistula.	When an abscess occurs at the root of the gum, or on the palate, or at the roots of the teeth, then it produces pus and bursts; afterwards, it becomes chronic and pus flows, and a fistula forms; then, if treatment does not help, it is necessary to cauterize the fistula with a cautery according to its size.
Deinde intromitte ipsum ignitum in foramine fistulae, et tene manum tuam, donec perueniat ferrum ignitum ad profundum eius, et ultimum eius: fac illud semel, aut duabus uicibus.	Then introduce the heated iron into the opening of the fistula, and hold your hand until the heated iron reaches its depth and its end; do this once, or twice.
Deinde cura ipsum post illud, cum eo quod diximus de curatione usquequo curetur.	Then treat it afterwards, with what we said about treatment until it is healed.
Si ergo abscinditur sanies, et sanatur, erit bonum.	If therefore the pus is discharged and it heals, it will be good.
Et si non, tunc necesse est detegere locum, et auferre os corrupum secundum quod ueniet in capite suo.	And if not, then it is necessary to expose the place and remove the diseased bone according to what appears on its head.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Gingiuis, et Dentibus mollificatis.	Concerning the method of cauterization in softened gums and teeth.
Caput XXII.	Chapter XXII.
Quando mollificatur gingiua propter humiditates, et mouentur dentes, et curas eam cum medicinis, et non confert: tunc pone caput infirmi in sinu tuo.	When the gum softens because of moisture, and the teeth move, and you treat it with medicines, and it does not help: then place the patient's head in your lap.
Deinde igni cauterium, cuius forma ueniet post haec, ita ut ponas Cannulam super dentem: et intromitte in ea Cauterium ignitum festinanter: et tene manum tuam parumper, donec sentiat infirmus calorem ignis iam peruenisse ad radicem dentis.	Then, with fire, a cautery, whose form will come after this, so that you place the Cannula over the tooth; and quickly insert the heated Cautery into it; and hold your hand for a short while, until the patient feels the heat of the fire already having reached the root of the tooth.
Et eleua manum tuam: deinde itera Cauterium aliquotiens, secundum quod uis.	And lift your hand; then repeat the cautery several times, as you wish.
Deinde impleat infirmus os suum aqua salis, et teneat ipsam hora una: et exspuat ipsam.	Then let the patient fill their mouth with salt water, and hold it for one hour; and let them spit it out.
Dens enim motus firmatur, et gingiua mollificata stringitur, et siccatur humiditas corrupta.	For the moved tooth is strengthened, and the softened gum is tightened, and the corrupt moisture is dried.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in dolore Dentium.	Concerning the method of cauterizing in toothache.
Caput XXIII.	Chapter XXIII.
Quando dolor dentis est propter frigiditatem, aut in ipso est frigus, aut uermis, et non confert curatio cum medicinis: tunc Cauterium in ipso est secundum duos modos: aut Cauterium cum butyro: aut cauterium cum igne.	When toothache is due to cold, or there is cold or a worm in it, and treatment with medicines is of no avail, then the cautery is applied in two ways: either cautery with butter, or cautery with fire.
Cauterium autem eius cum butyro est, ut accipias butyrum uaccinum, et bullias ipsum in cochleari ferreo, aut in uenera.	However, the cautery with butter is such that you take cow's butter and boil it in an iron spoon, or in a pot.
Deinde accipe cotum, et inuolue ipsum super extremitatem tentae.	Then take a cloth, and wrap it around the end of the probe.
Deinde submerge ipsum in butyro bullito: et pone ipsum super dentem dolorosum festinanter, et tene ipsum donec infrigidet: deinde itera ipsum aliquotiens, donec perueniat uirtus ignis ad radicem dentis.	Then immerse it in the boiled butter, and quickly place it on the painful tooth, and hold it until it cools; then repeat this several times, until the heat's effect reaches the root of the tooth.
Et si uis, submerge lanam, aut cotum in butyro frigido, et pone ipsum super dentem dolentem: et pone super ipsum ferrum ignitum, donec perueniat ignis ad profundum concauitatis dentis.	And if you wish, immerse wool, or a cloth in cold butter, and place it on the aching tooth; and place heated iron on top of it, until the fire reaches the deep cavity of the tooth.
Cauterizatio autem eius cum igne est, ut intendas ad cannulam aeris, aut cannulam ferri.	Its cauterization with fire is to apply a brass or iron tube.
Et sit in corpore eius quiddam grossitudinis, ut non perueniat acuitas ignis ad os infirmi.	And let there be something of its thickness, so that the sharpness of the fire does not reach the sick person's bone.
Deinde igni Cauterium, cuius forma ueniet: et pone ipsum super illum dentem: et tene manum tuam, donec infrigidetur Cauterium.	Then apply a cautery, whose shape will be appropriate, and place it on that tooth, and hold your hand until the cautery cools.
Fac illud aliquotiens, nam dolor remouebitur, aut in illo eodem die, aut die alio.	Do it several times, for the pain will be removed, either on that same day, or on another day.
Et oportet in impressione illius Cauterii, ut impleat infirmus os suum buyro bono, et teneat ipsum hora una: deinde exspuat ipsum.	And it is necessary, in the application of that cautery, that the sick person fill his mouth with good butter, and hold it for one hour; then he should spit it out.
Et haec est forma Cauterii.	And this is the shape of the cautery.
Cauteriza cum quacumque extremitate uis secundum quod est possibile: et haec est forma Cannulae.	Cauterize with whichever extremity you can, according to what is possible; and this is the shape of the cannula.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Strophulis.	Concerning the method of cauterizing in the Strophules.
Caput XXIIII.	Chapter Twenty-Four.
Quando Strophulae sunt a phlegmate, et ab humiditatibus frigidis, et non sunt obedientes digestioni per mecicinas, et uis digestionem earum uelociter: tunc igni Cauterium concauum, cuius forma est haec.	When Strophules are from phlegm and from cold humours, and are not obedient to digestion by medicines, and you wish their digestion swiftly, then use a concave Cautery with this shape.
Habens duas extremitates apertas, ut egrediatur fumus apud Cauterium ab extremitate altera: et pone ipsum ignitum super ipsum apostema semel, et secundo, si indiges illo, donec perueniat ad profundum apostematis.	Having two open extremities, so that smoke may escape from the cautery from one extremity; and place it, ignited, upon the abscess once, and a second time if necessary, until it reaches the depth of the abscess.
Quod si apostema est paruum: tunc pone Cauterium secundum quantitatem apostematis.	If the abscess is small, then place the cautery according to the size of the abscess.
Deinde dimitte ipsum tribus diebus, et pone super ipsum cotum infusum in butyro, donec remoueatur quod combussit ignis.	Then leave it for three days, and place upon it a poultice infused in butter, until that which the fire has burned away is removed.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento dentis, donec sanetur forma cannulae.	Then treat it with tooth ointment until the shape of the cannula is healed.

Caput XXV.	Chapter XXV.
Quando uincunt humiditates super cannale pulmonis, et praecipue quando illud est cum frigiditate complexionis, tunc oportet ut euacuetur infirmus in primis cum medicinis solutiuis.	When humidities overcome the lung passage, and especially when it is with a cold constitution, then it is necessary that the sick person be evacuated in the first place with dissolving medicines.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum in nocrati apud radicem gutturis in loce depresso: et caue, ne peruenias cum Cauterio ad guttur, neque in cute, nisi quiddam eius.	Then cauterize it in the nocrati near the root of the throat in the depressed place: and beware, lest you reach with the cautery to the throat, nor into the skin, except somewhat of it.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum cauterio alio apud iuncturam colli in ultimo spondili eius ultimando: et sit Cauterium clauile secundum modum, qui praecessit.	Then cauterize it with another cautery at the junction of the neck at the last of its vertebrae, and let the cautery be narrow according to the manner which preceded.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod praecessit, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with what preceded, until it is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in aegritudinibus Pulmonis, et Tussi.	Concerning the method of cauterizing in illnesses of the Lungs and Cough.
Caput XXVI.	Chapter XXVI.
Quando Tussis et aegritudo Pulmonis sunt ab humiditatibus frigidis, et infirmus non habet febrem, neque phthisim, et aegritudo antiqua: tunc cauteriza ipsum duobus cauteriis supra furculam in locis depressis, lenibus, uacuis.	When Cough and illness of the Lungs are from cold humors, and the sick person does not have a fever, nor consumption, and the illness is long-standing, then cauterize him with two cauteries above the fork in the low, smooth, empty places.
Et cauterio alio in medio pectoris inter duas mammillas: et sit cauterium cannulae secundum formam quae praecessit.	And with another cautery in the middle of the chest between the two nipples: and let the cautery be of the tube shape as preceded.
Et si uis sit cauterizatio tua punctando cum cauterio, quod nominatur Punctum, cuius forma praecessit in punctatione doloris aurium: et sint puncta ex triginta punctis usque quasi ad alia.	And if your wish is to cauterize by puncturing with the cautery, called the Point, whose shape preceded in the puncturing of ear pain: and let the punctures be from thirty punctures up to nearly another.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod praecessit, donec sanetur.	Then treat him with what preceded, until he is healed.
Et iam sit cauterium habens tres ramos: secundum hanc formam.	And now let the cautery have three branches: according to this shape.
Quare alleuiatur cum eo cauterizatio, quando tu facis cum eo uice una tria Cauteria.	Therefore, cauterization will be alleviated when you use three cauteries at once.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Titillico, in dislocatione Humeri.	On the method of cauterization in the Titillico, in the dislocation of the Humerus.
Caput XXVII.	Chapter XXVII.
Quando dislocatur caput adiutorii caussa humiditatum, et nonfigitur in hora reditus sui a dislocatione sua, donec sit illud ei consuetudo reditionis, deinde dislocatur a paruo motu, qui accidit sicut nos iam testificauimus illud, tunc oportet ut reducas dislocationem in primis.	When the head of the humerus is dislocated due to moisture, and does not settle into its proper place upon returning from the dislocation, until it becomes accustomed to returning, then dislocated by a small movement, which occurs as we have already testified, then you must first reduce the dislocation.
Deinde resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum, aut super latus sanum.	Then the patient is placed on his back, or on his healthy side.
Deinde eleua cutim, quae est in interiori Titillici ad superiora cum digitis manus tuae sinistrae: et si iunctura dislocatur ad interiora.	Then raise the skin that is on the inside of the Titillico towards the top with the fingers of your left hand: and if the joint is dislocated inwards.
Deinde igni Cauterium habens duo uerua.	Then, having a cautery with two prongs.
Cuius forma est haec.	Whose form is this.
Deinde cauteriza cutim, donec penetret eam usque ad latus aliud, et ueniet figura cauterizationis cum quatuor cauteriis.	Then cauterize the skin until it penetrates it to the other side, and the shape of the cauterization will come with four cauteries.
Et quandoque fit cauterizatio cum cauterio habente tria uerua, quare fit figura cauterizationis tunc sex cauteriorum: et sunt uerua secundum subtilitatem tentae.	And sometimes cauterization is done with a cautery having three prongs, wherefore the shape of the cauterization is then six cauteries: and the prongs are according to the thinness of the tent.
Et haec est forma cauterii habentis tria uerua.	And this is the form of a cautery having three prongs.
Et quandoque additur super hunc modum unum, quare sunt cauteria octo.	And sometimes one is added above this manner, wherefore there are eight cauteries.
Deinde pone super cauterium porros contritos cum sale.	Then place on the cautery crushed leeks with salt.
Deinde fac adhaerere infirmum tranquillitati, ut non moueatur membrum tempore aliquo, donec confortetur.	Then cause the weak person to adhere to quietude, so that the limb does not move at any time until it is strengthened.
Et si dislocatio est ad superiora, et raro fit illud, tunc cauteriza ipsum super humerum cauterio clauili, aut cauteriis multis punctando.	And if the dislocation is to the upper parts, and rarely does it happen thus, then cauterize it above the shoulder with a clavicle cautery, or with many cauteries by pricking.
Nam iunctura firmatur, et remouetur humiditas: et sanatur infirmus.	For the joint is strengthened, and moisture is removed: and the weak person is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Stomachum.	Concerning the method of cauterizing the Stomach.
Caput XXVIII.	Chapter XXVIII.
Quando accidunt in Stomacho frigus et humiditates multae, donec extrahant ipsum a complexione sua, et multiplicentur catarri ad ipsum, et assiduas modos curationis, et non confert: tunc oportet ut resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum, et extendat crura sua, et manus suas.	When there are cold and much moisture in the stomach, until they draw it out from its temperament, and phlegm increases within it, and continuous methods of treatment are of no avail: then it is necessary for the sick person to lie on their back, and extend their legs and hands.
Deinde cauteriza cum tribus cauteriis, cauterio sub cochleari pectoris quantitate digiti unius cum cauterio clauili, et duobus cauteriis inferius a duobus lateribus cauterii unius, donec ueniat figura cauteriorum triangulata.	Then cauterize with three cauteries: one cautery beneath the breastbone, the size of a finger, with a narrow cautery, and two cauteries below it on either side of a single cautery, until a triangular figure of cauteries is produced.
Et elonga inter utraque ut non coniungantur, quando facient pus.	And lengthen them between each so that they do not unite, when they will make pus.
Et sit profunditas cauterii quantitas duarum tertiarum grossitudinis cutis.	And the depth of the cautery should be the amount of two-thirds the thickness of the skin.
Et sit figura cauteriorum secundum hanc formam sine additione: et si uis cauteriza cauterio magno in medio stomachi secundum hanc formam: et sit cauterium quo fit hoc cauterium unum secundum figuram circuli secundum hanc formam.	And let the figure of the cauteries be according to this form, without addition. And if you wish to cauterize with a large cautery in the middle of the stomach, according to this form, let the cautery used for this be one, according to the form of a circle.
Et cauterizatur stomachus punctando ei qui terretur ab hoc cauterio: et est, ut signes super stomachum punctum secundum quantitatem, quam uis cum encaustro: deinde cauteriza ipsum cum cauterio puncti: deinde cura ipsum cum curatione, quae praecessit donec sanetur.	And the stomach is cauterized by pricking it for one who is frightened by this cautery. And it is as if you mark a point on the stomach according to the amount you wish with ink. Then cauterize it with a cautery of the point. Then treat it with the treatment that preceded until it is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Epar frigidum.	Concerning the method of cauterizing a cold liver.
Caput XXIX.	Chapter XXIX.
Quando accidit in Epate dolor ex frigiditate et humiditate, aut ex uentositate grossa, donec egrediatur a complexione sua naturali egressione superflua, et curatur infirmus, cum eo quod diximus, et non proficit in illo: tunc oportet ut resupinetur infirmus super ceruicem suam, et signes cum encaustro tria cauteria secundum hanc figuram, et hanc quantitatem eandem super Epar inferius ab hypocundriis, ubi peruenit cubitus hominis: et sit spacium quod est inter omne cauterium secundum grossitudinem digiti: et sit cauterium secundum longitudinem corporis rectum: et non comprimas manum tuam cum cauterio multum.	When pain occurs in the liver due to coldness and moisture, or to thick wind, until it emerges from its natural disposition by an excess expulsion, and the sick person is treated with what we have said, and it does not help him, then it is necessary for the sick person to be placed on their neck, and to mark three cauteries with ink according to this figure and this same amount on the lower liver from the hypochondria, where the man's elbow reaches. And let the space between each cautery be according to the thickness of a finger. And let the cautery be straight according to the length of the body, and do not press your hand with the cautery too much.
Et sit quantitas eius quod aduritur ex spissitudine cutis, quantitas medietatis eius non additum: et sit infirmus stans super pedes suos.	And let the amount that is burned be, from the thickness of the skin, the amount of half of it not added. And let the sick person be standing on their feet.
Si autem non est stans, tunc sit iacens, qui iam extendit crura sua, et eleuauit brachia sua.	If however, he is not standing, then let him lie down, having already extended his legs and raised his arms.
Haec est forma cauterii.	This is the form of the cautery.
Et tibi quidem possibile est, ut cauterizes ista cauteria cum cauterio cultellari, quando tecum est subtilitas et prudentia in arte.	And it is possible for you to cauterize these cauteries with a knife cautery, when you have subtlety and prudence in the art.
Et custodi te, ut non ultime procedas in cauterizatione, et aduratur spissitudo cutis totius, quare aduratur corpus totum, et perueniat ad intestina: quoniam cutis illic est subtilis, scias ergo illud.	And beware that you do not proceed too far in cauterization, and the thickness of the entire skin is burned, therefore the whole body is burned, and it reaches the intestines. For the skin there is thin, therefore know that.

Caput XXX.	Chapter XXX.
Quando accidit exitura, et uis scire, si illud apostema est in carne Epatis, aut in tunica eius: tunc si est in carne Epatis, inuadit infirmum dolor, et grauitas absque acuitate: et si est in tunica Epatis, cum dolore est acuitas uehemens: et uides iam, quia fatigauit medicos eius curatio.	When an exit occurs, and you wish to know if the abscess is in the flesh of the liver, or in its tunic: then if it is in the flesh of the liver, the sick person is afflicted by pain and heaviness without sharpness; and if it is in the tunic of the liver, there is sharp, intense pain; and you see now that the treatment has fatigued his physicians.
Oportet ergo ut resupinet infirmus super ceruicem suam.	Therefore, it is necessary for the sick person to lie on their back.
Deinde figura locum apostematis cum encaustro: deinde ignias cauterium quod assimilatur radio.	Then, mark the location of the abscess with ink; then, apply the cautery, which is likened to a ray.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form.
Et cauteriza cum eo cauterium unum, donec comburatur cutis tota, et perueniat ad siphac, donec egrediatur sanies tota: deinde cura ipsum curatione exiturarum, donec sanetur.	And cauterize with it one cautery, until the entire skin is burned and reaches the suppurating matter, until all the pus comes out; then treat it with the treatment for discharging wounds, until it is healed.
Et non oportet ut hac cauterii specie utatur, nisi cuius studium in arte medicinae prolongatur: et per cuius manus concurrunt aegritudines istae cum experimento aliquotiens: tunc enim audeat super huiusmodi operationem.	And it is not appropriate to use this type of cautery, unless one whose study of the medical art is prolonged, and through whose hands these illnesses have frequently passed with experience, then may dare to undertake such an operation.
At uero dimittere ipsam, apud me est melius.	But truly, to abandon it, is better with me.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Pleuresi.	Concerning the method of cauterizing in Pleuritis.
Caput XXXI.	Chapter XXXI.
Dixerunt antiqui, cauterium cum radicibus aristolochiae ad Pleuresim frigidam secundum hunc modum.	The ancients said that a cautery with aristolochia roots should be used for cold pleurisy in this manner.
Et est, ut recipias ex radicibus aristolochiae siccae longae, radicem unam longiorem, quae ex ea inuenitur, et sit sicut grossitudo digiti.	And it is, that you take from the dry long roots of aristolochia, one root longer than the others found among them, and be like the thickness of a finger.
Deinde submerge eam in oleo: et accende ipsam in igne.	Then immerse it in oil, and ignite it in fire.
Deinde cauteriza cauterio uno in eo quod est inter continuationem furculae cum collo, et duobus cauteriis paruis sub guidezi parum decliuibus ad partem, quae est sub barba.	Then cauterize with one cautery at the point between the fork's extension and the neck, and with two small cauteries in a slightly sloping position towards the area below the beard.
Et duobus cauteriis etiam in eo, quod est inter costam quintam et sextam decliuibus ad posteriora parumper: et cauterio alio in medio pectoris, et alio supra stomachum.	And with two cauteries also in that which is between the fifth and sixth ribs, sloping slightly to the back; and with another cautery in the middle of the chest, and another above the stomach.
Et tribus cauteriis a posterioribus: uno in eo quod est inter duas spatulas: et duobus cauteriis a duobus lateribus pectoris, inferius cauterio quod est inter duas spatulas.	And with three cauteries from the back: one in that which is between the two shoulder blades; and with two cauteries from the two sides of the chest, below the cautery that is between the two shoulder blades.
Et non oportet ut comprimas manum tuam cum cauterio, imo sit in manifesto cutis odorando.	And you should not press your hand with the cautery, rather it should be visible by smelling the skin.
Et iam dixerunt quidam antiqui, quod ex hominibus sunt qui utuntur cauterio ex ferro simili radio: et igniunt, et intus mittunt ipsum in eo quod est inter costas, donec perueniatur cum eo ad ipsum apostema, et egrediatur sanies: sicut diximus in apostemate Epatis.	And some ancient ones have said that there are men who use a cautery made of iron similar to a rod: and they set it alight, and insert it into that which is between the ribs, until they reach the abscess with it, and pus comes out, just as we said in the abscess of the liver.
Sed in hac perforatione cum cauterio est ex timore, quod aut moritur infirmus statim, aut accidit in loco fistula, cui non est sanatio.	But in this perforation with a cautery there is a fear that either the weak man dies immediately, or a fistula occurs in the place, which has no cure.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Splenem Caput XXXII.	Of the method of cauterizing the Spleen, Chapter XXXII.
Quando tu curas aegritudinem splenis, cum eo quod diximus ex curatione in diuisione aegritudinum, et non confert curatio tua, tunc cauterium in ea est secundum tres modos, qui omnes sunt recti.	When you treat the illness of the spleen, with that which we said concerning treatment in the division of illnesses, and your treatment does not help, then the cautery on it is in three ways, all of which are correct.
Quorum unus est, ut facias tria cauteria, aut quatuor lineando secundum longitudinem splenis secundum figuram cauteriorum Epatis, quorum praecessit figura.	One of which is to make three cauteries, or four, by drawing a line along the length of the spleen, according to the shape of the liver cauteries, whose shape preceded.
Et sit inter omne cauterium quantitas grossitudinis digiti, aut plus parum.	And let there be between each cautery a quantity of the thickness of a finger, or more or less.
Et sit modus cauterii, quem diximus in cauterio epatis aequaliter.	And let the method of the cautery be, which we said in the cautery of the liver, equally.
Et non comprimas manum tuam cum cauterio: et sit infirmus resupinus super dorsum suum.	And do not press your hand with the cautery; and let the infirm person be lying supine on his back.
Et modus alius de cauterizatione est: ut ignias cauterium habens duo uerua, quod diximus in capitulo dislocationis humeri: et eleua cutem, quae est in directo splenis, ubi peruenit cubitus infirmi sinister: et sit eleuatio tua qua eleuas cutem secundum latitudinem corporis, ut cadant cauteria secundum longitudinem corporis.	And another method of cauterization is: that you heat the cautery having two prongs, which we said in the chapter on the dislocation of the humerus; and lift the skin, which is directly over the spleen, where the left elbow of the infirm person reaches; and let your lifting of the skin be according to the width of the body, so that the cauteries fall along the length of the body.
Deinde intromitte duo uerua ignita ualde, donec cum eis penetres cutem a parte altera: deinde extrahe cauterium: fiunt ergo cauteria quatuor.	Then insert the two very hot prongs until you penetrate the skin with them on the other side; then withdraw the cautery; therefore four cauteries are made.
Et si uis cauteriza cum cauterio alio habente tria uerua.	And if you wish to cauterize with another cautery having three prongs.
Deinde cura cauterium postquam dimittis ipsum emittere pus diebus multis: est enim magis conferens quamque reliqua quae praecesserunt ex curatione.	Then treat the cautery after you have allowed it to discharge pus for many days; for it is more beneficial than all the rest which preceded it in the cure.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Hydropisi.	Concerning the method of cauterization in dropsy.
Caput XXXIII.	Chapter XXXIII.
Cauterium non cadit in Hydropisi, nisi ascliti proprie.	The cautery does not fall upon dropsy, unless properly applied.
Quando tu curas Hydropicum cum modis curationis, quos diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio, tunc oportet ut cauterizes ipsum quatuor cauteriis in circumitu umbilici, et cauterio uno super stomachum, et cauterio alio super epar, et cauterio super splenem, et cauteriis duobus post dorsum inter spondiles, et uno in directo pectoris, et alio in directo stomachi: et sit quantitas profunditatis cauterii propinqua spissitudini cutis.	When you treat the dropsical patient with the methods of treatment, which we have stated in the division, and the cure does not benefit, then you must cauterize him with four cauteries in a circle around the navel, and with one cautery above the stomach, and with another cautery above the liver, and a cautery above the spleen, and with two cauteries behind the back between the vertebrae, and one directly on the chest, and another directly on the stomach: and let the depth of the cautery be near the thickness of the skin.
Deinde dimitte cauterium apertum, ut emittat pus tempore longo.	Then leave the cautery open, so that it discharges pus for a long time.
Et non euacues infirmum a curatione post cauterium cum eo: quod oportet ut aggregentur ei duae intentiones: et festinabit ad ipsum sanatio cum auxilio Dei.	And do not remove the sick person from treatment after the cautery, because two intentions must be aggregated to him: and healing will hasten to him with the help of God.
Forma uero cauterii cum quo cauterizatur uenter, sit clauilis: secundum quod praecessit forma eius: et illius cum quo cauterizatur dorsum, sit oliuaris secundum quod praecessit eius forma.	The form of the cautery with which the belly is cauterized should be a nail-shaped, as its form preceded; and that with which the back is cauterized, should be olive-shaped, as its form preceded.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Pedes, et Crura.	Concerning the method of cauterizing the Feet and Legs.
Caput XXXIIII.	Chapter Thirty-Four.
Quando apostemantur in Hydropico, et replentur aqua citrina: oportet ut cauterizes super dorsum Pedis in nocrati, quae est inter auricularem et anularem: et eleua manum tuam cum cauterio, et non torqueas ipsum: deinde eleua manum tuam: et non iteres ipsum omnino.	When abscesses develop in a hydropic patient, and they fill with yellow water, you should cauterize on the back of the foot, in the area between the auricular and annular regions; and lift your hand with the cautery, and do not twist it; then lift your hand; and do not repeat it at all.
Resudet enim aqua citrina, et sit cauterium secundum hanc formam.	For the yellow water will drain, and the cautery should be of this form.
Deinde fac super duo crura duo cauteria in omni crure, et fiat cauterium cum extremitate cultellari cauterii: et fiat cauterium secundum longitudinem cruris, unum sub genu, et alterum inferius eo, circiter medium cruris: et super omnem coxam cauteria duo: et dimitte cauterium apertum absque curatione tempore longo: ut resudet ex eo aliquod aquae: deinde cura ipsum cum reliquis quae diximus.	Then make two cauteries on each leg, and let the cautery be made with the blade end of the cautery; and let the cautery be made along the length of the leg, one below the knee, and the other below that, approximately the middle of the leg; and on each thigh, make two cauteries; and leave the cautery open without treatment for a long time, so that some water drains from it; then treat it with the rest of what we have said.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in solutione Ventris.	Concerning the method of cauterization in abdominal distension.
Caput XXXV.	Chapter XXXV.
Quando est solutio uentris ex frigore et humiditatibus, donec debilitet uirtutes retentiuam et digestiuam, quae sunt in stomacho et intestinis: et curatur illud cum modis curationis, et non sanatur: et uides infirmum tolerantem cauterium exuberantis uirtutis, tunc cauteriza ipsum cauterio magno super stomachum suum, secundum quod praecessit in cauterizatione stomachi cum cauterio circuli, et quatuor cauteriis in circumitu umbilici subtilibus, cum cauterio clauili subtili: et cauterio super alcatin supra alhosos magno, aut duobus cauteriis.	When the abdomen is distended due to cold and dampness, weakening the retentive and digestive powers in the stomach and intestines, and treatment is applied but fails to cure it; and you see a weak patient tolerating a cautery of great strength, then cauterize him with a large cautery on his stomach, according to what preceded in cauterizing the stomach with a circular cautery, and with four subtle cauteries around the navel, with a subtle claw-shaped cautery, and a large cautery above the intestines, or with two cauteries.
Et si uides humiditates exuberantes, et infirmum tolerantem illud, tunc cauteriza ipsum cauterio super pectinem, et cauterio super omne ilium: et fortasse addes duo cauteria parua super stomachum prope magnum.	And if you see excessive moisture, and the patient tolerates it, then cauterize him with a cautery on the chest, and a cautery on each hip; and perhaps add two small cauteries near the large one on the stomach.
Est enim curatio proficiens, cuius iuuamentum non errat.	For it is a beneficial treatment, whose help does not err.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Hemorroidas.	Concerning the method of cauterizing Hemorrhoids.
Caput XXXVI.	Chapter XXXVI.
Quando in ano sunt Hemorroides antiquae multae, aut una, et sunt ex humoribus grossis, frigidis, aut humiditatibus corruptis, et curantur cum eo, quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio: tunc cauteriza tribus cauteriis super inferiorem spondilem dorsi sub almeidati parumper triangulatim, et cauterio sub umbilico quasi duobus digitis.	When in the anus are many old hemorrhoids, or one, and they are from gross, cold humors, or corrupted moistures, and are treated with what we have said in the division, and the treatment does not help: then cauterize with three cauteries on the lower spine of the back, somewhat triangularly under the almeidati, and with a cautery under the navel, as if with two fingers.
Et si cogitas, quod stomachus eius infrigidatus sit, et cibus eius non digeratur, et faciem eius uides apostemari, tunc cauteriza eum super stomachum cauterio magno, secundum quod praecessit: et cauterio super Epar eius, et alio super Splenem ipsius, cum cauterio clauili: et dimitte cauterium apertum tempore aliquo: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	And if you think that his stomach is chilled, and his food is not digested, and you see his face becoming abscessed, then cauterize him on his stomach with a large cautery, according to what has preceded: and with a cautery on his liver, and another on his spleen, with a nail cautery: and leave the cautery open for some time: then treat him until he is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi althelul post abscisionem eorum.	Concerning the method of cauterizing althelul after their excision.
Caput XXXVII.	Chapter XXXVII.
Quando tu abscindis althelul, tunc ignias cauterium quod assimilatur radio.	When you excise althelul, then apply a cautery resembling a ray.
Deinde intromittite ipsum ignitum in ipsum althelul abscisum: et ultima manum tuam, donec perueniat cauterium ad orificium uenae, ex qua currit sanguis: fac illud semel, aut bis.	Then insert the heated cautery into the excised althelul: and with the last of your hand, until the cautery reaches the opening of the vein from which the blood flows: do it once, or twice.
Si ergo althelul fuerint multa, tunc cauteriza unumquodque cauterio secundum quod narrauimus.	If, therefore, the althelul are many, then cauterize each one with a cautery according to what we have narrated.
Deinde cura ea, cum eo quod confert eis ex unguentis, donec sanentur.	Then treat them with what is beneficial to them from the ointments, until they are healed.
Et si cauterizas eum cauterio magno super alcatin, est magis ultimum in iuuamento.	And if you cauterize it with a large cautery over the alcatin, it is more useful in helping.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Fistulam in ano.	Concerning the method of cauterizing a fistula in the anus.
Caput XXXVIII.	Chapter Thirty-Eight.
Quando non obedit infirmus sectioni et operi quod narrauimus in loco suo, et terretur ab illo, fortasse sanatur cum cauterio.	When the sick person does not obey the incision and work that we have described in its place, and is terrified by it, perhaps he is cured with a cautery.
Cum ergo accidit alicui Fistula, et antiquatur, currit pus ex ea, et humiditates corruptae.	When therefore a fistula happens to someone, and it becomes old, pus runs from it, and corrupted humours.
Dignius ergo quod oportet est, ut probes eam cum tenta subtili.	Therefore, it is worth while to probe it with a fine probe.
Deinde cognosce quantitatem profunditatis eius cum tenta.	Then ascertain the depth of it with the probe.
Deinde ignias cauterium, quod est simile radio.	Then heat the cautery, which is like a ray.
Deinde intromit te ipsum ignitum in ipsam Fistulam et quantitatem in qua intrauit clauus.	Then insert the heated cautery into the fistula itself and the amount in which the cautery entered.
Et itera super eam cauterium, donec comburantur illa omnia corpora corrupta, semel, aut bis, aut ter, secundum quantitatem necessitatis tuae.	And repeatedly apply the cautery to it until all those corrupted bodies are burned, once, or twice, or thrice, according to your necessity.
Et custodi te ab adustione nerui, si est illic, aut uenae magnae: aut si Fistula uadit ad corpus uesicae, aut ad corpus intestini, tunc custodi te ab istis locis omnibus.	And guard yourself from burning the nerve, if there is one there, or a large vein; or if the fistula extends to the bladder, or to the intestines, then guard yourself from these places in all of them.
Et non facias illud, nisi quando fistula est in loco carnoso: et cogitas, quia non est penetrans.	And do not do it unless the fistula is in a fleshy place, and you think that it is not penetrating.
Deinde cura locum usquequo sanetur.	Then treat the place until it is healed.
Si autem sigillatur locus, et abscinduntur ab eo materiae, et remanet sic tempore longo: tunc scias, quia iam sanatus est integre.	If, however, the place is sealed up, and the matter is cut off from it, and it remains like that for a long time, then know that it is now completely healed.
Et si non abscindunt ab eo materiae, tunc scias quia est penetrans, aut in profundo eius est os corruptum, aut quasi illud ex illis: quorum rememoratio ueniet in loco suo.	And if matter is not cut off from it, then know that it is penetrating, or a corrupted bone is within it, or something like that from those things, whose mention will come in its place.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Renes.	Concerning the method of cauterizing the Kidneys.
Caput XXXIX.	Chapter Thirty-Nine.
Quando accidit in Renibus dolor ex frigore, aut ex uentositate grossa, et minuitur propter illud coius infirmi, tunc oportet ut cauterizes ipsum super almethenem super ipsos renes, cauterio super omnem renem cum cauterio clauili, cuius praecessit rememoratio.	When pain in the kidneys occurs from cold or from a thick wind, and it lessens on account of that of the infirm person, then it is necessary to cauterize it above the almethen, above the kidneys themselves, with a cautery on each kidney, with the clauile cautery, whose mention preceded.
Et fortasse cauterizamus ipsum secundo in ipso almeidatu.	And perhaps we cauterize it a second time on the almeidatu itself.
Quare uenient tria lineata.	Therefore three lines will come.
Ergo erunt magis ultima in iuuamento.	Therefore, the last will be more helpful.
¶ De modo cauteritzandi Vesicam.	Concerning the method of cauterizing the bladder.
Caput XL.	Chapter XL.
Quando accidunt in Vesica debilitas, et mollificatio a frigo re et humiditatibus, donec non retineat infirmus urinam, tunc cauteriza ipsum in inferiori parte suminis super Vesicam, ubi incipiunt pili pectinis, et cauterio a dextra suminis, et alio a sinistra illius: et sit longitudo illius cauterizationis lateris secundum quantitatem nodi pollicis: et cauteriza ipsum cauterio inferiori dorsi, aut duobus cauteriis, si indiges illo: et sit secundum quod praecessit cauterium clauile.	When weakness and softening of the bladder occur due to cold and moisture, to the point that the afflicted person cannot retain urine, then cauterize it on the lower part of the upper region above the bladder, where the hairs of the pubic area begin, and cauterize with one cautery from the right side of the area and another from the left side: and let the length of the cauterization on each side be according to the size of a thumb's knot; and cauterize it with a lower back cautery, or with two cauteries if that is insufficient: and let it be, as before, with a fitting cautery.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Matricem.	Concerning the method of cauterizing the uterus.
Caput XLI.	Chapter XLI.
Quando accidunt in Matrice frigus et humiditates, et prohibetur per illud ab impregnatione, et corrumpuntur menstrua eius, et tardatur prouocatio eorum, et accidit ei apud aduentum eorum dolor, tunc oportet ut cauterizetur tribus cauteriis in circumitu umbilici, sicut diximus in cauterizatione uesicae, et cauterio super alcatim inferius dorso, aut duobus cauteriis: et sit cauterium clauile.	When cold and moisture occur in the uterus, and it is prevented by it from conception, and her menses are corrupted, and their discharge is delayed, and pain occurs in her at their arrival, then it is necessary that it be cauterized with three cauteries in a circle around the navel, as we said in the cauterization of the bladder, and with a cautery above, below the back, or with two cauteries: and let the cautery be fitting.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Ancham in dislocatione.	Concerning the method of cauterizing the anus in dislocation.
Caput XLII.	Chapter XLII.
Quando effunduntur humiditates mucosae ad pixidem Anchae, et fiunt caussa exitus eius a loco suo: et signum illius est, quod prolongatur crus super alterum, quando comparantur adinuicem: et inuenitur locus dislocationis in eo uacuus.	When mucous humors are discharged into the anus, and they become the cause of its exit from its place; and the sign of this is that the leg is extended over the other, when they are compared together; and the place of the dislocation is found empty in it.
Oportet ergo ut cauterizes infirmum super pixidem Anchae ipsius cauterio simili circulo: postquam tu signas cum encaustro in circumitu pixidis, sicut reuoluitur: et ut cadat ipsa pixis in medio circuli.	Therefore, it is necessary to cauterize the afflicted area over the anus itself with a similar circular cautery: after you mark it with ink in a circle around the anus, as it revolves; and that the anus itself should fall in the middle of the circle.
Et sit cauterium cuius forma praecessit in cauterizatione stomachi.	And let the cautery be of a form that preceded in the cauterization of the stomach.
Quod si tibi non est praesens hoc cauterium, tunc cauteriza ipsum tribus cauteriis, cum cauterio oliuari magno: et fiat cauterio profunditas secundum quantitatem spissitudinis cutis totius.	If this cautery is not present for you, then cauterize it with three cauteries, with a large olive cautery; and let the depth of the cautery be according to the thickness of the whole skin.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then treat it until it is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Sciatica.	Concerning the method of cauterization in Sciatica.
Caput XLIII.	Chapter XLIII.
Quando accidit dolor in pixide anchae, et sunt caussa illius frigus et humiditates: et curatur infirmus cum eo, quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio, et antiquatur illud: tunc oportet ut soluas infirmum ab humoribus grossis cum pillulis foetidis, aut cum pillulis artificialibus, et similibus.	When pain occurs in the hip joint, and its cause is cold and moisture; and the patient is treated with what we have stated in the division, and the treatment does not benefit, and it is prolonged: then it is necessary to free the patient from gross humors with foul pills, or with artificial pills, and similar things.
Deinde cauteriza eum.	Then cauterize it.
Et modus cauterii in ea est secundum duos modos: aut cauterium cum medicinis adurentibus, aut cauterium cum igne.	And the method of cautery in it is according to two methods: either cautery with burning medicines, or cautery with fire.
Cauterium cum igne, est secundum multos modos.	Cautery with fire is according to many methods.
Quorum unus est, ut cauterizes super pixidem anchae ipsius tribus cauteriis triangulatis, secundum hanc formam.	One of which is that you cauterize above the hip joint itself with three triangular cauteries, according to this form.
Et fac eis profunditatem bonam, uel malam.	And make them a good depth, or a bad one.
Et sit spacium quod est inter omne cauterium quantitatis grossitudinis digiti: sitque cauterium oliuare.	And let the space that is between every cautery be the quantity of the thickness of a finger: and let the cautery be olive-shaped.
Quandoque autem fit cauterium in medio super caput anchae ipsius.	Sometimes, however, a cautery is made in the middle above the head of the hip joint itself.
Quare sunt quatuor cauteria.	Therefore there are four cauteries.
Et si uis cauteriza cum circulo, cuius praecessit forma in cauterizatione dislocationis anchae, uno: ut sit circulus continens ancham totam.	And if you wish to cauterize with a circle, whose form preceded in the cauterization of the dislocation of the hip joint, one: so that the circle contains the entire hip joint.
Et combure spissitudinem cutis totius.	And burn the thickness of the entire skin.
Iste est modus cauterii in Sciatica, quando dolor est adhaerens anchae ipsi, et non extenditur usque ad coxam et crus.	This is the method of cauterization in sciatica, when the pain is adhering to the hip joint itself, and does not extend down to the thigh and leg.
Si autem extenditur usque ad coxam et crus, tunc cauteriza ipsum duobus cauteriis super coxam, super locum ad quem innuit illic infirmus, in quo est dolor, et cauterio tuo super cauillam quatuor digitis ad partem syluestrem parumper: et sit cauterium cultellare.	However, if it extends down to the thigh and leg, then cauterize it with two cauteries upon the thigh, over the place to which the infirm person there points, where the pain is, and with your cautery over the shin four fingers towards the wild side for a short time: and let the cautery be a knife-like one.
Et sit profunditas cauterii secundum profunditatem spissitudinis cutis.	And let the depth of the cautery be according to the depth of the thickness of the skin.
Quod si infirmus innuit quod dolor extenditur usque prope digitos pedis, tunc cauteriza ipsum illic ubi innuit cum cauterio puncti, tribus, aut quatuor, aut pluribus, si indiget illo.	If, however, the infirm person indicates that the pain extends almost to the toes of the foot, then cauterize it there where he points with a pricking cautery, three, or four, or more, if needed.
Et si innuit dolorem esse sub genu uersus crus, tunc cauteriza ipsum illic cauterio uno cultellari.	And if he indicates the pain to be below the knee towards the leg, then cauterize it there with a single knife-like cautery.
Et caue tibi in omni cauterizatione tua, ut non ultimes cum cauterio ad hoc ut comburas neruum, aut arteriam magnam, et attrahas per illud super infirmum nocumentum malum, aut contractionem.	And beware in all your cauterizations, that you do not proceed with the cautery so far as to burn a nerve or a large artery, and thereby bring upon the infirm person bad harm or contraction.
Et ego quidem iam uidi unum et alium, ex eis qui cauterizauerunt supra cauillam, et ultimauerunt in cauterizatione, et inflatum est crus, donec tumor consecutus est pedem, et perforatus est totus, et corruptus est totus pes: deinde accidit solutio uentris, et mors post illud.	And indeed I have already seen one or another of those who have cauterized above the ankle, and proceeded too far in the cauterization, and the leg has become swollen, until a tumor reached the foot, and the entire foot was perforated and decayed: then dissolution of the belly happened, and death after that.
Quod si dolor est in duabus partibus simul, cauteriza utramque secundum hunc modum.	If the pain is in two parts simultaneously, cauterize each according to this method.
Et sapientes quidam dixerunt in cauterizatione anchae, cuius cauterii iste est modus.	And some wise men said in cauterization of the buttock, of which this is the method of cautery.
Fac simile samio ex ferro, cuius diametrus sit medietas palmi: et sit apud orificium suum secundum grossitudinem nuclei dactyli, aut minus parumper: et intra illud samium sit samium tertium.	Make a similar cautery of iron, whose diameter be the half of a palm: and let it be at its opening according to the thickness of a date-stone, or a little less: and within that cautery be a third cautery.
Et sit spacium quod est inter omne samium per quantitatem nodi pollicis: et sint samia aperta a duabus partibus: et sit altitudo eorum quasi nodus, aut duo nodi: et fac eis manubrium ex ferro decenter aptatum in samiis.	And let the space that is between every cautery be the quantity of a finger's joint: and let the cauteries be open on both sides: and let their height be like a joint, or two joints: and make for them a handle of iron fitting well into the cauteries.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form.
Deinde igniatur in igne, donec rubeat, et proiiciat scintillas: deinde ponatur super pixidem anchae infirmo accubitato super latus sanum.	Then let it be heated in fire until it turns red, and throws off sparks: then let it be placed over the box of the buttock of the sick person lying on the healthy side.
Cauteriza ergo eum tribus cauteriis rotundis in uice una.	Therefore cauterize him with three round cauteries at one time.
Deinde dimitte ipsum tribus diebus.	Then leave him for three days.
Postea emplastra cum butyro: et dimitte uulnus apertum diebus multis.	Afterwards apply plasters with butter: and leave the wound open for many days.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then treat him with ointment until he is healed.
Inquit Albucasis, hac specie cauterii o filii, parum usi sumus, propter terrorem aspectus eius: et propterea, quod paucos inuenimus qui expectent super ipsum.	Albucasis says, by this kind of cautery, O children, we have used little, because of the fear of its appearance; and because we find few who will wait on it.
Verumtamen est ex bonis cauteriis ei qui suffert, et inuenit cum eo locum eius.	However, it is among the good cauteries for the one who suffers, and finds its place with him.
Cauterium autem cum medicinis adurentibus est, ut tu facias duo samia habentia perforatam armillam, in quam descendit cardo portae eius ex aere, aut ferro, longitudo parietis: quorum in altitudinem eorum sint duo nodi, aut quasi ipsi.	However, the cautery is with burning medicines, so that you make two samian ones having a perforated armilla, into which descends the hinge of its gate of bronze, or iron, the length of a wall: whose height they should have two knots, or almost themselves.
Et sit spacium quod est inter utraque quantitas grossitudinis digiti, et sint aperta inferius et superius: et sit quod contineant se adinuicem, secundum hanc formam.	And let the space that is between both be the thickness of a finger, and let them be open below and above: and let that which contains them be joined together, according to this form.
Deinde depone eam super pixidem anchae, infirmo iacente super latus sanum.	Then place it upon a box of ashes, the sick person lying on their healthy side.
Et comprime manum tuam super pixidem anchae multum.	And press your hand upon the box of ashes firmly.
Deinde funde inter duos circulos ex aqua calida, quae sit calefacta cum igne parumper, et tene eam quantitate horae temporalis: et toleret infirmus mordicationem eius, et ipsius adustionem, nam ipse inuenit mordicationem sicut ignis, donec quiescat mordicatio.	Then pour between the two circles hot water, which has been warmed a little with fire, and hold it for a quantity of an hour's time: and let the sick person tolerate its burning and its cauterization, for he finds the burning like fire, until the burning ceases.
Deinde eleua manum tuam cum instrumento, et absterge aquam calidam ab ancha tota cum aqua dulci: deinde dimitte illud tribus diebus.	Then raise your hand with the instrument, and wipe away the hot water from the entire ash with fresh water; then leave it for three days.
Et pone super illud butyrum, donec remoueatur nigredo adustionis: et dimitte illud diebus aliquot, et curret ex eo pus.	And place butter upon it, until the blackness of the cauterization is removed; and leave it for a few days, and pus will run from it.
Est enim ultimum in iuuamento.	For it is the last in help.
Deinde cura illud cum unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with ointments until it is healed.
Quod si extendatur dolor usque ad coxam, aut crus: fac ei statuam in eo quod continet aquam, secundum quod fecisti in ancha aequaliter.	If the pain extends to the thigh or leg, make a poultice on it containing water, in the same manner as you did for the ash.
Et iste est modus aquae calidae: et ego iam scripsi eam in tractatu rectificationis medicinarum.	And this is the method of hot water: and I have already written it in the treatise on the rectification of medicines.
Sume alcali, et calcis non extinctae amborum ana partem unam: tere utraque, et pone ea in ollam nouam, cuius inferior pars sit perforata foramine uno paruo, secundum quantitatem quod ingrediatur ipsum radius: et pone sub fundo ollae ollam aliam uitreatam: et proiice super alcali et calcem ex aqua dulci, quod submergat utraque per digitum: post quam tu comprimas ea manu tua compressione bona: et dimite ollam, donec descendat aqua acuta inferiori parte ollae uitreatae.	Take alkali and quicklime, of each one part: pulverize both, and place them in a new pot, whose lower part has a small hole, according to the amount that the radius will enter: and place another glass pot beneath the bottom of the pot: and pour over the alkali and lime some fresh water, so that both are submerged by a finger's breadth: after which, you should compress them with your hand with good pressure: and leave the pot until the sharp water descends to the lower part of the glass pot.
Deinde aggrega illam aquam totam, et proiice eam super aliam calcem: et cola, donec renouetur.	Then collect all that water, and pour it over other lime; and strain it until it is renewed.
Ipsa enim erit tunc fortis acuitatis ualde, quae administratur in multis operationibus medicinae, et in cauterizatione reliquorum membrorum.	For it will then be very strong and sharp, which is administered in many surgical operations, and in the cauterization of other limbs.
Quoniam efficit operationem ignis ipsius.	Because it produces the effect of fire itself.
Et ex medicinis sunt, cum quibus cauterizantur ancha, etiam sicut tesisie, et mel anacardi, et calx cum sapone, ita quod utraque sint permixta. ¶	And among the medicines with which the anchas are cauterized, also like tesisie, and honey of anacard, and lime with soap, so that both are mixed together.
Et Galenus quidem narrando retulit, cuiusdam uiri ex antiquis curationem, qua curatus est dolor anchae et uenae sciaticae: et magnificauit esse eius ualde.	And Galen, indeed, relating, reported the cure of a certain man from the ancients, with which the pain of the ancha and sciatica vein was cured; and he magnified its to be very great.
Et dixit, quia non indiguit alia curatione, et quia sanatus est ex uice una, donec retulit, quia ipse fortasse intrauit balneum delatus, et exiuit ex eo iam sanus.	And he said, that he did not need any further treatment, and that he was healed in a single instance, until he reported, that he perhaps had entered a bath carried, and emerged from it already healthy.
Et est, ut accipiatur ex seitaragi uiridi: et si non inuenitur uiride, sumatur siccum, recens: et teratur multum cum aliquanto adipe, et ponatur super ancham, ubi est dolor, aut crus, aut in coxa: et ligetur, et dimittatur quantitate trium horarum, aut per quantitatem quod sentiat infirmus sedationem adustionis.	And it is to be taken from fresh seitaragi: and if fresh is not found, let dry, fresh, be taken; and let it be rubbed much with some fat, and placed upon the ancha, where the pain is, or the leg, or in the thigh: and let it be bound, and let it be left for the quantity of three hours, or for the quantity that the sick person feels a lessening of the burning.
Deinde intromitte eum in balneum.	Then immerse him in a bath.
Cum ergo roridum fit corpus eius, intromitte ipsum in solium.	When therefore his body becomes moist, immerse him in a couch.
Nam dolor recedit, et sanatur.	For the pain recedes, and he is healed.
Et scias, quia non oportet ut utatur aliquis cauterio cum istis medicinis, nisi post euacuationem corporis.	And know that it is not appropriate for anyone to use a cautery with these medicines unless after evacuation of the body.
Et Dioscorides qui dem dixit, quod stercus caprarum, quando cum eo cauterizatur uena sciatica, confert ei: et fit cauterium secundum hunc modum.	And Dioscorides, who said that the dung of goats, when cauterized with it the sciatic vein, benefits it: and the cautery is made according to this manner.
Sumatur lana, et imbibatur oleo antiquo, et ponatur super locum profundum, qui est inter pollicem pedis, et inter focile, et est propinquior focili.	Take wool, and soak it in old oil, and place it over the deep place, which is between the big toe and the other toe, and is closer to the other toe.
Deinde accipe stercus caprarum siccum, et inflamma ipsum in igne, donec fiat carbo.	Then take dry goat dung, and inflame it in fire until it becomes charcoal.
Deinde pone ipsum super lanam, et dimitte ipsum, donec extinguatur.	Then place it upon the wool, and let it be until it is extinguished.
Deinde itera illud.	Then repeat it.
Non cesses ergo facere illud, usquequo perueniat sensus super mediatione usque ad ancham, et quiescat dolor.	Therefore cease not to do it, until the sensation above the middle reaches the sole, and the pain subsides.
Et iste modus cauterii nominatur cauterium Vaccinum.	And this method of cautery is called the Vaccinum cautery.
¶ De cauterizatione doloris Dorsi.	Concerning the cauterization of back pain.
Caput XLIIII.	Chapter XLIV.
Quandoque accidit dolor in Dorso ex caussis multis, aut a casu, aut a percussione, aut euacuatione superflua, et illis similibus, ex infusione materiei frigidae, et humidae: et cauterium quidem non cadit, nisi in hac specie sola, quae fit ex infusione materiei frigidae.	Sometimes pain occurs in the back from many causes, either from an accident, or a blow, or an evacuation of superfluities, and similar things, from the infusion of cold and moist material: and indeed cautery does not apply, except in this sole case, which is caused by the infusion of cold material.
Oportet ergo post euacuationem infirmi cum pillulis foetidis, et eis similibus, ut fiant super Dorsum, ubi est dolor, tres lineae secundum latitudinem almeidati ipsius, postquam signas cum encaustro in omni linea quinque cauteria, aut plura secundum quantitatem quae uenit ex tolerantia infirmi uirtute eius: et fiat cauterizatio cum cauteriopuncti.	Therefore, after the patient's evacuation with foul pills, and similar things, let three lines be made on the back, where the pain is, according to the width of the almedate itself.  After marking each line with five cauteries, or more, according to the amount tolerated by the patient's strength, let the cauterization be done with the cauterium puncti.
Et si uis, cauteriza tribus cauteriis, aut quatuor, cum cauterio clauili mediali, secundum hanc formam.	And if you wish, cauterize with three or four cauteries with the medial claw cautery, according to this form.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in incaeptine Gibbositatis.	Concerning the method of cauterization in the incipient stages of gibbosity.
Caput XLV.	Chapter XLV.
Multotiens accidit haec aegritudo infantibus paruis.	This illness often occurs in young infants.
Et signum incaeptionis eius in pueris est: quod accidit super eum strictura in anhelitu apud eleuationem, et motum: et inuenis in ultima spondilium Dorsi et nodorum eius, quod iam incaepit eminere super reliquos spondiles.	And the sign of its inception in children is: that there is constriction in their breathing upon elevation and movement; and you find in the last vertebra of the dorsal spine and its joints, that it has already begun to project above the other vertebrae.
Cum ergo uides illud, et uis facere illud, tunc cauteriza ipsum cum cauterio quod sit circulus secundum hanc formam.	Therefore, when you see it, and wish to treat it, then cauterize it with a cautery that is circular, according to this form.
Et capiat cauterium super omnem partem spondilis aequaliter: et si uis cauteriza in circumitu spondilis cum cauterio puncti duas lineas, aut tres: et sint puncta propinqua adinuicem.	And let the cautery take hold equally on the entire area of the vertebra; and if you wish to cauterize the circumference of the vertebra with a pointed cautery, make two or three lines, and let the points be close together.
Deinde cura locum, donec sanetur cum eo quod diximus.	Then treat the place until it is healed with what we have said.
Et caue, ne administres cauterium in gibbositate, quae fit in spasmo nerui.	And be careful not to apply the cautery to the hump which forms in a nerve spasm.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Podagra, et doloribus iuncturarum.	On the method of cauterization for gout and joint pains.
Caput XLVI.	Chapter XLVI.
Quando dolores iuncturarum sunt ab humiditatibus frigidis, quae effunduntur ad cuiuslibet membra corporis, tunc quando accidunt dolores in pedibus, de consuetudine medicorum est, ut nominent illud Podagram proprie.	When the pains of the joints are from cold humors, which are shed to any members of the body, then, when such pains occur in the feet, it is customary for physicians to properly call it gout.
Cum ergo curatur Podagra frigidae caussae cum modis curationis, et non remouentur dolores, tune cauterium remouet eos.	Therefore, when gout of a cold cause is treated with methods of cure, and the pains are not removed, then the cautery will remove them.
Et est, ut cauterizes eum post euacuationem in circumitu iuncturae pedum, cauteriis multis: et sit cauterium Oliuare.	And it is, that you cauterize it after evacuation in the circumference of the foot joints, with many cauteries, and let the cautery be olive-shaped.
Cuius haec est forma.	This is its form.
Et si indiges ut punctes super faciem pedis, tunc fac cum cauterio puncti.	And if you need to puncture on the surface of the foot, then do it with a pointed cautery.
Quod si ascendunt dolores usque ad genua, aut reliquas iuncturas, et multotiens accidit illud, tunc cauteriza ipsum super omne genu tribus cauteriis, aut quatuor ab omni parte, cum hoc eodem cauterio Clauili.	If the pains ascend to the knees, or other joints, and this often happens, then cauterize it above each knee with three or four cauteries on all sides, using this same clavil cautery.
Si autem necessaria sunt tibi plura hoc cauterio, tunc cauteriza ipsum.	If however more of this cautery is necessary for you, then cauterize it.
Et non submergas manum tuam cum cauterio, imo sit circiter spissitudinem cutis tantum.	And do not immerse your hand with the cautery, but rather let it be about the thickness of the skin only.
Si autem ascendunt dolores ad genua, et dorsum: tunc administra quod diximus ex cauterio in capitulo suo.	If however the pains ascend to the knees and back, then administer what we have said about the cautery in its chapter.
Quod si dolores sunt in manibus tantum, tunc puncta in circumitu focilium, sicut reuoluuntur duae lineae.	If the pains are only in the hands, then puncture in a circle around the foci, as two lines revolve.
Si autem remanet ex doloribus in digitis, tunc puncta eos, super omnem nodum punctum, et super pectinem manus.	If however pain remains in the fingers, then puncture them, above each knot a puncture, and above the palm of the hand.
Si autem ascendunt dolores post dies ad cubitos, aut ad humeros, tunc cauteriza utrosque ab omni parte.	If however the pains ascend after days to the elbows, or to the shoulders, then cauterize both from every side.
Et non euacues infirmum ex regimine bono, ex recaeptione medicinarum.	And do not remove the sick person from a good regimen, from the taking of medicines.
Nam si bonum fiat regimen, et euacuetur phlegma, sanabitur auxilio Dei cum isto cauterio.	For if a good regimen is made, and phlegm is evacuated, it will be healed with the help of God with this cautery.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Rupturis.	Concerning the method of cauterization in Ruptures.
Caput XLVII.	Chapter XLVII.
Quando accidit Ruptura in inguinibus, et descendit intestinum, aut zirbum ad testiculum, et est illud incipiens propinquum: tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmo dimittere comestionem in die suo.	When a rupture occurs in the groin, and the intestine or the spermatic cord descends to the testicle, and it is beginning to approach closely: then it is necessary that you instruct the sick person to discontinue eating on that day.
Et utatur ex lenientibus, quo descendat stercus a uentre suo.	And let him use from among the lenitives, so that the stool may descend from his belly.
Deinde sedeat inter manus tuas super dorsum suum: et praecipe ei, ut teneat anhelitum suum, donec egrediatur, uel appareat zirbum, aut intestinum.	Then let him sit between your hands upon his back; and instruct him to hold his breath, until it emerges, or the spermatic cord, or the intestine appears.
Deinde reduc ipsum digitis tuis, et signa cum encaustro sub Ruptura super os pectinis, cum signo cuius extremitas sit similis medietati circuli ad superiora corporis.	Then reduce it with your fingers, and mark with ink under the rupture upon the pubic bone, with a sign whose extremity is similar to half a circle towards the upper part of the body.
Deinde igni cauterium, cuius haec est forma, donec ueniat album, et proiiciat seintillas.	Then cauterize with a cautery, whose form is this, until it becomes white and throws off sparks.
Deinde reduc intestinum, aut zirbum ad concauitatem suam.	Then reduce the intestine, or spermatic cord, to its cavity.
Deinde ponat minister manum suam super locum, ut non exeat intestinum: et tu iam aperuisti inter crura infirmi, et posuisti sub eo puluinar, et seruiens alius super crura eius, et alius super pectus eius qui tenet manus.	Then let the assistant place his hand over the place, so that the intestine does not come out; and you have now opened between the legs of the sick person, and placed a pillow under him, and another servant on his legs, and another on his chest who holds his hands.
Deinde depone cauterium super ipsum signum, manu tua cum cauterio stante recta.	Then place the cautery upon that mark, with your hand holding the cautery upright.
Et tene ipsum, donec cum eo consequaris os: aut itera cum eo uice alia, si non consecutus fueris cum eo in prima usque ad os.	And hold it until you reach the mouth with it; or again with it a second time, if you have not reached the mouth with it in the first attempt.
Et prudenter obserua ab exitu intestini in hora cauterizationis tuae, ne comburas ipsum, et eueniat per illud super infirmum aut mors, aut malicia magna.	And carefully watch for the exit of the intestine during your cauterization, lest you burn it, and thereby cause either death or great harm to the sick person.
Et scias, quod quando tu non consequeris cum cauterio os, non confert operatio tua.	And know that when you do not reach the mouth with the cautery, your operation is ineffective.
Et oportet ut sit cauterium infantium subtile, secundum mensuram eorum.	And the cautery for infants should be small, according to their size.
Deinde cura cum reliquis unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then treat with the remaining ointments until it is healed.
Et sit infirmus iacens super dorsum suum quadraginta diebus, donec sigilletur uulnus.	And let the sick person lie on their back for forty days, until the wound is sealed.
Et oportet, ut ponas nutrimentum eius longitudine temporis curationis eius, quod leniat uentrem eius: ut non exeat intestinum apud conamen et egestionem.	And it is necessary that you provide him with nourishment for the duration of his treatment, which will soothe his stomach, so that the intestines do not expel[matter] in straining and defecation.
Deinde quando uult surgere post quadraginta dies, tunc administra ligamentum decenter factum, et teneat ipsum quadraginta diebus aliis.	Then, when he wishes to rise after forty days, then administer a properly made bandage, and let him keep it on for another forty days.
Et minoretur a labore, et repletione cibi et potus, et uocibus uehementibus.	And let him abstain from labor, and from overeating and drinking, and from loud noises.
Nam quando utitur hoc regimine, ita sanatur sanatione integra.	For when he follows this regimen, he is thus healed completely.
Et ego dicam curationem Rupturarum cum incisione in capitulo suo.	And I shall discuss the treatment of ruptures with incision in his chapter.
Quando autem Rupturae accidunt in reliquo uentre, et sunt incipientes, et uis ut non addantur, tunc cauteriza Rupturam eius cauterio rotundo secundum quantitatem eius: et sit illud quod aduritur ex tunc sicut tertia eius.	However, when ruptures occur in the rest of the belly, and are just beginning, and force so that they do not increase, then cauterize the rupture with a round cauterium according to its size; and let that which is cauterized be then like a third of it.
Deinde cura ipsum, cum eo quod diximus: et non addetur.	Then treat him, with what we have said; and it will not increase.
Et iam dixerunt quidam primi: ut cauterizetur Ruptura cum cauterio triangulato, secundum hanc formam.	And some of the earlier ones have said that the rupture should be cauterized with a triangular cauterium, according to this shape.
Postquam signatur cum encaustro, et ponitur linea quae est per latitudinem in latere superiori Rupturae, et linea altera ad inferius.	After it is marked with ink, and a line is placed which is across the width on the upper side of the rupture, and another line at the lower one.
Et depone manum tuam in medio cum cauterio clauili.	And place your hand in the middle with the cauterium closed.
Sed cauterium primum est facilius et melius.	But the first cauterium is easier and better.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in doloribus propter casum, aut percussionem.	Concerning the method of cauterization in pains due to a fall or blow.
Caput XLVIII.	Chapter XLVIII.
Quando accidit in quibusdam membris a casu, aut percussione dolor: et perseuerat ille dolor tempore longo, et non confert in eo curatio cum medicinis: tunc oportet ut cauterizetur cum cauterio Puncti.	When, in certain limbs, pain arises from a fall or blow, and that pain persists for a long time, and treatment with medicines is of no avail, then it is necessary to cauterize with a pointed cauterium.
Et sit cauterium omnis membri cauterium secundum magnitudinem eius, et ipsius paruitatem, et debilitatem eius, et ipsius uirtutem, et locationem torsionis, et doloris ex eo.	And let the cauterization of each limb be according to its size, its smallness, its weakness, its strength, its location of twisting, and the pain arising from it.
Si ergo sanatur ex cauterio primo, est bene.	If therefore it is healed from the first cauterization, it is well.
Si non: tunc itera super ipsum cauterium.	If not, then repeat the cauterization upon it.
Quoniam de consuetudine horum dolorum est, ut permutentur ex membro ad illud quod appropinquat ei.	Because it is customary for these pains to shift from a limb to that which is near to it.
Quare oportet ut consequaris eos cum cauterio, donec sanetur infirmus.	Therefore, it is necessary to follow them with cauterization, until the afflicted one is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Lepra.	Concerning the method of cauterization in Leprosy.
Caput XLIX.	Chapter XLIX.
Leprosi autem quandoque iuuantur cauterio iuuamento maximo.	Lepers are sometimes helped greatly by cauterization.
Et praecipue species Leprae, quae fit propter putrefactionem phlegmatis et melancholiae: cum ergo uis cauterizare ipsam considera.	And especially the species of leprosy that arises from the putrefaction of phlegm and melancholy: therefore, when you wish to cauterize it, consider it.
Si ergo Lepra est ineipiciens, et curasti eam cum eo, quod diximus in diuisione, et non descendit, neque stat: et times super infirmum, quod comprehendat corruptio super totam complexionem eius: tunc cauteriza eum super caput quinque cauteriis: uno in medio capitis noto, et secundo inferius eo uersus frontem apud finem capillorum, et duobus super duo cornua, et uno posterius super nucea ceruicis.	If therefore the leprosy is unyielding, and you have treated it with what we have said in the division, and it does not descend, nor stand still, and you fear that corruption will spread over the whole of his complexion, then cauterize him on the head with five cauteries: one in the middle of the head, noted, and a second below it towards the forehead at the end of the hair, and two above the two horns, and one behind above the nape of the neck.
Et ultima manum tuam cum cauterio parumper, donec imprimat in os impressionem paruam, et dislocentur ex eo cortices: ut alleuietur expiratio uaporum grossorum ex eo, et cauteriza cauterio etiam super ipsum splenem, secundum quod praecessit.	And keep your hand with the cautery for a short time, until it imprints a small impression in the orifice, and the layers are separated from it, so that the expiration of the thick vapors from it may be alleviated, and cauterize with the cautery also on the spleen itself, according to what has preceded.
Sin autem Lepra iam sparsa est super infirmum, et apparet manifeste: tunc oportet ut cauterizes cum istis cauteriis, quae diximus in capite, et cauterio super extremitatem nasi, et duobus cauteriis super duas maxillas, et duobus cauteriis super spondiles colli, et sex super spondiles dorsi, et uno magno super alhahosos apud gran caudae et uno supra ipsum, in ipso almeidati: et duobus super anchas: scilicet super omnem ancham uno, et duobus super genua: uno super omne genu, et duobus super humeros, et duobus super cubitos, et duobus super teneritudines pectoris sui: et cauteriza ipsum super omnem iuncturam, ex iuncturis digitorum manuum suarum, et pedum suorum: et cauteriza super omnem calcaneum pedum suorum, et focilia manuum suarum.	But if the leprosy has already spread over the afflicted person, and appears clearly, then it is necessary to cauterize with these cauteries, which we have mentioned for the head, and with a cautery on the tip of the nose, and with two cauteries on the two jaws, and with two cauteries on the vertebrae of the neck, and six on the vertebrae of the back, and with one large one on the haunchbones near the base of the tail and one on it itself, in the middle of it; and with two on the hips: namely, one on each hip, and with two on the knees: one on each knee, and with two on the shoulders, and with two on the elbows, and with two on the soft parts of his chest, and cauterize him on every joint, from the joints of his fingers of his hands and feet, and cauterize on every heel of his feet, and the soft parts of his hands.
Et caue tibi a neruis qui sunt super postremum calcanei, ut non comburas eos.	And beware of the nerves that are above the last heel, so that you do not burn them.
Et quandoque cauterizatur cauterio super os pectinis, et alio super os stomachi, et alio super epar.	And sometimes a cautery is applied to the sternum, and another to the stomach, and another to the liver.
Et scias, quod quanto plus addis cauterium, est magis iuuamentum, et magis conferens.	And know that the more you add the cautery, the more beneficial and helpful it is.
Et scias, quod infirmus non inuenit in cauterio dolorem, sicut inueniunt ipsum sani: propterea, quod corpus eius iam stupefactum est.	And know that the sick person does not experience pain from the cautery as healthy people do, because his body is already numb.
Et oportet ut sint cauteria ex magnitudine, et paruitate secundum membra et iuncturas: secundum quod praecessit ex speciebus ferramentorum.	And it is necessary that the cauteries be of a size and smallness according to the members and joints, according to what has preceded concerning the types of instruments.
Deinde cura cauterium ex farina herbi cum melle, et reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then treat the cautery with herb flour and honey, and the rest of the treatment, until it is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Stupore.	Concerning the method of cauterization in numbness.
Caput L.	Chapter L.
Quando stupet aliquod membrum, et curatur cum medicinis, et oleis, et emplastris, et non sanatur, tunc cauteriza ipsum membrum stupefactum cauteriis, secundum quod meretur magnitudo membri, aut paruitas eius.	When any limb is numb, and is treated with medicines, and oils, and plasters, and is not healed, then cauterize that numb limb with cauteries, according to the deserved size, or smallness, of the limb.
Et sit cauterium tuum intrans in spissitudinem cutis parumper.	And let your cautery be a little way into the thickness of the skin.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with ointment, until it is healed.
Et quandoque cauterizatur ad quiddam stuporis, qui accidit manui, et pedi, in spondilibus dorsi apud exitum neruorum, qui mouent illud membrum: et remouetur stupor.	And sometimes a cautery is applied to something numb, which happens to the hand, and the foot, in the spinal column of the back at the exit points of the nerves that move that limb: and the numbness is removed.
Verum non praesumat super illud, nisi qui est sapiens in anatomia membrorum, et egressione neruorum mouentium corpus.	But let no one presume upon it, unless he is knowledgeable in the anatomy of limbs, and the exit of the nerves that move the body.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Albaras.	Concerning the method of cauterizing in Albaras.
Caput LI.	Chapter LI.
Quando antiquatur Albaras, et non confert in eo aliquid ex ingeniis medicinae: tunc cauteriza super ipsam cauterio profundo parumper, secundum quantitatem spissitudinis cutis, donec remoueatur albedo, et mutetur color eius.	When Albaras becomes old and no remedy from the arts of medicine helps it, then cauterize over it with a deep cautery for a short time, according to the thickness of the skin, until the whiteness is removed, and its color is changed.
Deinde cura ipsum cum farina herbi, et lentis cum oleo rosa, et foliis arnoglossae, et sanguine columbae, et sanguine hyrundinis: de unoquoque sit pars una: misceantur haec omnia, et liniantur super pannum, et adhaereant loco, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with flour of herbs and lentils with rose oil, and leaves of arnoglossa, and dove's blood, and swallow's blood: one part of each; mix these all, and line a cloth with it, and apply it to the place, until it is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Cancro.	Concerning the method of cauterizing in Cancer.
Caput LII.	Chapter LII.
Quando Cancer est incipiens, et uis ipsum sistere: tunc cauteriza ipsum cum cauterio circuli in circuitu eius, sicuti reuoluitur.	When Cancer is beginning, and you wish to stop it, then cauterize it with a circular cautery around it, as it revolves.
Sapientes autem dixerunt, ut cauterizetur cauterio ultimo in medio.	However, the wise have said that it should be cauterized with the final cautery in the middle.
Mihi autem non uidetur illud: quoniam timeo quod ulceretur: et ego iam uidi illud aliquotiens.	However, it does not seem right to me, since I fear that it will ulcerate, and I have seen it happen several times already.
Et rectius est, ut cauterizetur in circumitu eius cum circulo, sicut diximus: aut cauteriis multis.	And it is better that it be cauterized around it with a circle, as we said, or with many cauteries.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Adubelati.	Concerning the method of cauterization in Adubelati.
Caput LIII.	Chapter LIII.
Quando aliquis habet Adubelati, et tardatur in maturatione, aut propter superfluitatem facientem eam, aut propter aetatem infirmi, quando est decrepitus pauci sanguinis, aut propter tempus, et uis festinare in maturatione Adubelati, tunc cauteriza in circumitu eius cum cauteriis paruis multis punctando.	When someone has an Adubelati, and it is delayed in maturation, either because of excess causing it, or because of the patient's age, when he is decrepit with little blood, or because of the time and the need to hasten the maturation of the Adubelati, then cauterize around it with many small cauteries by puncturing.
Deinde dimitte eam.	Then leave it.
Nam ipsa festinabit cum maturatione.	For it will hasten with maturation.
Si autem uis perforationem eius cum cauterio, tunc igni cauterium, cuius haec est forma.	If however you wish to perforate it with a cautery, then heat the cautery, whose shape is this.
Et depone ipsum in medio Adubelati, donec penetret cutem: et sit cauterium ab eo quod sequitur infirmus, ut alleuietur cursus puris.	And place it in the middle of the Adubelati, until it penetrates the skin; and let the cautery be from that which follows the sick person, so that the course of the purulent matter is alleviated.
Deinde cura ipsum donec sanetur.	Then treat it until it is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in malo corrodente.	Concerning the method of cauterization in a corrosive evil.
Caput LIIII.	Chapter LIII.
Corrodens non est nisi corruptio in membro ambulans, et corrodit ipsum: sicut ignis comedit ligna sicca.	Corrosion is not unless a corruption is walking in the limb, and it corrodes it; just as fire consumes dry wood.
Si ergo uides corrodentem in loco qui toleret cauterium cum igne, tunc igni cauteria multa, clauilia parua et magna, secundum quod conueniet illi loco in quo est corrodens.	If therefore you see a corrosive in a place that can tolerate cautery with fire, then apply many cauteries with fire, small and large clamps, according to what is suitable for the place where the corrosion is.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum ab omni parte donec eradices corruptionem totam, et non remaneat ex ea aliquid penitus.	Then cauterize it from every side until you eradicate the entire corruption, and nothing of it remains at all.
Deinde dimitte ipsum tribus diebus, et pone super loca cauterizata sulphur tritum cum oleo, donec eradicentur escharae omnes, et omnis corruptio.	Then leave it for three days, and place ground sulphur with oil on the cauterized places, until all the eschars and all corruption are eradicated.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguentis generantibus carnem.	Then treat it with ointments that generate flesh.
Si ergo uides, quod post tres dies caro nascitur natiuitate sana, in qua non est corruptio, est bonum.	If therefore you see that after three days healthy flesh is born, in which there is no corruption, it is good.
Et si non: tunc itera cauterium super illud quod remansit ex locis corruptis.	And if not, then repeat the cautery on that which remained of the corrupted places.
Et corrodens medicatur quandoque cum medicina acuta.	And it is sometimes cured by corrosive medicine.
Ipsa namque surgit loco cauterii.	For indeed it rises in the place of the cautery.
Verumtamen cauterium cum igne est uelocioris iuuamenti: et ego quidem iam dixi cauterizationem eius cum medicina acuta in diuisione: accipe ergo eam illic quando ea indiges.	However, cautery with fire is of quicker help; and I have already said that its cauterization with sharp medicine is in division; therefore take it there when you need it.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Clauis, et Verucis.	Concerning the method of cauterization in corns, and warts.
Caput LV.	Chapter LV.
Multotiens accidit in inferioribus partibus pedum haec aegritudo: et est res grossa, filtrata, quae laedit pedem.	This ailment often occurs in the lower parts of the feet, and is a thick, filtered thing that hurts the foot.
Et cauterium quidem in eis est secundum duos modos: cauterium cum igne, et cauterium cum aqua calida.	And cautery in them is indeed in two ways: cautery with fire, and cautery with hot water.
Quantum autem cum igne est, ut ignias cauterium concauum simile pennae uulturis: quod fiat ex ferro, secundum quantitatem quod contineat clauum ab omni parte: et sit subtilium marginum.	As for that with fire, let the cautery be a concave cautery like a vulture's wing, made of iron, of a size that encompasses the corn on all sides, and with thin edges.
Deinde depone ipsum ignitum super clauum.	Then place it, heated, upon the corn.
Deinde reuolue manum cum cauterio in circumitu claui, donec perueniat cauterium ad profunditatem claui: et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus, donec incipiat emittere pus.	Then revolve the hand with the cautery around the corn until the cautery reaches the depth of the corn, and leave it for three days until it begins to emit pus.
Deinde emplastra ipsum cum maluis syluestribus, contritis cum sale: et dimitte emplastrum super ipsum in nocte.	Then plaster it with wild mallows, crushed with salt, and leave the plaster upon it at night.
Ipse enim eradicabitur ex radicibus suis.	For it will be eradicated from its roots.
Deinde cura locum unguento generatiuo carnis, donec sanetur.	Then treat the place with a generative flesh ointment until it is healed.
Quod si sunt non conuersi, et multotiens accidunt in superficie corporis, praecipue in manibus et pedibus: tunc administres in eis cauterium cum aqua calida: et est, ut accipias cannulam ex aere, aut ferro, aut ex penna uulturis: et depone eam super clauum, aut althelul.	If they are not cured, and frequently occur on the surface of the body, especially in the hands and feet, then apply a cautery to them with hot water.  And it is so that you take a cannula of bronze, or iron, or of a vulture's feather, and place it on the corn, or callus.
Deinde proiice in cannulam ex aqua calida quantitatem paucam: retine manum tuam, et tu reuolue eam cum compressione manus tuae parumper, ut imprimatur margo cannulae in radice claui, et inueniat aqua calida uiam ad profundum, ad radicem claui: et expectet infirmus parumper super mordicationem aquae calidae hora una.	Then pour a small quantity of hot water into the cannula; hold your hand, and revolve it with the pressure of your hand for a little while, so that the edge of the cannula presses into the root of the corn and the hot water finds its way to the depth, to the root of the corn; and let the sick person wait for a while on the soaking of the hot water for one hour.
Deinde dimitte ipsum, nam clauus eradicatur cum radicibus suis.	Then leave him, for the corn is eradicated with its roots.
Ita fac cum eis uno post unum, donec uenias super omnes qui ex eis sunt in corpore.	Do this with them one by one, until you come upon all who are of them in the body.
Deinde cura eos postquam eradicantur, cum eo quod generat carnem ex unguentis.	Then treat them after they are eradicated, with that which generates flesh from ointments.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Tremore.	Concerning the method of cauterizing in Tremor.
Caput LVI.	Chapter LVI.
Quando accidit alicui Tremor ex frigore in neruo, aut ex febre quartana, aut alio: tunc oportet ut cauterizes ipsum quatuor cauteriis, aut quinque super spondiles dorsi, et inter omnem spondilem cauterio, et in pectore eius cauterio, et super stomachum eius cauterio.	When tremor occurs in someone from cold in the nerve, or from quartan fever, or otherwise: then it is necessary to cauterize it with four cauteries, or five, above the vertebrae of the back, and between each vertebra with a cautery, and on its chest with a cautery, and on its stomach with a cautery.
Tremor enim quiescit cum cauterio oliuari, et festinat sanitas aegritudinis frigidae.	For tremor ceases with the olive cautery, and the cure of the cold disease hastens.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Albathir.	Concerning the method of cauterizing Albathir.
Caput LVII.	Chapter LVII.
Quandoque expelluntur in corpore Albathir foedae, id est, pustulae, quae fiunt a materiis grossis corruptis.	Sometimes foul things, that is, pustules, are expelled in the body of Albathir, which are made from corrupted gross matter.
Oportet ergo in primis cum apparent, ut cauterizentur super omne caput pustulae cauterio subtili cum ligno myrti, cuius extremitas accensa est cum igne.	Therefore, when they appear, it is necessary to cauterize every pustule on the head with a fine cautery made of myrtle wood, whose tip is heated with fire.
Aut cum radice aristolochiae longae.	Or with the root of long aristolochia.
Aut cum cauterio lenticulari.	Or with a lenticular cautery.
Et quandoque cauterizantur ademenul, in principio expulsionis suae secundum hunc modum: et non augentur: et disrumpitur superfluitas faciens eos, et sanatur ex eis.	And sometimes they are cauterized at the beginning of their expulsion in this way: and they are not increased: and the excess that makes them is broken, and they are healed from them.
Verumtamen oportet ut fiat illud post euacuationem cum phlebotomia.	However, it is necessary that this be done after evacuation with phlebotomy.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in fluxu sanguins ex arteria in uulnere.	Concerning the method of cauterizing in the flow of blood from an artery in a wound.
Caput LVIII.	Chapter LVIII.
Multotiens accidit fluxus sanguinis ex arteria, quae incisa est apud uulnus, quod accidit extrinsecus, aut apud incisionem apostematis, aut cauterium membri, et similia eis: et fit difficile abscindere eum.	Often a flow of blood occurs from an artery that is cut near a wound, which occurs externally, or near the incision of an abscess, or cauterization of a limb, and similar things to these: and it is difficult to stop it.
Cum ergo accidit alicui illud, tunc propera cum manu tua ad orificium arteriae, et pone super ipsum digitum tuum indicem: et stringe eum multum, donec obsessus sit sanguis sub digito tuo, et non egrediatur ex eo aliquid.	Therefore, when this happens to someone, then quickly apply your index finger to the opening of the artery, and press it firmly until the blood is blocked beneath your finger and no more comes out.
Deinde pone in ignem cauteria oliuaria parua, et magna numero plura: et suffla super ea, donec fiant ignita ualde.	Then place small olive-shaped cauteries, and several larger ones, in the fire; and blow over them until they become very hot.
Deinde accipe ex eis unum, aut paruum, aut magnum, secundum uulnus et locum, in quo disrupta est arteria, et depone cauterium super ipsam uenam, post quam tu remoues digitum tuum festinanter: et tene cauterium, donec abscindatur sanguis.	Then take one of them, either small or large, according to the wound and the place where the artery has been ruptured, and place the cautery upon the vein, after you have quickly removed your finger; and hold the cautery until the blood is stopped.
Quod si expellatur cum eleuas digitum ab orificio arteriae, et extinguis cauterium, tunc accipe cauterium aliud festinanter, ex cauteriis quae in igne sunt praeparata.	If, when you remove your finger from the artery's opening, and extinguish the cautery, blood then flows out, then quickly take another cautery from the ones prepared in the fire.
Non ergo cesses facere illud cum uno post aliud, donec abscindatur sanguis.	Therefore do not cease doing this, one after another, until the blood is stopped.
Et caue, ne comburas neruum qui est illic, et accidat super infirmum malicia alia.	And beware, lest you burn the nerve which is there, and cause another misfortune to the sick person.
Et scias, quod quando ex arteria fluit sanguis, tunc non est possibile abscindere ipsum: praecipue quaudo arteria est magna, nisi cum uno quatuor modorum.	And know that when blood flows from the artery, then it is not possible to stop it, especially when the artery is large, unless by one of the four methods.
Aut cum cauterio, sicut diximus.	Or with cautery, as we have said.
Aut cum extractione, quando non est extracta.	Or with extraction, when it is not extracted.
Nam quando extrahitur, contrahuntur extremitates eius, et abscinditur sanguis.	For when it is extracted, its extremities contract, and the blood is cut off.
Aut ligetur cum filo ligatione forti.	Or it is bound with a strong ligature.
Aut ponantur super ipsum medicinae de proprietate, quarum est abscindere sanguinem, et stringatur cum puluinari constrictione decenti.	Or let medicines of a nature to cut off the blood be placed upon it, and it be bound with a fitting constriction of a pillow.
Qui autem administrat abscisionem eius cum ligamento, et strictura cum panno, aut positione rerum comburentium, et similium, non confert ei penitus, nisi raro.	However, whoever performs its excision with a ligature, and constriction with cloth, or by placing burning things, and similar things, does not help it at all, unless rarely.
Si autem accidat alicui illud, et non sit ei praesens medicus, neque medicina: tunc incipiat cum positione digiti indicis super orificium uenae ipsius, sicut narrauimus, et constrictione eius ualde, donec obsessus sit sanguis a superiori parte uulneris, et super arteriam.	If, however, this happens to someone, and a physician or medicine is not present, then let him begin with the positioning of the index finger over the opening of the vein itself, as we have narrated, and with a strong constriction of it, until the blood is obstructed from the upper part of the wound, and above the artery.
Et digitus non remoueatur, desuper ipsum cum aqua frigida uehementis frigoris semper, donec congeletur sanguis, et ingrossetur, et abscindatur.	And the finger should not be removed, but rather always kept over it with very cold water, until the blood is congealed and thickened, and severed.
Et interim consideret in eo, quid indiget ex cauterio, aut ex medicina.	And meanwhile, let him consider what it needs from cautery or from medicine.

¶ De Incisione, Perforatione, et Phlebotomia in uulneribus, et his similibus.	Concerning incision, perforation, and phlebotomy in wounds, and similar matters.
Iam Diximus in Capitulo Primo, omnem aegritudinem in qua conueniens est cum igne cauterium et medicina comburente, et occasiones eius, ipsius caussas, et instrumenta eius, et formas cauteriorum.	We have already said in the first chapter, every ailment in which it is appropriate to use cautery with fire and burning medicine, and its occasions, its very causes, and its instruments, and the forms of cauteries.
Et posui illic capitula a uertice usque ad pedem.	And I have placed there chapters from the head to the foot.
Et ego procedam in hoc capitulo illa eadem uia: ut alleuietur super quaerentem quaesitum eius.	And I will proceed in this chapter along the same path: so that the seeker may be relieved of his inquiry.
Et antequam incipiam illud, oportet ut addiscatis o filii, quod in hoc capitulo est ex terrore illud quod est in capitulo primo de cauterizatione.	And before I begin that, it is necessary that you, children, learn that in this chapter there is the terror of that which is in the first chapter concerning cauterization.
Et propter illud oportet, ut sit cautela in eo uehementior, quoniam in operatione quae est in hoc capitulo, multotiens cadit euacuatio cum sanguine, cum quo stat uita apud apertionem uenae, aut incisionem super apostema, aut apertionem exiturae, aut curationem uulneris, aut extractionem sagittae, aut incisionem super lapidem, et illis similia: ex quibus omnibus associatur tremor, et timor, et cadit in pluribus eorum mors.	And therefore it is necessary that there be greater caution in it, because in the operation which is in this chapter, very often evacuation occurs with blood, with which life stands at the opening of a vein, or the incision upon an abscess, or the opening of an outlet, or the treatment of a wound, or the extraction of an arrow, or the incision upon a stone, and similar things: from all of which trembling and fear are associated, and death results in many of them.
Et ego moneo uos, ne cadat super uos illud in quo est haesitatio, nam quandoque cadunt ad uos in hac arte modi hominum cum modis infirmitatum.	And I warn you, lest that in which there is hesitation fall upon you, for sometimes there fall upon you in this art the ways of men together with the ways of illnesses.
Ex eis enim est qui irascitur cum aegritudine sua, et est leuis apud eum mors: propter uehementiam eius quod inuenit ex infirmitate sua et longitudine eius maliciei.	For among them is he who is angered by his illness, and death is light to him; because of the intensity of what he finds from his illness and the length of his malice.
Et cum aegritudine est ex timore quod significat mortem.	And with illness is the fear that signifies death.
Et ex eis est, qui dat tibicensum suum, et ditat te cum eo, sperans sanitatem, et aegritudo eius est perniciosa.	And among them is he who gives his money, and enriches you with it, hoping for health, and his illness is harmful.
Non ergo oportet ut consentiatis ei qui uenit ad uos ex eis, cuius modus est talis.	Therefore, you should not agree with him who comes to you from among them, whose manner is such.
Et sit cautela uestra uehementior, quam cupiditas et uestra rapacitas.	And let your caution be greater than your greed and your rapacity.
Et non praesumatis super aliquid ex illo, nisi post scientiam certam, quae uerificat apud uos illud ad quod peruenit successio laudabilis.	And do not presume upon anything from it, unless after certain knowledge, which verifies for you that to which a praiseworthy success has arrived.
Et utimini in curatione omnium infirmorum uestrorum, prognosticatione et indicatione de eo ad quod conuenienter sit salus.	And use in the treatment of all your sick persons, prognosis and indication of that to which health will be fitting.
In illo namque est uobis adiutorium super acquisitionem famae et gloriae, et memoriae et laudis.	For in that is aid for you in the acquisition of fame and glory, and of memory and praise.
Inspiret uobis Deus o filii, intellectum suum, et non auferat uobis directionem et inspirationem: quoniam illud est in manu eius.	May God inspire you, children, with his understanding, and may he not take away from you direction and inspiration; for it is in his hand.
Et ego quidem ordinaui hoc Capitulum distinguendo per capitula, secundum quod praecessit in capitulo Cauterii, a ceruice usque ad pedes: ut alleuietur uobis quaesitum quod uultis ex eo, et quo indigetis.	And I indeed have arranged this chapter, distinguishing it by chapters, according to what went before in the chapter on Cauteries, from the neck up to the feet, so that your desire and need from it may be alleviated.
¶ De curatione Aquae quae aggregatur in capitibus puerorum.	Concerning the treatment of Water which gathers in the heads of children.
Caput I.	Chapter 1.
Scias, quod haec infirmitas multotiens accidit pueris apud partum: aut quando stringit obstetrix caput pueri absque leuitate.	Know that this illness often happens to children at birth, or when the midwife tightens the child's head without ease.
Et quandeque accidit etiam ex caussa occulta quae non scitur.	And sometimes it happens also from a hidden cause which is not known.
Et ego quidem non uidi hanc aegritudinem in aliis quam in pueris: et ad omnem quem ex eis uidi properauit mors: propter illud ergo uisum est mihi dimittere operationem in ea.	And I myself have not seen this illness in anything other than children, and death has hastened to every one of them whom I have seen afflicted by it; therefore, on account of this observation, it seemed good to me to omit an operation on it.
Et ego quidem uidi ex eis puerum, cuius caput impletum erat aqua, et caput magnificabatur in omni die, donec non poterat sedere super seipsum, propter magnitudinem capitis sui: et humiditas augmentata fuit, donec mortuus est.	And indeed I saw one child among them whose head was filled with water, and the head grew larger every day, until it could not sit upon itself because of the size of its head, and the moisture increased until he died.
Et haec quidem humiditas, aut aggregatur inter cutem et os: aut aggregatur sub osse super sifac.	And this moisture, indeed, either collects between the skin and the bone, or collects under the bone above the surface.
Et operatio in illo, si est humiditas inter cutem et os, et apostema est paruum, tunc oportet ut findas in medio capitis fissura una in latitudine: et sit longitudo fissurae quasi duo nodi, donec currat humiditas.	And if there is moisture between the skin and the bone, and the abscess is small, then it is necessary to make a single incision in the middle of the head, the width of the incision, and the length of the incision should be about two knots, until the moisture flows out.
Et haec est forma spatumilis.	And this is the shape of a lancet.
Si ergo humiditas est magis augmentata, et apostema est maius, tunc pone eas duas fissuras, secundum formam hanc.	If, therefore, the moisture is more increased, and the abscess is larger, then make two incisions, according to this form.
Et si humiditas est sub osse, et signum eius est, quod uides commissuras capitis apertas ab omni parte: et aqua deprimitur quando comprimis eam manu tua ad interiora, et non occultatur tibi illud: tunc oportet ut findas in medio capitis tribus fissuris, secundum hunc modum.	And if the moisture is under the bone, and its sign is that you see the sutures of the head open on every side, and water is forced out when you press it with your hand inwards, and it is not hidden from you: then it is necessary to make three incisions in the middle of the head, according to this method.
Et post incisionem extrahe humiditatem totam.	And after the incision, remove all the moisture.
Deinde stringe fissuras cum pannis et puluillis.	Then bind the incisions with cloths and bandages.
Deinde embroca illud desuper cum uino et oleo usque ad diem quintum.	Then apply a liniment of wine and oil to it until the fifth day.
Deinde solue ligamentum, et cura uulnus cum tentis, et unguentis.	Then loosen the bandage, and treat the wound with tents and ointments.
Et non dimittas stringere caput cum aequalitate.	And do not allow the head to be bound equally tight.
Et ciba infirmum omni cibo sicco paucae humiditatis, usquequo confortetur membrum, et sanetur.	And feed the sick person with all dry food with little moisture, until the limb is strengthened and healed.
Et modus alius incisionis est, ut consideres ubi apparet magnitudo apostematis, et collectio aquae.	And another method of incision is to consider where the size of the abscess and the collection of water appear.
Quoniam quandoque est in occipitio plus, aut in sincipite, aut in dextra, aut in sinistra.	Because sometimes it is more in the back of the head, or in the forehead, or in the right, or in the left.
Ascende ergo cum incisione ubi apparet tibi apostema et impletio aquae: et scinde illud secundum quod tibi possibile est.	Therefore, make the incision where the abscess and collection of water appear to you; and cut it according to what is possible for you.
Et obserua, ne incidas arteriam, et accidat fluxus sanguinis, et moriatur infirmus ex illo fluxu cum euacuatione humiditatis.	And observe, lest you cut an artery, and a flow of blood occur, and the sick person dies from that flow with the evacuation of moisture.
¶ De incisione Arteriarum quae sunt post aures.	Of the incision of arteries which are behind the ears.
Caput II.	Chapter II.
Quando accidunt alicui catarri ad oculos, aut ad pectus, et antiquatur illud, et non confert curatio medicinarum: tunc magis ultima curatio est in illo, incisio harum duarum arteriarum.	When discharges occur to someone in the eyes or chest, and it is prolonged, and treatment with medicines does not help, then the last treatment for that is the incision of these two arteries.
Oportet ergo quando uis incidere eas, ut radat infirmus caput suum.	Therefore, when you wish to incise them, it is necessary that the sick person shave their head.
Deinde frica locum cum panno aspero, ut appareant arteriae.	Then rub the area with a rough cloth, so that the arteries appear.
Deinde stringat infirmus collum suum, cum quolibet panno suo.	Then the sick person should tighten their neck with any cloth they have.
Deinde considera, ubi pulset uena.	Then consider where the vein beats.
Et loca utriusque sunt loca quae sunt post aures depressa: et raro occultatur, nisi in quibusdam hominibus.	And the places of both are the places which are depressed behind the ears: and it is rarely hidden, except in certain people.
Deinde signa cum encaustro super utraque: et incide utramque cum spatumili utrimque acuro, incisione perueniente ad os: et fiat illud per latitudinem capitis.	Then mark with ink over each: and cut each with a scalpel on both sides, the incision reaching the bone; and let it be done across the width of the head.
Et si uis, intromitte spatumile sub arteria, et incide eam ad superiora cum incisione.	And if you wish, insert the scalpel under the artery, and cut it upward with the incision.
Et sit longitudo incisionis quasi duo digiti iuncti.	And the length of the incision be about two fingers joined together.
Nam quando inciditur uena, egreditur sanguis egressione pulsatili, qui salit ad interiora saltu frequenti.	For when a vein is cut, blood flows out with a pulsating discharge, which leaps inward with frequent jumps.
Si autem arteria non apparet sensui, tunc oportet ut mensures ab aure quantitatem spacii trium digitorum.	If, however, the artery is not apparent to the senses, then it is necessary to measure from the ear a space of three fingers' breadth.
Deinde signa cum encaustro, et finde usque ad os.	Then mark with ink, and split it all the way to the mouth.
Et illud quod oportet emittere ex sanguine, est VI uncia et fortasse emittis ex eo plus, aut minus.	And that which must be emitted from the blood is six ounces, and perhaps you emit from it more, or less.
Totum illud secundum quantitatem quae apparet tibi ex uirute infirmi et repletione arteriae eius.	All of that according to the quantity which appears to you from the weakness of the sick person and the fullness of his artery.
Deinde considera ad uulnus.	Then consider the wound.
Tunc si remanet ad os ex sifac aliquid, tunc incide illud, ut non accidat apostema calidum: tunc stringe uulnus cum liciniis ex panno lini.	Then, if anything remains on the mouth from the sifac, then cut it so that a hot abscess does not occur; then bind the wound with strips of linen cloth.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with ointment until it is healed.
¶ De extractione arteriarum, quae sunt in timporibus.	Concerning the extraction of arteries, which are in the temples.
Caput III.	Chapter III.
Quando accidit homini hemicranea antiqua, aut catarri acuti propter humiditates acrimoniales, et caliditate in lacertis timporum, aut soda antiqua, uehemens, et similia illis: et medicatur cum modis curationis medicinae, et non confert illud: tunc experti sumus in his aegritudinibus extractionem arteriarum ex timporibus, aut cauterizationem earum, sicut narrauimus.	When a man experiences chronic headache, or acute catarrhs due to acrid humors, and heat in the temples, or chronic, severe pain, and similar conditions: and if treatment with the methods of medical cure does not help it: then we are experienced in these illnesses in the extraction of arteries from the temples, or cauterization of them, as we have described.
Et modus operationis in extractione earum, est, ut radat infirmus pilos qui sunt in timporibus, et intendat ad arteriam apparentem in timpore.	And the method of operation in extracting them is that the weak person shaves the hair that is in the temples, and directs himself towards the artery appearing in the temple.
Ipsa namque ostenditur tibi ex pulsu suo, et raro occultatur nisi in paucis hominibus, aut uehementia frigoris.	For it is indeed shown to you by its pulse, and is rarely hidden except in a few people, or by the intensity of cold.
Quod si occultatur tibi, tunc stringat infirmus caput suum cum quolibet panno suo: deinde frica locum cum panno aspero.	If it is hidden from you, then let the weak person tighten their head with any cloth of theirs; then rub the place with a rough cloth.
Aut uapora locum cum aqua calida, donec appareat tibi apparitione manifesta.	Or apply vapors to the area with warm water, until it appears to you with clear evidence.
Deinde accipe spatumile, quod paulo ante formaui.	Then take the spatula, which I have previously formed.
Deinde excoria cum eo cutem cum facilitate, donec peruenias ad arteriam.	Then scrape the skin with it easily, until you reach the artery.
Deinde proiice in eam uncinum, et extrahe eam ad superiora, donec extrahas eam ex cute, et facias eam euadere ex tunicis quae sunt sub ea ab omni parte.	Then insert a hook into it, and pull it upwards, until you pull it out of the skin, and cause it to escape from the tissues beneath it on every side.
Si autem arteria est subtilis: tunc inuolue eam cum extremitate uncini.	If however the artery is delicate: then wrap it with the tip of the hook.
Deinde incide ex ea partem secundum quantitatem qua elongentur extremitates eius, et contrahantur, et non accidat fluxus sanguinis.	Then cut off a portion of it according to the amount by which its ends will be extended and contracted, and so that no blood flow occurs.
Nam si non inciditur, et si non abscinditur, non ascendit sanguis penitus.	For if it is not cut, and if it is not severed, the blood does not ascend completely.
Deinde euacua ex sanguine ana VI unci, usque ad .III.	Then evacuate six ounces of blood, up to three.
Quod si arteria est magna: tunc oportet ut liges eam in duobus locis ex filo duplo, forti, ex serico: aut ex chordis alhohod, ut non properet ad ipsam putrefactio ante consolidationem uulneris, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	If the artery is large, then it is necessary to tie it in two places with a strong double thread, of silk or of alhohod cords, so that decay does not rapidly occur at the wound before its healing, and that blood flow does not happen.
Deinde incide superfluitatem, quae est inter duo ligamenta.	Then cut away the excess, which is between the two ligatures.
Fac illud in illa hora, aut post horam aliam.	Do that at that hour, or after another hour.
Et si uis, cauteriza eam cauterio usque ad os, cum cauterio cultellari: donec incidantur extremitates eius, et stabit loco eiusdem operis.	And if you wish, cauterize it with a cautery, even to the bone, with a knife cautery, until its extremities are cut, and it will stand in place of the same work.
Et est melius opus, nisi si infirmus habet febrem, autest calefactae complexionis.	And it is a better work, unless the sick person has a fever or is of a hot complexion.
Quoniam cauterium est ex eis, quae iuuant ad finiendas humiditates.	Because cautery is from among those things that help to finish the humors.
Ergo est melius iuuamentum.	Therefore it is a better help.
Et oportet post extractionem arteriarum, ut impleatur locus cotto antiquo: et ponantur super ipsum puluilli decenter facti.	And it is necessary after the extraction of the arteries, that the place be filled with old cotton: and that cushions made properly be placed upon it.
Et post solutionem curetur cum medicinis siccis, quae faciunt nasci carnem, et cum liciniis, donec sanetur.	And after the removal, it should be treated with dry medicines that cause flesh to grow, and with bandages, until it is healed.
Quod si interim dum operaris accidit fluxus sanguinis ex arteria, tunc propera ad abscindendum eum cum cauterio, aut ut impleas locum cum zegi: et stringe manum tuam, donec abscindatur sanguis.	If meanwhile, while you are operating, a flow of blood from an artery occurs, then hurry to cut it off with a cautery, or to fill the place with zegi, and bind your hand tightly until the blood is cut off.
Quod si nihil ex illis est tibi praesens, tunc pone super locum digitum tuum, donec congeletur sanguis.	If none of those things are present for you, then place your finger on the area until the blood clots.
Et embroca locum cum aqua uehementis frigoris, donec quiescat acuitas, et stringatur secundum quod oportet.	And apply the place with water of extreme cold, until the sharpness subsides, and is bound as is appropriate.
Et ex eo quod est leuius et facilius extractione arteriae, est, ut cauterizes uenam cum hoc cauterio habente duos cultellos: sitque acuitas duorum cultellorum similis almagdatem.	And because what is lighter and easier than extracting an artery is to cauterize the vein with this cautery having two blades, and the sharpness of the two blades should be like an almond.
Verumtamen sunt multo minoris acuitatis, quam duo cultelli.	However, they are of much less sharpness than two blades.
Quoniam si sunt acutae, sicut duo cultelli, properat utrisque frigus: et non incidunt carnem cum uelocitate.	Because if they are sharp, like two blades, the cold hastens with both: and they do not cut flesh with speed.
Cum ergo in eis est aliquantulum grossitudinis, tenetur in eis calor ignis, et abscinditur caro uelociter: cum hoc ergo opus est melius omni opere, et leuius, et facilius.	Therefore, since there is some thickness in them, the heat of the fire is held within them, and the flesh is cut quickly: with this, therefore, the work is better than any other work, and lighter, and easier.
Et sit spacium quod est inter duos cultellos quantitas grossitudinis digiti, postquam tu signas duo loca cum encaustro: et depone utrosque ignitos ualde, donec perueniant ad os, et incidant uenam in duobus locis: ut elongetur quod est inter extremitates eius.	And let the space between the two blades be the thickness of a finger, after you mark the two places with ink; and place both of them intensely hot until they reach the bone, and cut the vein in two places, so that that which is between its ends may be lengthened.
Nam non consolidantur cum hoc cauterio penitus.	For they do not completely consolidate with this cautery.
Et haec est forma cauterii.	And this is the form of cautery.
¶ De cura cursus lachrymarum acutarum assiduarum ab oculis.	Concerning the treatment of acute and persistent tearing from the eyes.
Caput IIII.	Chapter IV.
Quando sunt lachrymae assiduae, et est cursus earum ex uenis, quae sunt super craneum capitis exterius: et non confert in eis aliquid curationis medicinae cum medicinis, et uides faciem infirmi iam rubere, et sentit in fronte sua deambulationem, sicut est deambulatio formicarum: et oculi eius sunt extenuati, humidi, ita quod iam corrosi sunt pili eorum cum corrosione: et calefactae sunt palpebrae eius ex acuitate lachrymarum: tunc antiqui indiguerunt in curatione earum hac operatione, et denominauerunt eam curationem, cum Ense.	When the tears are constant, and their flow is from the veins on the outer skull: and no medical treatment with medicines is effective for them, and you see the face of the sick person already reddened, and he feels a crawling sensation on his forehead, like the crawling of ants: and his eyes are weakened, moist, so that their hairs are already corroded with corrosion: and his eyelids are inflamed from the severity of the tears: then the ancients needed this operation in their treatment, and they named this treatment, with the Knife.
Et est, ut praecipias infirmo radere pilos qui sunt in fronte sua.	And it is necessary to instruct the sick person to shave the hairs on their forehead.
Deinde incide in fronte tres fissuras aequedistantes secundum longitudinem frontis: et sit longitudo fissurae quasi duo digiti, et fissura una sit aequedistans longitudini nasi in medio frontis, et secunda secundum longitudinem parumper a motu lacertorum, et tertia a parte altera: et caue ab incisione arteriarum quae sunt in duobus lateribus: et elonga manum tuam a continuatione duarum mandibularum, et sit spacium omnis incisionis quantitas trium digitorum coniunctorum: et sit tibi frustum spongiae praeparatum, aut panni siccati multi, cum quibus exsicces sanguinem.	Then make three equally spaced incisions along the forehead's length: and the length of each incision should be about two fingers, and one incision should be equidistant to the length of the nose in the middle of the forehead, and the second along the length slightly from the movement of the temples, and the third on the opposite side: and be careful not to cut the arteries which are on either side: and keep your hand away from the continuation of the two lower jaws, and let the space of each incision be the quantity of three joined fingers: and have a piece of sponge prepared, or many dry cloths, with which to absorb the blood.
Deinde intromitte spatumile duarum acutarum extremitatum, cuius mox sequens est forma.	Then insert a spatula with two sharp ends, whose form is as follows.
Ab incisione quae est a parte timporis, usque ad incisionem secundam: et excoria cum eo totam cutem, quae est inter duas incisiones, cum sifac, quod est super os.	From the incision that is by the temple, up to the second incision: and scrape away all the skin which is between the two incisions, with a sifac, which is over the bone.
Deinde fac illud etiam ab incisione media usque ad incisionem secundam.	Then do that also from the middle incision to the second incision.
Deinde extrahe hoc spatumile, et intromitte in incisionem primam iterum instrumentum aliud, quod nominatur cultellare acutum, ab una parte lene, non acutum ab altera parte.	Then withdraw this spatula, and insert into the first incision again another instrument, which is called a sharp scalpel, smooth on one side, not sharp on the other side.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form.
Et pone latus eius acutum uersus carnem annexam cum cute, et latus eius lene uersus os: et impelle ipsum, donec perueniat ad fissuram mediam: et abscinde cum eo omnia uasa, quae descendunt a capite ad oculos: praeter quod continuetur incisio usque ad illud quod apparet de cute.	And place its sharp side towards the flesh attached with the skin, and its smooth side towards the bone: and drive it, until it reaches the middle fissure: and cut with it all the vessels which descend from the head to the eyes: except that the incision continues up to that which appears of the skin.
Deinde fac illud in fissura media usque ad fissuram aliam.	Then do that in the middle fissure up to the other fissure.
Et postquam currit ex sanguine quantitas aequalis, exprime loca ex frustis sanguinis coagulati.	And after a quantity of blood runs equal, express the places from the fragments of coagulated blood.
Deinde pone in omnem fissuram licinium ex cotto ueteri, et pone super eos puluillos imbibitos in uino, et oleo, aut aceto.	Then place in every fissure a linen cloth made from old cotton, and place on them cushions soaked in wine, and oil, or vinegar.
Et uide ut non accidat apostema calidum.	And see that a hot abscess does not occur.
Et in die tertia solue ligamentum, et administra infusionem multam cum aqua tepida.	And on the third day loosen the ligature, and administer much infusion with lukewarm water.
Deinde cura illud ex unguento basilicon, et reliquis quibus curantur uulnera: usquequo sanetur.	Then treat it with basil ointment, and with the other remedies for wounds: until it is healed.
¶ De cura lachrymarum acutarum et catarrorum ad oculos ex interioribus capitis.	Concerning the treatment of acute tears and colds in the eyes from internal parts of the head.
Caput V.	Chapter V.
Quando accidunt alicui catarri acuti, acres, assidui: et uides oculos eius extenuatos, paruos, et iam debilitatus est aspectus eorum: et palpebrae ulceratae, et cadunt pili ex eis, et in profundo capitis est dolor acutus, laedens, et sternutatio consequens: tunc sume ex istis accidentibus, quod illae materiae, et catarri non ueniunt, nisi ex uenis multis.	When acute, harsh, persistent colds afflict someone, and you see his eyes thinned, small, and their appearance already weakened; and the eyelids ulcerated, and hairs fall from them, and there is a sharp, piercing pain deep within the head, and a consequent sneezing; then, from these occurrences, understand that those matters and colds do not arise, unless from many veins.
Et melior curatio in eis est haec.	And the better treatment for them is this.
Et est, ut praecipias infirmo radere frontem suam.	And it is that you should instruct the sick person to shave his forehead.
Deinde incide in eam fissuram unam in medio frontis, aut alterius parumper per latitudinem, et incipe cum fissura a timpore sinistro ad timpus dextrum: et sit incisio usque ad os: et elonga manum tuam a lacertis timporum, qui mouentur apud masticationem: donec quando detegitur os: et exsiccabis totum sanguinem cum spongia.	Then make a single incision in the middle of the forehead, or slightly wider, and begin with the incision from the left temple to the right temple; and let the incision reach the bone; and move your hand away from the temporal muscles, which move during mastication, until the bone is exposed; and you will dry up all the blood with a sponge.
Tunc separa inter duo labia fissurae cum cotto ueteri, aut cum liciniis ex lino.	Then separate the two lips of the incision with an old cloth or with linen strips.
Deinde stringe desuper cum puluillis: et imbibe puluillos cum uino et oleo, ut non accidat apostema calidum.	Then bind it from above with pledgets; and soak the pledgets with wine and oil, so that a hot abscess does not occur.
Et quando soluis illud, et uides quod apostema calidum iam imminuitur: tunc oportet ut frices os, donec incipiat in eo nasci caro.	And when you loosen it, and see that the hot abscess is now diminishing, then it is necessary to rub the bone until flesh begins to grow on it.
Deinde cura ipsum cum regimine exiccatiuo quod facit nasci carnem: sicut si accipias ex farina tritici partes duas, et ex colophonia quatuor partes: et praepares ex eis emplastrum, et administretur ad natiuitatem carnis in istis uulneribus.	Then treat it with a drying regimen that causes flesh to grow; such as if you take two parts of wheat flour and four parts of colophony: and prepare a plaster from them, and administer it for the growth of flesh in these wounds.
¶ De cura eius quod cadit in Aurem.	Concerning the treatment of that which falls into the ear.
Caput VI.	Chapter VI.
Omne Quod in Aurem cadit, est una quatuor specierum: aut lapis mineralis, aut simile lapidi, sicut ferrum, et uitrum: aut est ex planta, sicut est cicer, et fabae: aut est res fluxibilis, sicut aqua, et acetum, et eis similia: aut aliquod animal.	Everything that falls into the ear is one of four kinds: either a mineral stone, or something similar to a stone, such as iron and glass; or it is from a plant, such as a chickpea and beans; or it is a liquid substance, such as water and vinegar, and things like them; or some animal.
Quando ergo cadit in aurem lapis, aut genus lapidis ex eis quae non adduntur, neque crescunt in aure, expone Aurem soli: si ergo uides lapidem, tunc distilla in Aurem aliquid ex oleo uiolato, aut sisamino.	Therefore, when a stone, or a kind of stone, falls into the ear, from among those which do not adhere to, nor grow in, the ear, expose the ear to the sun.  If you then see the stone, distil into the ear some of violet oil, or sesame oil.
Deinde administra extractionem eius, et fac sternutare cum condisi, et opila nares apud aduentum sternutationis, postquam tu ponis in circumitu auris frusta ex pannis, aut lana, et extendis aurem ad superiora.	Then administer its extraction, and make him sneeze with condiments, and close the nostrils at the arrival of the sneeze, after you have placed around the ear fragments of cloth or wool, and have extended the ear upwards.
Multotiens enim egreditur cum hac cura.	For it often departs with this treatment.
Si autem non egreditur, tunc administra extractionem eius cum Gesti, id est, Pizigarolis subtilibus: cuius forma est haec.	If, however, it does not depart, then administer its extraction with forceps, that is, with thin tweezers; the shape of which is this.
Si ergo egreditur cum gesti, est bonum.	If, therefore, it departs with the forceps, it is good.
Et si non, tunc administra extractionem eius cum uncino caeco subtili paucae duplicationis.	And if not, then administer its extraction with a fine single-pronged hook.
Si ergo non egreditur per illud, tunc fac cannulam ex aere, et intromitte extremitatem cannulae in foramen auris multum, et opila quod est in circumitu cannulae cum caera mollificata cum oleo, ut non sit uento uia nisi cannulae: deinde extrahe cum uento tuo attractione forti.	If, therefore, it does not depart through that, then make a tube of bronze, and insert the end of the tube into the ear's cavity deeply, and seal that which is around the tube with softened wax mixed with oil, so that there is no passage by wind except through the tube; then extract with your wind by strong suction.
Multotiens enim egreditur cum eo quod narrauimus.	For many times it departs with that which we have narrated.
Si autem non egreditur hoc modo: tunc accipe ex helkalimbat, aut ex uisco, id est, gluten praeparato, cum quo capiuntur aues, rem modicam: et pone ipsum in extremitate radii postquam tu inuoluis super eam cotum decenter positum: deinde intromitte ipsum in foramen auris cum facilitate, postquam tu exiccas aurem ab humiditate.	If, however, it does not depart in this way, then take from a helkalimbat, or from birdlime, that is, prepared glue, with which birds are caught, a small amount: and place it at the tip of a rod, after you have wrapped a properly positioned rag around it: then insert it into the ear's cavity easily, after you have dried the ear from moisture.
Si ergo non egreditur cum omnibus quae narrauimus, tunc propera ad scindendum, antequam accidat apostema calidum, aut spasmus.	If, therefore, it does not depart with all that we have narrated, then hasten to incision before a hot abscess or spasm occurs.
Et modus fissurae est, ut phlebotomes infirmum in primis in cephalica: et extrahe ei ex sanguine secundum mensuram uirtutis eius.	And the method of incision is, that the phlebotomist, first of all, pierce the cephalic vein, and draw from it blood according to the measure of its strength.
Deinde fac sedere infirmum inter manus tuas, et conuerte aurem eius ad superiora, et finde fissuram paruam in radice auris apud adipem eius in loco depresso ipsi: et sit fissura lunaris figurae, donec peruenias ad lapidem: deinde aufer eum cum eo, quod est tibi possibile ex instrumentis.	Then make the sick person sit between your hands, and turn his ear upwards, and make a small incision at the root of the ear at its fatty, depressed area; and let the incision be crescent-shaped until you reach the stone; then remove it with whatever instruments are possible for you.
Deinde sue fissuram ab hora tua cum uelocitate, et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	Then stitch the incision with your skill quickly, and care for it until it heals.
Quod si res cadens in aurem est ex uno granorum, quae crescunt, et inflantur: tunc administra extractionem eius.	If the thing falling into the ear is one of the grains that grow and swell, then administer its extraction.
Si autem non obedit tibi ad exitum, tunc accipe spatumile tenue, subtile, secundum hanc formam.	If, however, it does not yield to you for extraction, then take a thin, subtle spatula, according to this shape.
Et administra cum eo abscisionem illius speciei ex granis, quae cadunt in aurem, et non facias illud, quando tu cogitas, quod illud granum iam humectatum est per uaporem auris, donec ponis ipsum frusta multa: deinde extrahe ea cum uncinis, aut cum gesti subtili, aut cum suctione, sicut diximus, nam extractio eius alleuiatur.	And administer with it the removal of that kind of grain that falls into the ear, and do not do it when you think that the grain is already moistened by the ear's vapor, until you put many small pieces on it; then extract them with hooks, or with a fine probe, or with suction, as we said, for its extraction is thus eased.
In aqua autem quae ingreditur in aurem, oportet ut utatur infirmus sternutatione cum condisi in primis: et iam impleuit aurem suam cum aliquanto cotto ueteri: et est iacens super illam aurem, in qua est aqua.	However, in water that enters the ear, the patient must use sneezing with condiments at first; and already he has filled his ear with some old lint; and he lies on the ear in which the water is.
Si ergo egreditur per illud, est bonum.	If therefore it comes out through that, it is good.
Et si non: tunc accipe lapides multos, secundum longitudinem digiti, tenues, lenes, et calefac eos cum igne parumper, et intromittat infirmus ex eis unum in foramen auris suae: et saliat super pedem suum unum ex illa parte, et percutiat cum lapide alio super lapidem qui est in aure.	And if not, then take many stones, according to the length of a finger, thin, smooth, and heat them a little with fire, and let the patient insert one of them into the hole of his ear; and let him hop on one foot on that side, and strike with another stone the stone that is in the ear.
Non ergo cesset facere illud cum lapide et lapide, donec egrediatur tota aqua.	Therefore, he must not cease doing that with stone and stone, until all the water comes out.
Et iam egreditur aqua ita, ut accipias ex parpyro, aut ex iunco unum, et intromittas extremitatem eius unam in aurem: et accendas extremitatem alteram cum igne, donec comburatur plurimum eius.	And now the water comes out so that you take one from papyrus or reed, and insert one end of it into the ear; and set fire to the other end, until most of it is burned.
Deinde itera iuncum alium, et fac illud multotiens, donec egrediatur tota aqua: et extrahe ipsam cum cannula secundum quod praemissum est in lapide.	Then again another reed, and do it many times, until all the water comes out; and extract it with a cannula as was previously described with the stone.
In extractione autem animalis intrantis in eam, si est parui corporis, ut pulex, et ei simile, cura ipsum sicut dixi in diuisione.	In extracting an animal that has entered it, if it is of small body, such as a flea, and similar to it, treat it as I said in the division.
Sed si est corporis magni, quod appareat sensui: tunc administra extractionem eius cum gesti, et uncinis: et res eius est facilior omnibus, quae tenentur in aure.	But if it is of large body, apparent to the senses, then administer its extraction with forceps and hooks; and its removal is easier than all those held in the ear.
In extractione autem uermis generati in aure, quando curas eum cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et in tractatu distilationum, et non confert curatio tua: tunc oportet ut aspicias aurem in sole.	In the extraction of a worm generated in the ear, when you treat it with what we said in the division and in the treatise on distillations, and your treatment does not help: then you must look at the ear in the sun.
Si ergo apparet illic aliquid ex uermibus, tunc extrahe illud cum gesti, aut cum uncinis subtilibus.	If therefore anything of the worms appears there, then extract it with forceps or with fine hooks.
Si autem non apparet illic aliquid, tunc accipe cannulam, cuius haec est forma, stricta inferius, ampla superius: et intromitte extremitatem subtilem in aurem secundum quantitatem quod tolerat eam infirmus: deinde suge cum ea suctione forti.	If however nothing appears there, then take a cannula, of which this is the shape, narrow at the bottom, wide at the top: and insert the thin end into the ear according to the amount that the sick person tolerates it; then suck with it with a strong suction.
Fac illud multotiens, donec egrediantur omnes uermes.	Do this repeatedly until all the worms come out.
Si autem non obediunt tibi ad exitum, tunc opila circumitum cannulae cum caera, sicut dixi in lapide.	If however they do not obey you for exit, then smear the circumference of the cannula with wax, as I said in the section on stones.
Quod si non egrediuntur cum eo quod diximus: tunc administra distillationes quas iam experti sunt antiqui in interfectione uermium: et inuenies illud in tractatu distillationum.	If they do not come out with what we have said, then administer the distillations that the ancients have already experienced in the killing of worms: and you will find it in the treatise on distillations.
Et sit effusio tua qua effundis olea et medicinas in aurem cum hoc instrumento, cuius forma depicta est hic.	And let your pouring, by which you pour oil and medicines into the ear with this instrument, the shape of which is depicted here.
Sicut uides fac ipsum ex argento, aut aere, inferius strictum, in quo sit foramen paruum, amplum superius.	As you see, make it from silver, or bronze, narrowed below, with a small hole, and wide above.
Sit ergo ut impellens quod est in concauitate cannulae, sit ex aere decenter factum.	Let the pusher, which is in the concavity of the cannula, be made of bronze well.
Et si uis, accipe radium, et inuolue in extremitate eius cottum inuolutione decenti: deinde proiice oleum, aut succum, aut quod uis ex istis medicinis in cannulam: et ipsa sit in aure: deinde intromitte radium cum cotto desuper, et exprime ipsum manu tua compressione temperata, donec impellatur oleum in concauitate auditus, et sentiat ipsum infirmus interius: et illud quod infunditur in aurem, sit iam calefactum cum igne parumper: et caue ne sit res quae distillatur in eam frigida ualde: medicinae enim non tolerant illud.	And if you wish, take a rod, and wrap a cloth around the end of it in a suitable wrapping; then pour oil, or juice, or whatever medicine you wish from these, into the cannula; and let it be in the ear; then insert the rod with the cloth from above, and squeeze it with your hand with moderate pressure, until the oil is driven into the concavity of the ear, and the afflicted person feels it inside; and that which is poured into the ear should already be warmed with fire for a short time; and be careful that the substance being distilled into it is not very cold, for the medicines do not tolerate that.
¶ De cura opilationis accidentis Auri.	Concerning the treatment of sudden ear blockage.
Caput VII.	Chapter VII.
Quandoque egrediuntur quidam infantes ex uentribus matrum suarum non perforati.	Sometimes infants emerge from their mothers' wombs unperforated.
Et iam accidit etiam quibusdam hominibus opilatio in meatu Auris a uulnere, aut carne nata in ea.	And sometimes blockage in the ear canal occurs in people due to a wound, or flesh grown in it.
Et haec opilatio quandoque fit in profundo foraminis Auris, quam non consequitur uisus: et quandoque accidit ad exteriora foraminis parum, et consequitur eam uisus.	And this blockage sometimes occurs deep within the ear opening, which is not followed by sight; and sometimes it happens close to the outer edge of the opening, and sight follows it.
Illa ergo quae accidit in profundo Auris, et quam non comprehendit aspectus, est in pluribus dispositionibus difficilis sanationis.	Therefore, that which occurs deep within the ear, and which sight does not encompass, is in many cases difficult to heal.
Et in illa quam consequitur uisus, oportet ut ponas Aurem infirmi in sole, et aspicias in ea: tunc si uides opilationem apparentem, aperi eam cum spatumili subtili, cuius forma est haec quae sequitur, sit extremitas eius in qua sit quaedam latitudo parua, cuius quaedam pars sit acuta: et reliquum spatumile sit duarum laterum lenium: ut non laedat aurem.	And in that which is followed by sight, you should place the patient's ear in the sun, and look into it. Then, if you see the blockage appearing, open it with a thin probe, whose shape is as follows: its tip should have a small width, one part of which is sharp, and the rest of the probe should be of two smooth sides, so as not to injure the ear.
Si ergo opilatio est a carne nata in meatu auris: tunc tene eam cum uncino subtili, et incide eam cum facilitate uehementi, donec auferatur tota caro.	If, therefore, the blockage is from flesh grown in the ear canal, then grasp it with a fine hook, and cut it with a forceful ease, until all the flesh is removed.
Quod si opilatio est in profundo auris: tunc accipe radium subtilem, lenem, et calefac ipsum cum igne parumper: deinde mitte ipsum in meatum auris.	If the blockage is deep within the ear, then take a thin, smooth rod and warm it slightly with fire; then insert it into the ear canal.
Si ergo senseris opilationem cum eo, quod inuenit infirmus cum grauitate auditus, conare apertionem eius cum facilitate: et caue, ne uulneres neruos auris.	If therefore you perceive the blockage, with the patient experiencing a difficulty in hearing, attempt its opening with care, and beware of injuring the ear's nerves.
Deinde pone in aurem licinium secundum quantitatem amplitudinis foraminis, quod inuoluisti in unguento aegyptio: fac illud aliquot diebus, donec sis securus de consolidatione uulneris.	Then place a linen pad, according to the size of the opening you have created, which you have soaked in Egyptian ointment; do this for several days until you are certain of the wound's healing.
Aut accipe licinium, et infunde ipsum in aqua rosata, et pulueriza super ipsum zegi tritum, et utere ipso.	Or take a linen pad and soak it in rosewater, and sprinkle crushed zegi upon it, and use it.
Quod si uides aurem iam apostemari: tunc oportet ut extrahas licinium, et permittas ipsum cum licinio alio, quod inuolues in caeroto quod sit factum cum oleo rosato, donec sedetur apostema calidum: deinde cura ipsum usquequo sanetur.	If you see that the ear is already abscessed, then it is necessary to remove the linen pad, and to apply another linen pad soaked in cerote made with rose oil, until the hot abscess subsides; then treat it until it is healed.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis: tunc submerge spongiam, aut pannos in aqua frigida, et pone super eam aurem: et utere reliqua curatione, quae abscindit fluxum sanguinis praedicta in tractatu distillationum.	If, however, a hemorrhage occurs, then immerse a sponge or cloths in cold water, and apply it to the ear; and use the remaining treatment, which cuts off the bleeding previously described in the treatise on distillations.
¶ De cura Altheli palpebrarum.	Concerning the treatment of the eyelids of Altheli.
Caput VIII.	Chapter VIII.
Isti Althelil qui accidunt in Palpebris oculi, quandoque sunt humidi, et sunt sicci.	These afflictions of the eyelids, which occur in the eye, are sometimes moist, and sometimes dry.
Oportet ergo ut teneas eos cum tenaliis: aut cum uncino, et incidas eos cum spatumili a radicibus suis.	Therefore, it is necessary to grasp them with forceps, or with a hook, and to cut them with a scalpel from their roots.
Deinde pone super loca zegi tritum.	Then place pounded zegi on the affected areas.
Si autem ex eis fluat sanguis, tunc cauteriza eos cum cauterio lenticulari subtili.	If blood flows from them, then cauterize them with a fine lenticular cautery.
Et cauterizare eos, est melius post incisionem.	And to cauterize them is better after the incision.
Multotiens enim redeunt quando remanet ex radicibus suis aliquid.	For they often return when something remains from their roots.
Et quando cauterizantur cum igne, comburuntur illae radices, et non redeunt.	And when they are cauterized with fire, those roots are burned, and they do not return.
¶ De cura Grandinum palpebrarum oculi.	Concerning the treatment of granulations of the eyelids of the eye.
Caput IX.	Chapter IX.
Multotiens accidit in palpebris aliquid quod assimilatur Crandini in fortitudine sua, et sua duricie, et propter illud nominatur Grando: et est aggregatio humiditatis grossae in palpebra superiore, et palpebra inferiore.	Often something occurs on the eyelids that is similar to granulation in its strength and hardness, and because of this it is called granulation: and it is a collection of thick moisture on the upper eyelid and the lower eyelid.
Operatio ergo in eis est, ut consideres tunc, si est Grando procedens in eo, quod apparet de palpebra, et mouentur ad omnem partem, et res eius est facilis.	Therefore the operation on them is that you should consider then, if it is a granulation growing on that which appears of the eyelid, and it moves to every part, and its matter is easy.
Finde ergo super eam fissura per latitudinem.	Therefore make a slit over it in width.
Deinde excoria eam ab omni parte cum facilitate, donec euadat.	Then scrape it from every side with ease, until it comes out.
Deinde suspende eam cum uncino, et abscinde ipsam.	Then suspend it with a hook and cut it off.
Si autem non praeparatur tibi abscisio eius, nisi postquam tu penetras palpebram cum incisione parumper, tunc nocet infirmo illud in aliquo.	If, however, its excision is not prepared for you unless after you pierce the eyelid with a small incision, then that harms the sick person in some way.
Quod si fissura est magna: tunc aggrega ipsam cum sutura: et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	If the slit is large, then collect it with sutures and treat it until it heals.
Et si est parua, non superueniet tibi malum ex ea.	And if it is small, no harm will come to you from it.
Vnguentum enim restaurat ipsam, et incarnat eam.	For ointment restores it and makes it flesh again.
Et si grando est decliuis ad interiora auris uersus superficiem intrinsecam, tunc inuersa palpebram, et suspende grandinem cum uncino: praeter quod indigeas incisione, et preme eam ab omni parte.	And if the growth is sloping towards the inner surface of the ear, then invert the eyelid, and suspend the growth with a hook; besides which, you will need an incision, and press it from every side.
Quod si elongatur palpebra per incisionem, non nocet illud in aliquo.	If the eyelid is prolonged by incision, that will not harm it in any way.
Deinde ablue oculum post incisionem grandinis, cum aqua salsa: et cura locum cum eo quod incarnat, donec sanetur infirmus.	Then wash the eye after the incision of the growth with salty water, and treat the place with that which makes it flesh, until the sick person is healed.
¶ De cura Axirnath palpebrarum.	Concerning the treatment of eyelid growths.
Caput X.	Chapter X.
Axirnath est adeps qui generatur in tunicis palpebrae superioris: et plurimum quidem accidit illud pueris: et ipsum grauat oculos eorum, et accidunt eis catarri in matutinis, et non possunt intueri lumen solis, propterea, quod lachrymae properant ad eos, et propter illud uides eos discumbere super facies suas semper, et super eas dormiunt, et sunt palpebrae eorum sub superciliis humidae, quas iam cooperuit inflatio: et eminentia quidem Axirnath apparens est oculo, et quando tu premis locum cum digitis tuis, sentis Axirnath inter eos.	Axirnath is a fat that is produced in the membranes of the upper eyelid; it most often occurs in children.  It weighs down their eyes, and they suffer from morning catarrh, and cannot look at sunlight because tears run to them.  Because of this, you see them always lying on their faces, and they sleep on them; and their eyelids, which are now swollen, are damp beneath their eyebrows.  The prominence of Axirnath is visible to the eye, and when you press the area with your fingers, you feel Axirnath between them.
Et modus operationis eius est, ut ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo.	And the method of its operation is that the sick person should place his head in your lap.
Deinde accipe pannum lini, et praepara in eo licinia, et fac ex illo licinio circulum secundum quantitatem quod continet Axirnath ab omni parte.	Then take a linen cloth and prepare some threads on it, and make a circle from that thread equal to the size of the Axirnath on all sides.
Deinde pone eum super eam, et preme cum digitis tuis ab omni parte, ut aggregetur Axirnath in medio circuli.	Then place it on top of it, and press with your fingers on all sides, so that the Axirnath is gathered in the middle of the circle.
Deinde finde in medio illius humiditatis cum spatumili incidente fissuras per latitudinem, et non sit fissura maior illa quae fit in phlebotomia in profundo.	Then, with a lancet, make incisions into the middle of that moisture, across its width, and do not make the incision larger than that which occurs in deep phlebotomy.
Aut oportet ut findas cutem totam, donec peruenias ad Axirnath in pluribus enim dispositionibus procedit Axirnath ex fissura secundum formam frusti pinguedinis albae.	Or it is necessary that you pierce the entire skin, until you reach the Axirnath; for in many ways the Axirnath proceeds from the incision, according to the form of a piece of white fat.
Extrahe ergo eam cum panno, quem infiltrasti inter digitos tuos ad exteriora: et tu reuoluis manum tuam ad dextram et sinistram, donec dispergatur: et caue, ne addas in fissura, ut non peruenias cum spatumili ad oculum, et laedas eum.	Therefore extract it with the cloth, which you have inserted between your fingers on the outside; and you will turn your hand to the right and left until it is dispersed; and beware, lest you press into the incision, so that you do not reach the eye with the lancet, and injure it.
Si autem non appareat tibi Axirnath in principio fissurae, tu addas in fissura parum cum facilitate, donec procedat Axirnath.	However, if the Axirnath does not appear at the beginning of the incision, you should gently add to the incision until the Axirnath comes forth.
Deinde extrahe eam, sicut diximus.	Then extract it, as we said.
Deinde submerge pannos in aceto et aqua, et pone eos super locum, et stringe eum cum puluillis.	Then immerse cloths in vinegar and water, and place them upon the place, and bind it with bandages.
Et ex hominibus sunt qui terunt salem, et ponunt ipsum in concauitate fissurae, ut liquefiat quod remansit ex illa humiditate.	And there are men who grind salt and place it in the concavity of the incision, so that what remains of that moisture may liquefy.
Deinde cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	Then treat it until it heals.
Si autem accidat in loco apostema calidum, tune cura ipsum cum emplastris sedatiuis, donec sanetur.	If however a hot abscess occurs in the place, then treat it with sedative plasters until it heals.
¶ De modis Ataxmir oculi, id est, cum palpebra mollificatur oculi, unde fit ut rugetur sicut non debet.	Concerning the methods for Ataxmir of the eye, that is, when the eyelid of the eye softens, whence it happens that it wrinkles in an improper manner.
Caput XI.	Chapter XI.
Quando nascuntur in palpebris oculi pili additi praeter cursum sub pilis naturalibus, et antiquantur: tunc ipsi nocent oculo, et faciunt accidere modos aegritudinum, sicut lachrymas assiduas, et mollificationem palpebrarum, et albuginem, donec fit illud caussa destructionis oculi.	When additional hairs grow in the eyelids, beyond the natural hair follicles, and grow old, they harm the eye and cause various ailments, such as persistent tears, softening of the eyelids, and white discoloration, until it becomes the cause of the eye's destruction.
Et Ataxmir quidem oculi curatur secundum quatuor modos.	And indeed, Ataxmir of the eye is treated according to four methods.
Aut per cauterium cum igne.	Or by cauterization with fire.
Aut cum medicina acuta, secundum quod praemissum est in capitulo cauterii.	Or with a sharp medicine, according to what was previously stated in the chapter on cauterization.
Aut curatur Ataxmir per incisionem et suturam.	Or Ataxmir is cured by incision and suture.
Aut per cannas, secundum quod ego dicam.	Or by probes, as I will say.
Oportet ut ponas caput infirmi in sinu tuo.	You should place the head of the sick person in your bosom.
Deinde conuerte palpebram oculi manu tua sinistra.	Then turn the eyelid of the eye with your left hand.
Si ergo conuertitur, bonum est.	If therefore it turns, it is good.
Et si non: intromitte acum in eam, in qua sit filum ab inferiori parte palpebrae, et fac penetrare acum cum filo desuper, et sit illud prope pilos ipsos, id est, prope marginem palpebrae, in quo nascuntur pili: et trahe filum ad superiora cum palpebra, et conuerte eam cum radio.	And if not: insert a needle into it, in which there is a thread from the lower part of the eyelid, and cause the needle with the thread to penetrate from above, and let it be near the hairs themselves, that is, near the edge of the eyelid where the hairs sprout; and pull the thread upwards with the eyelid, and turn it with a probe.
Deinde finde in interiori parte palpebrae sub pilis additis cum spatumili incidente a lachrymali maiore usque ad lachrymale minus.	Then find, in the inner part of the eyelid beneath the hairs, with a spatula sliding from the larger tear duct to the smaller tear duct.
Deinde extrahe filum, et pone sub palpebra puluillum paruum ex cotto, aut panno: deinde signa super palpebram cum encaustro, quod sit sicut figura folii myrti.	Then pull out the thread, and place under the eyelid a small cushion of cotton, or cloth; then mark the eyelid with ink, which should be like the shape of a myrtle leaf.
Verumtamen oportet, ut fit figura secundum quantitatem et eleuationem palpebrae: quoniam iam diuersificatur illud in hominibus.	However, it is necessary that the shape be according to the size and elevation of the eyelid, since it is already diversified in humans.
Ex eis enim est, qui indiget ut incidatur ex palpebra quantitas magna, secundum quantitatem quae mollificatur a palpebra.	For among them is he who needs that a large amount be cut from the eyelid, according to the amount which softens from the eyelid.
Deinde cum spatumili finde super duas lineas quas signasti, et incipe a lachrymali maiore usque ad lachrymale minus, et sit fissura una prope pilos naturales, sicut est grossitudo radii.	Then, with a spatula, find above the two lines you marked, and begin from the larger tear duct to the smaller tear duct, and let the slit be near the natural hairs, as is the thickness of a ray.
Deinde intromitte uncinum in uno duorum angulorum cutis.	Then insert the hook into one of the two corners of the skin.
Deinde excoria ipsam totam.	Then scrape off the entire thing.
Deinde aggrega cum sutura duo labia, cum acu et filo lana subtili: et absterge sanguinem, et fac adhaerere quod superfluit ex filis super duo supercilia, cum quibusdam rebus inuiscantibus, si uis facere illud: et si non, non cures.	Then stitch together the two lips with a needle and fine wool thread; and wipe away the blood, and make the excess thread adhere above the two eyebrows, with certain invisible things, if you wish to do so; and if not, do not bother.
Deinde dimitte suturam et fila usque ad tres dies, aut quatuor: postea cura illud.	Then leave the stitches and threads for up to three or four days; afterward, treat it.
Et si uis, dimitte uulnus absque sutura, et cura ipsum cum eo, quod exsiccat et constringit.	And if you wish, leave the wound without stitches, and treat it with that which dries and constricts it.
Nam palpebra eleuatur apud sigillationem uulneris et aggregationem eius: sed futura est melior.	For the eyelid is raised by the sealing and stitching of the wound: but it will be better.
Hunc modum curandi Ataxmir docuerunt antiqui.	The ancients taught this method of treatment.
Verumtamen in eo est sollicitudo super infirmum, et est ex bona operatione, et non est in eo timor.	However, there is concern for the sick person in it, and it is from good operation, and there is no fear in it.
Et modus alius est in Ataxmir etiam: et est, ut signes super palpebram figuram, quae sit sicut figura folii myrti, sicut narrauimus.	And another method is in Ataxmir also: and it is that you mark on the eyelid a figure, which is like the figure of a myrtle leaf, as we have recounted.
Deinde eleua palpebram cum tribus uncinis separatis, aut aggregatis, secundum formam hanc quae sequitur, deinde incide quod superfluit cum forficibus paruis, secundum hanc formam, cum aequalitate incisionis.	Then raise the eyelid with three separate hooks, or joined together, according to this following form, then cut what is superfluous with small scissors, according to this form, with evenness of incision.
Si autem non est tibi possibile tenere uncinum, et non aequatur illud: tunc accipe acum in qua sit filum, et intromitte ipsum in medio figurae: et intromitte filum aliud prope lachrymale maius, et filum secundum prope lachrymale minus: et aggrega inter digitos tuos fila cum aequalitate.	If however it is not possible for you to hold the hook, and it is not made equal: then take a needle in which there is thread, and insert it into the middle of the figure; and insert another thread near the larger tear duct, and a second thread near the smaller tear duct; and join the threads together between your fingers with equality.
Deinde eleua manum tuam eleuatione aequali: et eleua cutem super quam est signatum cotum, sicut narrauimus.	Then raise your hand with equal elevation; and raise the skin upon which the sign for the cut has been marked, as we have recounted.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris cum sutura: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then join the two lips of the wound with sutures; and treat it until it is healed.
Si uero accidat apostema apud incisionem tuam, aut fissuram tuam: seda illud apostema cum caeroto, et his similibus, ex unguentis sedantibus.	If however an abscess occurs at your incision, or your fissure: soothe that abscess with cauterization, and similar things, from soothing ointments.
Et quandoque accidit palpebrae etiam, ut conuertantur pili eius.	And sometimes it happens to the eyelid also, that its hairs turn.
Oportet ergo ut utaris in ea quod diximus in incisione: sed sutura utrisque magis est artificialis.	Therefore it is necessary that you use what we said about the incision; but sutures are more artificial for both.
¶ De cura Ataxmir cum cannis.	Concerning the treatment of Ataxmir with reeds.
ET Est, ut conuertas palpebram, et scindas fissuram quae est deintus, secundum quod narraui.	And you are to turn the eyelid, and cut the fissure which is within, according to what I have described.
Deinde arte fac duas cannas, aut duo ligna subtilia: quarum longitudo sit secundum longitudinem palpebrae, et latitudo earum sit minor latitudine spatumilis: et tu iam incidisti in extremitatibus utriusque ab utrisque partibus ubi tenes fila.	Then artfully make two reeds, or two thin pieces of wood; whose length be according to the length of the eyelid, and their width be less than the width of the spatula; and you have already incised at the extremities of each from both sides where you hold the threads.
Deinde aggrega utramque cum subtilitate super illud quod superfluit ex palpebra oculi, et stringe duas cannas ab utrisque partibus strictura forti, et dimitte eam diebus aliquot.	Then carefully attach each one to that which is superfluous of the eyelid, and bind the two reeds from both sides with a strong ligature, and leave it for a few days.
Cutis enim stricta morietur, et denigrabitur, et putrefiet, donec cadet per se.	For the skin being constricted will die, and become black, and putrefy, until it falls off of itself.
Si ergo tardatur, tunc incide eam cum forficibus.	If therefore it is delayed, then cut it with scissors.
Deinde cura eam, donec sanetur.	Then care for it until it is healed.
Cum ergo consolidatur, eleuatur palpebra: et non pungunt pili.	When therefore it is consolidated, the eyelid is raised: and the hairs do not prick.
Et haec est forma duarum cannarum, quas facies secundum hanc figuram, et quantitatem in longitudinem et latitudinem.	And this is the form of two canes, which you shall make according to this figure, and quantity in length and breadth.
¶ De eleuatione pilorum pungentium in oculo cum acu.	Concerning the raising of pricking hairs in the eye with a needle.
Caput XII.	Chapter XII.
Operatio in illo est, ut accipias acum subtilem, et intromittas in eam filum ex serico subtile, lene.	The operation in it is that you shall take a fine needle, and introduce into it a fine, soft silk thread.
Deinde aggreges extremitates eius, et nodes utramque nodo subtili ualde: et sit longitudo filorum palmus unus.	Then you shall tie its ends, and make a very small knot on each end: and let the length of the threads be one palm.
Deinde compone in Alinxotati filum aliud subtile sub eo in breui, et noda extremitates eius si uis.	Then place another fine thread underneath it in a short section, and tie its ends if you wish.
Deinde ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo, et sit prope solem ut declaretur operatio: quoniam est operatio subtilis, uel minuta.	Then let the patient place his head in your bosom, and let it be near the sun so that the operation may be clear, because it is a delicate or minute operation.
Deinde intromitte acum cum alinxotati in radicem palpebrae, et fac eam penetrare in palpebram festinanter, donec extrahas eam desuper pilum naturalem.	Then introduce the needle with the alinxotati into the root of the eyelid, and make it penetrate the eyelid quickly, until you draw it out above the natural hair.
Deinde trahe pilum usque supra alinxotati: et intromitte in alinxotati illum pilum: si est unus, aut duo, aut tres, non plures.	Then pull the hair up above the alinxotati, and introduce that hair into the alinxotati: if it is one, or two, or three, not more.
Deinde trahe manum tuam cum eo, donec egrediatur pilus cum alinxotati in palpebra cum pilo naturali.	Then pull your hand with it, until the hair comes out with the alinxotati into the eyelid with the natural hair.
Si autem trahatur alinxotati, et non egrediatur pilus cum ea: trahes alinxotati ad inferiora, cum filo quod tu composuisti in ea, donec egrediatur alinxotati ex foramine superiori, et uideas eam uisione oculi: tunc enim trahes alinxotati, et filum: et extrahe utraque, et claude oculum: et dimitte ipsum clausum duobus diebus, aut tribus, donec adhaereat pilus loco suo, et nascatur super ipsum caro.	However, if the alinxotati is pulled and the hair does not come out with it, pull the alinxotati downwards, with the thread that you have placed in it, until the alinxotati comes out of the upper opening, and you see it with the vision of the eye.  Then you will pull the alinxotati and the thread and remove both, and close the eye.  And leave it closed for two days or three, until the hair adheres to its place and flesh grows over it.
Quod si pilus est breuis, tunc aut associa ei pilum longum ex pilis naturalibus, et eleuatur cum eo: aut dimitte ipsum, donec elongetur post spacium, et tunc eleua ipsum.	If the hair is short, then either associate a long hair from the natural hairs with it, and lift it with it, or leave it until it lengthens after a time, and then lift it.
¶ De cura Alxatrati quae accidit in palpebra superiori.	Concerning the treatment of Alxatrati that occurs in the upper eyelid.
Caput XIII.	Chapter XIII.
Quando accidit oculo haec Alxatrati, nominatur Leporina.	When this Alxatrati happens to the eye, it is called Leporina.
Et haec Alxatrati est aut naturalis, aut accidentalis.	And this Alxatrati is either natural or accidental.
Accidentalis ergo fit ex consolidatione uulneris, aut sectionis, aut cauterii, et similium illis.	Accidental, therefore, it arises from the consolidation of a wound, or incision, or cautery, and things similar to those.
Et modus operationis in ea est, ut tu findas illam consolidationem, et ut separes labia eius, et ponas in eo quod est inter ea licinium ex lino, et liges eam, donec sanetur.	And the method of treatment in it is, that you find that consolidation, and that you separate its lips, and place in that which is between them a linen strip, and bind it until it is healed.
Et non oportet, ut utaris in curatione eius rebus quae exiccant et constringunt: nam si tu facis illud, redit Alxatrati deterior quam fuit: imo utere in ea rebus quae mollificant, sicut foenumgraecum: et embroca cum aqua, in qua cocta sit althea, semen lini: et unguento dyaquilon, quod liquefactum sit cum aliquo ex oleis: et inuolue cum eo licinium, et cura cum eo.	And it is not appropriate to use in its treatment things that dry and constrict: for if you do that, the Alxatrati returns worse than it was: rather, use in it things that soften, such as Greek hay: and embrocate with water in which althea, flax seed, has been cooked: and with dyaquilon ointment, which has been liquefied with some oil: and wrap with it a linen strip, and treat with it.
Et thesaurus curationis tuae est, ut coneris omni ingenio, ut non consolidetur, secundum formam quae fuit in primis.	And the treasure of your treatment is to strive with all your ingenuity so that it does not consolidate according to the form it first had.
Et haec quidem operatio quam diximus, non est nisi quaedam rectificatio Alxatrati, ut non redeat forma loci secundum quod fuit omnino.	And this operation, which we have described, is nothing more than a certain rectification of the Alxatrati, so that the form of the place does not return according to what it was entirely.
¶ De cura Alxatrati quae fit in palpebra inferiori, et est rugatio uel contractio sursum ad dextrum et sinistrum.	Concerning the treatment of Alxatrati that occurs in the lower eyelid, and is a wrinkling or contraction upwards to the right and left.
Caput XIIII.	Chapter XIV.
Haec Alxatrati quae fit inferius, est quae uere nominatur Alxatrati.	This Alxatrati, which occurs below, is truly called Alxatrati.
Et est naturalis, et est accidentalis.	And it is natural, and it is accidental.
Et accidentalis fit ex uulnere, aut fissura, aut cauterio, et illis similibus.	And the accidental one occurs from a wound, or a fissure, or a cauterization, and similar things.
Et uia operationis in ea est, ut accipias acum, in qua sit filum duplum, et tingas eam in carnem, et facias eam penetrare a lachrymali sinistro usque ad lachrymale dextrum, donec perueniat filum in duabus extremitatibus carnis.	And the method of operation in it is, that you take a needle, in which there is a double thread, and you dip it into the flesh, and you make it penetrate from the left tear duct to the right tear duct, until the thread reaches in two extremities of the flesh.
Deinde extende carnem ad superiora cum acu, et incide eam cum spatumili lato.	Then extend the flesh upwards with the needle, and cut it with a wide spatula.
Si ergo redit figura palpebrae secundum quod oportet, est bonum.	If therefore the eyelid's shape returns as it should, it is good.
Et si non, accipe radium, et pone ipsum in fissuram, et conuerte cum eo palpebram: et finde duas fissuras in latere interiore palpebrae, et sint extremitates duarum fissurarum ex duobus angulis incisionis, donec concurrant et fiat ex eis angulus: donec quando aggregantur fiat figura earum haec figura, et est litera lauda graeca.	And if not, take a spatula, and place it in the fissure, and turn the eyelid with it; and make two fissures in the inner side of the eyelid, and let the extremities of the two fissures be from the two angles of the incision, until they meet and a corner is made from them; until when they are brought together, their shape becomes this shape, and it is the Greek letter lambda.
Deinde aufer illam carnem per quantitatem, quod est latus eius acutum inferius, ab eo quod sequitur palpebram.	Then remove that flesh by the amount that is its acute lower side, from that which follows the eyelid.
Deinde aggrega partes separatas: sue eam cum filo lanae.	Then bring together the separated parts; sew it with wool thread.
Deinde cura eas cum eo quod diximus, de medicinis mollificantibus, et liciniis, donec sanentur.	Then treat them with what we have said, about softening medicines, and bandages, until they are healed.
Et si Alxatrati accidat ex fissura, et sutura, aut cauterio: tunc oportet ut findas fissura plana sub pilis palpebrarum, etiam secundum quod praecessit.	And if a laceration occurs from the fissure, and suture, or cautery: then it is necessary that you make a flat fissure under the hairs of the eyelids, even according to what has preceded.
Deinde separa inter duo labia cum licinio, secundum quod diximus.	Then separate between the two lips with a bandage, according to what we have said.
Et summa sermonis de cura Alxatrati, quando est desuper, aut inferius, est, ut currat in ea operatio, secundum quod praeparatur ex forma Alxatrati.	And the sum of the discourse concerning the treatment of Alxatrati, when it is superior or inferior, is that the operation should proceed according to the preparation of the form of Alxatrati.
Ipsa namque est multarum diuersitatum in forma: et artifex prudens praeparat ingenium cum quocunque modo est possibile ei, donec redire faciat figuram ad formam naturalem, aut prope eam, et ipsemet infirmus, secundum quod conuenit ei ex operatione et instrumentis in plurimis dispositionibus.	For indeed there are many varieties in form; and a prudent craftsman prepares the method in whatever way possible for it, until it restores the figure to the natural form, or nearly so, and the infirm person himself, according to what is appropriate for him from the operation and the instruments in many arrangements.
¶ De adhaerentia palpebrae oculi cum coniunctiua, aut cornea.	Concerning the adhesion of the eyelid to the conjunctiva or cornea.
Caput XV.	Chapter XV.
Quandoque accidit haec consolidatio multis hominibus, ita ut consolidetur palpebra superior cum albedine oculi, et prohibeat ipsum ab operationibus suis naturalibus.	Sometimes this consolidation occurs in many people, so that the upper eyelid becomes consolidated with the white of the eye and prevents it from its natural functions.
Oportet ergo quod intromittas extremitatem radii sub palpebra, et eleues eam sursum: aut extendas eam cum uncino: deinde incide adhaerentiam cum spatumili subtili, quod non sit cum acuitate incisionis spatumilium, imo sit obtusum parumper: ut non inquietetur infirmus apud operationem, et remoueatur spatumile, et laedat oculum cum acuitate sua: et sit incisio tua quasi tu excories illam adhaerentiam cum facilitate, donec quando redit palpebra secundum formam suam naturalem, et sanetur adhaerentia tota.	Therefore, you should introduce the tip of a probe under the eyelid and lift it up, or extend it with a hook; then cut the adhesion with a thin spatula, which should not be sharp, but slightly blunt, so that the patient is not disturbed during the procedure, and the spatula is removed without harming the eye with its sharpness; and your incision should be such that you gently scrape away the adhesion until the eyelid returns to its natural form and the entire adhesion is healed.
Funde tunc in oculum aquam salsam, cum aqua ablue ipsum: aut distilla in ipsum ex sief facto, ex ziniar dissoluto cum aqua.	Then pour salt water into the eye, washing it with the water; or distil into it a solution made from dissolved ziniar in water.
Deinde separa inter palpebram et oculum cum licinio lini: et pone super oculum lanam infusam cum albugine oui: et post diem tertium utere sief, et cum solidatiuis, donec sanetur.	Then separate the eyelid from the eye with flax thread; and place on the eye wool soaked in egg white; and after three days use a poultice, and with consolidants, until it is healed.
¶ De incisione ungulae et eminentiae carnis lachrymarum.	Concerning the incision of the toenail and the prominence of the tear flesh.
Caput XVI.	Chapter XVI.
Scias, quod ungula est secundum duos modos.	Know that the toenail is according to two ways.
Aut est neruosa: et est similis sifac duro, subtili.	Or it is nervous: and it is similar to hard, fine sinew.
Aut est non neruosa, similis humiditati congelatae albae: quae quando tangit cam ferrum, aut conaris capere eam cum uncino, abscinditur, et non figitur in ea uncinus.	Or it is not nervous, similar to congealed white moisture: which when touched with iron, or you try to grasp it with a hook, is cut off, and the hook does not stick to it.
Et utraeque species non incipiunt, nisi a lachrymali maiore, usquequo uadit paulatim, donec cooperit uisum, et prohibet lumen, et motum oculi.	And both types do not begin, unless from the larger tear duct, until it gradually progresses, until it covers the sight, and obstructs the light, and the movement of the eye.
Et modus operandi in incisione eius est: ut ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo.	And the method of operation in its incision is: that the sick person should place his head in your lap.
Deinde aperi oculos eius, et eleua palpebram manu tua.	Then open his eyes, and raise the eyelid with your hand.
Deinde collige ungulam cum uncino paucae duplationis, et extende eam ad superiora.	Then gather the nail with a hook of little doubling, and extend it upwards.
Deinde accipe acum, et intromitte in eam pilum ex pilis equi, et bouis, aut uaccae: et sit filum forte, et duplica extremitatem acus parumper, et fige eam in medio ungulae: et penetra eam cum acu, et liga cum filo ungulam, et extende eam ad superiora: et excoria cum pilo latus ungulae quod sequitur pupillam, ac si tu serres eam cum pilo usque ad postreimnum eius.	Then take a needle, and insert into it a hair from the hair of a horse, or an ox, or a cow; and let the thread be strong, and double the end of the needle a little, and fix it in the middle of the nail; and pierce it with the needle, and tie the nail with the thread, and extend it upwards; and scrape with the hair the side of the nail that follows the pupil, as if you were sawing it with the hair until its end.
Deinde incide residuum in radice lachrymalis cum spatumili subtili, aut cum forficibus paruis: et dimitte carnem lachrymalis naturalem, ut non accidat ex incisione eius cursus lachrymarum assiduus.	Then cut the remainder at the root of the tear duct with a fine spatula, or with small scissors: and leave the natural tear duct tissue, so that a constant flow of tears does not occur from its incision.
Et quandoque extenditur ungula cum uncino solo: aut cum filo, sicut diximus.	And sometimes the nail is extended with a hook alone, or with a thread, as we have said.
Deinde excoriatur cum spatumili leni, cuius haec est forma.	Then it is scraped with a gentle spatula, whose form is this.
Et caue, ne tangat spatumile tunicam corneam, et accidat in ea ruptura, et perforetur pupilla.	And beware, lest the spatula touch the horny tunic, and a rupture occur in it, and the pupil be pierced.
Deinde post incisionem, proice in oculum aliquid salis contriti, aut ex sief facto ex ziniar, et dimitte ipsum usque ad diem alium.	Then, after the incision, put some crushed salt into the eye, or a preparation made from ziniar, and leave it until another day.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod oportet, usquequo sanetur.	Then treat it with what is necessary, until it is healed.
Quod si ungula est non neruosa, et non potes intromittere in eam acum, neque figitur in ea uncinus, tunc multotiens curatur haec species ungulae cum medicinis, et sanatur sicut narraui in diuisione.	If the nail is not nervous, and you cannot insert a needle into it, nor is a hook fastened to it, then this type of nail is often treated with medicaments, and is healed as I have described in the division.
Quod si uis incidere eam, tunc aperi oculum infirmi, et accipe spatumile subtile, lene, debilis acuitatis, secundum hanc formam.	If you wish to cut it, then open the sick person's eye, and take a spatula, slender, gentle, of weak sharpness, according to this form.
Et rade ungulam desuper rasione cum subtilitate.	And scrape the nail from above with precision.
Quod si uides quod ipsa rarificatur et confringitur, et imprimit in eam rasio, tunc distilla ex hora tua in oculum ex sief facto ex ziniar, aut ex sief rubeo, aut sale trito: et opila oculum usque ad diem alium.	If you see that it thins and breaks, and the scraping imprints on it, then distil from your hour into the eye a sieve made of ziniar, or of red sieve, or of crushed salt; and close the eye until another day.
Deinde itera super ipsam operationem, donec remoueatur totum eius.	Then repeat the operation upon it until the whole of it is removed.
Nisi contrarium sit tibi in oculo apostema calidum: tunc enim dimitte ipsam, et cura apostema, donec sanetur.	Unless there is a hot abscess in the eye; for then leave it, and treat the abscess until it is healed.
Deinde itera operationem super ipsam cum rasione, donec sanetur.	Then repeat the operation upon it with the scraper, until it is healed.
Eminentia autem carnis lachrymalis, si nocet in oculo nocumento magno, suspendatur cum uncino, et incide ex ea partem eius: et non ultimes incisionem, ut non accidat cursus lachrymarum.	However, if the prominence of the lacrimal flesh harms the eye with great injury, it should be suspended with a hook and a part of it incised; and do not make the incision too deep, lest the flow of tears be harmed.
Deinde stilla in lachrymale sief rubeum, aut factum ex ziniari, donec sanetur.	Then instill into the lacrimal sac either red or made from ziniari, until it is healed.
¶ De incisione Alguardenic, et carne nata in oculo.	Concerning the incision of Alguardenic, and flesh grown in the eye.
Caput XVII.	Chapter XVII.
Nascitur quandoque in quibusdam oculis hominum caro rubea composita, uel superposita, donec cooperit pupillam, aut appropinquat, aut stringit super palpebras, et fortasse conuertit palpebras ad exteriora: et assimilatur rosae balaustinae.	Sometimes in some people's eyes, red flesh grows, either composed or superimposed, until it covers the pupil, or approaches it, or presses on the eyelids, and perhaps turns the eyelids outward; and it is similar to a rose-hip.
Et operatio in ea etiam est, ut ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo.	And the treatment in it is also that the patient should lay his head in your bosom.
Deinde aperi oculos eius, et collige illam carnem totam cum uncinis conuenientibus ad illud: et tene illud cum forcipe uno, aut gesti.	Then open his eyes, and gather that flesh entirely with suitable hooks for it: and hold it with a single forceps, or pliers.
Deinde incide carnem in primis, donec finiatur totum eius cum incisorio.	Then cut the flesh in the first place, until the whole of it is finished with the scalpel.
Et caue ab oculo, ut non laedas ipsum apud operationem: et sit incisio tua qua ipsam incidis, aut cum spatumili, quod narrauimus in incisione ungulae: aut cum forficibus paruis, cum quibus colligitur asebel, secundum quod ueniet forma eius post hoc capitulum.	And be cautious of the eye, so that you do not injure it during the operation: and let your incision, with which you cut it, be either with a lancet, which we described in the incision of a hoof, or with small scissors, with which the asebel is collected, as its form will appear after this chapter.
Cum ergo completur incisio tua, et remouetur tota alguardenici, tunc imple oculum ex sale contrito: aut distilla in eum puluerem rubeum, et similia illi ex medicinis corrosiuis: et pone super oculum deforis cottum cum albugine oui: ut securetur ab apostemate calido.	When therefore your incision is completed, and the whole of the alguardenici is removed, then fill the eye with crushed salt: or distill into it a red powder, and similar corrosives from medicines: and place over the eye externally a cloth with the white of an egg, so that it is protected from a hot abscess.
Quod si remanet ex alguardenici aliquid, et dominatur tibi sanguis calidus, et times apostema calidum: tunc dimitte oculum, et cura ipsum cum eo quod sedat apostema.	If anything of the alguardenici remains, and hot blood masters you, and you fear a hot abscess, then leave the eye, and treat it with that which quiets the abscess.
Deinde itera super ipsum cum operatione, donec sanetur.	Then repeat the operation on it until it is healed.
Et similiter fac cum carne addita quae accidit in oculo ex hac specie.	And similarly do with any added flesh which occurs in the eye from this type.
Verumtamen oportet, ut alienes curationem omnis oculi debilis ex uia naturali, aut ex uia accidentali, operando cum ferro: et non intromittas manum tuam in aliqua harum operationum, donec uideas, quod illud membrum est tolerans illam operationem.	However, it is necessary that you avoid the treatment of every weak eye by a natural or accidental path, by operating with iron: and do not put your hand into any of these operations until you see that the limb is tolerant of that operation.
¶ De collectione Sebel ex oculo.	Concerning the collection of sebum from the eye.
Caput XVIII.	Chapter XVIII.
Sebel sunt uenae rubeae quae texuntur super oculum, et prohibent uisui operationem suam: et debilitant oculum cum longitudine dierum.	Sebum are red veins which are woven over the eye, and hinder the operation of the sight; and weaken the eye with the length of days.
Necesse est ergo tibi in primis, ut consideres, si oculus in quo est Sebel, est fortis, et non est in eo aegritudo aliqua, praeter Sebel: tunc collige Sebel eius.	Therefore, it is necessary for you first to consider if the eye in which there is sebum is strong, and there is no other illness in it besides the sebum; then collect its sebum.
Et est, ut praecipias infirmo, ut ponat caput suum in sinu tuo.	And it is that you should instruct the sick person to place his head in your lap.
Deinde suspende illas uenas cum uncino uno, aut duobus secundum prudentiam tuam: et sit uncinus subtilis duplationis, secundum hanc formam, aut sint duo uncini gradat in corpore uno, secundum hanc formam.	Then suspend those veins with a single hook, or two, according to your judgment; and let the hook be a slender double hook, according to this form, or let there be two hooks graded on a single body, according to this form.
Deinde collige cum forficibus subtilibus illas uenas cum subtilitate, et absterge sanguinem hora post horam, donec uideas illas uenas remoueri ex oculo, et resoluuntur: et caue ne laedas oculum cum extremitatibus spatumilis.	Then collect those veins with fine forceps carefully, and wipe away the blood hour after hour, until you see those veins removed from the eye and dissolved; and beware lest you injure the eye with the tips of the forceps.
Et sit operatio tua in meridie coram sole, et sis firmus in operatione tua ualde: ut non incidas nisi illas uenas.	And let your operation be in the midday sun, and be very firm in your operation, so that you do not cut anything except those veins.
Et cum tu expleueris, tunc distilla in oculum sief uiride, aut rubeum: ut sua acuitate corrodat quod remansit ex sebel.	And when you have finished, then distill into the eye a green or red sief, so that its sharpness may corrode what remains of the sebel.
Si autem non est tibi possibile colligere illud totum in illa hora, tunc emplastra oculum cum eo, quod sedat dolorem oculi: et dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot, donec sedetur dolor eius: et securetur ab apostemate calido: deinde itera super ipsum secundum modum eundem, donec sanetur.	However, if it is not possible for you to collect it all at that time, then apply a poultice to the eye with that which soothes the pain of the eye, and leave it for a few days until its pain subsides, and is secured from a hot abscess; then repeat it again according to the same method, until it is healed.
Et haec est forma forficis.	And this is the form of the forceps.
¶ De reductione Arissati ad nasum.	Concerning the reduction of a displaced nose.
Caput XIX.	Chapter XIX.
Nominant medici Arissati Fistulam, quam curas cum cauterio, aut cum medicina acuta comburente, secundum quod praecessit eius narratio.	Physicians call the fistula Arissati, which you treat with a cautery, or with a burning, sharp medicine, according to its preceding description.
Et si non sanatur, tunc non est ingenium in ea: nisi ut findas super apostema apud natiuitatem eius, et extrahas totam humiditatem quae est in eo et pus, donec detegatur os.	And if it does not heal, then there is no skill in it: unless you pierce above the abscess at its origin, and extract all the moisture and pus from it, until the bone is exposed.
Cum ergo detegitur os, et uides in eo corruptionem, aut nigredinem, tunc rade ipsum cum instrumento, cuius forma est haec.	When therefore the bone is exposed, and you see corruption or blackness in it, then scrape it with an instrument, whose form is this.
Et nominatur Asperi capitis.	And it is called Asperi's head.
Fiat ex ferro indo, et sit caput eius rotundum sicut azir, quod sit punctatum punctatione limae, aut punctatione aliskilferi punctatione subtili: et pone ipsum super locum corruptum ossis.	Let it be made of tempered iron, and let its head be round like a zir, that it be punctured with a file's puncture, or with a fine aliskilfer's puncture: and place it upon the corrupted place of the bone.
Deinde reuolue ipsum inter digitos tuos, et tu preme manum tuam parumper, donec scias quod illa corruptio iam rasa est: et fac illud aliquotiens.	Then revolve it between your fingers, and you press your hand a little, until you know that the corruption has been scraped away: and do it several times.
Deinde restaura locum cum medicinis exiccatiuis stipticis.	Then restore the place with drying, astringent medicines.
Si ergo consolidatur locus, et nascitur in eo caro, et abscinditur cursus saniei: et remanet quadraginta diebus, et non renouatur, et non apostematur, et non accidit in eo accidens: tunc scias quia iam sanatus est.	Therefore, if the place consolidates, and flesh grows in it, and the flow of pus ceases; and it remains for forty days, and is not renewed, and does not suppurate, and no accident occurs in it, then know that it is now healed.
Et si non, tunc non est in eo ingenium, nisi reducere fistulam ad foramen nasi, secundum hanc formam.	And if not, then there is no remedy for it, except to reduce the fistula to the nostril's opening, according to this form.
Et est, ut detegas ab osse secundo cum ferro, aut cum medicina acuta: et cum detectum est os, tunc accipe terebrum secundum hanc formam, sit extremitas ferrea, triangulata: et lignum eius sit pyramis extenuata usque ad extremitatem, sicut uides.	And it is, that you expose the bone from the second with iron, or with a sharp medicine; and when the bone is exposed, then take a drill according to this form, let the iron end be triangular; and its wood be a tapered pyramid up to the end, as you see.
Deinde pone illud super os ipsum: et sit illud prope lachrymale: et elonga manum tuam ab oculo parum.	Then place it on the bone itself; and let it be near the tear duct; and move your hand away from the eye a little.
Deinde reuolue manum tuam cum terebro, donec penetret os, et sentiat illud infirmus: per hoc quod inuenit uentum exire ex eo, quando tenet manum suam super nasum suum.	Then revolve your hand with the drill, until it penetrates the bone, and the infirm feels it; by this, that he finds air coming out of it, when he holds his hand over his nose.
Ergo tunc restaura locum cum medicinis stipticis exiccantibus, sicut docui te.	Therefore, then restore the place with astringent drying medicines, as I taught you.
Cum ergo nascitur caro, et induratur locus: tunc materia quae effundebatur ad exteriora, redit ad nasum: est ergo leuius illud super infirmum.	When, therefore, flesh is born, and the place hardens, then the matter which was poured out to the outside returns to the nose; it is therefore lighter for the infirm.
¶ De reductione eminentiae Oculi.	Concerning the reduction of the prominence of the Eye.
Caput XX.	Chapter XX.
Quando eminet Oculus cum totalitate sua, et non accidit in uisu nocumentum, neque diminutio: tunc oportet ut soluas infirmum: deinde phlebotomes eum: postea ponas uentosas in ceruice absque scarificatione, sed cum suctione.	When the eye protrudes in its entirety, and no harm or diminution occurs in the vision, then it is necessary that you loosen the patient; then bleed him; afterwards, apply cupping to the neck without scarification, but with suction.
Deinde pone super Oculum linimentum quod fit ex acacia, et aloe, et olibano, et sarcocolla.	Then apply a liniment to the eye made from acacia, aloe, frankincense, and sarcocolla.
Deinde stringe Oculum desuper super emplastrum cum puluillis multis.	Then compress the eye from above, over the plaster, with many bandages.
Et modus puluillorum est: ut accipias pannos lenes, multos, et duplicetur omnis pannus ex eis super quatuor: fac ex eis multos: deinde pone eos unum super alium, secundum quantitatem qua indiget Oculus: deinde stringe super ipsos cum panno duro strictura forti.	And the method of the bandages is: that you take soft cloths, many, and each cloth should be doubled over four times; make many of them; then place them one upon another, according to the amount needed for the eye; then compress them with a hard cloth with a strong constriction.
Et itera uentosas cum suctione sine scarificatione.	And again apply cupping with suction, without scarification.
Deinde aufer uentosas, et dimitte oculum strictum die et nocte.	Then remove the cupping, and leave the eye bound day and night.
Si autem ligamentum iterum mollificatur, tunc oportet ut stringatur multum: deinde aufer ligamentum post diem et noctem, sicut diximus.	However, if the bandage softens again, then it is necessary that it be tightened very much; then remove the bandage after one day and night, as we have said.
Si ergo uides oculum iam redisse uuae tunicae, est bonum: et si non, tunc itera emplastrum, et puluillos, et stricturam, et uentosas, donec sanetur.	If therefore you see the eye has now returned to the state of its membrane, it is good; and if not, then again apply the plaster, and bandages, and constriction, and cupping, until it is healed.
¶ De incisionie Vuae tunicae.	Concerning the incision of the eye's membrane.
Caput XXI.	Chapter XXI.
Quando accidit disruptio in tunica Vuea, deinde eminet et procedit extra palpebras sicut granum Vuae, et foedatur forma hominis propter illud, et uis incidere illud: tunc operatio in eo est, secundum quod narro: et est, ut intromittas acum in radice Vuae ab inferiori ad superiorem partem.	When a rupture occurs in the eye's membrane, and then it protrudes and proceeds outside the eyelids like a grape-like swelling, and disfigures the man's appearance because of it, and one wishes to cut it: then the procedure for it is as I describe: and it is that you insert a needle into the root of the eye from the lower to the upper part.
Deinde intromitte acum aliam in qua sit filum duplum a parte lachrymalis, et fac eam penetrare: et dimitte acum primam secundum dispositionem suam.	Then insert another needle, on which is a doubled thread, from the tear duct side, and let it penetrate; and leave the first needle in its position.
Deinde incide locum fili dupli, et liga cum eo partem Vuae in circumitu acus: et stringe eam multum.	Then cut the place of the double thread, and tie with it the part of the eye around the needle; and tighten it very much.
Deinde extrahe acum, et pone super oculum lanam infusam in albugine oui: et dimitte eum, donec cadat filum cum Vua.	Then withdraw the needle, and place over the eye wool soaked in the white of an egg; and leave it until the thread falls with the eye.
Deinde cura oculum cum eo, quod confortat ipsum, donec sanetur uulnus.	Then treat the eye with that which strengthens it, until the wound heals.
Et quandoque stringitur Vua ab omni parte cum circulo ex panno, donec addat oculus eminentiam magnam.	And sometimes the eye is tightened from every side with a bandage of cloth, until the eye increases greatly in prominence.
Deinde perforetur cum spatumili subtili, quod perueniat ad profundum oculi, et currat humiditas albuginea, et descendat oculus, et ingrediatur statim: deinde stringe eum, donec sanetur.	Then it is pierced with a thin spatula, which reaches the depth of the eye, and the white fluid runs out, and the eye descends, and immediately enters; then tighten it until it heals.
¶ De curatione Alcomnati.	Concerning the treatment of Alcomnat.
Caput XXII.	Chapter XXII.
Haec Aegritudo quae nominatur Alcomnati, non, est nisi sanies, quae aggregatur in oculo, similis aquae descendenti, et non est ipsa.	This illness, called Alcomnat, is nothing but pus that gathers in the eye, similar to descending water, and is not the eye itself.
Et modus operandi in ea est, ut facias sedere infirmum super sedem praeparatum, uel directum.	And the method of treatment in it is that you make the infirm sit on a prepared seat, or upright.
Deinde accipe caput eius manibus tuis a partibus duabus, et moue ipsum, donec uideas saniem peruenire ad inferiora oculis tuis.	Then take his head in your hands from two sides, and move it until you see the pus descend to the lower part of your eyes.
Deinde figatur, et non descendat, et absoluatur lumen: et uideat infirmus res sicut uidebat: et si non descendit inferius, scias quia est aqua.	Then let it be fixed, and do not let it descend, and the light be released: and let the infirm person see things as he saw them before: and if it does not descend further, know that it is water.
Si autem non praeparatur descensus saniei cum eo quod diximus, tunc fac sedere infirmum inter manus tuas.	If, however, the descent of the pus is not prepared with what we have said, then make the infirm person sit between your hands.
Deinde accipe spatumile subtile, et finde cum eo supra panniculum corneum parumper apud continuationem coniunctiuae cum tunica cornea in corona, donec egrediatur sanies.	Then take a fine spatula, and split with it slightly above the corneal membrane near the junction of the conjunctiva with the cornea, until the pus emerges.
Cum ergo egreditur, tunc distilla in oculum aquam calidam in qua miscuisti mel: aut aquam in qua iam bullisti foenumgraecum et mel: deinde curetur cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	When it emerges, then instill into the eye warm water in which you have mixed honey; or water in which you have boiled fenugreek and honey; then treat with the rest of the treatment, until it heals.
¶ De cura aquae, quae descendit in oculo, uel cataracta.	Concerning the treatment of water that descends in the eye, or cataract.
Caput XXIII.	Chapter XXIII.
Iam Diximus species aquae in diuisione, et quae conuenit ad perforandum sermone declarante et exponente, tunc accipe illud idem secundum sanitatem.	We have already discussed the types of water in division, and what is appropriate for piercing, the speech declaring and explaining, then take that same thing according to health.
Tunc ergo oportet ut facias sedere infirmum inter manus tuas quadratum, oppositum lumini, prope solem: et liga oculum eius sanum, et stringe eum ualde: deinde palpebram oculi eius manu tua dextra, si oculus in quo est aqua, est oculus sinister: aut manu tua sinistra, si oculus est dexter.	Then you should have the infirm person sit between your hands, square, opposite the light, near the sun; and bind his healthy eye tightly; then, with your right hand, if the eye in which the water is, is the left eye, or with your left hand, if it is the right eye, press his eyelid.
Deinde accipe manu tua dextra almagda, si oculus est sinister: aut manu tua sinistra, si oculus est dexter.	Then take with your right hand an almagda, if the eye is left, or with your left hand, if the eye is right.
Deinde pone extremitatem almagda prope coronam per grossitudinem radii in ipsa albedine oculi apparente lachrymalis minoris: deinde impelle almagda cum uirtute: et tu reuoluis cum eo manum tuam, donec penetret in albuginem oculi: et sentias, quod almagda iam peruenit ad rem uacuam.	Then place the tip of the almagda near the crown, by the thickness of a ray, in the apparent white of the eye, near the smaller tear duct; then push the almagda with force, and turn your hand with it, until it penetrates the white of the eye; and you will feel that the almagda has now reached the empty space.
Et oportet, ut sit mensura itineris almagda ad profundum, mensura spacii quod est a pupilla usque ad finem nigredinis: et est corona oculi.	And the measure of the almagda's journey to the depth should be the measure of the space from the pupil to the end of the blackness; and it is the crown of the eye.
Uidebis enim ea in ipsa pupilla uisione oculi, propter claritatem tunicae corneae.	For you will see them in the very pupil of the eye's vision, because of the clarity of the cornea.
Deinde pone almagda usque ad locum in quo est aqua.	Then place the almagda to the place where there is water.
Deinde preme ipsum inferius uice una post aliam.	Then press it downwards, one time after another.
Si ergo descendit aqua statim, tunc infirmus uidet illud super quod aperit uisum suum statim, et almagda in oculo suo.	If, therefore, the water descends immediately, then the sick person sees that upon which he opens his sight immediately, and the almagda in his eye.
Deinde quiescas paululum.	Then rest a little.
Si ergo descendat aqua, tunc depone eam secundo, praeter quod egrediatur almagda.	If therefore the water descends, then remove it a second time, except that the almagda comes out.
Quando ergo figitur, et non ascendit: tunc extrahe almagda cum facilitate: et tu reuoluis manum tuam paulatim.	When therefore it is fixed, and does not ascend, then extract the almagda with ease, and you turn your hand gradually.
Deinde dissolue in aqua aliquid ex sale claro gemmae: et ablue cum eo oculum deintus.	Then dissolve some of clear gem salt in water, and wash the inside of the eye with it.
Deinde pone extra oculum totum stuppam, aut lanam infusam oleo rosato, et albugine oui: et liga cum eo oculum sanum.	Then put over the entire eye a bandage of lint or wool soaked in rose oil and egg white, and bind the sound eye with it.
Nos autem, et illi qui sunt nostri temporis, ponimus super eum ciminum tritum cum albumine oui.	We, and those of our time, place on it pounded cumin with egg white.
Quod si non obedit tibi almagda ad introitum in oculum propter duriciem suam, quoniam ex hominibus est, cuius oculus est durus ualde: tunc oportet ut accipias spatumile, quod nominatur Alberid, cuius haec est forma.	If the almagda does not obey you in entering the eye because of its hardness, since it is from human beings, whose eye is very hard, then it is necessary to take a spatula, which is called Alberid, of which this is the form.
Pefora ergo cum eo ipsam coniunctiuam tantum, et non ultimes manum tuam in foramine: et non est nisi ut facias uiam ad almagda locum subtilem.	Therefore, with it, scrape only the conjunctiva, and do not put your hand into the opening; and it is only that you make a subtle path to the place of the almagda.
Deinde intromitte almagda, secundum quod diximus.	Then introduce the almagda, as we have said.
Et apud complementum operis tui, praeparetur infirmo dormitorium decenter factum, in quo dormiat super dorsum suum in domo tenebrosa: et prohibeatur ab omnibus motibus, et a tussi: et pone cibum eius illud quo lenitur natura eius: et non moueat caput suum dextra, neque sinistra omnino.	And at the completion of your work, prepare for the patient a properly made sleeping place, in which he sleeps on his back in a dark room; and forbid him all movement, and coughing; and place his food that which soothes his nature; and let him not move his head to the right, nor to the left at all.
Et sit ligamentum secundum dispositionem suam usque ad diem tertium.	And let the bandage remain according to its arrangement until the third day.
Deinde solue illud in illa domo tenebrosa, et experire uisum eius: et fac eum uidere res.	Then loosen it in that dark room, and test his sight; and make him see things.
Deinde reduc ligamentum usque ad diem septimum.	Then reduce the bandage until the seventh day.
Et non oportet ut faciat illud in hora curationis, aut post incisionem statim: imo oportet, ut alienes illud: propterea quod aqua ascendit uelociter per aspectum uehementem.	And it is not necessary that he do this at the time of treatment, or immediately after the incision; rather, it is necessary that he abstain from it; because water rises quickly through intense looking.
Si autem accidit apostema calidum: tunc oportet ut soluas oculum ante septimum: et rectifica illud cum eo quod sedat apostema, donec sedatur: tunc absolue ipsius uisum, et pone super faciem eius orale quo regatur uisus eius sub eo diebus aliquot, ipso existente in illa domo tenebrosa.	If, however, a hot abscess occurs: then it is necessary that you loosen the eye before the seventh [day]; and rectify it with that which soothes the abscess, until it is soothed; then release its sight, and place over its face a covering to regulate its sight beneath it for some days, him being in that dark room.
Deinde egrediatur a domo gradatim, et conuersetur in casis suis.	Then he should gradually emerge from the house and mingle in his own dwellings.
Et scias, quod in zaltea non excusatur discipulus a uisione aliquotiens: tunc enim audeat super operationem.	And know that in the zaltea a disciple is not excused from a vision sometimes; then he may venture on the operation.
Et iam quidem peruenit ad nos quidam ex illis qui sunt de Alayrach, qui dixit, quod factum fuit in Alayrach magdan perforatum, quo sugitur aqua.	And now indeed one of those who are from Alayrach has come to us, who said that a perforated magdan was made in Alayrach, from which water is drawn.
Verum ergo non uidi aliquem in terra uostra, qui fecerit illud: neque legi illud in aliquo ex libris antiquorum: et est possibile, ut sit illud nouum.	But truly I have not seen anyone in your land who has done this; nor have I read it in any of the books of the ancients; and it is possible that it is new.
Et istae sunt formae specierum ex magda, ut stet super ea qui ea ignorat.	And these are the forms of the species from the magdan, so that he who is ignorant of them may stand on them.
Fiant ex aere proprie: et sint extremitates eorum cum hac eadem subtilitate triangulatae, et extremitas acuta.	Let them be made properly of bronze; and let their extremities be triangular with this same subtlety, and let the extremity be pointed.
Formae magda.	Forms of the magdan.
¶ De cura Carnis natae in naso.	Concerning the treatment of flesh growing in the nose.
Caput XXIIII.	Chapter XXIV.
Quandoque nascuntur in naso Carnes diuersae additae, ex quibus est aliquid quod assimilatur scorpioni multorum pedum: et ex ea est caro cancerosa, lapidea, fusci coloris: et ex ea est quae est caro lenis, non fusci coloris.	Sometimes various growths of flesh arise in the nose, some resembling a scorpion with many feet; and of these is cancerous, stony flesh of a dark color; and of these is flesh that is soft, not of a dark color.
In ea ergo quae ex istis carnibus est lenis, non fraudulenta, neque cancerosa, oportet ut facias sedere infirmum inter manus tuas oppositum soli, et aperi nares eius, et proiice uncinum in illas carnes: deinde trahe eas ad exteriora, et incide quod comprehendisti ex eis cum spatumili subtili acuto a parte una, donec scias quod caro tota iam ablata est.	In that soft flesh therefore, which is not fraudulent nor cancerous, you should have the sick person sit between your hands facing the ground, and open his nostrils, and insert a hook into that flesh; then pull it outwards, and cut what you have grasped from it with a thin, sharp spatula on one side, until you know that the entire flesh has been removed.
Quod si remaneret aliquid ex ea cuius abscisio non est possibilis: tunc rade illud cum uno instrumentorum subtilium cum facilitate, donec non remaneat ex eo aliquid.	If anything remains from that which cannot be removed: then scrape it with a fine instrument easily, until nothing remains of it.
Si autem sanguis tibi dominatur, aut accidat apostema calidum: tunc oppone ei per id quod oportet: aut est ex apostematibus malignis, tunc propera cauterizando eum, donec abscindatur sanguis, et auferantur omnes carnes.	If, however, blood dominates you, or a hot abscess occurs: then apply to it what is appropriate; or if it is from malignant abscesses, then hasten to cauterize it, until the blood is cut off and all flesh is removed.
Deinde proiiciatur in nasum post incisionem acetum, et aqua, aut uinum.	Then, after the incision, vinegar, and water, or wine, should be placed in the nose.
Si autem aperitur nasus, et procedat ex eo humiditas usque ad palatum, tunc scias quia iam sanus est.	If, however, the nose opens, and moisture flows from it to the palate, then you know that it is now healthy.
Si uero non penetrat humiditas, secundum quod oportet, tunc scias quod intra ipsum est caro nata in superioribus ossibus naris, ad quae non peruenit cum incisione instrumentum.	If, however, the moisture does not penetrate as it should, then know that within it is flesh grown on the upper bones of the nostril, to which the instrument did not reach during the incision.
Tunc ergo oportet, ut intromittas filum lini cui sit quaedam grossitudo, et noda in eo nodos multos: et pone inter omnem nodum quantitatem digiti, aut minus: et ingeniet infirmus, ut mittat extremitatem unam fili in nasum cum radio, aut cum quo possibile est ei postquam fecerit ipsum simile azer: et trahat odoratum suum, donec perueniat usque ad caassum, et egrediatur super guttur suum.	Then it is necessary to insert a linen thread of some thickness, and tie many knots in it; and place between each knot a quantity of a finger, or less; and let the infirm person, with a rod or whatever is possible for him after he has made it like azer, insert one end of the thread into the nose; and draw out the smell of it, until it reaches the abscess, and exits above his throat.
Et multotiens quidem faciunt simile huic Attomi pueri in scholis: et est res facilis ei, qui uult.	And many times, children in schools indeed do something similar to this Attomi; and it is an easy matter for him who wishes to do it.
Deinde pone duas extremitates fili, extremitatem unam quae egreditur super nasum, et alteram quae remansit in naso.	Then place the two ends of the thread, one end which emerges above the nose, and the other which remains in the nose.
Deinde ac ministra serraturam carnis cum nodis qui sunt in filo.	Then remove the flesh shavings with the knots that are on the thread.
Fac illud donec scias quod carnes iam sunt cum nodis fili.	Do that until you know that the flesh is now all with the knots of the thread.
Deinde extrahe filum: et pone in nasum post abstersionem sanguinis licinium quod imbibisti in unguento aegyptio: fac illud tribus diebus, aut plus, donec unguentum corrodat totum quod remansit ex carnibus.	Then pull out the thread, and after cleansing the blood, place in the nose the lint you soaked in Egyptian ointment; do this for three days, or longer, until the ointment corrodes all that remains of the flesh.
Deinde pone in fine rei in nasum cannulam de plumbo, diebus aliquot, donec sanetur.	Then place a lead cannula at the end of the thing in the nose, for several days, until it heals.
Si autem indiget curatione quae exiccet, utere illa.	If however it needs a treatment that will dry it out, use that.
Ad caputpurgium faciendum, cum quo distillantur olea, et aliae medicinae in nasum, fac illud ex argento, aut aere: quod sit simile lampadi paruae, apertum sicut conchula: et meatus eius similiter.	For performing nasal douching, with which oils and other medicines are distilled into the nose, make it of silver, or bronze; that be like a small lamp, open like a seashell; and its passageway likewise.
Et si uis fac cannulam clausam, sicut canna.	And if you wish, make it a closed cannula, like a reed.
Et conchula instrumenti ad caputpurgium faciendum, sit plena, detecta: cui sit manubrium in postremo eius, cum quo teneas ipsam, quando calefacis in ea oleum, aut quod uis ex succis, et rebus fluxibilibus.	And the shell of the instrument for nasal douching, be full, uncovered; to which there be a handle at its end, with which you hold it, when you heat oil in it, or whatever you wish from juices and liquid things.
Et haec est forma instrumenti.	And this is the form of the instrument.
¶ De cura Thelul nasi.	Concerning the treatment of nasal warts.
Caput XXV.	Chapter XXV.
Multotiens nascitur in extremitate nasi Thelul, et magnificatur, et augmentatur cum diebus, donec foedus fit aspectus eius.	Often a wart is born at the tip of the nose, and it grows larger and increases with the days until its appearance becomes unsightly.
Et propter illud oportet, ut in cidas illud in principio apparitionis eius, et eradices totum eius.	And therefore it is necessary, that in the beginning of its appearance, you should cauterize it and eradicate the whole of it.
Deinde pone super locum, aut cauterium, aut medicinam comburentem quae stat loco eius.	Then apply to the place either a cautery or a burning medicine which stands in its stead.
Si ergo tardatur incisio eius, donec magnificetur, tunc considera, si est lapideum, durum, fusci coloris, pauci sensus: tunc non tangas ipsum cum ferro: quoniam apostema est cancerosum.	If its incision is delayed until it grows large, then consider if it is stony, hard, of dark colour, and with little sensation: then do not touch it with iron, because it is a cancerous abscess.
Multotiens enim uidi, qui incidit hmoni apostema, et accidit ex eo malicia magna super illum qui ipsum habebat.	For often I have seen that whoever incised a man's abscess, and great harm resulted from it to the one who had it.
Et si apostema est lenis tactus, non fusci coloris, et uides quod incisio possibilis est in toto eius, tunc euacua infirmum, et incide ipsum sine timore, absque pauore: et cura locum cum eo quod exiccat et constringit, donec sanetur.	And if the abscess is soft to the touch, not dark in color, and you see that incision is possible throughout it, then evacuate the infirmity, and incise it without fear, without dread, and treat the place with what dries and constricts it, until it is healed.
¶ De sutura nasi, et labii, et auris.	Concerning the suturing of the nose, lip, and ear.
Caput XXVI.	Chapter XXVI.
Scias Quia quando accidit solutio continuitatis in una harum cartilaginum, parum confert in ea operatio, nisi in quibusdam hominibus.	Know that when a separation of continuity occurs in one of these cartilages, little benefit accrues from surgery in it, except in some individuals.
Oportet ergo quando accidit alicui aliquid ex illo, ut consideres, si est uulnus recens cum sanguine suo: et tunc aggrega duolabia uulneris cum sutura: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Therefore, when something of that kind happens to someone, you should consider if it is a fresh wound with its own blood; and then bring together the edges of the wound with sutures, and then treat it until it is healed.
Et si solutionis continuitatis labia iam separata sunt, et facta est unaquaeque pars sana: tunc oportet ut excories omnem partem a cute sua apparente, donec sanguinetur.	And if the separation of continuity has caused the lips to be already separated, and each part is healthy, then it is necessary to scrape away all the part from its apparent skin, until it bleeds.
Deinde aggrega duo labia cum sutura, et stringe ea, et pulueriza super ipsum sanguinem draconis, et olibanum trita: et pone supra pulueres frustum emplastri diafinicon, et alicuius alterius ex emplastris consolidatiuis: et dimitte ipsum ligatum duobus diebus, aut tribus.	Then bring together the two lips with sutures, and tie them, and powder upon it the blood of a dragon, and crushed frankincense: and place over the powders a piece of a Diafinicon plaster, and some other of the consolidating plasters: and leave it bound for two days or three.
Deinde solue ipsum, et permuta medicinam: et dimitte ipsum, donec abscindantur fila per se.	Then loosen it, and change the medicine, and leave it until the threads are cut off by themselves.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with ointment until it is healed.
Modus autem suturae est, ut aggreges solutionem continuitatis, aut cum acubus, sicut narrauimus in sutura uentris: aut aggrega solutionem cum filo, sicut feci te scire.	The method of suturing is, that you bring together the separation of continuity, either with needles, as we described in the suturing of the belly, or bring the separation together with thread, as I made known to you.
¶ De extractione nodorum labiorum.	Concerning the extraction of knots from the lips.
Caput XXVII.	Chapter XXVII.
Multis Quidem hominibus accidunt plaerumque in interioribus labiorum suorum apostemata dura similia granis herbi: et quaedam eorum minora, et maiora.	Many people often suffer abscesses hard like herb seeds on the inner parts of their lips, and some of them are smaller, and some larger.
Ergo oportet ut conuertas labium, et findas super omnem nodum eius, et suspendas ipsum cum uncino, et incidas ipsum ab omni parte.	Therefore, it is necessary to turn back the lip, and to cut over every knot on it, and to lift it with a hook, and to cut it away from all sides.
Deinde impleas locum post incisionem zegi trito, donec abscindatur sanguis.	Then, fill the place after the incision with bruised zegi, until the blood ceases.
Deinde colluatur cum aceto, et curetur locus cum eo, in quo est stipticitas, usquequo sanentur uulnera.	Then, wash it with vinegar, and treat the area with it, where there is astringency, until the wounds are healed.
¶ De incisione carnis natae super gingiuam.	Concerning the incision of flesh growing on the gum.
Caput XXVIII.	Chapter XXVIII.
Multotiens nascitur super gingiuam caro addiat, quam antiqui nominant abuluss.	Often flesh grows on the gum, which the ancients call a protrusion.
Oportet ergo ut suspendas eam cum uncino: aut teneas eam cum forcipibus, et incidas eam apud radicem suam, et dimittas saniem currere, aut sanguinem.	Therefore, you must suspend it with a hook; or hold it with forceps, and cut it near its root, and let the pus or blood run.
Deinde pone super locum zegi tritum, aut alios pulueres stipticos, exiccatiuos.	Then place on the area ground zegi, or other astringent, drying powders.
Quod si redit illa caro post curationem, nam multotiens redit, tunc incide eam secundo, et cauteriza ipsam: ipsa namque non redit post cauterium.	If that flesh returns after treatment, for it often does, then cut it a second time, and cauterize it; for it will not return after cauterization.
¶ De rasione Dentium cum ferro.	Concerning the removal of teeth with an iron tool.
Caput XXIX.	Chapter XXIX.
Quandoque aggregantur in superficiebus Dentium ab interiori et extetiori parte, et inter gingiuas cortices asperi, turpes, et quandoque denigrantur, et citrini fiunt, et uirides, donec peruenit ex illo corruptio ad gingiuam, et foedi fiunt dentes per illud.	Sometimes rough, unsightly, and sometimes darkened, yellowish, or greenish crusts collect on the surfaces of the teeth, both inner and outer, and between the gums, until the decay extends to the gums, and the teeth become disfigured by it.
Oportet ergo ut facias sedere infirmum inter manus tuas, et caput eius in sinu tuo, et rade molam et dentem, in quo apparent tibi cortices, et res similis arenae: donec non remaneat ex eis aliquid, et similiter fac de nigredine, et uiriditate, et citrinitate, et aliis donec mundentur.	Therefore, you should place the sick person between your hands, and his head in your lap, and scrape the molar and tooth where the crusts, resembling sand, appear, until nothing remains of them; and similarly treat the blackness, greenness, and yellowness, and other such things until they are cleaned.
Si ergo auferatur quod in eis est a principio rasionis, bonum est: et si non, tunc itera super eos rasionem die alio, secundo, et tertio, donec ad ultimum perueniat studium in eo quod uis.	If therefore that which is present on them from the beginning of the scraping is removed, it is good; and if not, then repeat the scraping on them another day, a second time, and a third time, until finally the desired result is achieved.
Et scias, quod dens indiget rasoriis diuersarum formarum, multarum figurarum: secundum quod praeparatur operationi tuae: proptera, quod rasorium quo raditur dens ab inferiori parte, est aliud a rasorio quo raditur inter dentes, secundum formas alias.	And know that a tooth requires scrapers of different shapes and forms, according to what is prepared for your operation; therefore, the scraper used to scrape the tooth from the lower part is different from the scraper used to scrape between the teeth, according to different shapes.
Et istae formae rasoriorum sint apud te praeparatae, quas uides.	And have these shapes of scrapers prepared, which you see.
¶ De extractione doloris Dentium.	On the extraction of toothache.
Caput XXX.	Chapter 30.
Oportet ut cures Dentem a dolore suo cum omni ingenio, et tardes in eradicatione eius.	You should treat the tooth from its pain with all ingenuity, and delay in its eradication.
Non est enim quod uicem eius suppleat quando eradicatur: quoniam est substantia sublimis: donec quando non est excusatio de eradicatione eius, tunc oportet quando cogitur infirmus eradicare ipsum, ut firmetur, et certificetur apud te dens dolens.	For there is nothing to replace it when it is eradicated; since it is a subtle substance. Until, when there is no excuse for its eradication, then it is necessary when the sick person is forced to eradicate it, so that it may be strengthened, and the aching tooth be certified by you.
Multotiens enim decipit infirmum dolor, et putat quia est in dente saha et eradicat ipsum: deinde non recedit dolor, donec eradicetur dens infirmus.	For often pain deceives the sick person, and he thinks that it is in the tooth itself and eradicates it; then the pain does not recede until the sick person's tooth is eradicated.
Nos enim iam uidimus illud ex operatione phlebotomatorum.	For we have already seen that from the operation of phlebotomists.
Cum ergo certificatur apud te dens dolens ipsemet, tunc oportet ut scarifices in circumitu dentis cum spatumili, in quo sit quiddam uirtutis, donec soluatur gingiua ab omni parte: deinde moue ipsum digitis tuis, aut cum forcipibus subtilibus in primis paulatim, donec concutias ipsum.	Therefore, when the aching tooth itself is certified by you, then it is necessary that you scarify in the circumference of the tooth with a spatula, in which there is something of virtue, until the gum is loosened on every side; then move it with your fingers, or with fine forceps at first gradually, until you break it.
Deinde loca tunc in eo forcipes magnos locatione bona, et caput infirmi inter genua tua: quod iam bene tenuisti, ita quod non moueatur: deinde trahe dentem secundum rectitudinem, ut non frangas ipsum.	Then place large forceps in a good position on it, and place the patient's head between your knees; which you have already held firmly so that it does not move; then pull the tooth in a straight line so that you do not break it.
Si ergo non egreditur, tunc accipe aliquod illorum instrumentorum, et intromitte ipsum sub eo ab omni parte cum facilitate, et conare motionem eius, sicut fecisti in primis.	If therefore it does not come out, then take one of those instruments, and introduce it under it from every side with ease, and attempt its movement, as you did at first.
Si autem dens est perforatus, aut corrosus: tunc oportet ut impleas illud foramen panno: et stringas ipsum cum extremitate radii subtilis, ut non frangatur in hora constrictionis tuae super ipsum cum forcipibus.	If however the tooth is perforated or corroded, then it is necessary that you fill that hole with cloth; and bind it with the extremity of a fine reed, so that it does not break at the time of your constriction upon it with the forceps.
Et oportet, ut exquisite agas cum scarificatione in circumitu gingiuae ab omni parte multum.	And it is necessary that you act carefully with the scarification around the gum on every side a great deal.
Et custodi fortitudinem tuam, ut non frangas ipsum, et remaneat pars eius, et redeat super infirmum ex ea malicia quae sit maior dolore eius primo.	And guard your strength, so that you do not break it, and a part of it remains, and returns upon the sick person from that malice which shall be greater pain than his first pain.
Et caue, ne facias illud quod ignorantes faciunt phlebotomatores in festinatione sua, et audacia ipsorum super eradicationem eius, praeter quod administrent illud quod narrauimus.	And beware, lest you do that which ignorant phlebotomists do in their haste, and their boldness over its eradication, beyond what we have described.
Multotiens enim faciunt euenire super homines infirmitates magnas, quarum difficiliores sunt ut frangantur, et remaneant radices eius omnes, aut quaedam earum: aut ut extrahant ipsum cum quibusdam ossibus mandibulae: sicut testificati sumus multotiens illud.	For they often cause great illnesses in men, which are more difficult to break, and leave all its roots, or some of them; or that they extract it with some bones of the jaw; as we have often witnessed that.
Deinde colluatur post eradicationem eius cum uino, aut cum aceto et sale.	Then it should be washed after its eradication with wine, or with vinegar and salt.
Quod si accidat fluxus sanguinis ex locis (multotiens enim accidit) tunc tere aliquid ex zegi, et imple cum eo locum: et si non, cauteriza ipsum si non confert tibi zegi.	If a flow of blood occurs from the places (for it often happens), then rub some of the zegi and fill the place with it; and if not, cauterize it if the zegi does not help you.
Formae forcipum subtilium quibus mouetur dens in primis, sint longarum extremitatum, breuis manubrii, grossi, ut non duplicentur quando cum eis premitur super dentem: sint sicut uides grossorum manubriorum, donec quando stringis cum eis, non dent seipsas, neque duplicentur: breuium extremitatum, et sint ex ferro indo, aut ex faled decenter facti, directarum extremitatum: et in eorum extremitatibus sint dentes, quorum quidam ingrediantur in quosdam, et stringant constrictione decenti, forti.	The shapes of the fine forceps with which the tooth is first moved should have long extremities, a short handle, and be thick, so that they do not double when pressed on the tooth; they should be like those with thick handles, so that when you tighten them, they do not give way or double; with short extremities, and be made of strong iron or good steel, with straight extremities; and on their extremities there should be teeth, some of which enter others and grip with a proper, strong constriction.
Et quandoque fiunt extremitates sicut forma oris auis quae nominatur ciconia, et sunt fortis constrictionis.	And sometimes the extremities are shaped like the beak of a bird called a stork, and are of strong constriction.
¶ De eradicatione Dentium, et extractione ossium mandibularum fractorum.	Concerning the eradication of teeth, and the extraction of fractured mandibular bones.
Caput XXXI.	Chapter XXXI.
Quando remanet apud eradicationem Dentis qui frangitur aliquid, tunc oportet ut ponas super locum cotum cum butyro die uno, aut duobus diebus, donec mollificetur locus: deinde intromitte ad ipsum algasti, aut forcipes: quorum extremitates assimilantur ori auis quae nominatur ciconia.	When, during the extraction of a tooth, something remains, then you should place a poultice of butter on the area for one or two days, until the area softens; then introduce algast or forceps, whose extremities resemble the beak of a bird called a stork.
Forma autem haec est forcipum.	The form of these forceps is this.
Sint extremitates eorum factae sicut lima deintus: aut sicut aliskilfegi.	Let their extremities be made like a file inside, or like an aliskilfegi.
Si ergo non obedit tibi ad exitum cum istis forcipibus, tunc oportet, ut caues super radicem, et detegas carnem totam, et intromittas instrumentum quod nominatur Palanca parua, cuius forma est haec.	If therefore it does not yield to you for extraction with these forceps, then it is necessary that you carefully pry on the root, and uncover all the flesh, and introduce the instrument called a small lever, whose form is this.
Sit breuis extremitatis, grossae parumper: et non sit imbibitum, ut non frangatur.	Let it be short in length, somewhat thick, and not be soaked, so that it does not break.
Si ergo egreditur radix per illud, est bonum: et si non, iuuare oportet cum istis instrumentis aliis quorum formae sunt istae.	If therefore the root emerges through it, it is good; and if not, it is necessary to assist with these other instruments whose forms are these.
Forma primi triangulatae extremitatis, in qua est quaedam grossitudo.	The form of the first one is triangular with a certain thickness at the extremity.
Forma triangulatae extremitatis subtilis.	The form of a triangular, slender extremity.
Etiam iuuatur cum hoc instrumento habente duos ramos, cuius haec est forma.	Also, it is assisted with this instrument having two branches, whose form is this.
Et cum aliis instrumentis et ferramentis quae praecesserunt in rasione dentium.	And with other instruments and tools that preceded in the discussion of teeth.
Etiam sit iuuamentum cum hoc instrumento quod assimilatur uncino magno, huius formae, triangulatae extremitatis tortae, in qua est quiddam grossitudinis, ut non frangatur: et sit non imbibitum.	There is also assistance with this instrument, resembling a large hook, of this form: a triangular, twisted extremity, with some thickness so it does not break, and should not be soaked.
Et scias, quod instrumenta dentium sunt multa: et similiter reliqua instrumenta non computantur, et artifex prudens, subtilis in arte sua inuenit per se ipsum instrumentum, secundum quod significant ei operatio et aegritudines ipsae.	And know that there are many instruments for teeth, and similarly, other instruments are not counted; and a skillful craftsman, subtle in his art, finds for himself the instrument according to which the operation and illnesses themselves indicate to him.
Quoniam ex agritudinibus sunt ad quas non dixerunt antiqui instrumentum, propter diuersitatem specierum earum.	Because there are illnesses for which the ancients did not describe an instrument, due to the diversity of their types.
Si autem frangatur os ex mandibula, aut ex aliis ossibus oris, aut putrefit: tunc perscrutare super ipsum in loco suo cum eo quod conuenit ei ex instrumentis et forcipibus quae dixi in extractione radicum, et iuuare cum gesti, cuius forma est haec.	If, however, a bone breaks from the jawbone, or from other bones of the mouth, or it rots: then investigate upon it in its place with what is appropriate to it from the instruments and forceps that I have mentioned in the extraction of roots, and assist with a lever, whose form is this.
Sit in eo quiddam grossitudinis paulatim, ut stringatur, uel teneatur cum eo os, et non fugiat et uadat, donec egrediatur os: et restaura locum cum medicinis conuenientibus ad illud.	Let there be some gradual thickness in it, so that the bone is tightened or held with it, and does not escape and go, until the bone emerges; and restore the place with medicines suitable to it.
Si autem in osse est putredo parua, tunc rade ipsum a putredine sua, et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	If however there is a small rot in the bone, then scrape it from its rot, and treat it until it is healed.
De serratura Dentium eminentium super alios.	Of the sawing of teeth protruding above others.
Caput XXXII.	Chapter XXXII.
Quando Dentes eminent non secundum cursum suum naturalem, foeda fit per illud forma: et praecipue quando accidit illud in mulieribus, et puellis, scilicet uenalibus.	When teeth protrude not according to their natural course, an ugly form is produced by it; and especially when this happens in women and girls, namely those who are available (or for sale).
Oportet ergo ut consideres.	Therefore, it is necessary to consider.
Nam si dens est natus post dentem alium, et non locatur, uel est possibilis eius serratura, neque limatura ipsius: tunc eradica ipsum: et si est annexus cum dente alio, tunc incide ipsum cum isto instrumento, cuius haec est forma.	For if a tooth is born after another tooth, and is not placed correctly, or its sawing, or filing is possible, then extract it; and if it is attached to another tooth, then cut it with this instrument, whose form is this.
Est simile rostro paruo, et fit ex ferro indo, acutae extremitatis ualde.	It is similar to a small beak, and is made from tempered iron, with a very sharp tip.
Et sit incisio tua qua ipsum incidis in diebus multis, et propter duriciem dentis, et ut non commoueatur alius ex dentibus.	And let your incision be such that you cut it over many days, and because of the tooth's hardness, and so that another tooth is not moved.
Si autem est eminens expositus limaturae suae: tunc lima ipsum cum lima ex indo, cuius forma est haec.	If however it is prominent, exposed to its filing, then file it with a file of tempered iron, whose form is this.
Sit totum ex indo, et manubrium eius minutorum punctorum ualdae, sicut lima cum qua fiunt acus: cum quo limetur dens paulatim in diebus multis cum facilitate, ut non commoueatur dens, et cadat: deinde leni ipsum, in fine rade ipsum cum quibusdam rasoriis.	Let the whole be of tempered iron, and its handle of small points very numerous, like the file with which needles are made; with which the tooth is filed gradually over many days with ease, so that the tooth is not moved and falls out; then gently smooth it, at the end scrape it with some razors.
Quod si est dens, ex quo frangatur pars, et laedit linguam: tunc oportet ut limes eum etiam, donec auferatur asperitas illius fractionis, et aequetur: et applanetur, et non laedat linguam, neque corrumpat sermonem.	If, however, it is a tooth from which a part has broken off, and it injures the tongue, then it is necessary to file it also, until the roughness of that fracture is removed, and it is made level; and is smoothed, and does not injure the tongue, nor corrupt speech.
¶ De retatione Dentium cum filis auri.	Concerning the re-attaching of teeth with gold wires.
Caput XXXIII.	Chapter XXXIII.
Quando accidit Dentibus anterioribus concussio et commotio a percussione, aut casu: et non potest infirmus stringere super illud quod comedit ut non cadat: et curasti eos cum medicinis stipticis, et non ualuit curatio: tunc ingenium in eis est, ut stringantur cum filo auri: quoniam argentum fit uiride, et putrefit post dies: sed aurum nunquam mutatur.	When the front teeth suffer concussion and displacement from a blow or fall, and the patient cannot firmly bite on that which they eat lest it fall out; and you have treated them with astringent medicines, and the treatment has not been successful, then the procedure is to secure them with gold wire; for silver turns green and rots after days, but gold never changes.
Et sit filum medium in subtilitate et grossicie secundum quantitatem quod capiat inter Dentes.	And let the wire be of medium fineness and thickness according to the amount it must span between the teeth.
Et forma quidem retationis est, ut accipias filum, et intromittas duplum eius inter duos dentes sanos: deinde texeas cum duabus extremitatibus fili inter dentes motos, siue unus sit, aut plures, donec peruenias cum tela usque ad dentem sanum alterius partis.	And the method of reattachment is as follows: take a wire, and insert double its length between two healthy teeth; then weave the two ends of the wire between the displaced teeth, whether one or more, until you reach a healthy tooth on the other side with the weaving.
Deinde itera texturam usque ad partem a qua incaepisti: et stringe manum tuam cum subtilitate et sapientia, donec non remoueatur prorsus: et sit constrictio tua qua stringis filum, apud radices dentium, ut non euadat.	Then repeat the weaving back to the point where you began; and draw your hand with care and skill until the wire is firmly secured; and your tightening of the wire should be near the roots of the teeth, so that it does not slip.
Deinde incide extremitates fili superfluentes cum forficibus: et aggrega utrumque, et conuerte eas cum gesti: et occulta ipsas inter dentem sanum et dentem motum, ut non laedat linguam: deinde dimittatur ita strictum dum remanet.	Then cut the excess ends of the wire with scissors; and bring them together, and turn them with forceps; and conceal them between the healthy tooth and the displaced tooth, so that they do not injure the tongue; then let it remain firmly secured.
Si autem soluitur, aut inciditur, stringe eos cum filo alio, et stabit cum eo taliter tempore toto.	If however it loosens or breaks, secure them with another wire, and it will remain thus throughout the time.
Et haec est forma Dentium, et figura retationis duorum dentium sanorum, et duorum dentium motorum, sicut uides.	And this is the method for teeth, and the form of reattachment of two healthy teeth and two displaced teeth, as you see.
Et quandoque fit, ut redeat dens unus, aut duo post casum urriusque in locis suis, et retentur sicut narrauimus, et remaneant: et non facit illud nisi artifex, prudens, et expertus.	And sometimes it happens that one or two teeth return to their places after displacement, and are secured as we described, and remain; and no one but a skilled, prudent, and experienced craftsman can achieve this.
Et quandoque aptatur aliquod ex ossibus uaccinis: et fit ex eo sicut forma dentis, et ponitur in loco, ex quo munitur dens et stringitur, sicut diximus: et remanet, et seruitur cum eo tempore longo.	And sometimes a piece of bone is fitted: and it is made into the shape of a tooth, and placed in the gap, by which the tooth is strengthened and secured, as we said: and it remains, and serves it for a long time.
¶ De incisione ligamenti quod accidit sub lingua, et prohibet loquelam.	Concerning the incision of the ligament which occurs under the tongue and prevents speech.
Caput XXXIIII.	Chapter Thirty-Four.
Quandoque ligamentum hoc quod accidit sub lingua, est aut naturale, cum quo nascitur homo, aut accidentale, a uulnere quod iam consolidatum est.	Sometimes this ligament under the tongue is either natural, with which a person is born, or accidental, from a wound which has already healed.
Et operatio in eo est, ut aperias os infirmi in capite eius in sinu tuo, et eleua linguam eius: deinde incide illud ligamentum neruosum per latitudinem, donec soluatur lingua a retentione sua.	And the operation on it is that you open the patient's mouth at his head in your presence, and elevate his tongue; then cut that nervous ligament across its width, until the tongue is released from its restraint.
Quod si in eo fuerit quiddam duriciei et nodationis, et fuerit illud ex consolidatione uulneris: tunc proiice in illud uncinum, et finde illud per latitudinem, donec incidas ligamentum, et soluatur nodatio.	If there be hardness and knotting in it, and it be from the consolidation of a wound, then apply a hook to it, and split it across its width, until you reach the ligament, and the knot is released.
Et caue, ne sit fissura in profundo carnis, et incidas arteriam illic, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	And beware lest there be a fissure deep in the flesh, and you cut the artery there, and a flow of blood occurs.
Deinde colluatur in uestigio incisionis cum aqua rosata, aut cum aceto, aut aqua frigida.	Then wash the site of the incision with rose water, or vinegar, or cold water.
Deinde pone sub lingua licinium ex lino, quod teneat infirmus in omni nocte: ut non consolidetur secundo.	Then place a linen bandage under the tongue, which the patient must hold in place all night, so that it does not consolidate a second time.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis, tunc pone super locum zegi tritum.	If a flow of blood occurs, then place pounded zegi on the site.
Si uero uincit te sanguis, tunc cauteriza locum cum cauterio lentiginoso, quod conuenit ad illud: deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	If, however, blood overcomes you, then cauterize the site with a lentiginous cautery, suitable for it; then treat it with the rest of the treatment, until it is healed.
¶ De extractione Ranulae quae fit sub lingua.	Concerning the extraction of a Ranula located under the tongue.
Caput XXXV.	Chapter XXXV.
Quandoque accidit sub lingua apostema quod assimilatur Ranae paruae, prohibens linguam ab operatione sua naturali: et fortasse magnificatur adeo, donec implet os.	Sometimes a boil occurs under the tongue, resembling a small frog, hindering the tongue from its natural function; and perhaps it enlarges to such an extent that it fills the mouth.
Et operatio in eo est, ut aperias os infirmi coram sole: et considera apostema.	And the operation in it is to open the mouth of the sick person before the sun; and to consider the boil.
Si ergo uides ipsum fusci coloris, aut nigri, durum, cui non inuenit infirmus sensum: tunc non tangas ipsum, quoniam est cancer.	If therefore you see it of a dark color, or black, hard, to which the sick person has no feeling: then do not touch it, for it is cancer.
Et si est decliue ad albedinem, in quo est humiditas, tunc proiice in ipsum uncinum, et incide ipsum cum spatumili subtili, et libera ipsum ab omni parte.	And if it is inclined to whiteness, in which there is moisture, then insert a hook into it, and cut it with a fine spatula, and free it from every side.
Quod si uincit te sanguis in hora tuae operationis, tunc pone super ipsum zegi tritum, donec abscindatur sanguis: deinde redi ad operationem tuam, donec extrahas ipsum cum complemento eius.	If blood overcomes you during your operation, then put crushed zegi on it until the blood ceases; then return to your operation, until you extract it with its entirety.
Deinde colluatur cum aceto et sale: et cura ipsum reliqua curatione conueniente ad illud, donec sanetur.	Then wash it with vinegar and salt; and treat it with the appropriate further treatment for it, until it is healed.
¶ De curatione apostematis duarum Amigdalarum.	Concerning the treatment of an abscess of the two tonsils.
Caput XXXVI.	Chapter XXXVI.
Quandoque accidunt inter guttur godad, id est, glandulae, quae similantur algodad, quae accidunt deforis: et nominantur duae Amigdalae: quas quando curas cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et non sanantur, tunc considera.	Sometimes there occur between the throat and the glands, which are similar to the algodad, which occur externally; and they are called the two tonsils: which when you treat with what we have said in the division, and they do not heal, then consider.
Si ergo est apostema durum, fusci coloris, pauci sensus: tunc non tangas ipsum cum ferro.	If therefore it is a hard abscess, of a dark color, with little sensitivity, then do not touch it with iron.
Et si est rubei coloris, et radix eius est grossa: tunc non tangas ipsum etiam cum ferro, timens fluxum sanguinis, imo dimitte ipsum, donec maturetur.	And if it is of a reddish color, and its root is thick, then do not touch it with iron either, fearing a flow of blood, but rather leave it until it matures.
Et tunc aut perforabis ipsum: aut rumpetur per se.	And then either you will pierce it, or it will burst by itself.
Et si est albi coloris, rotundum, et est radix eius subtilis: tunc oportet ipsum incidi.	And if it is of a white color, round, and its root is fine, then it is necessary to incise it.
Et operatio in ipso est, ut consideres ante operationem suam, si quieuit apostema eius calidum quiete completum, aut imminuitur quadam diminutione: tunc ergo fac sedere infirmum coram sole, et caput eius sit in sinu tuo: et aperi os eius, et accipiat seruiens inter manus suas, et premat linguam eius inferius cum instrumento, cuius haec est forma.	And the operation on it is that, before its operation, you should consider if its abscess has rested quietly and been completely finished, or is diminishing with some reduction: then therefore, make the sick person sit in the sun, and let his head be in your lap; and open his mouth, and let a servant take between his hands, and press his tongue downwards with an instrument, whose form is this.
Fiat ex argento, aut aere, quod sit subtile sicut cultellus.	Let it be made of silver or bronze, which is as fine as a knife.
Cum ergo premis cum eo linguam, et ostenditur tibi apostema, et cadit super ipsum uisus tuus: tunc accipe uncinum, et fige ipsum in amigdalam, et extrahe eam ad exteriora quantum potes, praeter quod trahas cum ea aliquid ex tunicis.	When therefore you press the tongue with it, and the abscess is shown to you, and your sight falls upon it, then take a hook, and fasten it to the tonsil, and pull it outward as far as you can, besides pulling out some of the tissues with it.
Deinde incide eam cum instrumento, cuius haec est forma quae sequitur.	Then cut it with an instrument, whose form is this which follows.
Assimilatur forficibus: uerumtamen extremitates eius sint curuatae, ita quod orificium cuiusque earum est in directo alterius acute: unde cura ut sit ex ferro indo, aut alfuled imbibitum.	It is similar to shears; however, its ends should be curved, so that the opening of each is in a direct line with the other's sharp point: therefore, take care that it is made of tempered iron, or of well-tempered steel.
Si autem non est praesens hoc instrumentum, tunc incide ipsum cum spatumili, cuius haec est forma.	If however this instrument is not present, then cut it with a spatula, whose form is this.
Sit acutum a parte una, non acutum a parte altera.	It should be sharp on one side, not sharp on the other.
Et postquam incidis amigdalam unam, incide alteram secundum hanc eandem speciem incisionis.	And after you have incised one tonsil, cut the other according to this same method of incision.
Deinde post incisionem gargarizet infirmus cum aqua frigida, aut cum aceto et aqua.	Then, after the incision, let the patient gargle with cold water, or with vinegar and water.
Si autem accidat ei fluxus sanguinis, gargarizet cum aqua in qua bulliti sunt cortices granatorum: aut folia myrti, et similia illis ex stipticis, donec abscindatur fluxus sanguinis: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	If however a flow of blood occurs, let him gargle with water in which the peels of pomegranates have been boiled: or with myrtle leaves, and similar astringent things, until the flow of blood is stopped: then treat him until he is healed.
Et quandoque nascuntur in gutture apostemata alia, praeter amigdalas duas.	And sometimes other abscesses arise in the throat, besides the two tonsils.
Incide ergo ea secundum quod dixi in incisione duarum amigdalarum aequaliter.	Therefore, cut it according to what I have said in the incision of the two tonsils equally.
Et ego quidem iam medicatus fui mulierem ex apostemate, quod natum erat inter guttur eius, quod trahebat ad fuscedinem, pauci sensus, quod iam fere clauserat guttur: et mulier respirabat a meatu stricto, et iam prohibuerat ei comestionem, et potum aquae: et iam peruenerat ad mortem, si remansisset uno die, aut duobus diebus.	And I myself have already treated a woman for an abscess which had arisen between her throat, which was drawing toward blackness, few senses, which had almost closed her throat; and the woman was breathing through a narrow passage, and I had already forbidden her eating and drinking water; and she had already come to death if it had remained for one or two days.
Et apostema tantum ascenderat, quod emiserat duos ramos, donec exierant super duo foramina nasi.	And the abscess had risen so much that it had sent out two branches, until they came out above the two nostrils.
Properaui ergo festinanter, et fixi in unum eorum uncinum.	I therefore quickly hastened and fixed a hook in one of them.
Deinde traxi ipsum, et tracta ex eo est portio magna.	Then I pulled it, and a large piece came out from it.
Deinde abscidi eam, ubi comprehendi ex foramine nasi.	Then I cut it off where I grasped it from the nostril.
Deinde feci illud ei quod processit ex foramine nasi altero.	Then I did the same to that which came out from the other nostril.
Deinde aperui os eius, et pressi linguam eius: et postea fixi uncinum in ipsum apostema: deinde abscidi ex eo partem eius, et non cucurrit ex eo nisi sanguis paucus: absolutum est ergo guttur mulieris, et incepit statim bibere aquam, deinde accepit ex cibo.	Then I opened its mouth and pressed its tongue; and afterwards I fixed a hook in the abscess; then I cut off a piece from it, and only a little blood flowed from it: thus the woman's throat was cured, and she immediately began to drink water, then to take food.
Non ergo cessaui incidere ex illo apostemate multotiens tempore longo: et apostema succedebat loco eius quod incidebam, donec prolongatum est nimis et cum ea illud.	Therefore I did not cease to cut from that abscess many times over a long time, and the abscess followed in the place of what I was cutting, until it was extended too much, and with it that.
Ingeniaui ergo, et cauterizaui apostema inter guttur.	Therefore I devised, and cauterized the abscess between the throat.
Stetit ergo ab additione: deinde ambulaui a parte, et non sciui quid fecit Deus cum ea post me.	Therefore it stood still from further additions; then I walked away, and did not know what God did with it after me.
¶ De incisione apostematis uuulae.	Concerning the incision of an abscess of the uvula.
Caput XXXVII.	Chapter XXXVII.
Quando descendit catarrus ad uuulam, et apostematur, et est long: tunc ipsa nominatur perpendicularis: et si est in inferiori parte grossa, rotunda, tunc ipsa nominatur uua.	When the catarrh descends to the uvula, and becomes abscessed, and is long, then it is called a perpendicular one; and if it is in the lower part thick, round, then it is called a grape.
Quando curatur cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio: et uides quod apostema calidum quieuit ab ea, et est subtilis: tunc oportet ut incidas eam.	When it is treated with what we said in the division, and the treatment does not help; and you see that the abscess, hot, has ceased from it, and is subtle; then it is necessary that you cut it.
Et quae ex ea est aggregata rotunda, et non est ei longitudo, et est sanguinea, aut fusci coloris, aut nigri, et non est ei sensus: tunc oportet ut deuites incisionem eius.	And that which is aggregated round from it, and has no length, and is bloody, or of a dusky colour, or black, and has no feeling: then it is necessary to avoid its incision.
In ea enim est timor super infirmum.	For there is fear upon the infirm.
Oportet ergo quando uides eam secundum modum quem dixi ex albedine, et longitudine sua, ut facias sedere infirmum coram sole: et premas linguam eius cum instrumento, cuius praecessit narratio: deinde fige uncinum in uuam, et trahe eam inferius: et incide eam cum uno duorum instrumentorum quae dixi in incisione duarum amigdalarum.	Therefore, when you see it according to the manner I said, from its whiteness and length, you must make the sick person sit facing the sun; and press his tongue with the instrument, the account of which preceded; then fix a hook in the grape, and pull it downwards; and cut it with one of the two instruments which I said in the incision of the two tonsils.
Et oportet ut non incidas ex ea, nisi illud quod additur super naturalem terminum sine additione.	And it is necessary that you do not cut from it, except that which is added beyond the natural limit without addition.
Nam si tu incidis ex ea plus, laedes uocem et sermonem.	For if you cut from it more, you will harm the voice and speech.
Deinde post incisionem utere eo quod narrauimus in incisione duarum amigdalarum: et cura eam, donec sanetur.	Then after the incision, use that which we described in the incision of the two tonsils, and care for it until it heals.
Si autem terretur infirmus ab incisione: tunc oportet ut utaris ingenio in cauterizatione eius absque timore et pauore.	If however the sick person is terrified by the incision, then it is necessary that you use skill in cauterizing it without fear and trembling.
Et modus cauterii in ea non est, nisi cum aqua acuta: et est, ut ponas caput infirmi in sinu tuo.	And the method of the cautery on it is not, except with sharp water, and it is that you place the head of the sick person in your bosom.
Deinde preme linguam eius cum instrumento quod diximus.	Then press his tongue with the instrument that we mentioned.
Deinde accipe ex aqua quam dixi tibi in capitulo cauterizandi, et confice cum ea calcem non extinctam, et pone eam non spissam, neque subtilem, et imple ex ea concauitatem huius instrumenti, cuius haec est forma.	Then take from the water which I told you about in the chapter on cauterizing, and make with it quicklime that is not extinguished, and place it neither thick nor thin, and fill with it the concavity of this instrument, which has this form.
Sit extremitati eius in qua ponitur medicina concauitas, sicut concauitas cochlearis radii.	Let the concavity in which the medicine is placed be, like the concavity of the radius of a spoon.
Et pone instrumentum cum medicina super uuulam ipsam: et infirmus sit iacens super latus suum, ut currat saliua ex ore eius ex intrinseca medicina, ut non descendat ex ea ad guttur ipsius aliquid, et laedat ipsum.	And place the instrument with the medicine upon the uvula itself, and let the sick person lie on his side, so that saliva flows from his mouth from the internal medicine, so that nothing descends from it to his throat and harms him.
Deinde tene manum tuam cum medicina.	Then hold your hand with the medicine.
Et tu ex primas eam super uuulam quantitate medietatis horae, donec uideas eam iam denigratam, et sedatam mordicationem medicinae.	And you should keep it on the uvula for about half an hour, until you see it blackened and the biting of the medicine calmed down.
Et si uis ut accipias cotum, et inuoluas ipsum super extremitatem radii, et infundas cotum cum medicina, et intromittas radium cum coto in cannulam desuper, donec adhaereat cotum super uuulam.	And if you wish to take the phlegm, and wrap it around the end of the radius, and introduce the phlegm with the medicine, and insert the radius with the phlegm into the cannula from above, until the phlegm adheres to the uvula.
Fac illud multotiens, donec consequaris quod uis de cauterizatione uuae.	Do that repeatedly, until you achieve what you want in terms of cauterizing the uvula.
Deinde dimitte eam: ipsa namque arescit et cadit post tres dies, aut quatuor.	Then leave it; for it will dry and fall off after three or four days.
Quod si indiges ut iteres medicinam, itera ipsam: et post cauterizationem absterge in circumitu uuae cum coto imbibito in butyro, et mundifica cum eo quod est in circumitu eius ex medicina: et colluatur cum aqua frigida.	If you need to repeat the medicine, repeat it.  And after the cauterization, wipe around the uvula with a cotton swab dipped in butter, and clean whatever is around it from the medicine; and rinse with cold water.
Et curetur extrinsecus cum embrocis, et deintus cum gargarismis, donec sanetur.	And treat it externally with poultices, and internally with gargles, until it is healed.
Haec ergo species curationis est salubrior incisione et longinquior a timore.	This method of treatment is therefore more beneficial than incision and further from fear.
Et quandoque curatur uuula etiam cum eo quod est subtilius quam cauterium et incisio: curatur enim cum suffumigatione, secundum hunc modum.	And sometimes the uvula is treated even with something finer than cautery and incision; for it is treated with fumigation, according to this method.
Sume calamentum, et hyssopum, et origanum, et rutam, et sseah, et chamomillam, et abrotanum, et similia eis ex herbis: et aggrega ea omnia, aut quaedam eorum in olla, et submergantur cum aceto, et bulliant: et olla sit lutata cum luto decenter: et sit in medio ollae foramen, super quod componatur instrumentum concauum secundum hunc modum.	Take calamint, hyssop, oregano, rue, sseah, chamomile, and wormwood, and similar herbs: and gather them all, or some of them, in a pot, and soak them with vinegar, and let them boil. And the pot should be properly coated with clay; and there should be a hole in the middle of the pot, over which a concave instrument should be placed according to this method.
Fiat ex argento, aut aere: et intromittatur extremitas, in qua est granatum, in os infirmi, donec ascendat uapor ad uuulam super cannulam, donec obscuretur uuula multum.	Let it be made of silver or bronze; and let the end, on which is the pomegranate, be inserted into the sick person's mouth, until the vapor rises to the uvula above the cannula, until the uvula is very dark.
Deinde itera super ipsam multotiens, donec arescat.	Then repeat over it many times, until it dries.
Et caue, ne facias hanc curationem in principio aduentus apostematis.	And beware, lest you perform this treatment at the beginning of the abscess's onset.
Plaerumque enim addit in apostemate: et non oportet ut facias illud nisi apud declinationem apostematis eius calidi.	For it usually adds to the abscess; and you should not do it unless at the decline of its hot stage.
Si autem non est praesens tibi hoc instrumentum, tunc accipe cannam, et compone in extremitate eius corticem oui: ut non comburatur os infirmi: quoniam cortex oui prohibet uaporem comburere os: et haec est ex bona curatione cum salute.	If, however, this instrument is not present for you, then take a reed, and attach an egg-shell to its end; so that the sick person's mouth is not burned; because the egg-shell prevents the vapor from burning the mouth; and this is from a good treatment with safety.
¶ De extractione spinarum, et ossium de gula.	Concerning the extraction of thorns and bones from the throat.
Caput XXXVIII.	Chapter Thirty-Eight.
Multotiens adhaeret in gutture os, aut spina piscis, aut aliud.	Often a bone, or a fishbone, or something else adheres in the throat.
Oportet ergo ut extrahas quod ex eis est apparens super quod cadit uisus, postquam premis linguam cum instrumento apud solem, et declaratur tibi quod est in gutture.	Therefore, it is necessary to extract what is apparent to the sight, after pressing the tongue with an instrument in the sun, and it is revealed to you what is in the throat.
Et quod non apparet tibi et occultatur in gutture, oportet ut facias uomere infirmum antequam digeratur cibus in stomacho.	And what is not apparent to you and is hidden in the throat, it is necessary to make the vomit weak before the food is digested in the stomach.
Fortasse enim egredietur res annexa per uomitum.	For perhaps the attached thing will be expelled by vomiting.
Aut deglutiat infirmus frustum napi, aut radicem lactucae, aut deglutiat buccellam panis sicci: aut accipiat frustum spongiae marinae siccae lenis: et liga ipsum in filo, deinde deglutiat ipsum.	Or let the weak person swallow a piece of turnip, or a root of lettuce, or swallow a piece of dry bread; or let him take a piece of soft dried sea sponge, and tie it to a thread, then swallow it.
Cum ergo peruenit ad locum ubi sunt spinae, aut os, et extrahitur, tunc egreditur.	When therefore it arrives at the place where the spines or bone are, and is extracted, then it emerges.
Si ergo non egreditur cum eo quod diximus: tunc utere instrumento ex plumbo secundum hanc formam.	If therefore it does not emerge with what we have said, then use an instrument of lead according to this form.
Sit grossius quam Radius parumper, et in extremitate eius sit curuitas, quam intromittat in guttur suum cum facilitate: et ipse habeat caput suum eleuatum sursum.	Let it be thicker than a radius a little, and at its extremity let there be a curvature, which he should introduce into his throat with ease; and let him hold his head raised upwards.
Et caueat a tactu suae epiglotis, ut non accidat ei tussis, et impellat cum eo os, aut spinam, aut intromittat ipsum medicus manu sua.	And let him beware of touching his epiglottis, lest a cough befall him, and push with it the bone or spine, or let the physician introduce it with his hand.
Verum quod infirmus intromittat, hoc est melius: propter scientiam suam de loco rei annexae: et impellat inferius, aut trahat manum suam cum instrumento sursum, totum illud secundum quantitatem quae praeparatur ei, donec egrediatur.	However, that the infirm person introduce it is better, because of their knowledge of the location of the attached thing: and let him push downwards, or pull his hand with the instrument upwards, all that according to the quantity prepared for him, until it emerges.
¶ De extractione Sanguisugae.	Concerning the extraction of a leech.
Caput XXXIX.	Chapter Thirty-Nine.
Quando medicatur sanguisuga cum eo quod dixi in diuisione ex curatione cum medicinis, et non confert, tunc considera in gutture infirmi coram sole, siue apud solem postquam premis linguam eius cum instrumento quod narraui tibi.	When a leech is treated with what I have said in the division of treatment with medicines, and it does not work, then consider the throat of the sick person in the light of the sun, or in the sunlight, after pressing his tongue with the instrument that I have told you about.
Si ergo cadit uisus tuus super sanguisugam, extrahe eam cum uncino paruo, aut cum gesti subtilibus decenter.	If, therefore, your sight falls upon the leech, extract it with a small hook, or with slender instruments appropriately.
Quod si non est possibile cum eis: tunc accipe cannulam concauam, et intromitte eam in guttur infirmi usque prope guttur: deinde intromitte in concauitatem cannulae ferrum ignitum cum igne.	If this is not possible with them, then take a concave cannula, and insert it into the throat of the sick person until near the throat; then insert into the concavity of the cannula a heated iron with fire.
Fac illud multotiens: et abstineat infirmus ab aqua tota die.	Do this repeatedly; and let the sick person abstain from water all day.
Deinde accipiat uitreatam plenam aqua frigida, et aperiat os eius in ea: et colluat os suum cum ea, et non deglutiat ex ea aliquid: et moueat aquam una hora post aliam cum manu sua.	Then let him take a vial full of cold water, and open his mouth in it; and let him rinse his mouth with it, and not swallow anything from it; and let him move the water one hour after another with his hand.
Sanguisuga enim ilico cum sentit aquam cadit.	For the leech immediately, when it feels the water, falls.
Si autem non egreditur cum eo quod narrauimus, tunc suffumiga infirmum cum cimicibus, aut cum asa cum instrumento quod narraui in suffumigatione uuulae.	If however it does not emerge with what we have narrated, then fumigate the sick person with leeches, or with asa with the instrument that I have narrated in the fumigation of the uvula.
Fac illud multotiens, quoniam ipsa cadet.	Do that many times, since it will fall.
Et modus operationis in suffumigatione est, ut accipias ollam, in qua sint prunae uiuae cum igne: et olla sit cooperta cum coopertorio, in cuius medio sit foramen: et componatur in illo foramine extremitas instrumenti.	And the method of operation in fumigation is, that you take a pot, in which there are live prunes with fire; and the pot is covered with a cover, in whose middle there is a hole; and the end of the instrument is placed in that hole.
Deinde proiice suffumigationem, et ponat infirmus os suum in extremitate cannulae, et claudat os suum, ut non egrediatur suffumigatio, donec scias quod suffumigatio iam peruenit ad sanguisugam.	Then project the fumigation, and let the sick person place his mouth at the end of the tube, and close his mouth, so that the fumigation does not escape, until you know that the fumigation has already reached the leech.
Nam sanguisuga statim cadet.	For the leech will fall immediately.
Quod si non cadit, tunc itera suffumigationem multotiens.	If it does not fall, then repeat the fumigation many times.
Et toleret infirmus sitim, et comedat salsa, et allia, et non bibat aquam.	And let the sick person endure thirst, and eat salt, and garlic, and not drink water.
Necesse est ergo ut egrediatur cum hoc regimine.	Therefore, it is necessary that it departs with this treatment.
Et haec est forma instrumenti cum quo extrahitur sanguisuga ex gutture, quando cadit super ipsam uisus.	And this is the form of the instrument with which the leech is extracted from the throat, when it falls upon it in sight.
Est simile forcipibus, sicut uides: nisi quia est ei haee curuitas quae intromittitur ad guttur.	It is similar to forceps, as you see: except that it has this curvature which is inserted into the throat.
Et extremitas eius similis ori auis quae nominatur ciconia, in quo est asperitas limae: quando comprehendit aliquid, non dimittit ipsum omnino.	And its extremity is similar to the beak of a bird called a stork, on which is the roughness of a file: when it grasps something, it does not release it at all.
¶ De apertione Apostematum, et eorum sectione, et cura in genere.	Concerning the opening of abscesses, and their incision, and their general care.
Caput XL.	Chapter XL.
Apostematum species sunt multae, multorum modorum, secundum quod uenit rememoratio eorum, scilicet unius, et unius in hoc libro: et sunt diuersae in perforatione eorum, et sectione ipsorum ex duobus modis.	Abscesses are of many kinds, and many modes, according to their recollection, namely one, and one in this book; and they differ in their perforation, and incision from two modes.
Quorum unus est ex specie apostematis in seipso, et eo quod comprehendit ex humiditatibus.	One of which is from the species of an abscess in itself, and from that which it encompasses of humors.
Et modus secundus est propter loca, in quibus accidit ex corpore.	And the second mode is because of the places in which it occurs within the body.
Quoniam apostema accidens in capite, est aliud ab apostemate accidente in ano: et apostema accidens in loco carnoso, est aliud ab apostemate accidente in iuncturis: et unicuique eorum est iudicium suum ex operatione.	Since an abscess occurring in the head is different from an abscess occurring in the anus; and an abscess occurring in a fleshy place is different from an abscess occurring in the joints; and each of them has its own judgment from the operation.
Et ex apostematibus sunt quae non oportet ut perforentur, nisi post maturationem saniei in eis, et complementum eius: et ex eis sunt, quae oportet ut perforentur, dum sunt cruda, et non maturantur secundum complementum.	And of abscesses there are some that should not be pierced, unless after the maturation of the pus within them, and its completion; and of them there are some that should be pierced while they are raw, and do not mature according to completion.
Sicut apostemata quae sunt propinqua iuncturis.	Such as abscesses that are near the joints.
Quoniam apostema quando accidit prope iuncturam, et prolongatur esse eius, donec putrefit quod est in circumitu eius fortasse corrumpuntur ligamenta, aut nerui illius iuncturae: quare est caussa propior contractionis illius membri.	Because an abscess, when it occurs near a joint and prolongs its existence until that which is around it putrefies, perhaps the ligaments or nerves of that joint are corrupted: therefore it is the more proximate cause of the contraction of that member.
Aut est apostema apud membrum principale: quoniam si tu tardas perforationem eius, donec maturetur, nocebit uel illi, uel per illud membro principali.	Or it is an abscess near a principal member: because if you delay its incision until it matures, it will harm either that member or the principal member through it.
Aut est prope anum, perfora ergo ipsum immaturum: et non oportet, ut perfores, apostema crudum, non completae digestionis, nisi quod est prope anum, ut non putrefiat profundum, et longetur ad interiora ani, et fiat fistula, aut fiat in termino eius quod non sanatur.	Or it is near the anus, therefore pierce it unripe; and it is not necessary to pierce a raw, incompletely digested abscess, unless it is near the anus, so that it does not putrefy deeply, and extend to the interior of the anus, and become a fistula, or be in a terminal state that does not heal.
Oportet ut scias horam perforationis apostematis, quod maturatum est secundum complementum: et est apud sedationem doloris, recessionem febris, et diminutionem rubedinis, et pulsationis, et acuitatem capitis apostematis: et reliqua signa.	It is necessary to know the time of incision of the abscess, which is mature according to completion: and it is from the cessation of pain, the recession of fever, and the lessening of redness, and pulsation, and sharpness of the abscess head: and the remaining signs.
Et oportet, ut facias eandem perforationem in inferiori loco apostematis, et uehementioris eminentiae: et sit perforatio uadens in longitudine corporis, si apostemata sunt in partibus manuum et pedum, et locis lacertorum, et chordarum, et neruorum, et arteriarum, et ad ultimum in omnibus locis aequalibus, quibus non est reflexio.	And it is necessary that you make the same incision in the lowest part of the abscess, and of more prominent elevation; and let the incision be in the length of the body, if the abscesses are in the parts of the hands and feet, and in the places of tendons, and chords, and nerves, and arteries, and finally in all equal places where there is no reflection.
In illis autem quae reflectuntur, uade cum perforatione secundum illud membrum.	In those, however, that are reflected, proceed with the incision according to that limb.
Quando uero apostema est in locis carnosis: tunc melius est ut dimittas perforationem eius, donec confirmetur eius digestio, sicut diximus secundum complementum.	However, when an abscess is in fleshy areas, then it is better to leave its incision until its digestion is confirmed, as we have said according to completion.
Quoniam si tu perforas ipsum ante illud, prolongatur cursus uirus ex eo, et est multae sordis et sordiciei, et fortasse indurantur labia eius, et profunditas eius.	Because if you incise it before that, the course of the virus from it is prolonged, and there is much filth and uncleanliness, and perhaps its edges and depth will harden.
Et quaedam apostemata perforantur secundum latitudinem corporis apud necessitatem: aut secundum illud quo indiget membrum.	And some abscesses are incised across the body, according to necessity, or according to what the limb requires.
Et oportet, ut administres in apostematibus paruis perforationem paruam, et in apostematibus magnis perforationem amplam: aut sectiones multas per similitudinem magnitudinis apostematis.	And it is necessary that you administer a small incision in small abscesses, and a large incision in large abscesses, or multiple incisions according to the abscess's size.
Et sunt ex apostematibus, in quibus oportet ut concauetur cutis: et incidatur quando iam facta est sicut pannus, et facta est in termino, quod iam mortua est: sicut illud quod accidit in multis, ut dubelet, et bubonibus.	And there are some abscesses in which the skin must be hollowed out; and incised when it has already become like a rag, and has reached its end, so that it is already dead; like that which happens in many cases, such as boils and buboes.
Et ex eis sunt quae secantur sectione habente tres angulos.	And some of them are incised with an incision having three angles.
Et ex eis est, ex quo inciditur sicut figura folii myrti.	And some of them are incised like the shape of a myrtle leaf.
Sicut apostema inguinum.	Like a groin abscess.
Et ex eis sunt in quibus administratur sectio rotunda, et sectio lunaris: et similes eis ex sectionibus.	And among them are some in which a round incision, and a crescent-shaped incision are administered; and similar incisions to them.
Illud uero cui non est caput, sicut sunt apostemata lenia superficialia, oportet ut perfores ipsum perforatione superficiali, uel plana tantum.	That which does not have a head, however, such as mild superficial abscesses, ought to be pierced with a superficial, or merely a flat, perforation.
Et oportet, quando apostema est grossum, et iam collegit saniem multam, et perforas ipsum, ut non properes et extrahas pus totum in illa hora: imo extrahe ex ipso partem eius.	And it is necessary, when the abscess is large and has already collected much pus, and you pierce it, that you do not hurry and extract all the pus at that time; rather, extract only a part of it.
Deinde opila apostema usque ad diem alium.	Then, close the abscess until another day.
Deinde extrahe quiddam ex pus iterum.	Then extract some more of the pus again.
Fac illud multotiens secundum gradationem, donec egrediatur: praecipue si infirmus est debilis uirtutis, aut mulier praegnans, aut puer paruus, aur senex decrepitus: spiritus enim animalis ab animali multotiens resoluitur cum egressione saniei: et fortasse moritur infirmus, et tu non percipis.	Do this repeatedly according to stages, until it is expelled; especially if the patient is weak in strength, or a pregnant woman, or a young child, or an old, decrepit person: for the animal spirit of the animal is repeatedly released with the expulsion of the pus; and perhaps the patient dies, and you do not perceive it.
Caue ergo hoc capitulum cautela magna.	Therefore, beware of this chapter with great caution.
Et post perforationem tuam, qua ista perforas apostemata, oportet ut abstergas uulnus: et considera.	And after your perforation, with which you perforate these abscesses, it is necessary that you cleanse the wound: and consider.
Si ergo est uulnus apostematis paruum, aut est sectio plana, tunc administra licinia ex lino, aut coto antiquo.	If therefore the wound of the abscess is small, or is a flat incision, then apply bandages of linen, or of old cloth.
Et si est apostema magnum, et fissurae perforationis multae sunt, oportet tunc ut intromittas in omnem fissuram licinium, donec perueniant adinuicem.	And if the abscess is large, and there are many fissures of perforation, it is then necessary that you insert a bandage into every fissure, until they meet each other.
Et si in apostemate abscidisti partem cutis, aut in circumitu concauasti eam: tunc oportet ut impleas eam coto ueteri, aut sicut quando texitur pannus, aut raditur lanugine lini absque humiditate: et stringe ipsum usque ad tertium diem.	And if in the abscess you have removed part of the skin, or hollowed it out in the circumference: then it is necessary that you fill it with old cloth, or as when cloth is woven or wool is shaved from linen without moisture: and bind it tightly for up to three days.
Deinde proiice ipsum, et cura illud cum eo quod oportet ex unguento, donec sanetur.	Then remove it, and treat it with what is necessary from the ointment, until it is healed.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis in hora tuae operationis, tunc administra aquam frigidam, et acetum, postquam imbibitur in eis pannus: et ponis ipsum super locum fluxus sanguinis multotiens.	If however a flow of blood occurs during your operation, then apply cold water and vinegar, after having soaked a cloth in them: and place it repeatedly over the site of the bleeding.
Si autem perseuerat fluxus sanguinis, tunc oportet ut administres regimen, et curationem, et pulueres, quae narraui in locis multis huius nostri libri, et ex diuisione.	If however the bleeding persists, then it is necessary that you administer the regimen, and the treatment, and the powders, which I have described in many places of this book of ours, and in its division.
Si autem est in tempore hyemis, et locus apostematis est multorum neruorum: tunc oportet ut infundas puluillos cum uino, et oleo calidis: et ponas eos super loca.	If, however, it is during wintertime, and the site of the abscess is of many nerves: then it is necessary that you place heated cloths with wine and oil on those areas.
Et si fuerit in aestate, et loca sunt carnosa: tunc oportet ut ponas puluillos imbibitos in aqua, et oleo, aut eum uino et oleo, et totum illud frigidum.	And if it is in summer, and the areas are fleshy: then it is necessary that you place cloths soaked in water and oil, or in wine and oil, and make it all cold.
Donec quando erit dies tertius, sicut diximus, tunc oportet ut soluas apostema, et abstergas ipsum, et administres in curatione eius quod ei conuenit, donec sanetur.	Until when the third day arrives, as we have said, then it is necessary to open the abscess, and cleanse it, and administer to it in its treatment whatever is appropriate, until it is healed.
Hoc est ergo quod necessarium est ex cognitione curationis apostematum uniuersaliter.	This, therefore, is what is necessary from the knowledge of the treatment of abscesses universally.
Secundum semitam uero distinctionis, iam dixi de omni apostemate, qualiter est uia ad curationem eius capitulatim singulariter.	Following the path of distinction, however, I have already spoken of every abscess, how its cure is capitulated singularly.
¶ De sectione apostematum quae accidunt in cute capitis.	Concerning the incision of abscesses that occur on the scalp.
Caput XLI.	Chapter XLI.
Accidunt in cute capitis apostemata parua, et sunt ex speciebus Nodorum, quos continent tunicae, quae sunt eis sacci: quasi ipsa sint hausolati gallinae.	Small abscesses occur on the scalp, and they are of the kind of tumors, which the coverings contain, as if they were the sacs of a hen's egg.
Et ipsorum species sunt multae.	And their varieties are many.
Ex eis sunt pingues: et ex eis sunt quae continent humiditatem similem limo: et ex eis quae continent humiditatem similem frisatis et pultibus: et eis similibus, et ex eis sunt, quae sunt lapidea dura.	Some of them are fatty; and some contain moisture similar to mud; and some contain moisture similar to gruel and porridge; and similar to these, and some are hard, stony.
Et in sectione omnium, et ipsorum extractione non est timor, dum apud ipsorum sectionem non facit contrarietatem arteria.	And there is no fear in the incision and extraction of all of them, as long as the incision does not conflict with an artery.
Et operatio in sectione eorum est, ut experiaris ea cum instrumento, cuius forma uenit post haec, quod nominatur Intromissum, donec scias quid contineat.	And the operation in their incision is, to test them with an instrument, whose form comes after this, which is called the Intromissum, until you know what it contains.
Nam si est illud quod continet humiditas, tunc seca ipsum sectione secundum longitudinem sectione superficiali: secundum hanc formam.	For if it contains moisture, then cut it with a superficial incision along its length, according to this form.
Et incipe cum sectione ex linea b. ad lineam, g. Cum ergo euacuatur humiditas, tunc excoria kistin quae continet illam humiditatem, et non dimittas ex ea aliquid penitus.	And begin with an incision from line b to line g. When the moisture is therefore evacuated, then scrape the container that contains that moisture, and do not leave anything from it at all.
Multotiens enim redit, si remanet ex ea aliquid.	For it often returns if anything remains from it.
Deinde submerge cotum in unguento aegyptio, si est praesens: et si non, in aqua et sale: et imple cum eo uulnus, et dimitte ipsum usque ad diem alium.	Then immerse the cotum in Egyptian ointment, if it is present; and if not, in water and salt: and fill the wound with it, and leave it until another day.
Ipsum enim corrodet quod remansit ex kisti.	For it will corrode what remained from the kist.
Deinde itera super ipsum cotum cum aegyptio secundo, et tertio, et si indiges illo, donec confidas quia non remanserit ex kisti aliquid, tunc enim cura uulnus cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then repeat over the cotum with Egyptian ointment a second, and a third time, and if you need it, until you are confident that nothing has remained from the kist; then treat the wound with the ointment until it is healed.
Quod si apostema continet nodum pinguem: tunc seca ipsum secundum hanc formam, sectione habente formam crucis: et proiice uncinos inter duolabia sectionis, et excoria ipsum ab omni parte: et conare uirtutem tuam in extractione tunicae quae continet ipsum.	If the abscess contains a fatty tumor, then cut it according to this form, the incision having the shape of a cross; and insert hooks between the two sides of the incision, and scrape it from every side; and try your skill in extracting the membrane that contains it.
Si autem contrarietatem facit tibi arteria, tunc fac illud quod narrabo tibi post.	If, however, an artery opposes you, then do that which I shall tell you later.
Et similiter fac in apostemate, si est lapideum, ex sectione, et curatione eadem, secundum quod diximus.	And likewise do in an abscess, if it is stony, by the same incision and treatment, according to what we have said.
Et sectio super apostema lapideum est facilior: quoniam est pauci sanguinis et humiditatis.	And the incision over a stony abscess is easier, because it has little blood and moisture.
Et quandoque sunt quaedam horum apostematum quae sunt in capite in quibusdam hominibus, cum quibus penitus non est humiditas.	And sometimes there are some of these abscesses which are on the head in some men, with which there is absolutely no moisture.
Quod est: quia ego secui super apostema in capite mulieris uetulae, et inueni apostema sicut lapis solidus et durus, asper, albus, qui non poterat frangi: et si percuteretur cum eo aliquis proiiciendo, uulnerat ipsum.	Which is so because I incised an abscess on the head of an old woman, and found an abscess like a solid, hard, rough, white stone, that could not be broken; and if someone struck it while throwing, it wounded them.
In aliis uero apostematibus accidentibus in capite, praeter haec scilicet apostemata quae accidunt in capitibus puerorum, et apud radices aurium, sectio eorum omnium sit sectio superficialis.	In other abscesses, however, occurring on the head, except for those abscesses which occur on the heads of children and at the roots of the ears, the incision of all of them should be a superficial incision.
Vel pone perforationem eorum semper ab inferiori parte eorum, ut alleuietur cursus saniei ad inferiora.	Or make their perforation always from their lower part, so that the flow of pus may be eased downwards.
Deinde cura ea cum eo quod conuenit eis ex curatione.	Then treat them with what is suitable for them from the treatment.
¶ De sectione Strophularum in collo.	Concerning the incision of tumors on the neck.
Caput XLII.	Chapter XLII.
Multotiens acccidunt ista apostemata in collo, et sub assellis, et inguinibus: et quandoque accidunt in reliquo corpore.	These abscesses often occur in the neck, and under the armpits, and in the groin: and sometimes they occur in the rest of the body.
Et super illa quae ex eis accidunt in collo, sunt unum, et multa: et generantur ab inuicem: et omnis Strophula ex eis est intra tunicam propriam ei, sicut est in nodis et apostematibus capitis, sicut narrauimus.	And those that occur in the neck from them are single, and multiple; and they are generated from one another; and every tumor from them is within its own tunic, just as in the knots and abscesses of the head, as we have narrated.
Et species harum Strophularum sunt multae.	And the types of these tumors are many.
Et ex eis enim sunt lapideae: et ex eis sunt quae continent humiditates: et ex eis sunt malignae, quae non obediunt curationi.	And from them some are stony; and from them some contain humors; and from them some are malignant, which do not obey treatment.
In illa ergo quam ex eis uides bonae dispositionis in tactu, cuius manifestum est propinquum colori cutis, et mouetur ad omnem partem, et non est annexa cum neruis colli, neque cum guidegi, neque cum arteria, neque est profunda: oportet ut seces eam sectione superficiali a superiori parte ad inferiorem partem corporis ex linea, b. ad lineam, g. et excoria eam ab omni parte: et extende duo labia cutis cum uncino, aut cum uncinis multis, si indiges illo, sicut diximus in apostematibus capitis, et extrahe eam paulatim.	Therefore, in that one from them which you see to be of good disposition to the touch, whose proximity to the skin color is evident, and which moves in every direction, and is not attached to the nerves of the neck, nor to the veins, nor to the artery, nor is deep: it is necessary to remove it by a superficial incision from the upper part to the lower part of the body along a line, b, to line, g, and to scrape it from every side; and to spread the two skin flaps with a hook, or with many hooks, if you need it, as we said in the abscesses of the head, and to extract it gradually.
Et est super cautelam, ut non incidatur uena, aut neruus.	And it is a precaution that a vein or nerve be not cut.
Et sit spatumile non acutum ualde: ut non addat tibi manum tuam cum incisione, aut inquietet infirmum, et incidas quod non est necesse.	And let the scalpel not be very sharp, so that it does not injure your hand with the incision, or disturb the sick person, and you cut what is not necessary.
Si autem incidis uenam, aut arteriam, aut prohibet te ab operatione, tunc pone in uulnus zegi tritum, aut quosdam pulueres qui abscindunt sanguinem, et stringe uulnus, et dimitte ipsum, donec quiescat acuitas apostematis, et mollificetur uulnus: uel incipit et uult putrefieri.	However, if you cut a vein, or artery, or it hinders you from the operation, then put into the wound ground zegi, or some powders that cut off blood, and bind the wound, and leave it, until the sharpness of the abscess subsides, and the wound softens; or it begins and wants to putrefy.
Nam sanguis abscinditur tuncia Redi ergo ad operationem tuam, donec compleas.	For the blood is cut off then.  Return therefore to your operation, until you complete it.
Deinde inquire digito tuo indice, si remansit aliquid ex Strophulis aliis paruis: ergo incide eas, et munda eas.	Then investigate with your index finger if any remnants of the other small strophuli remain; therefore, cut and clean them.
Quod si est in radice Strophulae uena magna: tunc oportet ut non incidas illam Strophulam ex radice sua: imo oportet ut liges eam cum filo duplato forti, et dimittas eam donec cadat per se absque nocumento.	If there is a large vein at the root of the strophulus, then you should not cut that strophulus from its root; rather, you should tie it with a strong doubled thread, and leave it until it falls off by itself without harm.
Deinde imple uulnus coto ueteri, quod iam submersisti in unguento aegyptio.	Then fill the wound with old lint, which you have already soaked in Egyptian ointment.
Deinde cura ipsum.	Then treat it.
Si inciditur Strophula tota, tunc oportet ut aggreges labia duo uulneris: et suas ipsum statim, postquam uides quia prorsus non remansit superfluitas.	If the entire strophulus is cut, then you should bring together the two edges of the wound and close it immediately, after you see that there is no excess remaining.
Si autem uides quod remansit superfluitas propter magnitudinem Strophulae, tunc oportet ut intendas ad incidendam radicem eius, et extrahendam eam: et administra suturam quam diximus.	If, however, you see that excess remains due to the size of the strophulus, then you should aim to cut its root and extract it, and apply the suture we described.
Et quae ex Strophulis continet humiditates, perfora illam perforatione superficiali: ut appareat tibi locus maturitatis eius: et pone perforationem ab eo quod sequitur inferius corporis, sicut diximus.	And any strophulus containing moisture, pierce it with a superficial puncture, so that you may see its place of maturity, and make the puncture from the part that follows below its body, as we said.
Deinde administra post perforationem licinia cum unguento, et similia eis, ut corrodat quod remansit ex corruptione, donec quando uides uulnus iam mundatum esse: tunc cura ipsum cum unguento generatiuo carnis, donec sanetur.	Then, after the puncture, apply dressings with ointment, and similar things, to corrode what remains of the corruption, until you see the wound already cleansed; then treat it with a generative flesh ointment, until it is healed.
¶ De sectione Epiglotis ab apostemate intra guttur accidente.	Concerning the incision of the epiglottis from an abscess occurring within the throat.
Caput XLIII.	Chapter XLIII.
Dixerunt antiqui hanc sectionem in Epigloti, et non uidi aliquem in terra nostra, qui eam fecerit: et haec est scriptura sermonis eorum.	The ancients spoke of this incision in the epiglottis, and I have seen no one in our land who has performed it; and this is the record of their words.
In habentibus autem synanchiam, oportet ut deuitetur sectio Epiglotis: cum non fiat iuuamentum per illud: propterea, quod omnes uenae et pulmo sunt infirmi.	However, in those suffering from quinsy, the incision of the epiglottis should be avoided; since no benefit is derived from it; because all the veins and lungs are weak.
In illis uero qui habent apostema calidum in ore, aut gutture, aut duabus amigdalis, quando non est aegritudo in cannali, oportet uti sectione Epiglotis, ad fugiendum ex perditione quae fit ex praefocatione.	However, in those who have a hot abscess in the mouth, or throat, or both tonsils, when there is no illness in the canal, one should use the incision of the epiglottis, to avoid the destruction that comes from suffocation.
Oportet ergo quando uolumus illud, ut secemus Epiglotim sub tribus circulis Epiglotis, aut quatuor, sectione parua per latitudinem, in eo quod est inter duos circulos per quantitatem, quod sit sectio in sifac, non in cartilagine: et iste quidem locus est conueniens sectioni, quoniam est priuatus carne, et uasa sanguinis ab eo sunt longinqua.	Therefore, when we wish to do so, we should incise the epiglottis below three or four circles of the epiglottis, with a small incision in width, at the point between two circles; an incision to be made in the syriac, not in the cartilage.  This place is suitable for incision, since it is devoid of flesh and the blood vessels are distant from it.
Quod si medicator est timidus, tunc oportet ut extendat cutem gutturis cum uncino.	If the surgeon is timid, then it is necessary to extend the skin of the throat with a hook.
Deinde findat cutem, donec quando peruenit ad cannalem: deuitet uas sanguinis, si uidet ex eis aliquid.	Then he should split the skin until, when he reaches the canal, he should avoid blood vessels, if he sees any of them.
Deinde secet sifac quod narrauimus: et significatur super sectionem cannalis ex phlegmate quod egreditur ex ea, cum eo quod disrumpitur, et abscisione uocis.	Then he should cut the syriac, as we have described: and the incision of the canal is signaled by the phlegm that emerges from it, along with the rupturing and severing of the voice.
Et dimitte uulnus apertum tempore aliquo.	And leave the wound open for a time.
Cum ergo remouetur hora in qua timetur praefocatio, aggrega duo labia uulneris cutis, et sue ipsam solam absque cartilagine.	When therefore the hour in which suffocation is feared is removed, bring together the two lips of the wound of the skin, and suture only it itself, without the cartilage.
Deinde administra medicinas quae faciunt nasci carnem, usquequo sanetur.	Then administer the medicines that cause flesh to grow, until it is healed.
Inquit Albucasis.	Says Albucasis.
Summa huius sermonis quem narrauimus, expositio non est, nisi quando uident, quod aliquod horum apostematum iam opilauit guttur infirmi: et sublimatus est infirmus super mortem, et uult intersecari anhelitus eius: uadunt ad secandum Epiglotim, ut respiret infirmus super locum uulneris quadam respiratione, et saluetur a morte: et propter hoc praeceperunt dimittere uulnus apertum, donec consumatur malicia aegritudinis, et est malicia eius tribus diebus, et quasi ipsa: tunc ergo praecaeperunt suere uulnus, et curare ipsum, donec sanetur.	The summary of this discourse which we have narrated is not an exposition, unless they see that some of these abscesses have already obstructed the throat of the sick person; and the sick person is raised above death, and his breathing is about to be cut off; they proceed to cut the epiglottis, so that the sick person may breathe over the wound with a certain respiration, and be saved from death; and for this reason they prescribed leaving the wound open, until the malice of the illness is consumed, and its malice is three days, and almost as much; then they prescribed sewing up the wound and treating it until it is healed.
Et illud quod uidi per me ipsum est, quod una ancilla accaepit cultellum, et misit cum in guttur suum, et incidit cum eo partem cannalis pulmonis.	And that which I saw with my own eyes is that a certain maid took a knife and thrust it into her throat, and cut a part of the lung passage with it.
Et uocatus sum ad curationem eius, et inueni eam mugire, sicut est mugitus mortui.	And I was called to treat her, and I found her moaning, like the moan of a dead person.
Detexi ergo a uulnere, et inueni sanguinem qui egressus fuerat ex uulnere paruum.	Therefore, I examined the wound, and found blood that had escaped from the small wound.
Confisus ergo sum, quod ipsa non absciderat uenam, neque guidegi: et uentus egrediebatur ex uulnere.	Therefore, I was confident that she had not cut a vein, nor a jugular; and wind was escaping from the wound.
Properaui ergo, et sui uulnus, et curaui ipsum, donec sanum est: et non accidit ancillae aliquid, nisi raucedo in uoce: et rediit post dies ad meliorem dispositionum suarum.	I quickly therefore dressed the wound, and treated it until it was healthy; and nothing happened to the maid except a hoarseness in her voice; and she returned after days to her better state.
Hinc ergo dico: quod in sectione Epiglotis non est timor.	Hence, I say: that there is no fear in the cutting of the epiglottis.
¶ De sectione Herniae gutturis.	Concerning the cutting of a hernia of the throat.
Caput XLIIII.	Chapter XLIV.
Hoc Apostema nominatum Hernia gutturis, est apostema magnum, secundum colorem corporis: et est in mulieribus multum.	This abscess, called a hernia of the throat, is a large abscess, the color of the body; and it is very common in women.
Et est secundum duos modos: aut enim est naturale: aut est accidentale.	And it is in two ways: either it is natural, or it is accidental.
In naturali certe non est ingenium.	Certainly, in the natural one, there is no ingenuity.
Accidentale uero est secundum duos modos: quorum unus est similis nodis pinguibus.	However, the accidental one is in two ways: one of which is similar to fatty lumps.
Et modus alter, est similis apostemati quod fit ex nodatione arteriae.	And the other way is similar to an abscess that forms from the knotting of an artery.
Et in ipso est timor, et non oportet ut praesumptio fiat ad ipsum cum ferro, nisi in eo quod est paruum: et tu proba ipsum, et inuestiga ipsum cum Intromisso.	And in it there is fear, and it is not necessary that presumption be made upon it with iron, unless it is small.  And you shall probe it, and investigate it with an instrument.
Si ergo inuenis ipsum simile nodo pingui, et non est suspensum cum aliqua uenarum: tunc seca ipsum, sicut secantur nodi: et extrahe ipsum cum eo quod continet ex kisti, si est in kisti: et si non, tunc perscrutare totum eius.	If therefore you find it similar to a fatty lump, and it is not connected to any vein, then cut it, as lumps are cut: and extract it with whatever it contains from a cyst, if it is in a cyst; and if not, then explore its entire area.
Deinde cura locum cum eo quod oportet ex curatione, donec sanetur.	Then treat the area with what is appropriate from treatment, until it heals.
¶ De sectione super species Nodorum.	Concerning the incision upon the varieties of Lumps.
Caput XLV.	Chapter XLV.
Nodorum multae sunt species, et ego iam dixi omnes species eorum in diuisione: et oportet ut narrem hic differentiam inter Nodum, et Exituram: cum sit dubitationem faciens.	There are many kinds of lumps, and I have already mentioned all their types in the division [of lumps]; and it is necessary to describe here the difference between a lump and a fistula, since it is a source of doubt.
Dico ergo, quod cum Exitura est caliditas, et febris, et dolores uehementes, donec sedatur ebullitio superfluitatis, et completur putrefactio: tunc enim quiescunt febris et calor.	Therefore, I say that when a fistula has heat, fever, and severe pain, until the ebullition of the excess fluid subsides and the putrefaction is complete, then the fever and heat cease.
Cum Nodo uero non est caliditas, neque febris, neque dolores, et continet eos kistis sifachin, qui est eis saccus proprius, et est secundum colorem corporis: et est incaeptio eorum sicut cicer, et fit sicut batecha, et maior et minor.	However, with a lump there is no heat, nor fever, nor pain, and it contains those little pouches called sifachin, which are their own sacs and are the same color as the body; and their beginning is like a chickpea, and it becomes like a batecha, and larger and smaller.
Et sunt secundum duas species: aut pingues: aut continent humiditatem.	And they are of two types: either fatty or containing moisture.
Et colores humiditatis sunt multi, secundum quod dixi in diuisione.	And the colors of the moisture are many, according to what I have said in the division.
Oportet ergo, quando peruenis ad curationem Nodi, ut experiaris eum, et inquiras ipsum in primis cum instrumento quod nominatur Intromissum, secundum quod ueniet forma eius in capitulo quod est post hoc.	Therefore, when you come to the treatment of a lump, you must examine it and inquire into its form first with an instrument called an Intromissum, according to how its shape will be described in the chapter that follows this one.
Et modus inquisitionis apostematum, et Nodorum omnium est, ut accipias hoc instrumentum, et intromittas ipsum in humidiorem locum, quem inuenis in apostemate: et tu reuolue digitos tuos cum eo paulatim, donec scias quod instrumentum iam penetrauit cutem.	And the method of examining abscesses and all lumps is that you should take this instrument and insert it into the wettest place that you find in the abscess; and you should slowly revolve your fingers with it until you know that the instrument has already penetrated the skin.
Deinde ultima manum tuam secundum mensuram magnitudinis apostematis.	Then place your hand over it according to the size of the abscess.
Deinde extrahe Intromissum, et considera illud quod egrediur in uestigio eius.	Then withdraw the Intromissum, and consider what comes out in its wake.
Si ergo egreditur humiditas currens, quicunque color sit: tunc seca ipsum sectione superficiali, secundum quod dixi in reliquis apostematibus.	If, therefore, running moisture of any color comes out, then cut it with a superficial incision, as I have said in other abscesses.
Et si non egreditur humiditas in uestigio Intromissi, tunc scias quia est pinguis: seca ergo super ipsum sectione habente formam crucis, secundum formam hanc, sicut docui te: et suspende ipsum cum uncinis, et excoria cutem ab omni parte cum facilitate: et custodi kistin si potes super illud, ut extrahas ipsam sanam cum Nodo.	And if no moisture comes out in the wake of the Intromissum, then know that it is fatty.  Therefore, cut over it with a cross-shaped incision, according to this form, as I have taught you. And suspend it with hooks, and scrape the skin from all sides with ease; and preserve the cyst if possible upon it, so as to extract the sound one with the lump.
Si autem disrumpitur kistis apud operationem, et non est possibile extrahere ipsam sanam, multotiens enim accidit illud, tunc extrahe ipsam frustatim, donec non remaneat ex ea aliquid.	However, if the cyst breaks during the operation, and it is not possible to extract it whole, for this often happens, then extract it piece by piece until nothing remains of it.
Nam si remanet ex ea aliquid parum, aut multum, redit Nodus secundum plurimum.	For if any small or large part remains of it, the lump returns very often.
Quod si uincit te, et remanet ex eo parum: tunc imple uulnus apud completionem tuam, quibusdam pulueribus corrosiuis acutis: et stringe uulnus, et pone supra ipsum quod sedet apostema calidum, et cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	If, however, it overcomes you, and a small part remains, then fill the wound at your completion with certain sharp corrosive powders, and constrict the wound, and place upon it what sits warm over the abscess, and treat it with the rest of the treatment until it is healed.
Si ergo est Nodus magnus, tunc sue duo labia eius, et cura ipsum cum eo quod incarnat.	If therefore the lump is large, then sew its two lips together, and treat it with what causes it to heal.
Si autem est tibi contraria uena pulsatilis, aut non pulsatilis: tunc propera, et imple locum zegi trito, et dimitte ipsum strictum duobus diebus, aut tribus, donec putrefiat uulnus, et quiescat ebullitio sanguinis: deinde redi ad incidendum illud quod remansit ex Nodo.	If, however, there is a pulsating or non-pulsating vein, then hurry and fill the place with ground zegi, and leave it constricted for two or three days until the wound is rotten and the ebullition of blood ceases; then return to cutting what remains of the lump.
¶ De foris instrumentorum pro sectione et perforatione.	Concerning the exterior instruments for cutting and piercing.
Caput XLVI.	Chapter XLVI.
EX Eis sunt formae Intromissorum, et sunt trium specierum.	Among them are the forms of probes, and they are of three kinds.
Ex eis enim est magnum, et ex eis est medium, et ex eis est paruum.	For among them is a large one, and among them is a medium one, and among them is a small one.
Fiant ex ferro alfulud quadratarum extremitatum decenter, ut festinent introitum in apostemate.	Let them be made of iron, alfulud, with square ends, fittingly, so that they hasten entry into the abscess.
Et istae sunt formae Experientium, et no, id est, perforantia: et unum eorum nominatur beris, idest, peforans: et sunt trium specierum.	And these are the forms of instruments, and, no, that is, perforating ones: and one of them is called beris, that is, piercing: and they are of three kinds.
Ex eis enim est magnum, et medium, et paruum.	For among them is a large one, and a medium one, and a small one.
Conueniunt, ut inuestigentur per ea apostemata, et exiturae, et fistulae, et bubones ab eo quod inter ea est ex ossibus.	They are suitable for investigating abscesses, exits, fistulas, and buboes through that which is between them from the bones.
Et aliis fiunt rotunda, tersa, lenia, sicut acus magnae quibus subsellia suuntur, ex citrino scilicet, aut ex aere, aut ferro, aut argento.	And others are made round, smooth, and polished, like large needles with which saddles are sewn, namely from amber or bronze or iron or silver.
Et meliora eorum sunt quae fiunt ex citrino.	And the best of them are those made from amber.
Et fiunt Experientia etiam de plumbo nigro, quae conueniunt ut per ea experiantur fistulae, quarum concauitate sunt reflexiones, ut reflectantur cum lenitate sua cum illis reflexionibus.	And also experiences are made from black lead, which are suitable for experiencing fistulas, whose concavity has reflections, so that they may be reflected with their gentleness along those reflections.
Et sunt iterum trium specierum.	And they are again of three kinds.
Quoniam ex eis sunt longa, ex eis media, et ex eis breuia, secundum quantitatem amplitudinis fistulae et stricturae eius.	Because some of them are long, some medium, and some short, according to the amount of the fistula's width and its constriction.
Forma Vncinorum, et sunt multarum specierum.	The shape of hooks, and they are of many kinds.
Quoniam ex eis sunt simplices, scilicet quibus est curuitas una: et sunt trium specierum sicut uides, Magni, Medii, et Parui.	Because some of them are simple, namely those with a single curve: and they are of three kinds as you see, Large, Medium, and Small.
Et ex eis sunt Vncini caeci: et sunt trium specierum.	And from among them are blind hooks: and they are of three kinds.
Et ex eis sunt uncini habentes duas curuaturas, et sunt trium specierum: et ex eis sunt uncini habentes tres curuaturas, et sunt trium specierum: et omnes isti sunt necessarii in loco suo.	And from among them are hooks having two curves, and they are of three kinds: and from among them are hooks having three curves, and they are of three kinds: and all these are necessary in their place.
Et istae sunt formae Scalpellorum, quibus secantur et excoriantur Nodi, et apostemata: et sunt trium specierum: quoniam ex eis est magnum, medium, et paruum.	And these are the shapes of scalpels, with which knots and abscesses are cut and scraped: and they are of three kinds: because from among them is a large, a medium, and a small one.
Eorum extremitates quibus fit sectio sunt acutae, extremitates aliae sunt non acutae: et non ponuntur taliter, nisi ut cum eis fiat iuuamentum in excoriatione Nodorum apud timorem incisionis uenae, aut nerui: et ut sanetur per ea infirmus, et inueniat tranquillitatem parumper ex adustione quam inuenit apud excoriationem apostematis.	Their cutting edges are sharp, the other edges are not sharp: and they are not placed thus, unless they are to be of assistance in scraping knots in fear of cutting a vein or nerve: and that the sick person may be healed by them, and find a little respite from the burning pain that he finds in the scraping of the abscess.
Istae sunt Magda, et sunt specierum trium.	These are large ones, and are of three kinds.
Fiunt ex aere, et sunt similia Radio, cum quo fit alcohol: et in extremitate lata est puncta Spatumilis occultata: et in ea currit ad interiora, et ad exteriora quando uis, sicut uides.	They are made of bronze, and are similar to the tool with which alcohol is made: and on the broad end is a hidden point of a spatula: and on it it runs inward and outward when you wish, as you see.
Forma Spatumilium quae absconduntur inter digitos apud perforationem apostematum: et non percipiunt ea infirmi: et sunt trium specierum, magnum, medium, et paruum.	The shape of spatulas that are hidden between the fingers when perforating abscesses: and the sick do not perceive them: and they are of three kinds, large, medium, and small.
Fomae Ventosarum cum quibus abscinditur fluxus sanguinis: et sunt trium specierum, magnae, mediae, et paruae.	The shapes of cupping glasses with which the flow of blood is removed: and they are of three kinds, large, medium, and small.
Fiant ex aere, aut citrino, rotundae, ad longitudinem parumper, sicut uides: et sint ad subtilitatem.	Let them be made of bronze or brass, round, a little in length, as you see: and let them be of a fine thinness.
Et oportet ut sint istae species Ventosarum apud te magnae, et paruae: ut abscindas per eas sanguinem cum uelocitate apud necessitatem, et tunc quando non est tibi praesens medicina.	And it is necessary that these kinds of cupping glasses be large and small with you: so that you may remove blood with speed when necessary, and then when no medicine is available to you.
Verumtamen non utaris eis in abscisione sanguinis in omni loco corporis, et non utaris nisi in locis carnosis: sicut lacertis cruris, et coxae, et lacertis brachiorum, et mammillarum, et uentris, et inguinum, et similibus eis, ex lacertis carnosis, humidis.	However, do not use them to remove blood in every part of the body, and do not use them except on fleshy areas: such as the thighs of the legs, and the hips, and the arms, and the breasts, and the belly, and the groin, and similar fleshy, moist parts.
Et quandoque fiunt ex eis instrumenta parua alia similia corticibus fisticorum, secundum suam formam: quibus abscinditur sanguis quando fluit ex loco phlebotomiae, aut apud incisionem uenae, aut arteriae: et quandoque fiunt ex eis rotundae secundum hanc formam.	And sometimes other small instruments like hazelnuts are made from them, according to their shape, with which blood is removed when it flows from a phlebotomy site or at the incision of a vein or artery, and sometimes they are made round in this shape.
¶ De cura Mammillarum hominum quae mammillis mulierum assimilantur.	Concerning the care of men's breasts that resemble women's breasts.
Caput XLVII.	Chapter XLVII.
Quandoque inflantur Mammillae quorundam hominum apud complementum somni (id est, cum incipiunt pollui in somno) donec similantur mammillis mulierum: et remanent apostemosae foede.	Sometimes the breasts of some men swell at the completion of sleep (that is, when they begin to be polluted in sleep) until they resemble women's breasts, and remain foul-looking sores.
Qui ergo abhorret illud, oportet ut secet super mammillas sectione lunari, secundum hanc formam ex linea, b. ad lineam, g. Deinde excoria pinguedinem totam.	Therefore, whoever abhors that, it is necessary that he cut over the breasts with a crescent-shaped incision, according to this form from line b to line g.  Then scrape away all the fat.
Postea imple uulnus ex medicamine incarnatiuo.	Afterwards, fill the wound with a flesh-inducing medicine.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris cum sutura, et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then bring together the two lips of the wound with sutures, and care for it until it is healed.
Si autem declinat mammilla ad inferiora, et mollificatur propter magnitudinem suam, sicut accidit mulieribus: tunc oportet ut findatur in duobus lateribus suis superioribus duabus sectionibus similibus figurae lunari, quarum unaquaeque continetur cum altera apud fines utriusque, donec sit linea maior continens minorem, secundum hanc formam ex linea, b. ad lineam, g. Postea excoria cutem quae est inter duo labia, et aufer pinguedinem, et administra quod diximus de sutura et pulueribus, quod est necessarium ex curatione, donec sanetur.	If, however, the breast inclines downwards and softens due to its size, as happens with women, then it is necessary to cut it in two, along its upper sides, with two incisions similar to a crescent shape, each one containing the other at the ends of each, until a larger line contains a smaller one, according to this form from line b to line g. Afterwards, scrape off the skin between the two lips, and remove the fat, and administer what we said about sutures and powders, what is necessary from the treatment, until it is healed.
Si autem non comples incisionem eius quod oportet te incidere, propter inquietudinem infirmi, aut propter fluxum sanguinis: tunc oportet ut impleas uulnus coto submerso unguento corrosiuo, et dimitte ipsum, donec corrodat illud quod remansit ex pinguedine.	However, if you do not complete the incision that you ought to make, due to the patient's distress, or because of blood flow, then you must fill the wound with cloth soaked in corrosive ointment, and leave it until it has corroded what remains of the fat.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then care for it until it is healed.
¶ De perforatione apostematis, quod accidit sub Titillico.	Concerning the perforation of an abscess that occurs under the armpit.
Caput XLVIII.	Chapter XLVIII.
Ista apostemata quae accidunt sub Titillico, sunt ex speciebus Strophularum dura, quae continet kistis, et ex eis sunt quae continent humiditates.	These abscesses which occur under the armpit are of the kind of hard Strophulae, which contain cysts, and of those which contain moisture.
Quae ergo sunt ex eis quae continent humiditates, oportet ut secentur sectione lunari, secundum hanc formam, ex linea b. ad lineam, g. cum ergo euacuatur totum quod est in apostemate ex sanie, tunc imple ipsum coto ueteri, et dimitte ipsum usque ad diem alium.	Therefore, those of them that contain moisture should be incised with a lunate incision, according to this form, from line b. to line g.  When, therefore, all that is in the abscess, of pus, is evacuated, then fill it with old lint, and leave it until another day.
Deinde auferatur cotum, et curetur cum unguento conueniente ad illud, donec sanetur.	Then remove the lint, and treat it with a suitable ointment for it, until it is healed.
Quod si apostema fuerit ex specie nodorum Strophularum, tunc scinde super ipsum, sicut diximus in sectione super Strophulas aequaliter.	If the abscess is of the kind of the knotty Strophulae, then cut upon it, as we said in the section on Strophulae, equally.
Si autem extenditur uulnus in hoc ut emittat pus, tunc administra in eo cauterium, secundum quod diximus in eo quod praemissum est.	If however the wound extends in this so that it emits pus, then apply a cautery to it, according to what we said in what was previously stated.
¶ De sectione apostematis quod accidit propter Arteriam et Venam.	Of the incision of the abscess that occurs because of the Artery and Vein.
Caput XLIX.	Chapter XLIX.
Quando disrumpitur Arteria, et consolidatur cutis quae est supra eam, tuno multotiens accidit inde apostema: et similiter accidit Venae etiam, ut accidat in ea apostema et inflatio.	When an artery is ruptured, and the skin above it is consolidated, then often an abscess occurs from it: and similarly it happens to the vein also, that an abscess and swelling occur in it.
Et signa quibus cognoscitur, quod apostema et inflatio sint propter Arteriam et Venam, sunt: quoniam, quando apostema est propter arteriam, est longum, aggregatum in profundo corporis: et quando impellis apostema digits tuis, sentis quasi sit ei stridor.	And the signs by which it is known that the abscess and swelling are due to the Artery and Vein, are: because, when the abscess is due to the artery, it is long, aggregated deep in the body: and when you press the abscess with your fingers, you feel as if there is a creaking sound to it.
Et illud quod est propter Venam, est rotundum in manifesto corporis.	And that which is due to the Vein, is round on the surface of the body.
Et sectio super hoc apostema est error, et praecipue quod est sub ascellis, et inguinibus, et collo, et in locis multis corporis: et est magnum ualde.	And incision upon this abscess is an error, and especially that which is under the armpits, and the groins, and the neck, and in many places of the body: and it is very great.
Oportet ergo ut deuitetur eius cura cum ferro, et quod ex eis etiam est in extremitatibus, aut in capite, oportet ut deuitetur.	Therefore, its treatment with iron should be avoided, and what is also from them in the extremities, or in the head, should be avoided.
Super illud ergo quod ex eis est ex inflatione orificii Arteriae, finde in cute sectione in longitudine.	Upon that which is from them, from the inflation of the artery's orifice, make a cut into the skin in the length.
Deinde aperi sectionem cum uncinis, postea Arteriam: et libera eam ex tunicis, donec detegatur.	Then open the incision with hooks, afterward the Artery; and free it from its coverings, until it is uncovered.
Deinde intromitte sub ea acum, et fac eam penetrare usque ad latus aliud, et stringe Arteriam cum filo duplo in duobus locis, secundum quod docui te in extractione duarum Arteriarum quae sunt in timporibus.	Then insert a needle beneath it, and cause it to penetrate to the other side, and tie the Artery with a double thread in two places, according to what I taught you in the extraction of the two Arteries which are in the temples.
Deinde punge locum, qui est inter duo ligamenta cum spatumili, donec egrediatur sanguis qui est in eo totus, et soluatur apostema.	Then prick the place, which is between the two ligatures with a lancet, until the blood that is in it entirely emerges, and the abscess is resolved.
Deinde administra curationem quae generat pus, donec cadant ligamenta: postea cura illud cum unguentis conuenientibus ad illud, donec sanetur.	Then administer a treatment that produces pus, until the ligatures fall off; afterwards treat it with suitable ointments for it, until it is healed.
Quod si fuerit apostema propter sectionem Venae, tunc oportet ut teneas manu tua quod tibi possibile est ex apostemate cum cute.	If it is an abscess because of the incision of a Vein, then it is necessary that you hold with your hand what is possible for you of the abscess with the skin.
Deinde intromitte acum sub loco quem tenuisti manu tua, et fac eam penetrare: et sit in ea filum duplum, donec extrahas ipsum ex latere altero.	Then insert a needle beneath the place you have held with your hand, and cause it to penetrate; and let there be a double thread on it, until you extract it from the other side.
Deinde liga cum ipso apostema ligamento bono: secundum quod dixi tibi in ligamento uuae, a duabus partibus cum duabus extremitatibus fili.	Then tie the abscess with a good ligature, according to what I told you concerning the ligature of the grape, from two sides with two ends of the thread.
Si autem times quod extrahatur filum, tunc intromitte acum aliam cum filo alio sub apostemate toto apud incisionem acus: preme, et stringe fila tua in quatuor locis.	If however you fear that the thread will be pulled out, then insert another needle with another thread beneath the entire abscess near the incision of the needle; press, and tighten your threads in four places.
Deinde seca apostema in medio sui, donec quando egreditur quod in eo est: tunc incide superfluitatem cutis, et dimitte quod ligatum est ex ea.	Then cut the abscess in its middle, until what is in it comes out; then cut the excess skin, and leave that which is bound from it.
Deinde pone super ipsum puluillum quem submersisti in uino, et oleo.	Then place on it a poultice which you have soaked in wine and oil.
Deinde administra curationem, quae fit cum liciniis et unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then administer treatment, which is done with bandages and ointments, until it is healed.
¶ De apostemate quod accidit ex torsione Neruorum.	Concerning the abscess that arises from the twisting of nerves.
Caput L.	Chapter L.
Sicut accidit apostema in Arteria et Vena, similiter accidit apostema in Neruis: quod accidit in eis percussio, aut accidit a labore superfluo, et similibus: et fit plurimum illis in locis adiutoriorum, aut calcanei, et in omni loco in quo mouentur iuncturae: et est apostema graue.	Just as an abscess occurs in the artery and vein, so too does an abscess occur in the nerves: which occurs in them by impact, or by excessive exertion, and similar causes; and it happens most frequently in the joints of the hands or feet, and in every place where joints move: and it is a serious abscess.
Similatur color eius reliquo corpori, et est in pluribus dispositionibus absque dolore: et quando stringitur cum uehementia, sentit in eo infirmus simile stupori.	Its color is similar to the rest of the body, and it is in many cases painless; and when it is pressed forcefully, the sufferer feels a sensation similar to numbness in it.
Et non est apostema aggregatum in profundo corporis, imo est sub cute, et ipsum mouetur ad omnem partem, et non uadit ad anteriora, uel ante, neque retro ad posteriora.	And it is not a deep-seated, collected abscess, but rather under the skin, and it moves to every part, and does not progress forwards, or backwards.
Quod ergo ex eis est in iuncturis, non oportet ut inuadatur cum ferro.	Therefore, those that are in the joints should not be incised with iron.
Fortasse enim accidet contractio.	For perhaps contraction will result.
In illo autem quod ex eis est in capite, aut in fronte, finde cutem cum spatumili.	However, in those that are on the head or forehead, split the skin with a spatula.
Si ergo est apostema paruum, tunc tene ipsum cum forficibus, et abscinde ipsum a radice.	If, therefore, it is a small abscess, then hold it with scissors, and cut it away from the root.
Et si est magnum, tunc suspende ipsum eum uncino, et excoria ipsum: deinde aufer ipsum, et aggrega uulnus cum sutura: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	And if it is large, then suspend it with a hook, and scrape it: then remove it, and stitch the wound: and treat it until it is healed.
¶ De sectione apostematis, quod accidit in uentre.	Concerning the incision of an abscess that occurs in the belly.
Caput LI.	Chapter LI.
Accidunt quibusdam hominibus multotiens in uentribus eorum, et in reliquis corporibus ipsorum, thelil, quae nominantur Fungalia, per similitudinem ipsorum cum fungis.	Many people have, many times, in their bellies and in their other bodies, tumours, which are called Fungalia, by their resemblance to fungi.
Quorum radix est subtilis, et ipsorum caput est grossum, et conuersa sunt labia eorum.	Their root is subtle, and their head is large, and their lips are turned outwards.
Et est ex eis paruum: et est ex eis quod magnificatur ualde.	And some of them are small, and some of them greatly enlarge.
Et ego quidem iam uidi uirum, et in uentre eius erant duo thelil, quae erant magis quam rebus aliis similia fungis: non erat differentia inter ea, alba, minutae radicis, et inuersabantur labia eorum, et findebantur, et humiditas currebat ex eis semper.	And I myself have seen a man, and in his belly were two tumours, which were more like fungi than other things: there was no difference between them, being white, small-rooted, and their lips turned outwards, and they split open, and moisture flowed from them constantly.
Incidi ergo ea, et inueni in pondere unius quasi X et VIII uncia et in altero quasi VI uncia Et operatio in incisione eorum est, ut consideres tunc, si infirmus est humidus, et color thelil est albus, humidum, subtilis radicis: tunc incide ipsum cum spatumili lato, et sint in praesentia tua cauteria in igne.	Therefore I cut them, and found in the weight of one, about ten and eight ounces, and in the other, about six ounces.  And the operation in cutting them is that you must consider, if the sick person is moist and the color of the tumour is white, moist, with a fine root: then cut it with a broad spatula, and have cauteries present in fire.
Multotiens enim expellitur apud sectionem eius sanguis multus: propera ergo si te uincit sanguis, tunc cauteriza ipsum.	For often much blood is expelled at its incision; therefore, hurry if blood overwhelms you, then cauterize it.
Quod si uides infirmum pauidum et timidum ab incisione cum ferro, tunc accipe filum ex plumbo decenter factum, et stringe cum eo athelul: cuius modus est quem diximus, et dimitte ipsum duobus diebus.	If you see the sick person afraid and timid of incision with iron, then take a thread of lead, well-made, and bind it to the tumour; by the method we have described, and leave it for two days.
Deinde adde in strictura plumbi.	Then add to the lead binding.
Non ergo cesses stringere plumbum, quotiens imprimit in thelil, donec abscindatur, et cadat per se absque labore.	Therefore do not cease binding the lead, whenever it presses on the tumour, until it is severed, and falls off by itself without effort.
Si autem thelil grossae fuerit radicis, tunc in incisione eius est quiddam timoris et pauoris: praecipue quod est in uentre.	If however the tumour is of a large root, then in its incision there is some fear and dread; especially that which is in the belly.
Verumtamen possibile est, ut incidas medietatem eius.	However, it is possible to cut half of it.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum, ut non redeat.	Then cauterize it, so that it does not return.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur uulnus.	Then treat it until the wound heals.
Et caue ne praesumas incidere thelil quod est fusci coloris, pauci sensus, foedi aspectus: ipsum enim est apostema cancerosum: et ego ueniam cum rememoratione Cancri post hoc.	And beware lest you presume to cut a tumour that is dark-coloured, of little feeling, and foul appearance: for it is a cancerous abscess; and I shall come with a reminder of Cancer after this.
¶ De cura eminentiae Vmbilici.	Concerning the treatment of the navel's prominence.
Caput LII.	Chapter LII.
Fit eminentia Vmbilici ex caussis multis.	The navel's prominence arises from many causes.
Aut ex fissuris sifac, quod super uentrem est: et exit ex eo althub, aut intestinum, secundum quod accidit in reliquis rupturis.	Or from fissures in the skin above the abdomen, and from which a part of the caul, or the bowel, protrudes, according to what happens in other ruptures.
Aut ex sanguine qui fluit ex Vena, aut ex Arteria, secundum quod praemissum est.	Or from blood flowing from a vein or artery, as was previously stated.
Aut ex uentositate coartata in eo.	Or from constrained wind within it.
Si autem est propter fissuram sifac, et exitum thirbi: tunc est color apostematis similis colori corporis: et est lene, absque dolore: et apparet diuersi situs.	If however it is due to a fissure in the caul, and the protrusion of the bowel, then its color is like the color of the body; and it is soft, without pain; and it appears in diverse positions.
Et si est propter egressionem intestini, tunc est situs eius, cum eo quod narrauimus, uehementioris diuersitatis.	And if it is due to the protrusion of the bowel, then its position, with that which we have described, is of more violent diversity.
Cum ergo tu premis ipsum digitis tuis, occultatur: deinde redit, et fortasse est cum eo sonitus: et magnificatur multum apud introitum balnei, et laborem uehaementum.	When therefore you press it with your fingers, it disappears; then it returns, and perhaps with a sound; and it greatly magnifies itself at the entrance of the bath, and in violent exertion.
Si uero est propter humiditatem, est lene, tunc non occultatur quando premis ipsum manu tua, neque constringium, neque additur.	If however it is due to moisture, it is soft, then it does not disappear when you press it with your hand, nor does it contract, nor is it added to.
Quod si est propter sanguinem, tunc cum istis signis apparet apostema ad nigredinem de cliue.	If however it is due to blood, then with these signs the abscess appears black on the slope.
Si autem est propter carnem natam: tunc est apostema graue, grossum, durum, et figitur secundum quantitatem unam.	If however it is due to generated flesh: then the abscess is severe, large, hard, and fixed according to a single quantity.
Si uero est propter uentositatem, tunc tactus eius est lenis.	If however it is due to windiness, then its touch is soft.
Et operatio in illo est, ut consideres tunc, si eminentia umbilici est propter sanguinem Arteriae, aut Venae, aut uentositatem: tunc oportet ut prohibearis a curatione eius.	And the operation on it is, that you should then consider, if the eminence of the navel is due to blood of the artery, or vein, or windiness: then it is necessary that you refrain from its treatment.
Nam in illo est timor et pauor, sicut docui te in capitulo, in quo dixi apostemata propter arteriam et uenam.	For in it is fear and dread, as I taught you in the chapter, in which I said abscesses due to artery and vein.
Quod si eminentia umbilici est propter intestinum, aut zirbum: tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmo, quatenus teneat anhelitum suum, et stet stans extensus.	If the eminence of the navel is due to the intestine or hernia, then it is necessary that you command the sick person to hold their breath and stand stretched out.
Deinde signa cum encaustro in circumitu umbilici totius.	Then mark with ink around the entire navel.
Postea praecipe ei, ut resupinetur inter manus tuas super dorsum suum.	Afterwards, command him to lie on his back between your hands on his back.
Deinde circunda cum spatumili lato in circumitu umbilici super locum quem signasti cum encaustro.	Then surround with a broad spatula the area around the navel, over the place you marked with ink.
Postea extende medium apostematis ad superiora, cum uncino magno.	Afterwards, extend the middle of the abscess upwards with a large hook.
Deinde liga eum in circumitu forti cum filo, aut cum chorda de serico ligamento firmo: et sit nodus ligamenti alenxotati.	Then tie it around firmly with thread, or with a silken cord or strong ligament; and let the knot of the ligament be tied.
Deinde aperi medium apostematis extensum supra ligamentum.	Then open the middle of the abscess, extended above the ligament.
Si ergo inueneris ipsum iam captum a ligamento: tunc extrahe alenxotati, et intromitte in ipsum digitum indicem, et impelle intestinum ad interiora uentris: et si inueneris zirbum, tunc accipe ipsum cum uncino, et incide superfluitatem eius.	If therefore you find it already grasped by the ligament, then pull out the tied portion, and insert the index finger into it, and push the intestine into the interior of the belly; and if you find a hernia, then take it with a hook, and cut off its excess.
Si autem contraria est tibi arteria, aut uena: tunc circunda ipsum multum.	If however the artery or vein is contrary to you, then surround it much.
Deinde redi ad operationem tuam.	Then return to your operation.
Et accipe duas acus, et intromitte in eis duo fila fortia: et intromitte duas acus in circumitu quem fecisti circa apostema in modum crucis, quas facis penetrare.	And take two needles, and insert in them two strong threads; and insert the two needles in the circumference you made around the abscess in the manner of a cross, making them penetrate.
Deinde stringe apostema in quatuor locis super acus: et si uis, aufer acus, et dimitte locum, donec putrefiat caro extensa: et cadat per se: aut incide ipsam quando subtiliatur et putrefit.	Then tie the abscess in four places above the needles; and if you wish, remove the needles and leave the place until the extended flesh putrefies, and falls away by itself; or cut it when it is softened and putrefied.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod oportet ex unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with whatever is necessary from the ointments until it is healed.
Quod si eminentia umbilici est ex carne nara in eo, aut ex humiditate: tunc oportet ut concaues apostema, sicut diximus.	If the protrusion of the navel is from flesh rising within it, or from moisture, then it is necessary to excavate the abscess, as we have said.
Et extrahas sanguinem, aut humiditatem, quam inuenis in eo.	And extract the blood or moisture that you find in it.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod solidat locum.	Then treat it with what consolidates the place.
¶ De cura CANCRI.	Concerning the treatment of CANCER.
Caput LIII.	Chapter LIII.
Iam diximus in diuisione species Cancri, et qualiter est uia ad curationem eius cum medicinis: et cauendum ab eo cum curatione eius cum ferro, ut non ulceretur: et diximus Cancrum generatum in matrice, et cautelam a curatione eius.	We have already discussed the classification of Cancer, and how to treat it with medicines; and we have warned against using iron in its treatment, lest it should become ulcerated; and we have discussed Cancer originating in the womb, and the precautions in its treatment.
Et dixerunt antiqui, quod quandoque Cancer est in loco, ubi possibilis est eius eradicatio: sicut Cancer qui est in mammillis, aut in coxa, et eis similibus, ex membris locatis ad extrahendum totum eius: praecipue quando est incipiens paruus.	And the ancients said that sometimes Cancer is in a place where its eradication is possible, like Cancer in the breasts or the thigh, and similar parts of the body located externally, especially if it is small and newly developed, allowing the complete removal of the entire lesion.
Quando uero antiquatur, et est magnus, non oportet ut appropinques ei.	However, when it is longstanding and large, you should not approach it.
Ego enim non potui sanare ex eo aliquem: neque uidi alium ante me qui peruenerit ad illud.	For I myself could not cure anyone of it, nor have I seen anyone before me who has succeeded in doing so.
Et operatio in eo, quando est locatus sicut diximus, est, ut praecedas, et soluas infirmum ex cholera nigra aliquotiens.	And the treatment, when it is located as we have said, is to proceed, and to relieve the afflicted person from the black cholera on several occasions.
Deinde phlebotoma ipsum si inuenis cum repletione manifesta.	Then, if you find it with obvious fullness, phlebotomize it.
Deinde praepara infirmum praeparatione, in qua locetur cum operatione.	Then prepare the patient with the preparation in which he will be placed with the operation.
Deinde proiice in Cancrum uncinos qui conueniunt ei.	Then cast into the Cancer the hooks that are suitable for it.
Postea concaua ipsum ab omni parte cum cute, secundum perscrutationem, donec non remaneat aliquid ex radicibus eius: et dimitte sanguinem currere, et non abscindas ipsum uelociter, imo exprime loca, et absterge sanguinem grossum totum manu tua, aut cum quo possibile est ibi ex instrumentis.	Afterwards, hollow it out from every side with the skin, according to examination, until nothing remains of its roots: and allow the blood to run, and do not cut it quickly, rather express the places, and wipe away all the thick blood with your hand, or with whatever instruments are possible there.
Si autem contrarietatem facit tibi fluxus sanguinis grossi ex incisione arteriae, aut uenae: tunc cauteriza uenam, donec abscindatur sanguis.	If, however, a contrary flow of thick blood from the incision of an artery or vein occurs to you, then cauterize the vein until the blood ceases.
Deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with the rest of the treatment, until it is healed.
¶ De cura Hydropisis.	Of the treatment of dropsy.
Caput LIIII.	Chapter LIII.
Iam narrauimus in diuisione species Hydropisis, et qualiter fit aggregatio aquae: et signa omnis speciei, et curationem eius cum medicinis.	We have already narrated in the division of the species of dropsy, and how the aggregation of water occurs, and the signs of every species, and its treatment with medicines.
Et illa quae curatur cum ferro, non est nisi species asclitis sola: et non approximatur cum ferro speciei timpanitis: neque speciei hyposarcae penitus: nam illud mortale est.	And that which is treated with iron is only a species of ascites alone; and it is not applied with iron to the species of tympanites; nor to the species of hyposarca entirely; for that is fatal.
Quando tu iam medicatus es hanc speciem Hydropisis timpanitis cum medicinis, et non contulit medicatio tua: tunc considera.	When you have already treated this species of dropsy, tympanites, with medicines, and your treatment has not availed, then consider.
Nam si infirmo iam consecuta est debilitas, aut est cum eo infirmitas alia praeter Hydropisim: sicut si sit cum eo tussis, aut uentris solutio, et similia illis: tunc caue ne mediceris ei cum ferro: quoniam est timor illud.	For if weakness has already overtaken the sick person, or there is another illness with him besides the dropsy, such as if there be a cough with him, or looseness of the belly, and things similar to these, then beware that you do not treat him with iron, because there is fear of it.
Si autem uides infirmum exuberantis uirtutis, neque est cum eo aegritudo praeter Hydropisim solam: et non est puer, neque senex: tunc modus operationis in eo est, ut tu eleues infirmum stantem inter manus tuas, et minister post ipsum exprimat uentrem eius manu sua impellendo aquam ad inferiorem partem pectinis.	If, however, you see the sick person of abundant strength, and there is no illness with him other than dropsy alone; and he is neither a child nor an old man; then the method of operation in him is that you raise the sick person standing between your hands, and the attendant behind him press his belly with his hand, driving the water to the lower part of the chest.
Deinde accipe spatumile spinosum, secundum hanc formam.	Then take a thorny spatula, according to this form.
Sit duarum partium acutarum, longum, acutae extremitatis sicut Spatumile.	Let it be of two sharp parts, long, with sharp extremities like a spatula.
Verumtamen in eo sit quiddam breuitatis paulatim, ut non pertranseas cum eo apud operationem usque ad intestinum, et laedas ipsum.	However, let there be something of brevity gradually, so that you do not proceed with it during the operation all the way to the intestine, and harm him.
Deinde considera.	Then consider.
Nam si est generatio Hydropisis ex parte intestinorum, tunc oportet ut elongeris cum sectione ab umbilico quantitate trium digitorum, ad inferiora in directo eius supra pectinem.	For if there is generation of dropsy from the part of the intestines, then it is necessary that you extend with the incision from the navel by the quantity of three fingers, downwards in a straight line above the pubic bone.
Si uero generatio Hydropisis est propter aegritudinem epatis: tunc sit sectio tua sinistra ab umbilico tribus digitis.	If however the generation of dropsy is because of disease of the liver, then let your incision be to the left of the navel by three fingers.
Et si generatio eius est propter splenem, tunc sit sectio in latere dextro: et non oportet etiam ut sit sectio in latere super quod uult iacere infirmus, ut non currant superfluitates ad illum locum debilem.	And if its generation is because of the spleen, then let the incision be on the right side; and it is also not necessary that the incision be on the side on which the sick person wishes to lie, so that superfluities do not run to that weak place.
Deinde perfora cum instrumento cutem totam.	Then pierce with the instrument all the skin.
Deinde intromitte in illam sectionem, et eleua manum tuam cum Spatumili inter cutem, et sifac, quasi tu excories ipsum: et sit quantitas quae excoriatur quantitas unguis, aut circiter ilud.	Then insert into that incision, and raise your hand with the Spatumili between the skin, and do so, as if you were to scrape it; and let the amount scraped be the amount of a fingernail, or about that.
Deinde perfora sifac, donec perueniat Spatumile ad locum uacuum: et est locus aquae.	Then pierce, doing so until the Spatumile reaches the empty place; and it is the place of water.
Deinde extrahe ipsum, et intromitte in foramen instrumentum, cuius haec est forma.	Then withdraw it, and insert into the hole the instrument, of which this is the shape.
Et est simile cannulae: fit ex argento, aut aere, aut aurichalco, lene, tersum: cui in inferiori parte sui est foramen paruum, et in lateribus eius sunt tria foramina, duo ab una parte, et unum a parte altera: et facia est extremitas eius incisa, secundum modum incisionis calami, sicut uides: in extremitate eius superiore est armilla.	And it is similar to a cannula: it is made of silver, or bronze, or brass, smooth, polished; to which at its lower part is a small hole, and on its sides are three holes, two on one side, and one on the other side; and its end is cut, according to the manner of cutting a reed, as you see; on its upper end is a ring.
Nam quando instrumentum peruenit ad aquam, tunc ipsa descendit statim super instrumentum, ergo euacua ex aqua in hora quantitatem mediam.	For when the instrument reaches the water, then it descends immediately upon the instrument, therefore evacuate from the water in a short time a moderate quantity.
Quoniam si tu euacuas ex ea plus quam oportet, in hora fortasse moritur infirmus per resolutionem spiritus sui animalis: aut accidit ei syncopis quae appropinquat morti.	Because if you evacuate from it more than is necessary, perhaps the weak person dies in a short time by the dissolution of his animal spirit; or a syncope happens to him which approaches death.
Verum euacua ex ea secundum quantitatem uirtutis eius, et secundum quod significant tibi dispositiones infirmi ex uirtute pulsus eius, et ex bonitate eius.	But evacuate from it according to the quantity of its virtue, and according to what the patient's conditions signify to you, from the strength of his pulse, and from his well-being.
Deinde extrahe instrumentum, et retine aquam.	Then withdraw the instrument, and retain the water.
Quod est, quia retinetur statim propter cutem quae retinet foramen quod est super sifac: de quo narraui, ut perfores ipsum secundum illum modum.	Because it is immediately retained due to the skin which retains the opening which is above the sifac: of which I have spoken, so that you pierce it in that manner.
Deinde itera instrumentum die altero, si uides infirmum tolerare illud: et extrahe etiam ex aqua quantitatem paruam.	Then again use the instrument on the following day, if you see the patient tolerating it; and also extract a small quantity from the water.
Fac illud diebus aliquot sine timore, et custodi te ab errore: donec non remaneat ex aqua nisi parum.	Do this for several days without fear, and guard against error, until only a little remains of the water.
Si autem times super infirmum, et dimittis ex aqua rem multam: tunc cura ipsum cum sepultura in harena calida, et sudore multo in balneo et sole, et expectet super sitim: et cura ipsum cum medicinis exiccatiuis, donec sanetur: et cauteriza super stomachum, et epar, et splenem, post extractionem aquae: secundum quod narraui in eo quod praecessit.	However, if you fear for the patient, and you release a great deal of water, then treat him with burial in hot sand, and with much sweat in a bath and sun, and let him endure thirst; and treat him with drying medicines until he is healed; and cauterize the stomach, liver, and spleen, after the extraction of water, according to what I have narrated before.
¶ De cura infantium qui nascuntur locis urinae eorum non perforatis.	Concerning the care of infants born in places where their urine passages are not perforated.
Caput LV.	Chapter LV.
Quando egreditur aliquis infantium ex uentre matris suae, et caput mutonis eius est non perforatum, aut est foramen strictum, aut in non suo loco.	When any infant emerges from its mother's womb, and the opening of its urethra is not perforated, or is a narrow opening, or is in the wrong place.
Oportet ergo succurrere cum perforatione eius statim cum nascitur cum Spatumili subtili ualde, secundum hanc formam.	Therefore, it is necessary to immediately assist with its perforation when it is born with a very fine spatula, according to this form.
Deinde pone in foramine clauum subtilem ex plumbo, et liga ipsum: et tene ipsum tribus diebus, aut quatuor.	Then place a fine leaden peg in the opening and tie it; and hold it for three days or four.
Quando ergo uult urinam emittere, remoueatur, et mingat.	When it then wishes to urinate, it should be removed, and it will urinate.
Deinde reduc ipsum.	Then replace it.
Et si tu non ponis plumbum, iam possibile est, ut urina quae incedit super locum, non permittat ipsum claudi.	And if you do not place the lead, it is possible that the urine flowing over the area will not allow it to close.
Ille autem cuius foramen est strictum, medicatur cum plumbo, sicut diximus, diebus multis, donec amplificetur.	However, the one whose opening is narrow is treated with lead, as we have said, for many days, until it widens.
Illi autem in quibus est foramen in non suo loco, laeduntur.	However, those in whom the opening is in an improper place are harmed.
Quod est, quia ex eis qui nascitur, foramen est apud finem capitis uirgae: quare non potest mingere ad anteriora, donec eleuat uirgam manu sua ad superiora.	For this reason, those born with an opening at the end of the penis: therefore, they cannot urinate forward until they raise their penis upward with their hand.
Neque est ei generatio, propterea, quod sperma non potest peruenire ad matricem secundum rectitudinem: et est aegritudo foeda ualde.	Nor is there generation for him, because the semen cannot reach the womb properly: and it is a very foul disease.
Et modus operationis in illo est, ut resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum.	And the method of operation in him is that the sick person be placed on their back.
Deinde extende caput uirgae eius manu tua sinistra extensione uehementi, et incide caput capitis uirgae ex loco priapi, cum acumine, aut spatumili acuto: sicut est incisio calami, aut sicut tu radis aliquid, ut medium eius ueniat simile capiti uirgae: et ut cadat foramen in medio secundum quod oportet.	Then extend his penis with your left hand forcefully, and cut off the head of the penis from the glans, with a sharp needle or sharp scalpel; like cutting a reed, or like you shave something, so that its middle becomes like the head of the penis, and so that the opening falls in the middle, as is required.
Et caue tibi apud operationem tuam a fluxu sanguinis.	And beware of the flow of blood in your operation.
Multotiens enim accidit illud.	For it often happens.
Oppone ergo ei cum eo quod abscindit sanguinem, et cura uulnus, donec sanetur.	Therefore, apply to it whatever stops the bleeding, and treat the wound until it heals.
¶ De Albather quae accidunt in praeputio et capite uigae, et corruptione, nigredine, et adhaerentia.	Concerning the problems that occur in the foreskin and the head of the penis, and its corruption, blackness, and adhesion.
Caput LVI.	Chapter LVI.
Multotiens accidunt istae Albather in uirga, et est eminentia carnis foedae.	These problems frequently occur in the penis, and there is a prominent growth of foul flesh.
Et ex ea alia est maligna, et alia non maligna.	And from it some are malignant, and some are not malignant.
Non malignam ergo oportet ut suspendas cum uncino subtili, et abscindas eam, donec mundes eam totam.	Therefore, the non-malignant one should be suspended with a fine hook, and cut off, until the whole of it is cleansed.
Deinde pone super eam cotum submersum in unguento aegyptio.	Then place on it a poultice soaked in Egyptian ointment.
Deinde cura ipsum post illud cum unguento dyafinicon, donec sanetur.	Then treat it afterward with diaphanicon ointment until it heals.
Quod si Albather est maligna, foedi coloris, tunc oportet ut administres in ea cauterium post incisionem eius et ipsius rasionem.	If, however, it is malignant, of foul colour, then it is necessary to apply a cautery to it after its incision and scraping.
Si autem Albather est in praeputio captiui, non circumcisi, et est pars Albather inter praeputium, et pars eius extra: tunc oportet ut auferas Albather, quae est intus in primis, donec quando consolidatur, tunc cura ipsum exterius: quoniam quando tu curas eam simul, non securatur praeputium quin preforetur.	If, however, the ulcer is on the foreskin of an uncircumcised captive, and a part of the ulcer is within the foreskin and another part outside: then it is necessary to remove the ulcer that is within first, until when it is consolidated, then treat it externally; because when you treat it at the same time, the foreskin is not safe from being perforated.
Et iam accidunt etiam in testiculis, et praeputio nigredo et corruptio.	And these also occur in the testicles and the foreskin, a blackness and corruption.
Oportet ergo, ut tu concaues totum quod iam denigratum est, et quod uult corrumpi, aut iam corruptum est.	Therefore, it is necessary to cauterize all that is already blackened and that desires to become corrupted, or that is already corrupted.
Deinde line super ipsum post illud cum melle quod iam concussum est cum farina corticum granatorum, et herbi tritorum cribellatorum.	Then, apply a line over it after with honey that has already been mixed with the flour of pomegranate bark and crushed, sifted herbs.
Deinde cura illud cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with the remaining treatment, until it is healed.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis, tunc administra cauterium cum cauterio lunari, secundum hanc formam.	If however, a flow of blood occurs, then apply a cautery with a lunar cautery, according to this form.
Cauterium enim est iuuatiuum ad duas dispositiones simul, scilicet ad fluxum sanguinis, et uulnus quando corrumpitur.	For cautery is helpful for two conditions at once, namely for the flow of blood and a wound when it is corrupted.
Quod si corroditur caput uirgae, et destruitur totum in hora: tunc oportet ut intromittas in meatum priapi cannulam ex plumbo, ut mingat infirmus super eam.	If the head of the penis is corroded and the entire thing is destroyed within an hour, then it is necessary to insert a lead cannula into the urethra so that the sick man urinates over it.
In adhaerentia uero praeputii cum capite uirgae, et haec quidem adhaerentia non accidit, nisi in eo cuius praeputium est sanum, et non exigitur super ipsum circumcisio: et quandoque accidit adhaerentia propter uulnus, aut apostema: oportet ergo ut excories eam cum Spatumili obtuso, donec soluatur ligamentum, et liberetur caput uirgae ab omni parte.	However, when the foreskin adheres to the glans penis, and this adhesion does not occur unless the foreskin is healthy, and circumcision is not required upon it; and sometimes adhesion occurs due to a wound or an abscess: therefore, it is necessary to scrape it with a blunt Spatumili, until the ligament is loosened, and the glans penis is freed on all sides.
Quod si est difficile discernere ea exquisite, tunc oportet ut excories aliquid ex capite uirgae, et ex praeputio.	If it is difficult to discern these things precisely, then it is necessary to scrape something from the glans penis and from the foreskin.
Quod est, quia praeputium quando est subtile, fortasse perforatur propter subtilitatem suam uelociter.	This is because the foreskin, when it is thin, perhaps is perforated quickly because of its thinness.
Deinde separa inter praeputium, et caput uirgae cum panno lini subtili, qui iam madefactus est in aqua frigida, ut non adhereant iterum.	Then separate the foreskin and the glans penis with a thin linen cloth, which has already been moistened in cold water, so that they do not adhere again.
Deinde curetur cum uino stiptico, donec consolidetur.	Then treat it with astringent wine until it is solidified.
¶ De mundificatione infantium, et curatione ex errore eis accidente.	Concerning the cleansing of infants and the treatment of errors that befall them.
Caput LVII.	Chapter LVII.
Circumcisio non est solutio continuitatis, sicut reliqua uulnera: uerumtamen cum sit ex operatione nostra, uoluntate nostra, et usus eius sit in pueris proprie, est necesse ut signemus in ea operationem meliorem, et uiam leuiorem perducentem ad salutem.	Circumcision is not a solution of continuity, like other wounds; however, since it is from our operation, by our will, and its use is properly in boys, it is necessary that we mark it with a better operation and a smoother path leading to health.
Dico ergo, quod antiqui non dixerunt circumcisionem in aliquo suorum librorum: quoniam non utuntur in legibus suis, et non est nisi quod acquisiuimus per experimentum.	Therefore I say that the ancients did not mention circumcision in any of their books, since they do not use it in their laws, and it is only something we have acquired through experience.
Quod est, quia ego inueni maiorem partem artificum, et phlebotomatorum uti mundificatione, circumcidendo cum nouacula, et cum forficibus: et utuntur alfecati, et ligaudo cum filo, et incisione cum ungula.	This is because I have found most of the artisans and phlebotomists using cleansing, circumcising with a razor and with scissors; and the skilled ones using cauterization, ligation with thread, and incision with a nail.
Et ego quidem iam probaui omnes istos modos, et non inueni meliorem mundificatione cum forficibus, et ligamento cum filo.	And I myself have already tested all these methods, and have found no better cleansing than with scissors and ligation with thread.
Quoniam in mundificatione cum nouacula, multotiens effugit cutis.	Because in cleansing with a razor, the skin often escapes.
Quoniam cutis praeputii duas habet tunicas: ergo forsitan inciditur cutis superior, et temanet tunica inferior: cogitur ergo ad incisionem ad incidendum alteram, et dolorem futurum.	Since the skin of the foreskin has two layers: therefore perhaps the upper layer is incised, and the lower layer remains; therefore it is necessary to make an incision to cut the other one, and future pain.
Et cum mundificatione quae fit per alfecati, id est, digitalis, quo utuntur sutores, non securatur incisio extremitatis uirilis membri: quoniam fortasse ingreditur in foramen eius.	And with the cleansing that is done by cauterization, that is, digital, which the surgeons use, the incision of the extremity of the male member is not secured, since perhaps it enters the opening of it.
In mundificatione autem cum ungula, fortasse euadit ferrum, et corrumpit operationem tuam: et cutis quidem pueri est breuis natura, et multotiens nascuntur taliter, quod non indigent mundificatione: et iam uidi illud.	In cleansing with a nail, perhaps the iron escapes and spoils your operation; and the skin of the boy is short in nature, and they are often born in such a way that they do not need cleansing: and I have already seen that.
Mundificationis autem cum forficibus, et ligamento cum filo, bonum experimentum detexit mihi: quoniam forfices sunt proportionalis incisionis: propterea, quod acuitas quae est superius, est sicut acuitas quae est inferius.	However, cleansing with scissors, and ligation with thread, has shown me a good experiment; since scissors are proportional to the incision; because the sharpness that is above is like the sharpness that is below.
Cum ergo premis manum tuam, proportionantur duae acuitates, et incidunt secundum operationem unam in tempore uno: et fit compressio simili figura, continens cutem uirgae ab omni parte, cum qua non cadit error omnino.	When, therefore, you press your hand, the two sharpnesses are proportioned, and they cut according to one operation at one time; and a compression of similar shape is made, encompassing the skin of the penis from all sides, with which no error falls at all.
Et modus operationis propriae est, ut facias extimare, puerum praecipue, si est ex eis qui intelligunt parumper, quod tu non facis, nisi quod ligas filum in uirga sua tantum: et dimittas ipsum usque ad diem alium.	And the proper method of operation is that you cause the boy, especially if he is of those who understand a little, to be aware that you do not do anything except tie a thread to his penis, and you leave him until another day.
Deinde fac eum gaudere et laetari omnimodo quo possibile est tibi illud, ex eo quod recipit intelligentia sua.	Then cause him to rejoice and be joyful in every way that is possible for you, from that which his understanding receives.
Deinde fac eum stare inter manus tuas praeparatae staturae, et non sit sedens: et occulta forfices in manica tua, aut sub pede tuo, ne uideat eos puer omnino, neque aliquid ex instrumentis.	Then have him stand between your prepared hands, and do not let him sit; and hide the scissors in your sleeve, or under your foot, so that the boy does not see them at all, nor anything of the instruments.
Deinde intromitte manum tuam ad uirgam eius, et suffla in cutem, et trahe eam sursum, donec egrediatur caput uirgae.	Then insert your hand into his penis, and blow into the skin, and pull it upward until the head of the penis emerges.
Deinde mundifica ipsam ex eo quod aggregatur in ea sordicie.	Then cleanse it from the dirt that has accumulated on it.
Deinde liga locum signatum cum filo duplo.	Then tie the marked place with a double thread.
Postea liga inferius eo parumper ligamentum secundum.	Then tie a second ligature a little lower.
Deinde tene cum indice tuo, et pollice locum ligamenti inferioris retentione bona, et incide inter duo ligamenta.	Then hold the lower ligature's place with your index finger and thumb, providing good retention, and cut between the two ligatures.
Deinde eleua cutem sursum uelociter, et extrahe caput uirgae.	Then lift the skin quickly upwards and extract the head of the rod.
Deinde dimitte sanguinem currere paulatim (est enim melius) et pone puluerem desuper: et super puluerem pannum in quo expansus est uitellus oui decocti in aqua rosata, concussum cum oleo ros recenti bono: et dimitte eum super ipsum usque ad diem alium: et cura ipsum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then allow the blood to run slowly (for it is better) and put powder on top. And over the powder, a cloth on which the yolk of a hard-boiled egg, mixed with good fresh rose oil, has been spread: and leave it there until another day, and treat it with the rest of the treatment until it is healed.
Forma autem forficis ad mundificationem haec est.	The shape of the scissors for cleaning is this.
Sint hebetes duae extremitates, et sint incidentes: ne egrediatur in eis ramus claui: et sit longitudo duarum acuitatum, sicut longitudo duorum manubriorum aequaliter.	Let the two ends be blunt and meet at an angle, so that a nail's branch does not emerge from them, and let the length of the two sharpened parts be equal to the length of the two handles.
Error uero cadens in mundificatione est: quoniam fortasse effugit cutis intrinseca tota, aut pars eius apud incisionem.	A mistake that occurs in cleaning is that perhaps the inner skin is entirely or partially escaped at the incision.
Ergo oportet, ut extendas eam ex hora tua cum ungue tuo ante apostemationem loci: et incidas eam secundum aequalitatem.	Therefore, you should pull it out with your finger before the abscess forms, and cut it evenly.
Quod si non potes tenere eam cum ungue tuo, tunc extrahe eam cum uncino, et incide eam.	If you cannot hold it with your finger, then pull it out with a hook, and cut it.
Si autem praeterierint ei tres dies, et remanet quod est sub uirga inflatum, apostematum: tunc dimitte illud, donec sedetur apostema calidum, et excoria illud cum facilitate, et incide illud secundum quod praeparatur tibi: et caue tibi a capite uirgae.	However, if three days have passed and the area under the rod remains swollen, an abscess: then leave it until the abscess has matured, and open it easily, and cut it according to what is prepared for you.  Beware of the rod's head.
Non enim nocebit ei illud.	For it will not harm it.
Cura ergo illud cum eo quod consolidat uulnus ex pulueribus, quos narrauimus in tractatu de pulueribus: et si inciditur ex cute supra mensuram, et euadit ad superiora, non nocet ei illud etiam.	Therefore, treat it with that which consolidates a wound from the powders that we have discussed in the treatise on powders.  And if it is cut from the skin beyond measure and goes up, that will not harm it either.
Cura ergo illud cum eo quod diximus, donec sanetur.	Therefore treat it with what we have said, until it is healed.
¶ De extractione Vrinae retentae in uesica.	On the extraction of retained urine in the bladder.
Caput LVIII.	Chapter LVIII.
Urinae retentio in uesica, fit ab opilatione facta ex lapide, aut sanguine congelato, aut pus, aut carne nata, et similibus illis ex eis quae diximus ex modis curationis in diuisione.	Retention of urine in the bladder occurs from an obstruction caused by a stone, or congealed blood, or pus, or grown flesh, and similar things to those which we have stated in the methods of treatment in the division.
Et si non soluitur Vrina, et uides retentionem eius esse propter Lapidem, qui iam est in collo uesicae: tunc oportet ut sit infirmus super genua sua curuatus.	And if the urine is not released, and you see its retention to be because of a stone, which is already in the neck of the bladder, then it is necessary that he be weak, bent over his knees.
Deinde componantur pedes eius super dorsum eius, et extendat uentrem suum ex superiori parte dorsi eius, et stringat infirmus anhelitum suum quantum possibile est ei.	Then let his feet be placed on his back, and let him extend his belly from the upper part of his back, and let the weak man draw in his breath as much as possible.
Cogitur ergo cum collo uesicae ad expulsionem Lapidis ad posteriora: quare absoluitur Vrina.	Thus he is forced, with the neck of the bladder, to expel the stone to the rear: wherefore the urine is released.
Quod si non soluitur cum eo quod diximus, et uehemens sit res super infirmum: tunc oportet ut administres extractionem eius cum instrumento, quod nominatur siringa, cuius haec est forma Sit ex argento, et sit subtile, lene, concauum sicut cannula pennae auis in subtilitate radii, longum in similitudine palmi unius et medii: cui sit cannula subtilis in capite eius.	If it is not released with what we have said, and the matter is severe upon the patient, then it is necessary that you administer its extraction with an instrument, which is called a syringe, of which this is the form. It should be of silver, and be slender, smooth, concave, like the quill of a bird's feather in its slenderness, one and a half palms in length; to which there should be a slender tube at its head.
Et modus exitus Vrinae per ipsum est, ut accipias filum duplicatum, et liges in extremitate eius lanam, aut cotum, ligatura bona: et intromittas extremitatem fili in inferiori parte Siringae: et incide cum forficibus si superfluit aliquid ex lana, uerum intromitte in cannulam cum uehementia, sicut alzer.	And the mode of the urine's exit through it is, that you take a doubled thread, and tie to its end wool, or tow, with a good ligature; and insert the thread's end into the lower part of the syringe; and cut with scissors if any wool protrudes, but insert it into the tube with force, like a lever.
Deinde inunge siringam cum oleo, aut cum butyro, et albugine oui: et fac sedere infirmum super sedem, et embroca uesicam, et ipsius uirgam cum oleis humidis, et oleo oliuae, et aqua tepida.	Then anoint the syringe with oil, or with butter, and the white of an egg; and make the patient sit on a seat, and embrocate the bladder and its urethra with moist oils, and olive oil, and warm water.
Deinde intromitte siringam in uirgam cum facilitate, donec perueniat ad radicem uirgae.	Then introduce the syringe into the urethra with ease, until it reaches the root of the urethra.
Deinde dupla ipsam superius a parte umbilici.	Then double it upward from the part of the navel.
Deinde impelle siringam intra ipsam, donec perueniat ad Vesicam, et sentiat eam infirmus iam peruenisse ad rem uacuam: et non fit hoc secundum hunc ordinem, nisi quoniam meatus, in quo uadit, est in quo est tortuositas.	Then drive the syringe into it, until it reaches the bladder, and the patient feels it has reached the empty space: and this is not done according to this order, unless because the passage, in which it travels, is tortuous.
Deinde extende filum cum lana paulatim.	Then extend the thread with wool gradually.
Vrina enim sequetur lanam.	For the urine will follow the wool.
Deinde extrahe eam, et fac currere Vrinam per uiam urinae: et itera siringam, et non cesses facere illud, donec euacuetur uesica, et inueniat infirmus alleuiationem.	Then pull it out, and cause the urine to run through the urinary way: and repeat the syringe, and do not cease to do it, until the bladder is emptied, and the patient finds relief.
¶ De qualitate clisterizationis uesicae cum Clepshydra.	Concerning the quality of bladder irrigation with a clepsydra.
Caput LIX.	Chapter LIX.
Quando accidit in uesica ulcus, aut sanguis in ea congelatur, aut coartatur in ea pus, et uis distillare in eam aquas et medicinas: tunc fiat cum instrumento quod nominatur Clepshydra, et haec est forma eius.	When a sore occurs in the bladder, or blood clots in it, or pus is collected in it, and force is used to pour water and medicines into it, then it should be done with an instrument called a Clepsydra, and this is its form.
Est enim surda, id est, clausa.	It is deaf, that is, closed.
Et in eo sunt tria foramina, duo ex parte una, et unum ex parte altera, sicut uides.	And in it are three openings, two on one side, and one on the other side, as you see.
Et locus concauus, in quo est illud quod impellit, sit secundum quantitatem quod opilet ipsum sine additione, donec quando trahitur cum eo aliquid, ex humiditatibus attrahatur: et quando impellitur, cum eo expellatur ad longinquum: secundum quod facit clepshydra, qua proiicitur naphta, id est, ignis graecus in praeliis martis.	And the hollow place, in which that which impels it is, should be according to the quantity that it can fill without addition, until, when something is pulled with it, humidities are drawn out; and when it is impelled, it is expelled with it to a distance; according to what the clepsydra does, with which naphtha, that is, Greek fire, is projected in naval battles.
Cum ergo uis proiicere humiditates in uesicam, intromitte extremitatem clepshydrae in humiditatem, et trahe cum eo quod impellit ad superiora, humiditas enim trahitur in concauitatem clepshydrae.	Therefore, when force is used to project humidities into the bladder, insert the end of the clepsydra into the humidity, and pull that which impels it upwards, for humidity is drawn into the concavity of the clepsydra.
Deinde intromitte extremitatem eius in uirgam, secundum quod narrauimus in siringa.	Then insert its end into the tube, as we have described in the syringe.
Deinde impelle humiditatem cum eo quod impellit illa namque humiditas peruenit ad uesicam statim, ita quod sentit eam infirmus.	Then propel the humidity with that which impels it; for that humidity reaches the bladder immediately, so that the sick person feels it.
Forma clisteris subtilis quo clisterizatur uesica.	A subtle form of clyster with which the bladder is clysterized.
Fiat ex argento, aut auricalco: cuius caput altius sit simile alcama paruo, et sub eo sinus inter quem cadat ligamentum.	Let it be made of silver or brass: whose head be higher, similar to a small alcama, and beneath it a sinus into which a ligament falls.
Deinde accipe uesicam arietis, et pone in ea humiditatem, qua uis clisterizare uesicam.	Then take the bladder of a ram, and place in it the humidity with which you wish to clysterize the bladder.
Deinde liga eam inter duos sinus ligatura forti cum filo duplo: et calefac illam humiditatem parumper super ignem.	Then tie it between two sinuses with a strong ligature with a double thread: and warm that humidity for a short time over the fire.
Deinde intromitte extremitatem clisteris in uirgam, postea stringe manum tuam super uesicam cum humiditate strictura decenti, donec sentiat infirmus, quod illa humiditas iam peruenit ad uesicam.	Then introduce the extremity of the clyster into the tube, then grasp your hand over the bladder with a proper constriction containing the humidity, until the infirm person feels that that humidity has already reached the bladder.
Si autem non est tibi praesens uesica, tunc accipe frustum pergameni, et fac ex eo circulum, et perfora ipsum ab omni rotunditate sua.	If however you do not have a bladder present, then take a piece of parchment, and make a circle from it, and perforate it from all its roundness.
Deinde intromitte filum forte in illis foraminibus, sicut reuoluuntur.	Then introduce a strong thread into those holes, as they revolve.
Deinde aggrega circulum, sicut aggregatur alsofratu: postquam tu ponis in eo illud quod uis ex humiditatibus, et oleis, et aquis.	Then aggregate the circle, as a loaf is aggregated: after you place upon it what you wish from humidities, and oils, and waters.
Deinde liga ipsum in instrumento: et fac cum eo sicut fecisti cum uesica ex expressione cum manu tua, donec perueniat humiditas ad uesicam.	Then tie it to the instrument, and do with it as you did with the bladder by squeezing with your hand, until the humidity reaches the bladder.
¶ De extractione Lapidis.	On the extraction of the Stone.
Caput LX.	Chapter LX.
Iam diximus in diuisione species Lapidis, et curationem eius cum medicinis: et dixi differentiam inter Lapidem generatum in renibus, et uesica, et signa illius totius: et dixi Lapidem in quo cadit operatio cum manu et sectio: et est Lapis generatus in uesica proprie: et ille qui figitur in uirga: et ego sum narrans illud cum expositione manifesta et abbreuiatione.	We have already discussed the classification of the types of stone, and its treatment with medicines; and I have explained the difference between stone generated in the kidneys and the bladder, and the signs of each; and I have explained the stone in which manual operation and incision are performed; and the stone generated in the bladder is properly so called; and the one which adheres to the urethra; and I am explaining that with clear exposition and abbreviation.
Dico ergo, quod Lapis generatus in uesica, plurimum accidit pueris.	Therefore, I say that stone generated in the bladder most often occurs in children.
Et ex signis eius est, quod urina egreditur ex uesica similis aquae in subtilitate sua: et apparet in ea harena alba, et fricat infirmus uirgam suam, et laborat cum ea, et multotiens pendet.	And among its signs is that the urine passes from the bladder like water in its subtlety, and white sand appears in it, and the sick person rubs their urethra and suffers with it, and often hangs down.
Deinde erigitur, et egreditur cum eo anus in multis eorum.	Then it rises and comes out with the anus in many of them.
Et est facilis sanatio puerorum, ex eo usquequo consequuntur quatuordecim annos.	And the cure is easy for children, as long as they reach fourteen years.
Et est difficilis in senibus.	And it is difficult in the elderly.
In iuuenibus autem est media, in eo quod est inter illud: et eius cuius Lapis est maior, curatio facilior: et si paruus, est econuerso illius cura.	However, in young people it is intermediate, in that it is between those two: and the one whose stone is larger, the cure is easier; and if it is small, the cure is the opposite of that.
Cum ergo peruenimus ad curationem, oportet in primis, ut mundificemus infirmum cum clisteri, quod extrahat totum stercus quod est in intestinis suis: ipsum enim quandoque prohibet inuentionem Lapidis apud inquisitionem.	Therefore, when we come to the treatment, it is necessary first to cleanse the sick person with an enema, which will remove all the waste that is in his intestines; for it sometimes prevents the discovery of the stone during the examination.
Deinde accipiatur infirmus cum pedibus suis, et concutiatur, et moueatur ad inferiora: ut descendat Lapis ad profundum uesicae, aut saliat de loco alto aliquotiens.	Then the sick person should be taken up by their feet and shaken and moved downwards, so that the stone descends to the depth of the bladder, or sometimes leaps from a higher position.
Deinde fac eum sedere inter manus tuas praeparatum, et manus eius sint sub coxis ipsius, ut fiat uesica tota decliuis ad inferiora.	Then have him sit between your hands, prepared, and let his hands be under his thighs, so that the entire bladder is inclined downwards.
Deinde perquire eum, et tange eum extrinsecus.	Then search him and touch him externally.
Si ergo sentis Lapidem in spacio, tunc propera statim cum sectione super ipsum.	If therefore you feel a stone in the space, then immediately proceed with incision above it.
Quod si non cadat sub tactu tuo omnino, tunc oportet ut abstergas digitum indicem cum oleo manus sinistrae, si infirmus est puer: aut digitum medium si est iuuenis completus: et intromittas ipsum in anum suum, et perquire de Lapide, donec stat sub digito tuo: et conuerte eum paulatim ad collum uesicae.	If, however, it does not fall under your touch at all, then you must wipe your index finger with oil from your left hand, if the patient is a child; or your middle finger if he is a full-grown youth; and insert it into his anus, and search for the stone until it is under your finger; and turn it gradually towards the neck of the bladder.
Deinde preme super ipsum cum digito tuo, et impelle ipsum ad exteriora aduersus locus, cuius sectionem uis: et praecipe ministro, ut premat uesicam manu sua, et praecipe alii ministro, ut extendat testiculos manu sua dextra ad superiora: et alia manu sua, ut remoueat cutem, quae est sub testiculis in parte a loco in quo est sectio.	Then press upon it with your finger, and drive it outward against the place which you wish to incise; and command a servant to press the bladder with his hand, and command another servant to raise the testicles with his right hand upward, and with his other hand to draw back the skin that is beneath the testicles, at the side of the place where the incision is to be.
Deinde intromitte Spatumile incidens, cuius forma haec est.	Then insert the Spatumile, which has this shape.
Et finde in eo quod est inter anum et testiculos, et non in medio, ad latus natis sinistrae: et sit sectio super ipsum lapidem, et digitus tuus sit in ano: et fiat sectio transuersa, ut sit sectio exterius ampla, et interius stricta, secundum quantitatem quod sit possibile egressio Lapidis ex ea non maior.	And find it in the space between the anus and testicles, and not in the middle, towards the left buttock; and let the incision be above the stone, and your finger be in the anus; and let the incision be transverse, so that the incision be wide externally and narrow internally, according to how much it is possible for the stone to emerge from it, not larger.
Fortasse enim comprimit digitus, qui est in ano Lapidem apud sectionem, et egreditur absque difficultate.	For perhaps the finger, which is in the anus, compresses the stone near the incision, and it emerges without difficulty.
Et scias, quod ex Lapide est cui sunt anguli et margines, quare fit difficilis exitus eius propter illud.	And know that if the stone has angles and edges, therefore its exit becomes difficult because of that.
Et ex eo est lenis, similis glandulae, et rotundus: et fit facilis egressus eius.	And if it is smooth, like a gland, and round, its exit becomes easy.
Ei ergo cui sunt anguli, et margines, adde in fissura.	Therefore, to the one with angles and edges, add in the fissure.
Quod si non egreditur ita, tunc oportet ut ingenies super ipsum: aut stringas super eum cum gesti decenter, cuius extremitas sit sicut Luna, quae stringat super Lapidem, et non euadat ab ea: aut ut intromittas sub eo instrumentum subtile, curuatae extremitatis.	If it does not emerge thus, then it is necessary that you devise something over it; or you should bind over it with a suitably formed instrument, whose extremity is like the Moon, which binds over the stone, and does not escape from it; or that you introduce a thin, curved instrument under it.
Si autem non potes super cum, tunc amplifica foramen parumper.	If, however, you cannot over it, then enlarge the opening slightly.
Quod si uincit te aliquid ex sanguine, abscinde ipsum cum zegi.	If, however, something from the blood conquers you, sever it with a zegi.
Si uero lapis est plus quam unus, tunc impelle in primis magnum ad os uesicae.	If, however, the stone is more than one, then drive the largest one first to the mouth of the bladder.
Deinde incide super ipsum.	Then cut upon it.
Postea impelle paruum post illud: et similiter fac si sunt plures duobus.	Afterwards, drive the small one after that: and similarly do if there are more than two.
Quod si magnus est ualde, tunc ignorantia est ut seces super ipsum sectione magna.	If it is very large, then ignorance it is to cut upon it with a large incision.
Quoniam accidit infirmo una duarum rerum, aut ut moriatur, aut accidit ei distillatio urinae assidua: proptera, quia non consolidatur locus omnino.	For it happens to the sick person one of two things, either that he dies, or that a constant dripping of urine happens to him, because the place is not completely consolidated.
Verum administra expulsionem eius, donec egrediatur: aut ingenia in fractura eius cum forficibus, donec extrahas eum frustatim.	But administer its expulsion, until it comes out: or devise ways in its fracture with forceps, until you extract it piece by piece.
Cum ergo compleueris operationem tuam, tunc imple uulnus thure, et aloe, et sanguine draconis: et stringe ipsum, et pone super ipsum pannum infusum oleo et uino, aut oleo rosato, et aqua frigida: ut sedetur apostema calidum.	When therefore you have completed your operation, then fill the wound with frankincense, and aloe, and dragon's blood: and bind it, and put over it a cloth soaked in oil and wine, or rose oil, and cold water, so that a hot abscess is subdued.
Deinde resupina infirmum super collum suum, et non soluas ligamentum, usque ad diem tertium.	Then lay the sick person on their back, and do not loosen the bandage until the third day.
Cum ergo solueris ipsum, embroca locum cum aqua, et oleo multo.	When therefore you have loosened it, anoint the place with water and much oil.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento dyafinicon, et unguento basilicon, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with diaphoretic ointment, and basilicon ointment, until it is healed.
Si autem accidit in uulnere apostema calidum additum, et corrosi, et illi similia: sicut si congeletur sanguis in uesica, et prohibeatur ex eo urina: et cognoscitur illud ex egressione sanguinis cum urina.	If however a hot abscess, added to the wound, and corrosives, and similar things happen: such as if blood is congealed in the bladder, and urine is prevented from passing through it, and this is known by the blood being expelled with the urine.
Intromitte ergo digitum tuum in uulnus, et extrahe illum sanguinem.	Therefore, insert your finger into the wound, and draw out that blood.
Nam si remanet, prouocat ad corruptionem uesicae, et putrefactionem eius.	For if it remains, it provokes corruption of the bladder, and its putrefaction.
Deinde ablue uulnus cum aceto, et aqua, et sale: et oppone omni speciei cum eo quod conuenit ex curatione, usquequo sanetur.	Then wash the wound with vinegar, water, and salt: and apply whatever remedy is appropriate for its treatment until it is healed.
Et oportet in horis curationis totius, ut liges duas coxas, et aggreges, caussa medicinarum quae ponuntur super locum.	And it is necessary in the hours of the entire treatment, that you bind the two hips, and bring together, for the sake of the medicines which are placed upon the place.
Quod si lapis est paruus, et sit in meatu uirgae, et figitur in eo, et prohibetur urinae exitus: tunc cura ipsum cum eo quod narro antequam peruenias ad sectionem.	If a stone is small and situated in the urethra, and is fixed there, and prevents the exit of urine: then treat it with what I have narrated before you arrive at the incision.
Multotiens enim a sectione excusaris per hanc curationem, iam enim probaui illud.	For many times you will be spared the incision by this treatment, for I have already proven it.
Et est, ut accipias Perforatorium ex ferro alferico, cuius haec est forma, triangulatae extremitatis, acutum, fixum in ligno.	And it is that you should take a perforator of iron, whose shape is this, of a triangular tip, sharp, fixed in wood.
Deinde accipe filum, et liga cum eo uirgam sub lapide ut non redeat ad uesicam.	Then take a thread, and tie the urethra with it beneath the stone so that it does not return to the bladder.
Deinde intromitte ferrum perforans in uirgam cum facilitate, donec perueniat Perforatorium ad ipsum lapidem: et reuolue Perforatorium manu tua in ipso lapide paulatim: et coneris perforationem eius, donec facias ipsum penetrare a parte altera.	Then introduce the perforating iron into the urethra with ease, until the perforator reaches the stone itself: and rotate the perforator with your hand on the stone gradually: and try to pierce it, until you make it penetrate on the other side.
Urina namque absoluitur statim.	For the urine is discharged immediately.
Deinde preme manum tuam super illud quod remansit ex lapide ab exteriori parte uirgae.	Then press your hand upon that which remains of the stone from the outside of the urethra.
Ipse enim frangitur, et egreditur cum urina, et sanatur infirmus.	For it breaks itself and emerges with the urine, and the sick person is cured.
Si autem non praeparatur tibi haec curatio, propter aliquid quod prohibet ab illo: tunc liga filum sub lapide, et filum aliud supra lapidem.	If, however, this treatment is not prepared for you, due to something that prevents it: then tie a thread under the stone, and another thread above the stone.
Deinde seca super lapidem in ipsa uirga inter duas ligaturas.	Then cut above the stone on the very urethra between the two ligatures.
Deinde extrahe ipsum.	Then extract it.
Postea solue ligamentum, et mundifica sanguinem congelatum, qui fit in uulnere.	Afterwards, loosen the ligature, and cleanse the congealed blood which forms in the wound.
Et non est necessarium ligamentum fili sub lapide, nisi ut non redeat ad uesicam: et ligamentum aliud desuper, nisi ut quando soluitur filum post egressionem lapidis, redeat cutis ad locum suum, et cooperiat uulnus: et propter illud necesse est tibi illud quando ligas filum superius, ut eleues cutem ad superiora, ut redeat apud complementum tuum, et cooperiat uulnus, sicut diximus.	And it is not necessary for the ligature of thread under the stone, unless so that it does not return to the bladder; and another ligature above, unless so that when the thread is loosened after the stone's exit, the skin returns to its place and covers the wound; and for that reason it is necessary for you to raise the skin upward when you tie the upper thread, so that it returns to its proper position and covers the wound, as we have said.
¶ De extractione Lapidis mulierum.	Concerning the extraction of the Stone in women.
Caput LXI.	Chapter LXI.
Parum generatur Lapis in mulieribus.	Little stone is generated in women.
Si autem accidat alicui earum lapis, tunc difficilis est curatio, et prohibetur propter modos multos.	If, however, a stone should befall any of them, then the cure is difficult, and is prohibited because of many methods.
Vnus eorum est: quod mulier fortasse est uirgo.	One of them is: that the woman is perhaps a virgin.
Et secundus est, quia tu non inuenis mulierem quae detegat seipsam medico, quando est casta, aut ex habentibus maritos.	And the second is, because you do not find a woman who reveals herself to a physician, when she is chaste, or from those who have husbands.
Tertius est, quia tu non inuenis mulierem bene scientem hanc artem, praecipue operationem cum manu.	The third is, because you do not find a woman well knowing this art, especially the operation with the hand.
Et quartus est longinquitas a loco lapidis: quare indiget sectione profunda, et in illo est timor.	And the fourth is the distance from the place of the stone: wherefore it needs a deep incision, and in that is fear.
Quod si necessitas prouocat ad illud, tunc oportet ut accipias mulierem medicam, bene scientem: et parum inuenitur.	If necessity provokes it, then it is necessary that you take a woman physician, well knowing: and few are found.
Si uero priuaris ea, tunc quaere medicum castum, subtilem, et praesenta mulierem obstetricem bene doctam in re mulierum, aut mulierem quae in hac arte innuit partem artis: fac ergo eam praesentem, et praecipue ei, ut faciat totum quod praecipis ei ex inquisitione super lapidem.	If however you privately entrust this to her, then seek a chaste, skillful physician, and present a knowledgeable midwife skilled in women's matters, or a woman who hints at skill in this art: thus make her present, and especially to her, have her do everything you prescribe to her in inquiring about the stone.
In primis quod est, ut aspiciat si mulier est uirgo: tunc oportet ut intromittat digitum in anum eius, et quaerat lapidem.	First, that she look if the woman is a virgin: then it is necessary that she introduce her finger into her anus, and seek the stone.
Si ergo inuenit ipsum, coartet eum sub digito suo, et tunc praecipe obstetrici, ut intromittat digitum suum in uuluam infirmae, et inquirat super lapidem, postquam ponit manum suam sinistram super uesicam, et comprimit eam compressione bona.	If therefore she finds it, she should hold it under her finger, and then instruct the midwife to insert her finger into the woman's vagina and inquire about the stone, after placing her left hand upon the bladder and pressing it with good pressure.
Si ergo inuenit lapidem, tunc oportet ut gradatim moueat eum ab orificio uesicae ad inferiora cum summa uirtutis suae, donec perueniat cum eo ad radicem coxae.	If therefore she finds the stone, then it is necessary that she gradually move it from the opening of the bladder downwards with all her strength, until she reaches it with the root of the thigh.
Deinde secet super eum apud oppositionem medietatis uuluae apud radicem coxae, ex quacunque parte praeparatur ei, et sentit lapidem in illa parte: et digitus eius non remoueatur a lapide, coartans sub eo: et sit sectio parua in primis.	Then she shall cut upon it at the opposing middle of the vulva at the root of the thigh, from whichever side it is prepared for her, and she feels the stone in that part: and her finger shall not be removed from the stone, holding it under it: and let the incision be small at first.
Deinde intromittat radium super illam sectionem.	Then insert a probe into that incision.
Si ergo sentit lapidem, tunc addat in sectionem secundum quantitatem proportionatam quod lapis egreditur ab ea.	If therefore she feels the stone, then she should add to the incision according to the proportionate quantity by which the stone emerges from it.
Et scias, quod species lapidis sunt multae.	And know that the kinds of stones are many.
Ex his enim est paruus, et magnus, lenis et asper, longus, et rotundus habens ramos.	For among them is the small, and the large, the smooth and the rough, the long, and the round one having branches.
Scias ergo species eius, ut significetur tibi per hoc super illud quod uis.	Know therefore its kinds, so that you may be shown by this concerning that which you wish.
Si ergo uincit te sanguis, tunc adde in loco zegi tritum, et tene ipsum hora una, donec abscindatur sanguis.	If therefore blood overcomes you, then add in the place bruised, crushed, and hold it one hour, until the blood is severed.
Deinde redi ad operationem tuam, donec egrediatur lapis: et fac, ut praepares tecum ex instrumentis, quae dixi in extractione lapidis in uiris, ut adiuueris per ea in operatione tua.	Then return to your operation, until the stone emerges; and do as I have instructed you regarding instruments for the extraction of stones in men, so that you may be aided by them in your operation.
Quod si uincit te fluxus sanguinis, et scis quod expulsio sanguinis est ex arteria quae incisa est: tunc pone puluerem super locum, et stringe eum cum puluillis strictura decenti: et non mutes illud: et dimitte lapidem, et non extrahas ipsum.	If, however, a flow of blood overcomes you, and you know that the expulsion of blood is from an artery that has been cut, then place powder on the area and bind it tightly with suitable bandages; and do not change it; and leave the stone, and do not extract it.
Fortasse enim morietur mulier infirma.	For perhaps the weak woman will die.
Deinde cura uulnus.	Then treat the wound.
Cum ergo sedatur acuitas sanguinis post dies, et putrefit locus, tune redi ad operationem tuam, donec egrediatur lapis.	When therefore the sharpness of the blood subsides after days, and the area becomes putrid, then return to your operation, until the stone emerges.
¶ De sectione suiper Herniam aquosam.	Concerning the incision of a watery hernia.
Caput LXII.	Chapter LXII.
Ramex aquosa non est, nisi aggregatio humiditatis in sifac albo, quod est sub cute testiculi continente ouum: et nominatur sifac.	A watery hernia is not there, unless a collection of moisture in a white sifac, which is beneath the skin of the testicle containing the egg: and it is called sifac.
Et quandoque est in panniculo proprio sibi, quem praeparauit ei natura in parte oui, donec putetur: quod est ouum aliud, et est cutis testiculi inter sifac album, quod diximus: et non fit illud nisi raro.	And sometimes it is in the proper membrane prepared for it by nature in the part of the egg, until it rots: which is another egg, and there is the skin of the testicle between the white sifac, which we mentioned: and this does not happen except rarely.
Et generatio quidem huius ramicis, est ex debilitate quae accidit testiculis: quare effunditur ad eos haec materia.	And the generation of this hernia indeed is from weakness which happens to the testicles: wherefore this matter is poured out to them.
Et quandoque accidit ex percussione super testiculos.	And sometimes it happens from a blow on the testicles.
Et haec humiditas est habens colores multos.	And this moisture has many colours.
Aut enim est color eius decliuis ad citrinitatem, aut est sanguineus rubeus, aut faeculentus, niger, aut est aquosus albus, et est illud quod est plus.	For either its color is inclined to yellowness, or it is blood-red, or foul, black, or watery white, and that is what is more.
Et signa quibus scitur ubi sit aggregatio aquae, sunt ista.	And the signs by which it is known where the aggregation of water is, are these.
Nam si est in sifac albo quod diximus, tunc apostema est rotundum ad longitudinem parumper sicut figura oui: et non apparet testiculus, quoniam humiditas continet eum ab omni parte.	For if it is in the white sifac that we mentioned, then the abscess is round to a small length like the shape of an egg: and the testicle does not appear, because the moisture contains it from every side.
Et si est humiditas in panniculo proprio sibi, tunc apostema est rotundum cum parte oui, et propter hoc extimat homo quia est ouum aliud.	And if the moisture is in the proper pannicle to itself, then the abscess is round with a part of an egg, and because of this a man estimates that it is another egg.
Et si humiditas est inter cutem testiculorum et sifac album, tunc cadit sub sensu.	And if the moisture is between the skin of the testicles and the white sifac, then it falls under the sense.
Quando ergo uis cognitionem coloris humiditatis, tunc experire colorem humiditatis in apostemate cum Intromisso quadrato, cuius forma praecessit.	Therefore, when you wish knowledge of the color of the moisture, then experience the color of the moisture in the abscess with the introduced square, whose form preceded.
Secundum illud ergo quod egreditur in uestigio Intromissi, iudica de illo quod est inter ipsum.	Therefore, according to that which emerges in the trace of the Intromiss, judge of that which is between it.
Cum ergo uenimus ad curationem cum ferro, tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmo, ut phlebotometur si possibile est ei illud, et uides corpus eius plenum.	When, therefore, we come to treatment with iron, then it is necessary that you instruct the sick person, that he be bled if possible for him, and you see his body full.
Deinde resupinetur super dorsum suum super rem altam parum, et pone sub eo pannos multos.	Then he will be laid on his back on a slightly raised object, and place many cloths under him.
Deinde sede tu super sinistram eius, et praecipe ministro, ut sedeat a dextra eius, qui extendat uirgam eius ad unum duorum laterum cutis testiculorum, et ad partem mirach uentris.	Then sit you on his left side, and instruct the attendant to sit on his right, who will extend his rod to one of the two sides of the skin of the testicles, and to the part of the navel of the belly.
Deinde accipe spatumile latum, et seca cutem testiculorum ex medio per longitudinem, usque prope pectinem: et fiat sectio secundum rectitudinem aequedistantis lineae quae diuidit cutem testiculorum, donec perueniat ad sifac album comprehendens: et excoria ipsum et obserua, uel caue ex hoc, ut seces ipsum: et sit excoriatio tua qua ipsum excorias, ex parte quae suspenditur cum ouo plus: et subtiliter scrutare cum excoriatione secundum quantitatem quod tibi possibile est.	Then take a wide spatula, and cut the skin of the testicles from the middle lengthwise, until near the groin; and let the incision be according to the straightness of an equidistant line which divides the skin of the testicles, until it reaches the white sifac that encompasses it; and scrape it and observe it, or be cautious about this, so that you cut it: and let your scraping, by which you scrape it, be from the part which hangs with the egg more; and search subtly with the scraping according to the amount that is possible for you.
Deinde perfora sifac plenum aqua perforatione ampla, et extrahe totam aquam.	Then pierce the sifac full of water with a wide perforation, and draw out all the water.
Deinde separa inter duo labia sectionis cum uncinis, et extende sifac ad superiora, et non tangas cutem testiculorum comprehendentem: et incide sifac qualitercunque est possibile tibi incidere ipsum, aut cum totalitate sua, aut frustatim, praecipue latus eius subtile.	Then separate the two lips of the incision with hooks, and extend the sifac upwards, and do not touch the skin of the testicles that encompasses it; and cut the sifac however it is possible for you to cut it, either with its entirety or in pieces, especially its slender side.
Nam si tu non exquisite perscrutaris, in incisione eius non fit securitas, quin aqua redeat.	For if you do not carefully examine it, there is no security in its incision, lest the water return.
Si autem procedit ouum exterius a cute sua in hora operationis tuae: tunc quando compleueris sectionem sifac, reduc ipsum.	If however the egg protrudes externally from its skin during your operation, then when you have completed the incision of the sifac, pull it back.
Deinde aggrega duo labia cutis testiculorum cum sutura.	Then bring together the two lips of the scrotal skin with sutures.
Deinde cura ipsum sicut reliqua uulnera, donec sanetur.	Then treat it as other wounds until it heals.
Quod si inuenis ouum corruptum ex nigredine alia, tunc oportet ut liges uasa, quae sunt suspensorium, timens fluxum sanguinis.	If you find a corrupted egg from another blackness, then it is necessary to tie the vessels, which are the suspensory ligaments, fearing the flow of blood.
Deinde abscinde testiculum cum suspensorio, et extrahe ouum: postea cura illud cum eo quod diximus.	Then cut off the testicle with the suspensory ligament, and remove the egg; afterwards treat it with what we have said.
Si uero aqua est aggregata in duabus partibus, tunc scias quia sunt duae ramices: seca ergo partem aliam secundum quod fecisti in altera aequaliter.	If, however, water is collected in two parts, then know that there are two branches: therefore cut the other part in the same way as you did the other, equally.
Et si aequatur tibi, ut sit operatio una, tunc fac: deinde absterge sanguinem.	And if it is equal to you, so that it is a single operation, then do it; then wipe away the blood.
Et intromitte in sectiones lanam submersam in oleo, aut in oleo rosato: et pone deforis lanam aliam quam submersisti in uino et oleo, et expande eam super duos testiculos, et mirach uentris: et pone desuper pannos duplicatos, et sunt puluilli: et liga eos desuper cum ligamento, quod est habens sex secundum hanc formam.	And introduce into the incisions wool soaked in oil, or in rose oil; and place outside wool which you have soaked in wine and oil, and spread it over the two testicles, and the belly; and put on top doubled cloths, and they are cushions; and tie them on top with a bandage, which has six parts according to this form.
Deinde sumantur duo panni, et suantur, et impleantur la na carminata, secundum hanc similitudinem: et fiant extremitates quibus premitur ex coto, aut lana humida: et aggregentur cum strictura in lumbari bracharum: et una extremitatum accipiat super anum usque ad dorsum, et secunda accipiat ad partem pectinis: et duae extremitates super duas coxas inferius, et duae extremitates aliae super duo inguina, et aggregetur strictura tota in lumbari bracharum.	Then take two cloths, and sew them together, and fill them with dyed wool, according to this likeness; and let the edges with which it is pressed be of linen, or damp wool; and let them be gathered with a constriction at the lumbar region of the breeches; and one edge take over the anus up to the back, and the second take to the side of the pubis; and two edges over the two thighs below, and two other edges over the two groins, and let the entire constriction be gathered at the lumbar region of the breeches.
Et, quandoque artificialiter medicatur haec ramex cum cauterio loco sectionis cum ferro: et est, ut accipias cauterium cultellare subtile, et seces cum eo cutem testiculorum: et est ignitum, secundum quod narrauimus: donec quando detegitur sifac album continens aquam: tunc accipe cauterium, secundum hanc formam.	And sometimes this branch is artificially treated with a cautery at the site of the incision with iron: and it is as if you take a fine cautery knife, and cut the skin of the testicles with it; and it is heated, as we have stated; until when white, milky pus containing water is revealed; then take a cautery, according to this form.
Assimilatur literae graecae.	It is similar to the Greek letter.
Deinde perfora cum eo illud sifac, et est ignitum, donec egrediatur humiditas tota.	Then pierce it with it, and let it be heated, until all the moisture comes out.
Deinde extende sifac cum uncinis, et excoria cum cauterio subtili ignito, et incide ipsum secundum quod possibile est tibi, donec eradices totum eius.	Then spread the pus with hooks, and scrape it with a heated fine cautery, and cut it as much as possible until you remove the whole of it.
Et caue ex ouo, ne tangat ipsum ignis.	And beware, from the egg, lest the fire touch it.
Et scias, quod haec operatio est saluior, et longinquior a fluxu sanguinis, et melior quam operatio cum sectione.	And know that this operation is safer, and further from blood flow, and better than an operation with a cut.
Si uero contrarietatem tibi facit in hora sectionis, aut in hora cauterii apostema calidum, aut fluxus sanguinis, aut aliquid aliud: tunc oportet ut cures quod contrarietatem tibi facit ex illo cum curatione quae conuenit ei, secundum quod praemissum est.	If, however, in the hour of the incision, or in the hour of the cautery, a hot abscess, or blood flow, or anything else, presents opposition to you: then it is necessary that you treat that which opposes you from it with the treatment which is suitable for it, according to what has been stated previously.
Si autem infirmus est timidus, et non expectat super hanc operationem, propter horribilitatem suam: tunc administra perforationem secundum quod ego narro illud: et est.	But if the sick person is fearful, and does not expect this operation because of its horror: then administer a perforation according to what I tell of it: and that is it.
Quando certificatur tibi apud te per illud quod diximus de significationibus, quod ramex est aquosa: tunc oportet quod facias sedere infirmum super sedem eleuatam.	When it is certified to you by what we have said about the signs that the branch is watery, then it is necessary that you make the sick person sit on a raised seat.
Deinde perfora apostema in inferiori parte sui cum spatumili lato: et pone perforationem secundum longitudinem corporis, et sit apertio ampla, donec currat aqua tota.	Then pierce the abscess in its lower part with a wide spatula, and make the perforation along the length of the body, and let the opening be wide, until all the water runs out.
Deinde pone super locum cotum, et liga ipsum, et dimitte ipsum ut currat residuum aquae: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur uulnus.	Then place a poultice over the area, and bind it, and let it run until the remaining water drains out; then treat it until the wound heals.
Si autem contrarietas sit egressioni aquae in hora qua perforas ipsam: et non sit illud nisi propterea, quia panniculus albus contrarietatem facit in orificio uulneris, et prohibet exitum aquae: tunc oportet ut intromittas pennam in uulnus, aut instrumentum cum quo extrahitur aqua hydropicorum, cuius forma praecessit: aut adde in operatione uulneris parumper.	But if there is an obstruction to the outflow of water at the time you pierce it, and it is not due to anything but that a white bandage causes an obstruction in the wound opening and prevents the water from exiting, then you must insert a pen into the wound, or an instrument with which the water of the hydrops is extracted, whose form has been previously described, or add a little more to the wound operation.
Et scias, quod aqua redit, et aggregatur post sex menses, aut circiter eos.	And know that the water returns and gathers after six months, or approximately that time.
Cum ergo aggregatur, tunc pertoretur secundum eundem modum, et pertransibit infirmus dies suos.	When it gathers again, then it should be pierced according to the same method, and the sick person will pass their days.
¶ De cura Ramicis carnosae.	Concerning the treatment of fleshy tumors.
Caput LXIII.	Chapter LXIII.
Scias, quod in sectione super hanc Ramicem, est ex timore perducente ad perniciem in pluribus dispositionibus.	Know that in the section above this tumor, there is fear leading to harm in many dispositions.
Quapropter uidetur mihi eius dimissio saluari ex ea.	Therefore, it seems to me that its release is to be saved from that.
Et ego sum rememorans operationem in ea, et species apostematis.	And I am recalling the operation on it, and the appearance of the abscess.
Dico ergo, quod accidunt apostemata multa in corporibus, ex quibus componuntur testiculi: et fit illud ex caussis multis, scilicet.	Therefore, I say that many abscesses occur in the bodies from which the testicles are composed; and it happens from many causes, namely.
Aut ex superfluitate acuta, uel acri, quae effunditur ad testiculos.	Or from an acute or acrid superfluity, which is poured out to the testicles.
Aut ex percussione.	Or from a blow.
Et est color apostematis secundum colorem corporis, et non inuenitur ei dolor: et est apostema graue.	And the color of the abscess is according to the color of the body, and no pain is found in it; and it is a serious abscess.
Et fortasse est apostema lapideum, cuius color est fuscus, et non est sensus ei.	And perhaps it is a stony abscess, whose color is dark, and there is no feeling in it.
Et quandoque fit ex nodatione arteriarum, et inflatione earum: sicut iam praecessit eius rememoratio: aut ex inflatione uenarum.	And sometimes it arises from the knotting of arteries, and their swelling: as its recollection has already preceded; or from the swelling of veins.
Quod ergo est ex eis ex inflatione arteriarum, cognoscitur per dispositionem apostematis, quando comprimis ipsum digitis tuis.	Therefore, what is from them, from the swelling of the arteries, is recognized by the disposition of the abscess, when you press it with your fingers.
Et non oportet ut tangas ipsum prorsus.	And you should not touch it completely.
Illud uero quod fit ex inflatione uenarum, non dispergitur ex eo aliquid apud compressionem cum digitis.	But that which arises from the swelling of veins, does not disperse anything from it upon compression with the fingers.
Et iam possibile est, quod super hanc speciem fiat sectio, et super reliquas carnes: et est, ut seces cutem testiculorum.	And it is possible now that a section be made upon this kind, and upon the other flesh; and it is, as if one should sever the skin of the testicles.
Deinde extende ouum ad sursum, et extrahe ipsum cum sifach albo: et libera suspensorium ex uasis, et liga uasa: et incide suspensorium postquam tu liberas ipsum ab omni parte ex partibus oui.	Then extend the egg upwards, and extract it with a white sifach; and free the suspensory from the vessels, and tie the vessels; and cut the suspensory after you have freed it from every part from the parts of the egg.
Si ergo ouum consolidatum est cum illis carnibus natis, tunc oportet ut attrahas ouum, et incidas ipsum.	If therefore the egg is consolidated with those born flesh, then it is necessary to pull the egg, and cut it.
Et si adhaerentia est inter aliquid ex siphaket, aut in eo quod est inter uasa: tunc oportet ut liberes totam illam adhaerentiam, et incidas eam incisione rotunda.	And if there is adhesion between any of the siphaket, or in that which is between the vessels, then it is necessary to free all that adhesion, and cut it with a circular incision.
Si autem est natiuitas carnis in loco adhaerentiae quae est retro: tunc oportet ut incidas totum eius, et extrahas ouum, sicut diximus.	If however there is a birth of flesh in the place of adhesion which is behind, then it is necessary to cut all of it, and extract the egg, as we have said.
Cum ergo completur operatio tua, tnnc imple uulnus in lana infusa in oleo rosato, et uino: deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	When therefore your operation is completed, then fill the wound with wool infused in rose-oil and wine; then treat it with the rest of the treatment, until it is healed.
¶ De cura Ramicis, quae est cum Vite.	Of the treatment of Ramicis, which is with Vite.
Caput LXIIII.	Chapter Sixty-four.
Uitis est apostema inuolutum quadam inuolutione, simile botro, cum mollificatione testiculorum: et fit difficilis super infirmum motus et exercitium, et deambulatio.	Vitis is an abscess enveloped by a certain wrapping, resembling a cluster of grapes, accompanied by softening of the testicles; and it makes movement and exercise, and walking, difficult for the infirm person.
Et in curatione huius aegritudinis est ex timore, propter illud cuius praecessit rememoratio.	And in the treatment of this illness there is fear, because of that which preceded it, remembered.
Verum oportet, ut dicamus operationem in ea secundum quod fecerunt primi.	But it is necessary, that we speak of the operation upon it according to what the first ones did.
Dico ergo, quod oportet ut facias sedere infirmum super sedem eleuatam.	I say therefore, that it is necessary to make the sick person sit on a raised seat.
Deinde impelle suspensorium testiculorum ad inferiora.	Then push down the suspensory ligament of the testicles.
Deinde tene cutem testiculorum cum digitis tuis, cum uasis quae sunt propinqua uirgae: et teneat ea minister alius, et extendat ea extensione uehementi.	Then grasp the skin of the testicles with your fingers, near the vessels that are close to the penis; and let another attendant hold them, and stretch them with great force.
Deinde incide cum spatumili lato acuto sectione transuersa in directo uasorum, donec detegantur uasa.	Then, with a broad, sharp spatule, make a transverse incision directly over the vessels, until the vessels are exposed.
Deinde excoria ab omni parte, sicut diximus tibi in extractione Arteriarum quae sunt in timporibus.	Then, scrape away from all sides, as we told you in the extraction of arteries in the temples.
Postea fige in eis acum in qua sit filum duplum, et liga ipsum in primo locorum quibus accidunt Vites: et liga ipsum iterum in ultimo eorum.	Afterwards, insert a needle with a double thread into them, and tie it in the first place where the veins occur: and tie it again in their last one.
Deinde seca ea in media sectione recta secundum longitudinem corporis, et extrahe quod aggregatur ex humiditatibus faeculentis corruptis.	Then cut it in the middle, straight across, lengthwise, and remove the material that has accumulated from corrupt, putrid moisture.
Deinde cura uulnus cum curatione reliquorum uulnerum, in quibus uis generari saniem, ut cadant uasa quae nutriunt unum testiculorum.	Then treat the wound with the treatment of the other wounds, in which the force generates pus, so that the vessels that nourish one testicle may fall.
Non est enim malum per illud.	For there is no harm through it.
Si autem accidat Vitis omnibus uasis, tunc oportet ut extrahantur propter hoc testiculi cum uasis: ut non priuetur ouum nutrimento, propter incisionem, et tabescat, uel arescat, et non sit iuuamentum cum eis.	However, if all the vessels are affected, then it is necessary that the testicles be removed with the vessels, so that the egg is not deprived of nourishment, due to the incision, and becomes wasted, or dries up, and is not beneficial with them.
¶ De cura Ramicis intestinalis.	On the treatment of intestinal colic.
Caput LXV.	Chapter LXV.
Euentus huius Ramicis est ex sectione, quae accidit in sifach extenso super uentrem in parte inguinum ex mirach uentris.	The result of this colic is from a section, which occurs in the extended sifach over the abdomen in the groin area from the abdominal mirach.
Quare descendunt intestina ex illa Ruptura ad unum testiculorum.	Why do the intestines descend from that rupture to one testicle.
Et haec Ruptura est aut ex sifach, aut extensione eius.	And this rupture is either from sifach, or its extension.
Et accidunt istae duae species ex caussis multis: aut ex percussione, aut saltu, aut clamore, aut eleuatione rei grauis, et similibus.	And these two types occur from many causes: either from a blow, or a jump, or a shout, or the lifting of a heavy object, and similar things.
Et signum, quando est ex extensione sifach.	And a sign, when it is from the extension of sifach.
Est quod accidit paulatim in tempore longo, et non accidit subito: et est apostema aequale uersus profundum: propterea, quod sifach comprimit intestinum.	It is that which happens gradually over a long time, and does not happen suddenly: and it is an abscess equal to the depth; because the sifach compresses the intestine.
Et signum eius quando est ex sectione sifach, quia facit accidere ex principio sui dolorem uehementem subito: et est apostema diuersum, apparens sub cute propinque: et illud est propter exitum intestini, et cursus eius ad exteriora sifach.	And a sign of it, when it is from a section of sifach, because it causes a sudden, intense pain at its beginning; and the abscess is different, appearing under the skin nearby; and that is because of the exit of the intestine, and its course to the exterior of the sifach.
Et quandoque egreditur cum intestino zirbum: et nominatur haec Ramex intestinalis, et zirbia: et quandoque fit cum uentositate.	And sometimes it emerges with the intestine as a zirbum; and this is called a intestinal ramex, and zirbia; and sometimes it happens with windiness.
Et quandoque currit in intestinum stercus, et retinetur illic: et est cum eo pernicies infirmi: quoniam facit accidere dolorem prauum, et praecipue quando premitur.	And sometimes faeces runs into the intestine and is retained there; and this is harmful to the sick person, because it causes a slight pain, and especially when it is pressed.
Et in curatione specierum aegritudinis huius cum ferro est timor: quare oportet ut caueatur casus in ea.	And in the treatment of these types of illnesses, there is a fear with iron; therefore, one must beware of injury in it.
Et modus operationis est, ut praecipias infirmo, ut reducat intestinum manu sua ad interiora concauitatis suae, si obedit reditui.	And the method of operation is that you instruct the sick person to pull back the intestine with his own hand into the interior concavity of his body, if it yields to the withdrawal.
Deinde resupinetur super collum suum inter manus tuas: et eleua crura eius.	Then let him be placed supine on his back between your hands, and raise his legs.
Deinde extende cutem quae sequitur cutem ad superiora, et seca cutem testiculorum totam per longitudinem.	Then stretch the skin which follows the skin upwards, and cut the skin of the testicles completely along its length.
Deinde fige in duobus labiis sectionis uncinos, secundum quod indiges ad aperiendum sectionem cum eis: et sectio sit secundum quantitatem, quod sit possibile, ut egrediatur ex ea ouum.	Then fix hooks in the two lips of the incision, according to what you need to open the incision with them; and let the incision be according to the amount, that it is possible for the egg to emerge from it.
Deinde excoria siphak, et quae sunt sub cute testiculorum, donec quando detegitur sifach album, durum ab omni parte: tunc intromitte digitum tuum indicem in eo quod sequitur testiculum, in eo quod est inter siphach album, quod est sub cute oui, et inter sifach secundum, et absolue cum eo adhaerentiam quae est in posteriori parte oui.	Then scrape away the siphak, and what is under the skin of the testicles, until when the white, hard siphak is revealed on all sides; then insert your index finger into that which follows the testicle, into that which is between the white siphak, which is under the skin of the egg, and the second siphak, and loosen with it the adhesion that is on the posterior part of the egg.
Deinde moue cum manu dextra ad interiora cutem testiculorum: et cum hoc extende sifach album ad sursum, cum manu sinistra: et eleua ouum cum sifach ad partem sectionis: et praecipe ministro, ut extendat ouum ad sursum: et tu solue adhaerentiam, quae est retro solutione completa.	Then move the skin of the testicles inwards with your right hand; and with this, pull the white siphak upwards with your left hand; and lift the egg with the siphak towards the incision; and order the attendant to pull the egg upwards; and you loosen the adhesion which is behind the complete release.
Et quaere digitis tuis, ut non sit aliquid illic ex intestino inuoluto in sifach albo duro.	And examine with your fingers, that there is nothing there from the intestine wrapped in the hard white siphak.
Si autem inuenis ex eo aliquid: tunc impelle ipsum ad uentrem inferius.	If however you find something of it: then push it towards the lower abdomen.
Deinde accipe acum, in qua sit filum grossum, factum licinium ex decem filis: et intromitte ipsam apud postremum sifach, id est, tunicae, quod est sub cute testiculorum quae sequitur sectionem: deinde incide extremitates quae eminent ex filo, donec sint quatuor fila.	Then take a needle with a thick thread, made of linen from ten threads; and insert it at the last siphak, that is, of the tunic, which is under the skin of the testicles which follows the incision; then cut the ends which project from the thread, until there are four threads.
Deinde compone quaedam eorum super quaedam cum figura quae sit in modo crucis: et liga cum eis alsifach, de quo diximus, quia est sub cute testiculorum ligamento uehementi, donec non possit aliquod ex uasis, quae nutriunt eos mittere ad eos aliquid: ut non accidat inde apostema calidum.	Then place some of them over some with a cross-shaped figure; and tie with them the alsifach, of which we spoke, because it is under the skin of the testicles with a strong ligature, until no blood vessels that nourish them can send anything to them; so that no hot abscess may occur from this.
Et pone iterum ligamentum secundum extra ligamentum primum, longinquum ab eo minus duobus digitis.	And place another ligature again, outside the first ligature, a distance of less than two fingers from it.
Et post ista duo ligamenta dimitte ex sifach, quod est sub cute testiculorum, quantitatem magnitudinis digiti: et incide reliquum totum secundum rotunditatem, et aufer ex eo ouum.	And after these two ligatures, leave from the sifach, which is under the skin of the testicles, a quantity the size of a finger; and cut the rest completely around, and remove the egg from it.
Deinde seca in inferiori parte cutis testiculorum sectione, ex qua currit sanguis, et sanies: sicut narrauimus in eo quod praemissum est.	Then cut in the lower part of the skin of the testicles, at the incision from which blood and pus runs, as we have described in what has been said before.
Deinde administra lanam submersam in oleo, et pone in uulnus: et administra ligamentum quod narrauimus.	Then apply wool soaked in oil, and place it on the wound; and apply the ligature that we have described.
Et quandoque cauterizatur sifach album quod diximus, post incisionem eius timendo de fluxu sanguinis.	And sometimes the white sifach that we mentioned is cauterized after its incision, fearing the flow of blood.
Multotiens enim accidit illud.	For this often happens.
Et dimitte ligamentum, donec cadat per se.	And leave the ligature until it falls off by itself.
Si autem tardatur casus eius, tunc embrocetur cum aqua calida: et pone super ipsum illud quod diximus, donec cadat.	If however its falling is delayed, then it should be moistened with warm water; and place upon it that which we have mentioned, until it falls off.
Deinde cura uulnus cum reliqua curatione uulnerum, donec curetur.	Then treat the wound with the rest of the treatment for wounds, until it is healed.
¶ De Ramice uentosa.	Concerning the windy (or tympanic) ramia.
Caput LXVI.	Chapter LXVI.
IN Hac Ramice non uidi aliquem qui ausus fuerit super curationem eius cum ferro.	In this ramia, I have not seen anyone who dared to use iron in its treatment.
Et primi quidem dixerunt, quod fit sicut narrauimus in Ramice quae est cum Vite.	And indeed the first ones said that it happens as we have described in the ramia that is with the vine.
Quod est, ut liges uasa post sectionem super ea cum facilitate inferius: deinde seca in medio, et cura postremo cum eo quod aperit ipsum, donec cadant uasa: et cura uulnus, secundum quod diximus, donec sanetur.	That is, to tie the vessels after the incision, then cut in the middle, and finally treat it with that which opens it, until the vessels fall out: and treat the wound as we said, until it is healed.
¶ De disruptione quae fit in inguinibus.	Concerning the rupture that occurs in the groin.
Caput LXVII.	Chapter LXVII.
Quando accidit Ruptura in inguinibus, sicut diximus, et eminet locus, et non descendit ad testiculos aliquid ex intestinis: et si descendit, est illud parum, et redit in omnibus horis: uerum si prolongatur cum ea tempus, additur fissura in sifach, donec descendunt intestina in sifach.	When rupture occurs in the groin, as we said, and the area protrudes, and nothing from the intestines descends to the testicles; and if it descends, it is little, and returns at all hours; but if time passes with it, a fissure is added to the sifach, until the intestines descend into the sifach.
Et accidit illud ex extensione sifach, quod est in inguinibus, sicut diximus.	And that occurs from the stretching of the sifach, which is in the groin, as we said.
Quod est, quia extenditur sifach: deinde mollificatur, et apostematur locus, et eminet.	Because the sifach is stretched, then the area softens, and an abscess forms, and it protrudes.
Et cura eius est cum cauterio, sicut praecessit eius narratio.	And its treatment is with a cautery, as its preceding description stated.
Et quandoque curatur cum ferro, secundum hunc modum: et est, ut iaceat infirmus super dorsum suum inter manus tuas.	And sometimes it is treated with iron, according to this method: and it is that the sick person should lie on their back between your hands.
Deinde seca locum Rupturae apostematum et eminentem, sectione per latitudinem, secundum quantitatem trium digitorum.	Then cut the location of the suppurated and protruding rupture, cutting across its width, according to the quantity of three fingers.
Deinde stringe alsifak et, quae sunt sub cute, donec quando detegitur sifach album, quod est sub cute quae sequitur ipsum.	Then squeeze the alsifak and what is beneath the skin, until when the white sifach is revealed, which is beneath the skin that follows it.
Tunc accipe radium, et pone ipsum super locum eminentem ex sifach, et preme ipsum ad profundum uentris.	Then take a radius, and place it over the protruding location of the sifach, and press it to the depth of the belly.
Deinde sue duo loca eminentia super extremitatem radii ex sifach, et annecte cum sutura unum eorum cum altero: deinde extrahe extremitatem radii.	Then sew the two protruding locations above the extremity of the radius from the sifach, and connect one of them with the other with a suture; then pull out the extremity of the radius.
Et non incidas alsifach omnino, neque tendas ouum, neque aliud, sicut feci te scire in curatione ramicis intestinalis.	And do not cut the alsifach at all, nor stretch the egg, nor anything else, as I have made you know in the treatment of intestinal twigs.
Deinde cura illud curatione uulnerum.	Then treat it with the treatment of wounds.
Cum ergo incidis fila, mundifica illud, et restaura uulnus, donec consolidetur.	When therefore you cut the filaments, cleanse it, and restore the wound, until it consolidates.
Sisach enim contrahitur, et non additur eminentia Rupturae.	For the sisach contracts, and no protrusion of the rupture is added.
Et cauterium est melius in hoc loco: quoniam est propinquius ad salutem.	And a cautery is better in this place, because it is nearer to health.
¶ De mollificatione cutis testiculorum.	Concerning the softening of the skin of the testicles.
Caput LXVIII.	Chapter LXVIII.
Multotiens mollificatur cutis testiculorum in quibusdam hominibus, propter quod mollificantur carnes quae sunt inter ea, et foedatur aspectus eius.	The skin of the testicles is often softened in some men, so that the flesh between them softens as well, and its appearance becomes disfigured.
Ergo necesse est ei qui rogatur in curatione eius, ut faciat iacere infirmum super dorsum suum, et incidat totam cutem quae mollificata est super cutem naturalem.	Therefore, it is necessary for the one who is asked about its treatment, to make the sick person lie on their back, and to cut all the softened skin over the natural skin.
Deinde aggreget duo labia cum sutura: et si uis, sue in primis superfluitatem cutis mollificatae tribus suturis, aut quatuor, et firma suturam.	Then he should bring together the two lips with sutures: and if he wishes, he should first suture the excess of softened skin with three or four sutures, and make the suture firm.
Deinde incide inter sututuras.	Then cut between the sutures.
Deinde cura curatione reliquorum uulnerum, usquequo sanetur, et cadant fila.	Then treat the remaining wounds with care until they heal and the threads fall out.
¶ De Castratione.	Concerning Castration.
Caput LXIX.	Chapter LXIX.
Scias, quod Castratio in lege nostra excommunicata est: et propter illud liceret mihi, ut non rememorarer eius in libro meo isto: et non est necessaria rememoratio eius, nisi propter duos modos.	Know that castration is excommunicated in our law; and because of that, I might not have mentioned it in this book of mine; and its mention is not necessary except for two reasons.
Quorum unus est, ut sit illud in scientia medici quando interrogatur de ea: et ut sciat curationem eius cui accidit.	One of which is that it should be in the knowledge of a physician when questioned about it, and that he may know the treatment of one who has undergone it.
Et modus alter est, quod nos multotiens indigemus castratione quorundam animalium, propter iuuamenta nostra per illud, sicut arietum, hyrcorum, et gattorum, et similium ex animalibus.	And the other reason is that we often need castration of certain animals, for our benefit through it, such as rams, boars, and cats, and similar animals.
Dico ergo, quod Castratio fit secundum duos modos.	Therefore, I say that castration is done according to two methods.
Aut per attritionem.	Or by attrition.
Aut per fissuram, et sectionem.	Or by fissure and section.
In illa autem quae fit per attritionem, uia operationis est: quod nos faciamus sedere animal in aqua calida, donec mollificentur testiculi eius, et leniantur, et pendeant: deinde attere eos manu tua, donec resoluantur et non appareant sub tactu.	In that which is done by attrition, the method of operation is: that we should place the animal in warm water, until its testicles soften and loosen and hang; then rub them with your hand, until they dissolve and no longer appear under touch.
In castratione autem per fissuram et sectionem, oportet ut teneas animal, et premas cutem testiculorum eius cum manu sinistra.	In castration by fissure and section, it is necessary to hold the animal and press the skin of its testicles with your left hand.
Deinde liga suspensorium, et seca super omne ouum sectione una, donec quando procedunt duo oua: tunc incide ea postquam excoriaueris utrumque, et non dimittas super ea ex sifaket aliquid praeter sifac subtile, quod est super uasa.	Then tie the suspensory ligament, and cut above each testicle with a single incision, until two testicles protrude; then cut them after you have scraped each, and do not leave on them any sifaket other than the thin sifak that is over the vessels.
Et iste modus castrationis est melior eo qui fit per attritonem: quoniam attritio fortasse relinquit aliquid ex testiculis, quare desiderat animal coitum.	And this method of castration is better than that which is done by attrition, because attrition perhaps leaves some of the testicles, wherefore the animal desires intercourse.
Deinde cura uulnus, donec sanetur.	Then treat the wound until it is healed.
¶ De cura Hermafroditae duorum modorum.	Concerning the treatment of a hermaphrodite, there are two methods.
Caput LXX.	Chapter 70.
Hermafrodita ex uiris est secundum duos modos.	A hermaphrodite is from males in two ways.
Vnus eorum est, quia apparet in eo quod sequitur spacium, aut in cute testiculorum, in eo quod est inter duos testiculos, figura quasi uulua mulieris, in qua sunt pili: et quandoque currit urina ex eo quod est in cute testiculorum.	One of them is that, appearing in the space that follows, or in the skin of the testicles, in the area between the two testicles, there is a figure like a woman's vulva, with hair in it; and sometimes urine runs from that which is in the skin of the testicles.
In mulieribus autem est species una, et est uulua mulieris super pectinem sicut testiculi uiri parui omnino, eminentes ad exteriora: quorum unus est sicut priapus uiri, et duo sicut duo testiculi.	In females, however, there is one type, and it is a woman's vulva on the pubic bone, like very small male testicles protruding outwards; one of which is like a man's penis, and two like two testicles.
Et curatio trium specierum, duarum ex uiris, et speciei unius ex mulieribus, est: quia oportet ut incidas carnes additas, donec effugiat impressio earum.	And the treatment of three types, two from males, and one type from females, is: because it is necessary to cut away the added flesh, until its impression disappears.
Deinde cura eas curatione reliquorum uulnerum.	Then treat them with the treatment of the other wounds.
In specie autem secunda uirorum, ex qua egreditur urina, quae est in cute testiculorum, non est operatio, neque est eius curatio omnino.	In the second type of males, from which urine comes forth, which is in the skin of the testicles, there is no operation, nor is there any treatment at all.
¶ De incisione Tentiginis, et carnis eminentis in uuluis mulierum.	Concerning the incision of the labia, and protruding flesh in women's vulvas.
Caput LXXI.	Chapter LXXI.
Tentigo fortasse additur super rem naturalem, donec foedatur et turpis fit aspectus eius: et quandoque magnificatur in quibusdam mulieribus adeo, donec expanditur sicut in uiris, et peruenit usque ad coitum.	The labia may perhaps be added to the natural state, until its appearance becomes ugly and foul: and sometimes in some women it is greatly enlarged, until it expands like in men, and reaches the point of intercourse.
Oportet ergo ut teneas superfluitatem Tentiginis manu, aut cum uncino, et incidas: et non ultimes in incisione, praecipue in profundo radicis: ut non accidat fluxus sanguinis.	Therefore, you must grasp the excess of the labia with your hand, or with a hook, and make an incision: and do not make the incision too deep, particularly into the root: so that a flow of blood does not occur.
Deinde cura ipsam curatione uulnerum, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with the treatment of wounds, until it is healed.
Caro autem orta, est caro quae nascitur in orificio matricis, donec impleat ipsum: et fortasse egreditur ad exteriora secundum similitudinem caudae: et propter illud quidam primi nominant aegritudinem caudatam.	However, the flesh that arises is flesh that is born in the orifice of the womb, until it fills it: and perhaps it emerges to the exterior, resembling a tail: and on account of this some first name the ailment a tailed disease.
Oportet ergo ut incidamus eam sicut incidimus Tentiginem, et curemus eam, donec sanetur.	Therefore, it is necessary to incise it as we incise the labia, and treat it until it is healed.
¶ De cura Alratica, quae est uulua mulieris non perforata.	Concerning the treatment of Alratica, which is the unperforated vulva of a woman.
Caput LXXII.	Chapter LXXII.
Alratica est, ut sit uulua mulieris non perforata, aut sit foramen paruum.	Alratica is, as it were, the unperforated vulva of a woman, or one with a small opening.
Et est aut naturalis, aut accidentalis.	And it is either natural or accidental.
Accidentalis est ex aegritudine quae praecessit: et ipsa quidem fit aut ex carne nata addita, aut sifach subtili, aut spisso: et fit aut in profundo matricis, aut in lateribus eius, aut in superiore ipsius, aut inferiori eius: et prohibet a coitu et impregnatione, et partu, et fortasse prohibet menstrua.	Accidental is it from illness that has preceded: and indeed it is made either from added flesh grown, or by a subtle, or thick sifach: and it is made either in the deep of the womb, or on its sides, or above it, or below it: and it prevents intercourse and impregnation, and childbirth, and perhaps it prevents menstruation.
Et cognitio illius fit per aspectum obstetricis, si opilatio est apparens propinqua.	And its knowledge is made by the obstetrician's observation, if there is an apparent nearby obstruction.
Si autem non est apparens, tunc quaere eam digitis tuis, aut cum radio.	If however it is not apparent, then seek it with your fingers, or with a rod.
Si autem opilatio est ex sifach subtili, et est propinqua duobus labiis: tunc propera, et disrumpe ipsam.	If however the obstruction is from a subtle sifach, and is near the two lips: then hurry, and break it apart.
Et est, ut ponas super duo labia puluillos.	And it is, that you place cushions on the two lips.
Deinde pone indices tuos duarum manuum simul, et mulier sit super dorsum suum expansis cruribus suis.	Then place your index fingers of both hands together, and let the woman be on her back with her legs outstretched.
Deinde extende duo labia cum fortitudine, donec disrumpatur sifach subtile, et aperiatur opilatio.	Then extend the two lips with strength, until the subtle sifach is broken, and the obstruction is opened.
Deinde accipe lanam, et imbibe eam in oleo, et pone ipsam super locum: et coeat mulier omni die, ut non consolidetur locus uice alia.	Then take wool, and soak it in oil, and place it on the place: and let the woman apply it every day, so that the place is not solidified again.
Si autem sifach est grossum, spissum: tunc oportet ut seces ipsum cum spatumili lato simili folio myrti.	If however the sifach is thick, dense: then it is necessary that you cut it with a spatula broad similar to a myrtle leaf.
Si autem opilatio est ex carne nata, tunc suspende eam cum uncinis, et incide eam: et sint tecum medicinae quae fluxum sedant sanguinis absque mordicatione, sicut acacia, et sanguis draconis, et thus aggregatum cum albugine oui.	If however the obstruction is born from flesh, then suspend it with hooks, and cut it: and let there be with you medicines that stop the flow of blood without causing harm, such as acacia, and dragon's blood, and frankincense mixed with the white of an egg.
Deinde administra cannulam ex plumbo amplam, ut non consolidetur uulnus uelociter, teneat eam diebus aliquot: et administra licinium ex lino sicco, deinde curetur reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then administer a wide lead cannula so that the wound does not heal quickly, hold it for a few days: and administer a bandage of dry linen, then treat with the remaining treatment, until it is healed.
Et quandoque nasciur in matrice natiuitas carnium aliarum: oportet ergo ut incidantur secundum hunc modum: dum non est apostema cancerosum apostemati enim canceroso quod est in matrice, non fiat contrarietas cum ferro omnino.	And sometimes a birth of other flesh occurs in the womb: it is therefore necessary that they be cut in this way: as long as it is not a cancerous abscess; for a cancerous abscess that is in the womb, do not use any opposition with iron at all.
¶ De cura hemorroidarum, Athehelil, et Bothor rubeae in uuluis mulierum.	Concerning the treatment of hemorrhoids, Athehelil, and Bothor, a red inflammation in women's vulvas.
Caput LXXIII.	Chapter LXXIII.
Hemorroides quidem sunt apertio orificiorum uenarum, donec currit ex eis sanguis multus assidue.	Hemorrhoids indeed are an opening of the veins' orifices, until much blood flows from them constantly.
Cum ergo antiquantur hemorroides, fiunt thelil: et iam dixi in diuisione species earum, et signa ipsarum: et dicam hic quae ex eis recipiunt curationem, et quae non.	Therefore, when hemorrhoids become chronic, they become thelil: and I have already stated in the division of their kinds and their signs: and I shall say here which of them receive a cure, and which do not.
Dico ergo, quod hemorroides quae sunt in orificio matricis, et non apparent sensui: tunc non est ei curatio cum ferro.	I say therefore, that hemorrhoids which are in the orifice of the womb, and do not appear to the senses, then there is no cure with iron for them.
Quae autem ex eis sunt in orificio matricis super quas cadit sensus, sunt quae curantur.	However, those of them that are in the orifice of the womb, over which the senses fall, are those that are cured.
Oportet ergo ut intromittas mulierem in domum frigidam.	Therefore, it is necessary that you introduce the woman into a cool house.
Deinde extende athehelil cum forficibus, aut cum panno aspero, et incide eas ex radicibus suis.	Then, extend the thelil with scissors, or with a rough cloth, and cut them from their roots.
Deinde pulueriza super eas apud fluxum sanguinis ex uno puluerum incisiuorum absque mordificatione: sicut acacia, et sanguis draconis, et thus, et similia eis.	Then, sprinkle over them, at the flow of blood, from one of the powdered incisions without mordication, such as acacia, and dragon's blood, and frankincense, and similar things to them.
Deinde impellat pedes eius ad parietem hora una.	Then let him propel her feet against the wall for one hour.
Postea depone eam in aquam frigidam.	Then place her in cold water.
Quod si perseuerat fluxus sanguinis: tunc fac eam sedere in decoctione sumach, et corticum granatorum, et gallarum, et similium.	If the flow of blood persists, then make her sit in a decoction of sumach, and the bark of pomegranates, and gallnuts, and similar things.
Deinde accipe farinam hordei, et confice eam cum melle et aceto, et fac emplastrum cum eo super dorsum eius.	Then take barley flour and mix it with honey and vinegar, and make a plaster with it on her back.
Si ergo abscinditur sanguis cum eo, bonum est: et si non, fac adhaerere dorso uentosas, et mammillis, absque scarificatione.	If, therefore, the blood is cut off with it, it is good; and if not, make cupping adhere to the back and armpits, without incision.
Deinde accipe lanam, et submerge in succo tarathit, aut succo arnoglossae, aut succo ramorum alaulat, id est, aglanter, uino pontico, et fac adhaerere loeo.	Then take wool and immerse it in the juice of tarathit, or the juice of arnoglossa, or the juice of alaulat branches, that is, aglanter, or Pontic wine, and make it adhere to the place.
Cum ergo quiescit apostema, tunc cura locum cum unguentis, donec sanetur.	When the abscess therefore subsides, then treat the place with ointments until it is healed.
Albarth uero rubeum est simile capitibus alhaasse, et est asperi aspectus.	Albarth, however, is red, similar to the heads of alhaasse, and is of harsh appearance.
Oportet ergo ut incidas quod apparet ex eo, secundum quod dixi in thelil aequaliter: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Therefore, it is necessary to cut away what appears from it, according to what I have said about the thelil equally: and treat it until it is healed.
¶ De perforatione Exiturae quae accidit in matrice.	Concerning the perforation of the outlet that occurs in the womb.
Caput LXXIIII.	Chapter LXXIV.
Accidunt in matrice species multae apostematum, sicut cancer, et apostema lapideum, et ulcera, et adubelati, et alekilati, id est, herpes, aestiomemus, et fistulae, et hemorroides, et ragadiae, et thelil, et apostema calidum.	Many kinds of abscesses occur in the womb, such as cancer, and stony abscess, and ulcers, and adubelati, and alekilati, that is, herpes, boils, and fistulas, and hemorrhoids, and cracks, and thelil, and a hot abscess.
Et ego quidem iam dixi omnes has aegritudines et species earum, et signa ipsarum, et earum curationes in diuisione: necesse est ut dicam in hoc tractatu apostema calidum quod accidit in matrice, quando est ex apostematibus quae colligunt saniem, et uis scire qualiter fit eius apertio cum ferro.	And I have indeed already described all these diseases and their types, and their signs, and their cures in the divisions: it is necessary that I say in this treatise about the hot abscess that occurs in the womb, when it is from the abscesses which collect pus, and you wish to know how its opening is made with an iron.
Oportet ergo ut consideres.	Therefore, it is necessary to consider.
Tunc si dolor apostematis in incaeptione sua est acutus cum percussione sua, et flamma, et febre: et uides ipsum rubere: si cadit super ipsum sensus, tunc non properes cum perforatione eius: et cura ipsum cum eo eo quod iuuat super maturationem, donec quando quiescat acuitas accidentium.	Then if the pain of the abscess in its beginning is sharp with its striking, and burning, and fever: and you see it red: if the touch falls upon it, then do not rush with its perforation: and treat it with that which is helpful for maturation, until when the sharpness of the afflictions subsides.
Tunc oportet ut facias sedere mulierem super sedem quae labeat duo sedilia, et reclinetur, uel appodietur super dorsum suum, et aggreget pedes suos ad partem inferiorem uentris: et sint coxae eius expansae, et ponat brachia sua sub genibus suis, et liget utraque ligamento conueniente ad illud.	Then it is necessary that you have the woman sit on a seat that inclines with two cushions, or lean on her back, and draw her feet to the lower part of her abdomen: and let her thighs be spread, and let her place her arms under her knees, and bind each with a suitable bandage to it.
Deinde sedeat obstetrix a latere dextro, et administra instrumentum quo aperitur orificium matricis.	Then let the midwife sit on the right side, and administer the instrument with which the opening of the womb is opened.
Cuius forma uenit in eis quae sunt post.	Whose form comes in those that are after.
Et oportet quando uis administrare hoc instrumentum, ut figas cum Radio profundum matricis mulieris: ut non sit illud quod ingreditur ex instrumento plus, quam profundum matricis, et laedat infirmam.	And it is necessary when you wish to administer this instrument, that you fix it with the rod deep within the woman's womb, so that what enters from the instrument be no more than the depth of the womb, and injure the infant.
Si autem fuerit instrumentum magis quam profundum, tunc oportet ut ponas puluillos super tecturam profundi matricis: ut prohibeatur introitus instrumenti totius in profundum matricis: et oportet ut ponat uertiginem, quae currit in instrumento, ex latere superiore: et ut teneat instrumentum, et ut reuoluat minister uertiginem, donec aperiatur profundum matricis.	However, if the instrument is more than the depth, then it is necessary that you place cushions over the lining of the womb's depth, so that the full entry of the instrument into the womb's depth is prevented; and it is necessary that it place the wheel, which runs on the instrument, from the upper side; and so that the attendant holds the instrument and turns the wheel until the womb's depth is opened.
Cum ergo apparet Exitura, et tangitur manu, et est lenis et mollis: tunc oportet ut seces ipsam apud caput suum cum spatumili lato.	When therefore the exit appears, and is touched by the hand, and is soft and supple, then it is necessary to separate it at its head with a wide spatula.
Cum ergo euacuatur sanies, tunc oportet ut ponas in uulnus licinium submersum in oleo rosaceo: aut oleo uiridi, in quo sit quaedam stipticitas: et pone licinium, et extrahe sectionem in profundo matricis.	When therefore the pus is evacuated, then it is necessary to place on the wound a lint soaked in rose oil, or green oil, in which there is some astringency; and place the lint, and extract the section within the womb's depth.
Et pone exterius super matricem, et super pectinem lanam mundam submersam in aqua, in qua bullitae sunt maluae.	And place externally on the womb, and on the pubic area, clean wool soaked in water in which mulberries have been boiled.
Deinde curetur post duos dies cum unguento quod conuenit ad illud, donec sanetur.	Then treat it after two days with an ointment suitable for it, until it is healed.
Et quandoque abluitur matrix et uulnus, ita quod clisterizatur cum aqua et melle: deinde cum aqua in qua bullita est radix lilii, aut aristolochia longa: deinde redeat ad unguentum.	And sometimes the womb and wound are washed, so that it is cleansed with water and honey; then with water in which the root of lily or long aristolochia has been boiled; then return to the ointment.
Quod si uulnus absconditum fuerit interius in matrice, tunc oportet ut prohibearis ex curatione eius cum ferro, imo cura ipsum cum eo quod diximus in diuisione.	If the wound is hidden inside the womb, then it is necessary that you refrain from treating it with iron, rather treat it with what we have said in the division.
¶ Doctrinae Obstetricum, qualiter medicentur embriones uiui, secundum figuram non naturalem egressi.	Instructions for Midwives, how to treat living embryos which have emerged in a non-natural form.
Caput Lxxu.	Chapter 70.
Necesse est Obstetrici, ut cognoscat in primis figuram partus naturalis.	It is necessary for the midwife to know first the form of a natural birth.
Ex signis ergo eius est, quod quando uides mulierem comprimi ad inferiora, et desiderat odorare aerem, et alleuiatur super eam quod super ipsam est de partu, et festinat exitus embrionis: tunc scias quod iste partus est secundum figuram naturalem, et est exitus eius super caput suum, et secundina cum eo: aut suspensa, uel pendens ex umbilico.	Therefore, among its signs is this: when you see a woman pressing downwards, and she desires to smell the air, and is relieved of that which is upon her regarding birth, and the exit of the embryo is hastened: then know that this birth is according to the natural form, and its exit is over her head, and the afterbirth with it: either suspended, or hanging from the navel.
Cum ergo uides haec signa, tunc oportet ut comprimatur uenter eius, ut descendat embrio uelociter.	Therefore, when you see these signs, then it is necessary that her belly be pressed, so that the embryo descends quickly.
Nam quando descendit super caput suum, descendit secundina cum eo, et mundatur ex illis superfluitatibus mundificatione bona.	For when it descends over her head, the afterbirth descends with it, and it is cleansed from those superfluities by good cleansing.
Qui autem est praeter hunc partum, est innaturalis, illaudabilis.	However, that which is beyond this birth is unnatural, blameworthy.
Quoniam quandoque egreditur foetus super pedes suos, et egreditur corpus eius ante caput ipsius, et pedes eius, et manus eius una, aut pes eius unus: aut egreditur caput eius et manus eius: aut egreditur uentrinus: et fortasse conuertitur super collum suum, et similia ex figuris illaudabilibus.	For sometimes the fetus emerges over its feet, and its body emerges before its head, and its feet and hands together, or one of its feet: or its head and one of its hands emerges: or the abdomen emerges: and perhaps it turns on its neck, and similar figures from blameworthy forms.
Necesse est ergo Obstetrici, ut sit prudens, subtilis in istis rebus omnibus, et caueat sibi ab errore et decaeptione: et ego sum ostendens omnem figuram ex eis, et qualiter est ingenium in ea, et significetur per illud, et stetur super ipsum.	Therefore, it is necessary for the midwife to be prudent, subtle in all these matters, and to guard herself from error and deception; and I am showing every form among them, and how the disposition is in it, and what is signified by it, and how to act upon it.
Quando egreditur foetus super caput suum egressione sua naturali, et uehemens fit illud super mulierem, et difficilis fit ei partus, et uides uirtutem eius iam debilitatam: tunc fac eam sedere super sedem, aut mulieres teneant eam: et uapora uuluam eius cum foenugraeco decocto, et cum oleis humidis.	When the fetus emerges over its head in its natural expulsion, and it is difficult for the woman, and the labor is difficult for her, and you see her strength already weakened: then have her sit on a seat, or have women hold her; and bathe her vulva with decocted fenugreek and with moist oils.
Deinde intromittat Obstetrix inter digitos suos Spatumile paruum, et findat cum eo secundinam, et secet eam ungue suo, donec currat quod est in ea ex humiditate: et preme uentrem mulieris, donec descendat foetus.	Then let the midwife insert a small spatula between her fingers, and split the afterbirth with it, and cut it with her fingernail until that which is in it from moisture runs out; and press the woman's abdomen until the fetus descends.
Si autem non descendit, tunc oportet ut clisterizetur mulier ex mucillagine foenugraeci, cum oleo sisamino.	If it does not descend, then it is necessary for the woman to be administered an enema of fenugreek mucilage with sesame oil.
Deinde praecipe ei post clistere, ut comprimatur: et fac eam sternutare cum condisi, et tene os eius et nasum ipsius hora una.	Then command her, after the enema, to be compressed; and make her sneeze with a spice, and hold her mouth and nose for one hour.
Foetus enim egredietur statim.	For the fetus will emerge immediately.
Quod si egrediantur duae manus foetus in primis, iunc oportet ut reducas eas cum facilitate paulatim.	If two hands of the fetus emerge first, you should gently and gradually draw them back.
Si autem non obedit in introitu, tunc pone mulierem super sedem, et eleua pedes eius sursum: deinde concute sedem super terram: et mulier teneatur, ut non cadat apud concussionem.	If, however, it does not yield in entering, then place the woman on a seat, and raise her feet upward; then shake the seat on the ground; and let the woman be held so that she does not fall during the shaking.
Si ergo non egrediuntur manus, et moritur foetus: tunc incide eas, et extrahe residuum foetus: et liga manum eius cum panno, et extrahe ipsum cum aequalitate: nam ipse egredietur.	If, therefore, the hands do not emerge, and the fetus dies, then cut them, and extract the remaining fetus; and tie its hand with cloth, and extract it with equanimity; for it will emerge.
¶ Exitus embrionis super pedes suo.	The exit of the embryo is above its feet.
Quando egreditur foetus super pedes suos, tunc oportet ut impellat eos sursum: deinde conuertat foetum paulatim: postea aequet ipsum.	When the fetus emerges above its feet, then it is necessary to push them upward; then turn the fetus gradually; afterward, straighten it.
Deinde accipiat unum pedum eius, et extendat eum paulatim.	Then take one of its feet and extend it gradually.
Cum ergo egrediuntur usque ad coxas, tunc praecipe ei, ut comprimatur, et fac eam sternutare cum condisi: egredietur enim, si Deus uoluerit.	When, therefore, they emerge up to the hips, then command him to compress it, and make it sneeze with the application of medicine; for it will emerge, if God wills.
Et si non egreditur cum eo quod narrauimus, tunc reduc foetum paulatim, donec ponas eum secundum figuram naturalem.	And if it does not emerge with what we have described, then return the fetus gradually until you place it in its natural position.
Nam ipse egredietur tunc egressu facili.	For it will then emerge with easy exit.
Quod si prohibeatur cum eo toto quod narrauimus: tunc accipe ex mucillagine alteae, et oleo sisamino, et gummi soluto: et percute totum in mortario percussione bona: deinde line cum eo uuluam mulieris, et inferius uentris eius.	If it is prevented by all that we have described, then take from marshmallow mucilage, and sesame oil, and dissolved gum; and pound the whole in a mortar with a good pounding; then line with it the woman's vulva and the lower part of her abdomen.
Deinde fac eam sedere in aqua tepida, donec consequatur hypocundria.	Then have her sit in warm water until she reaches the hypochondria.
Cum ergo uides quod iam calefacta sunt inferiora eius, tunc fac ei sief de myrrha: et suppone ipsum.	When you therefore see that her lower parts are now warmed, then make for her a poultice of myrrh and apply it.
Quando ergo tenet sief hora una, tunc fac eam sedere super sedem.	When therefore the poultice has held for one hour, then have her sit on a seat.
Deinde fac eam sternutare: et stringe ipsius os et nasum: et preme inferiorem partem uentris compressione facili.	Then have her sneeze; and bind her mouth and nose; and press the lower part of her abdomen with gentle pressure.
Nam foeus egredietur statim.	For the pus will come out immediately.
¶ Exitus foetus super genua et manus.	The exit of the fetus is upon the knees and hands.
Quando egreditur secundum hanc formam, tunc ingeniet in intromittendo manus suas paulatim.	When it emerges in this manner, then gently insert her hands.
Deinde resupinetur mulier super collum suum, et pendeant pedes eius ad inferiora: et ipsa sit iacens super lectum, et complicet manus suas.	Then the woman will be placed on her back, and her feet will hang down; and she will lie on the bed, and fold her hands.
Deinde preme supra uentrem eius paulatim.	Then press gently on her abdomen.
Deinde extrahe quod est sub pedibus eius ex puluinaribus, donec sit praeparata in inferiori parte.	Then pull out what is under her feet from the cushions until it is prepared in the lower part.
Quod si non egreditur foetus, tunc accipe pedes eius, et moue eos motu uehementi.	If the fetus does not emerge, then take her feet and move them with a vigorous motion.
Deinde preme quod est supra hypocundria paulatim, donec ascendat foetus ad superiora.	Then press gently on what is above the hypochondria until the fetus rises upwards.
Deinde intromittat manus suas, et aequet foetum paulatim: et praecipe mulieri, ut comprimatur, donec egrediatur foetus.	Then let her insert her hands, and gently straighten the fetus; and instruct the woman to compress herself until the fetus emerges.
¶ Exitus foetus latitudinaliter pendens ex manibus.	The exit of the fetus hangs lengthwise from the hands.
Ingenietur in reductione manus eius.	Let his hand be skillfully applied to the reduction.
Si autem non potest reducere eam, tunc eleua mulierem, et fac eam ambulare.	If however he cannot reduce it, then raise the woman and make her walk.
Si uero ambulare non potest, tunc fac eam iacere super lectum: et concute crura eius concussione uehementi.	If indeed she cannot walk, then make her lie on a bed, and shake her legs with a violent shaking.
Deinde administra linimentum quod praeparasti ex mucillaginibus.	Then administer the liniment which you have prepared from mucilages.
Quod si accipit eam partus, tunc fac eam sedere super sedem.	If she receives it through childbirth, then make her sit upon a seat.
Deinde stude in reductione manus, et aequa foetum secundum figuram naturalem: et fac sternutare mulierem, et praecipe ei, ut comprimat se, donec egrediatur.	Then strive in the reduction of the hand, and adjust the foetus according to its natural form; and make the woman sneeze, and order her to compress herself until it emerges.
¶ Exitus foetus super collum suum, expansis manibus, et est facies eius ad dorsum matris suae.	The exit of the foetus is over her neck, with outstretched hands, and its face is toward the back of its mother.
Oportet ut teneat Obstetrix manum foetus, deinde reuoluat eum paulatim, et aequet eum cum facilitate.	The midwife should hold the foetus's hand, then slowly turn it over, and adjust it with ease.
Cum ergo aequatur, tunc pone super uuluam eius quod narrauimus ex oleo et mucillaginibus.	When it is adjusted, then place upon its vulva what we have narrated of oil and mucilaginous substances.
Deinde praecipe ei, ut moueatur paulatim.	Then order her to move slowly.
Cum ergo feceris illud, tunc fac eam sedere super sedem, et praecipe ei ut inclinetur ad latus dextrum.	When you have done that, then make her sit upon a seat, and order her to lean to her right side.
Deinde praecipe ei, ut comprimatur: et fac eam sternutare cum condisi.	Then order her to press; and make her sneeze with a seasoning.
¶ Exitus foetus praeparati super latus.	The exit of the prepared fetus on the side.
Quando descendit ad orificium matricis secundum hunc modum cum secundina, tunc scinde secundinam cum ungue tuo, donec euacuetur ex humiditate.	When it descends to the orifice of the womb in this manner with the afterbirth, then cut the afterbirth with your fingernail until it is evacuated from the moisture.
Si ergo suspenditur super faciem foetus, et collum eius, tunc incide eam ex umbilico: ut non retineatur, et moriatur.	If therefore it hangs over the face of the fetus, and its neck, then cut it from the navel: so that it is not retained, and dies.
Deinde impelle foetum ad interiora, donec ponas eam secundum quod oportet: et praecipe mulieri, ut comprimat se aliquotiens: ipse enim egredietur exitu leui.	Then push the fetus inward, until you place it as it ought to be; and order the woman to compress herself several times; for it will exit by an easy exit.
¶ Exitus Geminorum, aut foetuum multorum.	The exit of twins, or many fetuses.
Scias, quod Gemini multotiens nascuntur: et quandoque nascuntur tres, et quatuor.	Know that twins are often born, and sometimes three and four are born.
Verumtamen illud extraneum est, et raro contingit.	However, that is unusual, and rarely occurs.
Quinque uero est res extra naturam, et non uiuunt penitus: et continet eos, quamuis multiplicentur, secundina una: et separantur per sifach, distinguens inter eos ligatum in umbilico cuiusque eorum.	Five, however, is unnatural, and they do not entirely survive; and although they multiply, they are contained by one afterbirth; and they are separated by a sort of membrane, distinguishing them, bound to the navel of each of them.
Et quandoque egrediuntur sicut egreditur foetus unus exitu naturali, facili: et egrediuntur exitu illaudabili, sicut narrauimus.	And sometimes they emerge just as a single fetus emerges through a natural, easy exit, and they emerge in a way that is not to be praised, as we have narrated.
Quod si difficiles fuerint quidam eorum apud partum, et perueniunt ad illud quod diximus ex figuris innaturalibus, tunc cura eos sicut narrauimus: et sit ob stetrix subtilis, et faciat quod facit cum facilitate et tarditate, et ingenietur secundum omnem figuram cum eo quod praeparatur ei ex ingenio ducente ad salutem.	If some of them are difficult at birth, and reach the unnatural figures we mentioned, then treat them as we have described. Let the midwife be skillful, and do what she does with ease and caution, and devise a way that corresponds to every shape, with what is prepared for her by a skilled guide towards salvation.
¶ Rememoratio eius quod formatur in matrice ex embrionibus, et abortiuntur.	A reminder of that which is formed in the womb from embryos, and miscarriages.
Quandoque formatur in matrice unus, et duo, et tres, et quatuor, et quinque, et sex, et septem, et plures decem: et iam uerificatum est apud me, quod mulier abortiendo emisit septem, et alia quindecim, omnes formatos.	Sometimes one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, and more than ten are formed in the womb.  And it has been verified by me that a woman expelled seven and another fifteen, all formed, through miscarriage.
Quod factum est mensuratione gloriosi sapientis.	That which occurred through the measurement of the glorious sage.
Hoc ergo totum oportet ut sit in scientia Obstetricis.	Therefore, all of this must be within the knowledge of the midwife.
Fortasse enim perueniet ad eam simile illius: opponat ergo ei cum illo quod oportet	For perhaps something similar will come to her; therefore, let her oppose it with what is necessary.
¶ De extractione foetus mortui.	Concerning the extraction of a dead fetus.
Caput LXXVI.	Chapter LXXVI.
Quando curas foetum mortuum cum eo quod dixi in diuisione ex medicatione, et non egreditur, et cogeris uti operatione cum manu, tunc oportet ut consideres.	When you treat a dead fetus with what I have said about medicine, and it does not emerge, and you are compelled to use an operation with your hand, then it is necessary to consider.
Si ergo mulier est sanae uirtutis, et non est cum aliquo ex accidentibus, ex quibus timetur super eam perditio: tunc oportet ut resupinetur mulier super lectum, super dorsum suum, et sit caput eius inclinatum inferius, et crura eius eleuata: et ministra teneat eam a duabus partibus, aut ligetur ad lectum, ut non extrahatur corpus eius apud extractionem foetus.	If then the woman is of sound strength, and is not with any of the accidents from which harm is feared for her: then it is necessary that the woman be laid on her back upon the bed, and her head be inclined downwards, and her legs raised; and let the attendant hold her on both sides, or let her be bound to the bed, so that her body is not pulled during the extraction of the fetus.
Deinde humecta os matricis ex oleis humidis cum mucillagine alteae, et foenugraeci, et seminis lini.	Then moisten the mouth of the womb with humid oils with the mucilage of marshmallow, and fenugreek, and linseed.
Deinde inungat Obstetrix manum suam cum istis oleis et mucillaginibus: deinde intromittat eam in matricem cum facilitate.	Then let the midwife anoint her hand with these oils and mucilages; then let her introduce it into the womb with ease.
Deinde quaerat cum ea locum in quo figat uncinos ex foetu, et loca conuenientia ad illud.	Then let her seek with it the place where to fix the hooks from the fetus, and the suitable places for it.
Considera ergo tunc, si foetus est praeparatus ut descendat super caput suum: tunc fige uncinos in oculos eius, aut in collo eius, aut in ore eius, aut in palato ipsius, aut sub barba eius, aut in furcula ipsius, aut in locis propinquis costis, et sub hypocundriis.	Therefore, consider then, if the fetus is prepared to descend on its head: then fix the hooks into its eyes, or its neck, or its mouth, or its palate, or under its chin, or in its fork, or in the nearby ribs, and under the hypochondria.
Si autem descensus est super pedes eius, tunc in pectine, et costis eius mediis.	If, however, the descent is upon its feet, then in its pubic bone and its middle ribs.
Et oportet, ut teneat uncinum cum manu dextra: et ponat curuitatem eius in eo quod est inter digitos sinistrae manus: et intromittat cum manu cum facilitate, et figat uncinum in aliquo illorum locorum quae diximus, donec perueniat ad rem uacuam.	And it is necessary that she hold the hook with her right hand; and place its curve in that which is between the fingers of the left hand; and introduce it with the hand with ease, and fix the hook in any of those places which we have said, until it reaches the empty space.
Deinde figat in oppositione eius uncinum alium, aut tertium, si indiges: ut sit contractio aequalis, et non declinet ad partem.	Then let her fix another hook, or a third, if necessary, in opposition to it, so that there is an equal contraction and it does not deviate to one side.
Deinde extendatur extensione aequali, et non sit extensio secundum rectitudinem tantum, imo moueatur ad omnem partem, ut alleuietur exitus eius: sicut fit cum dente apud eradicationem eius.	Then let it be extended with equal extension, and let the extension not only be straight, but rather move in every direction, so that its exit is eased; as is done with a tooth during its extraction.
Et oportet in eo quod est inter illud, ut mollificetur extensio.	And it is necessary in that which is between them, that the extension be softened.
Quod si retineatur ex eo pars, tunc oportet ut inungat Obstetrix quosdam digitos cum oleo, et intromittat eos ex parte, ut reuoluat cum eis quod retinetur.	If a part is retained from it, then the midwife ought to anoint some fingers with oil, and introduce them from the side, so that she may revolve with them that which is retained.
Si ergo egreditur pars foetus, tunc permutentur uncini ad locum alium qui sit altior: fac hoc donec egrediatur foetus totus.	If therefore a part of the fetus emerges, then let the hooks be changed to a higher place; do this until the entire fetus emerges.
Si ergo egreditur manus ante alia, et non est possibile reducere eam, propter coartationem eius: tunc oportet, ut inuoluatur super eam pannus.	If, therefore, a hand emerges before other parts, and it is not possible to return it, due to its constriction, then it is necessary that a cloth be wrapped around it.
Deinde extrahe eam donec quando egreditur tota, incide eam aut in iunctura plantae, aut in cubito: et ita oportet ut facias in manu altera, et in duobus pedibus.	Then pull it out until, when the entire hand emerges, cut it either at the ankle joint, or at the elbow: and thus it is necessary that you should do in the other hand, and in the two feet.
Si autem caput foetus est magnum, aut accidit ei coartatio in exitu, aut est in capite eius aqua aggregata: tunc oportet ut intromittat inter digitos Spatumile spinosum, et findat cum eo caput, et extrahat aquam: aut disrumpat ipsum cum instrumento quod nominatur Almisdac: cuius forma uenit cum formis reliquorum instrumentorum in capitulo quod est post hoc.	If, however, the fetus's head is large, or constriction occurs in its exit, or water is collected in its head, then it is necessary that the midwife insert prickly Spatumile between the fingers, and split the head with it, and remove the water; or break it with the instrument called Almisdac, whose form comes with the forms of the other instruments in the chapter which is after this.
Similiter faciat si foetus est magni capitis natura, tunc oportet ut seces algengematu: aut extrahas ipsum cum misdach, sicut diximus.	Similarly, let him do this if the fetus is of a large head by nature, then it is necessary that he cut it with an algengematu or remove it with a misdach, as we said.
Deinde attrahas ossa cum forcipibus.	Then pull the bones with forceps.
Quod si egrediatur caput, et coartetur apud furculam: tunc findatur, donec effundatur humiditas quae est in pectore.	If the head emerges and is constricted at the fork, then it should be split until the moisture that is in the chest is discharged.
Si autem non complicatur, neque obedit ad exitum: tunc incide caput frustatim, secundum quod possibile est tibi.	If, however, it does not become entangled, nor yields to exit, then cut the head into fragments, as far as possible for you.
Quod si inferius uentris est apostematum, aut est in eo hydropisis: tunc oportet ut perfores ipsum, donec currat humiditas ex eo.	If the lower part of the belly is ulcerated or contains dropsy, then it is necessary that you pierce it, until moisture flows from it.
Si uero foetus est super pedes suos, tunc attractio eius est facilis, et directio eius ad os matricis est leuis.	If the fetus is on its feet, then its extraction is easy, and its direction towards the mouth of the womb is gentle.
Si autem coartatur apud uentrem, aut pectus: tunc oportet ut extrahas ipsum cum panno quem inuoluisti super manum tuam: et findat uentrem, aut pectus, donec currat quod est in eis.	If, however, it is constricted at the belly or chest, then it is necessary that you extract it with a cloth which you have wrapped around your hand, and split the belly or chest until that which is within them flows out.
Si autem auferuntur reliqua membra, et redit caput: tunc intromittat Obstetrix manum sinistram.	If the other limbs are removed, and the head returns, then let the midwife insert her left hand.
Si ergo os matricis est apertum, tunc intromittat manum in profundum matricis, et quaerat cum ea caput, et attrahat ipsum cum digitis usque ad os matricis: deinde intromittat in eo uncinum unum, aut uncinos duos, et attrahat ipsum cum eo.	If therefore the mouth of the womb is open, then let her insert her hand deep into the womb, and seek out the head with it, and pull it with her fingers until it reaches the mouth of the womb; then let her insert into it one hook, or two hooks, and pull it with it.
Quod si os matricis coartatur, propter apostema calidum quod accidit ei: tunc non oportet ut laboretur super ipsum, imo oportet tunc administrare effusionem rerum humidarum, pinguium: et administra emplastra: et sedeat in aquis quae mollificant et humectant.	If, however, the mouth of the womb is constricted, due to a hot abscess that occurs in it, then it is not necessary to labor over it, but rather it is necessary then to administer the outflow of moist, greasy things, and to administer plasters; and she should sit in waters that soften and moisten.
Quod si foetus est super latus suum, tunc possibile est ut aequetur: tunc administretur quod diximus in foetu uiuo.	If the fetus is on its side, then it is possible to equalize it; then let that which we said about a living fetus be administered.
Quod si non est possibile illud, tunc incidatur frustatim, et extrahatur.	If this is not possible, then it should be cut into pieces and extracted.
Et oportet ut non dimittas aliquid ex secundina intus omnino.	And it is necessary that you not leave anything of the afterbirth inside at all.
Cum ergo compleueris operationem tuam, tunc administra quod diximus in apostematibus calidis quae accidunt in matricibus.	When, therefore, you have completed your operation, then administer that which we said about hot abscesses that occur in wombs.
Quod si accidat fluxus sanguinis, tunc descendat in aquis stipticis, et administra reliquam curationem.	If a flow of blood occurs, then it should descend into astringent waters, and administer the rest of the treatment.
Et ego quidem iam uidi mulierem, in cuius uentre mortuus erat foetus: deinde impregnata est super ipsum uice alia, postea mortuus est foetus alius etiam.	And indeed I have already seen a woman, in whose womb a dead fetus was: then she became pregnant again over it, afterwards another fetus died as well.
Accidit ergo ei post tempus longum apostema in umbilico suo, et inflatum est, donec apertum est: et coepit emittere pus.	Therefore, a long time later, an abscess occurred in her navel, and it became swollen, until it opened: and it began to emit pus.
Vocatus sum ergo ad curationem eius, et medicatus sum ei tempore longo: et non consolidatum est uulnus.	Therefore, I was called to treat her, and I medicated her for a long time: and the wound was not healed.
Posui ergo super ipsum ex quibusdam emplastris fortis attractionis: et exiuit ex loco os.	Therefore, I placed upon it some plasters of strong attraction: and the bone came out of the place.
Deinde praeterierunt ei dies aliquot, et exiuit os aliud.	Then several days passed, and another bone came out.
Miratus sum ergo inde, cum in uentre non sit os.	Therefore, I was surprised by this, since there is no bone in the belly.
Cogitaui ergo, quia erant ex ossibus foetus mortui.	Therefore, I thought that they were from the bones of a dead fetus.
Inquisiui ergo uulnus, et extraxi ossa multa, muliere existente in melioribus dispositionibus suis: et iam uixit taliter tempore longo, et mittit ex loco pus parum.	Therefore, I investigated the wound, and extracted many bones, the woman being in her best condition: and she lived thus for a long time, and emitted little pus from the place.
Et ego non firmaui hic hoc extraneum, nisi quoniam in eo est scientia, et adiutorium ad illud, quod administrat medicus artifex cum manu ex curatione.	And I have not confirmed this as extraneous, unless because there is knowledge and help in it, for the artificer physician to administer it with a hand from healing.
¶ De formis Instrumentorum necessariorum in extractione foetus.	Concerning the forms of necessary instruments in the extraction of a fetus.
Caput LXXVII.	Chapter LXXVII.
Hic inferius est forma Strictorii, quo aequantur libri, cui aequaliter sunt duae uertigines in duabus extremitatibus duorum lignorum.	Here below is the form of the Strictorium, by which books are made equal, to which are equally two hinges at the two extremities of two pieces of wood.
Verumtamen haec Vertigo oportet ut sit subtilior strictorio: et ut fiat, aut ex ebano, aut ex ligno bussi.	However, this hinge must be finer than the strictorium: and to be made, either of ebony or of boxwood.
Et sit latitudo omnis ligni quasi duo digiti: et margo cuiusque amborum est quasi digitus unus, et longitudo cuiusque eorum est palmus et medietas: et in medio duorum lignorum sunt duo additamenta ex genere eiusdem ligni, quae iam firmata sunt in utrisque, quorum longitudo est medietas palmi et plus parum: et latitudo utriusque est quasi duo digiti, aut plus parum.	And the width of each piece of wood is about two fingers; and the edge of each of the two is about one finger, and the length of each of them is a palm and a half; and in the middle of the two pieces of wood are two additions of the same kind of wood, which are already fastened to both, whose length is half a palm and a little more; and the width of each is about two fingers, or a little more.
Et ista duo additamenta intromittuntur in os matricis, ut aperiatur cum eis quando tu reuoluis duas Vertigines.	And these two additions are inserted into the mouth of the matrix, so that it opens with them when you turn the two hinges.
Forma Vertiginis qua aperitur matrix.	The form of the hinge by which the matrix is opened.
Forma alia ad simile illius, subtilior, et leuior.	Another form, similar to that, finer, and lighter.
Fiat ex ligno ebani, aut bussi, secundum similitudinem forcipum.	Let it be made of ebony wood, or boxwood, according to the likeness of forceps.
Verumtamen in extremitate eius sint duo additamenta, sicut uides hic supra: et longitudo omnis additamenti ex eis est quasi palmus: et latitudo utriusque est, duo digiti.	However, at its extremity let there be two additions, as you see here above: and the length of each of these additions is about a palm: and the breadth of each is two fingers.
Cum ergo uis aperire matricem cum eo, tunc fac sedere mulierem super lectum, pendentibus pedibus eius, aperto quod est inter crura eius.	When therefore you wish to open the womb with it, then make the woman sit on a bed, with her feet hanging down, the part between her thighs open.
Deinde intromitte ista duo additamenta coniuncta in matricem: et tu es tenens extremitatem instrumenti inferius inter coxas eius.	Then introduce these two joined additions into the womb: and you are holding the lower end of the instrument between her thighs.
Deinde aperi manum tuam cum instrumento, sicut facis cum forficibus, aequaliter secundum quantitatem quam uis ex apertione oris matricis, donec faciat Obstetrix quod uult.	Then open your hand with the instrument, as you do with forceps, equally according to the amount of opening of the womb's mouth, until the midwife does what she wants.
Forma Vertiginis alterius quam dixerunt antiqui Forma Impellentis quo impellitur foetus.	Another form of Vertigo, as the ancients called it, the form of the Impeller by which the fetus is propelled.
Forma Almisdac, qua conteritur caput magnum: et assimilatur forcipi, cui sunt dentes in extremitate, sicut uides.	The Almisdac form, with which the large head is crushed: and it is made similar to a pair of forceps, which have teeth at the end, as you see.
Et quandoque fit oblungum, sicut forcipes secundum hanc formam, sicut uides, cui sunt dentes sicut dentes serrae, quo inciditur et conteritur.	And sometimes it is made oblong, like forceps of this form, as you see, which have teeth like saw teeth, with which it is cut and crushed.
Forma Almisdac quo conteritur caput paruum.	The Almisdac form, with which the small head is crushed.
Forma Vncini habentis spinam unam.	The form of a hook with a single spine.
Forma Vncini habentis spinas duas.	The form of a hook with two spines.
Forma forcipis cui sunt dentes serrae, cum quo conteritur caput foetus.	The form of forceps with saw teeth, with which the fetus' head is crushed.
Forma Spatumilis habentis duas extremitates ad abscindendum caput.	The form of a spatula with two ends for severing the head.
Forma duorum Spatumilium etiam latorum.	The form of two spatulas, also broad.
Ista instrumenta omnia exercentur, et quanto plus multiplicantur species eorum, et praeparata sunt apud artificem, est uelocior ad operationem suam, et altior apud homines, propter quantitatem suam.	All these instruments are used, and the more their varieties are multiplied, and prepared by the craftsman, the more swift his operation, and the higher his reputation among men, because of their quantity.
Non ergo despicies ex eis instrumentum, quin sit apud te praeparatum.	Therefore, do not despise any instrument, so that it may be prepared for you.
Inexcusabilis est enim necessitas eorum.	For their necessity is inexcusable.
¶ De extractione Secundinae.	Concerning the extraction of the Secundina.
Caput LXXVIII.	Chapter LXXVIII.
Quando retinetur Secundina apud partum, tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmae, ut retineat anhelitum suum.	When the Secundina is retained at childbirth, then it is necessary that you instruct the woman to hold her breath.
Deinde fac eam sternutare cum condisi: et stringe manum tuam super os eius, et nares ipsius.	Then make her sneeze with condiments; and press your hand upon her mouth and nostrils.
Si ergo egreditur per hoc, bonum est.	If therefore it emerges by this means, it is good.
Si non: tunc accipe ollam, et perfora in coopertorio foramen: et pone in ea herbas aperientes os matricis, sicut calamentum, rutam, et anetum, et camomillam, et sseham, et cassiam ligneam, et centauream: accipe omnes istas herbas, aut quasdam earum, et submerge eas cum aqua, et pone eas super ignem.	If not, then take a pot and pierce a hole in the lid; and place in it herbs that open the mother's mouth, such as calamint, rue, dill, chamomile, sese, cinnamon wood, and centaury; take all these herbs, or some of them, and immerse them in water, and place them on the fire.
Deinde pone embulam arundinis super foramen coopertorii ollae, et extremitatem aliam in os matricis: et teneat eam donec perueniat uapor ad concauitatem matricis.	Then place a reed plug over the hole in the pot's lid, and the other end in the woman's womb; and let her hold it until the vapor reaches the concavity of the womb.
Deinde fac eam sternutare, sicut diximus.	Then make her sneeze, as we have said.
Secundina enim egredietur cum facilitate.	For the afterbirth will emerge with ease.
Si autem remaneat post hanc curationem, et non egrediatur: tunc praecipe Obstetrici, ut submergat manum suam in oleo sisamino, aut mucillagine alteae.	If, however, it remains after this treatment, and does not emerge, then instruct the midwife to immerse her hand in sesame oil, or marsh-mallow mucilage.
Deinde intromittat in uuluam, et quaerat cum ea Secundinam.	Then let her introduce it into the vagina, and search for the afterbirth with it.
Cum ergo inuenerit eam, tunc accipiat eam, et extendat ipsam paulatim.	When therefore she finds it, then let her take it, and gently extend it.
Si autem fuerit annexa in profundo matricis, tunc intromittat manum, secundum quod narrauimus, donec quando inuenerit Secundinam, et extrahat eam paulatim secundum rectitudinem, ut non cadat matrix apud attractionem uehementem: imo oportet, ut permutetur cum facilitate ad latera dextra et sinistra: deinde addatur in quantitatem attractionis.	If, however, it is attached deep within the womb, then let her introduce her hand, as we have described, until, when she finds the afterbirth, she extracts it gently in a straight line, so that the womb does not fall with a violent pull; rather, it must be moved easily to the right and left sides, then the amount of pulling should be increased.
Ipsa enim obedit tunc, et seruatur, et euadit ab adhaerentia.	For then it yields, and is preserved, and escapes from adhesion.
Quod si os matricis est coartatum, sicut nos iam narrauimus: cura eam cum sternutatione, et ex medicatione ollae cum herbis.	If the opening of the womb is constricted, as we have already described: treat it with sneezing and with a decoction of herbs from a pot.
Si autem non egreditur cum omnibus quae narrauimus, tunc caue ne fatigeris super eam in iteratione extractionis.	If, however, it does not emerge with all that we have described, then beware of tiring yourself out repeatedly pulling at it.
Verum oportet, ut quod egreditur ad os matricis ex ea, liges ad coxam mulieris.	But it is necessary that whatever emerges from the womb at the opening be tied to the woman's hip.
Deinde clisteriza eam cum unguento tetrapharmacon.	Then administer an enema with the four-drug ointment.
Ipsum enim putrefaciet eam post dies, et dissoluetur, et egredietur.	For this will cause it to putrefy after days, and it will dissolve and emerge.
Verumtamen quando putrefit, eleuatur ex ea odor malus ad stomachum et caput, et laedit illud infirmam.	However, when it putrefies, a foul odor rises from it to the stomach and head, and harms the weak.
Oportet ergo ut administrentur suffumigationes conuenientes ad illud.	Therefore, suitable fumigations should be administered to it.
Quidam autem antiquorum iam experti sunt suffumigationem nasturtii, et ficuum siccarum.	Some of the ancients have already experienced fumigation with nasturtium and dried figs.
Forma instrumenti quo suffumigatur mulier apud retentionem Secundinae et menstruorum.	Form of the instrument by which a woman is fumigated during retention of the Secundinae and menses.
Fiat ex uitro simile alcama, aut ex zere: et ponatur extremitas ampla super ignem: et suffumigatio sit posita super prunas: teneat eam, donec consumatur illa suffumigatio: et itera aliam.	Let it be made of glass similar to alembic, or of earthenware: and let the wide end be placed over the fire: and let the fumigation be placed over the pruns: let her hold it, until that fumigation is consumed: and again another.
¶ De curatione Ani non perforati.	On the treatment of the unperforated anus.
Caput LXXIX.	Chapter LXXIX.
Nascuntur multi puerorum, et Ani eorum sunt non perforati, quos iam opilauit sifac subtile.	Many children are born with their anuses unperforated, which have already been obstructed by a fine sifac.
Oportet ergo, ut obstetrix perforet illud sifac digito suo: et si non, perforet ipsum cum Spatumili acuto: et caueat lacertum, ne tangat eum.	Therefore, the midwife ought to pierce that sifac with her finger: and if not, she ought to pierce it with a sharp spatula: and let her be careful not to touch it with her arm.
Deinde pone super ipsum lanam infusam in uino et oleo.	Then place on it wool steeped in wine and oil.
Deinde cura ipsum cum ungentis, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with ointments until it is healed.
Si autem times quod opiletur, tunc pone in foramine cannulam de plumbo diebus multis, et auferatur quando puer uult egerere.	If you fear that it will be obstructed, then place a lead cannula in the opening for many days, and it will be removed when the child wishes to pass stool.
Et iam accidit opilatio Ani etiam ex consolidatione uulneris, aut apostematis.	And blockage of the anus also occurs from the consolidation of a wound, or an abscess.
Oportet ergo ut secetur illa consolidatio, deinde curetur cum eo quod diximus ex curatione et plumbo.	Therefore, that consolidation must be cut, then treated with what we said about treatment and lead.
¶ De curatione Fistularum quae accidunt in inferiori parte.	Concerning the treatment of Fistulas that occur in the lower part.
Caput LXXX.	Chapter Eighty.
Fistulae quae accidunt in inferiori, sunt Nodatio, et Grossitudo quae accidunt prope anum deforis: aut in spacio unius partium: et est Fistula una, aut plures.	Fistulas that occur in the lower part are a knotting and a thickening that occur near the anus externally, or in the space of one part; and it is one fistula, or several.
Cum ergo antiquatur illa Nodatio, aperitur, et currit ex ea humiditas aquosa alba, aut pus subtile.	When that knotting becomes old, it opens, and watery white moisture, or thin pus, runs from it.
Et quandoque sunt ex istis Fistulis penetrantes.	And sometimes there are penetrating ones from these fistulas.
Ergo penetrantes cognoscuntur per illud quod egreditur ex egestione, et uentositate, quando utitur infirmus egestione: et fortasse egreditur ex eis uermis.	Therefore, penetrating ones are recognized by what comes out with bowel movements and wind, when the sick person uses bowel movements; and perhaps worms come out of them.
Et sunt ex eis Fistulae quando sunt in spacio penetrantes usque ad uesicam, et usque ad meatum uirgae.	And some of them, when they are penetrating in the space, extend to the bladder and to the urethra.
Et sunt ex eis penetrantes usque ad iuncturam coxae, et usque ad nodum caudae.	And some of them penetrate up to the hip joint and up to the tailbone.
Ex eo autem quo cognoscitur Fistula penetrans usque ad anum, etiam a non penetrante, est, ut intromittas digitum tuum indicem in anum: et intromittas tentam subtilem in Fistulam ex aere, aut ferro: quando non est tortuositas.	By this one can recognize a fistula penetrating to the anus, even from one that does not penetrate, is, that you introduce your index finger into the anus; and introduce a slender thread into the fistula through air, or iron, when there is no twisting.
Quod si in ea est tortuositas, tunc intromitte in eam tentam ex plumbo subtilem, aut pilum ex pilis equarum, donec sentias tentam, aut pilum in digito tuo.	If there is twisting in it, then introduce a thin lead thread into it, or a strand from horsehair, until you feel the thread or hair in your finger.
Quod si non sentis ipsam penitus, neque procedit ex foramine aliquid ex egestione, neque uentositas, neque uermis sicut dixi: tunc scias, quia est non penetrans: propera ergo ad curationem.	If you do not feel it completely, nor does anything exit from the opening in terms of excretion, nor wind, nor a worm as I said: then know that it is not penetrating: therefore hurry to the treatment.
Et quando Fistula est penetrans usque ad uesicam, aut ad meatum urinae: tunc significatio eius est exitus urinae ex ea, et prohibitio eius ab hoc ut consolidetur locus cum medicinis.	And when the fistula penetrates to the bladder, or to the urinary meatus: then its indication is the outflow of urine from it, and prevention of it from this so that the place is consolidated with medicines.
Si uero est penetrans usque ad iuncturam coxae, aut ad os coxae: tunc signum eius est, quod perueniat tenta usque illuc, si non est in ea tortuositas usque ad os: et inuentio doloris in circumitu partis, et quod egreditur pus ex ea semper: et quod non ualeat in ea medicatio, neque consolidatur cum unguento.	However, if it is penetrating to the hip joint, or to the hip bone: then its sign is that the thread reaches there, if there is no twisting in it to the bone; and the finding of pain in the surrounding area, and that pus emerges from it always; and that the treatment is not effective in it, nor is it consolidated with ointment.
Et in istis Fistulis omnibus penetrantibus non est curatio omnino: et curatio earum est labor et uanitas ei, ex stultis medicis, super quem formatur.	And in all these penetrating fistulas there is no cure at all; and their treatment is labour and vanity for him, from foolish physicians, upon whom it is formed.
In illa autem quae non est penetrans, et non antiqua, speratur sanatio cum serro: secundum quod ego narro tibi, et ego iam probaui: et est, ut iaceat infirmus inter manus tuas super dorsum suum: et eleua crura eius usque supra coxas ipsius, et coxae eius sint inclinatae ad uentrem ipsius.	However, in that which is not penetrating, and is not old, healing is hoped for with a saw: according to what I tell you, and I have already proven; and it is that the sick person lies between your hands on their back; and elevate their legs above their hips, and their hips should be inclined toward their stomach.
Deinde intromittetentam plumbi, aut aeris, si est in Fistula tortuositas, donec scias ubi peruenit tenta.	Then introduce a lead or copper thread, if there is twisting in the fistula, until you know where the thread reaches.
Si autem sentit eam infirmus circa anum, tunc oportet ut intromittas digitum tuum indicem in anum.	If, however, the patient feels it near the anus, then you must insert your index finger into the anus.
Si ergo sentis in digito tuo tentam iam penetrasse per seipsam detectam, praeter quod sentias inter digitum tuum, et inter ipsum sifac, aut carnem: tunc ergo scias certe, quia est penetrans: non ergo labores in ea, quoniam non est eius sanatio, sicut diximus.	If, therefore, you feel the probe through itself detected in your finger, beyond what you feel between your finger and the fistula, or flesh, then you know for certain that it is penetrating; therefore you do not work on it, because there is no cure for it, as we said.
Dixerunt tamen, quia sanatur in quibusdam hominibus caro, et ex medicatione qua ei speratur iuuamentum, est, ut ignias cauterium subtile secundum amplitudinem Fistulae, sicut praecessit, et intromittas ipsum ignitum in Fistulam, donec perueniat circa anum.	However, they say that in some men the flesh is healed, and from the medication by which they hope for help, it is that you cauterize a thin cautery according to the width of the fistula, as before, and introduce it, hot, into the fistula, until it reaches the vicinity of the anus.
Deinde itera illud bis, aut ter, donec scias, quia iam adustae sunt omnes illae carnes additae filtratae, quae sunt similes cannulae pennae auis.	Then do this twice or thrice, until you know that all those added, filtered flesh which are similar to the hollow quill of a bird are now burned.
Deinde cura illud cum liciniis inuolutis in butyro, donec egrediantur illae carnes, quae adustae sunt: deinde cura illud cum unguentis generantibus carnem et consolidantibus.	Then treat it with lint wrapped in butter, until those burned flesh parts emerge; then treat it with ointments that generate flesh and consolidate it.
Si ergo sanatur, bonum est.	If, therefore, it is healed, it is good.
Et si non, tunc non sanatur cum alia curatione unquam.	And if not, then it will never be healed with any other treatment.
Et si egreditur tenta, et non peruenerit usque ad digitum tuum, qui est in ano, et est inter ipsum et tentam uelamen spissum ex carne, aut sifac: et uides Fistulam in eo quod sequitur superficiem cutis, tunc seca cutem ab initio Fistulae, et tu uadis secando cum tenta quod est in fistula, donec perueniat secatio ubi peruenit tentae extremitas, et liberatur tenta et cadit.	And if the probe emerges, and does not reach your finger in the anus, and there is a thick layer of flesh between it and the probe, or if such a thing is: and you see a fistula in that which follows the skin's surface, then cut the skin from the beginning of the fistula, and you proceed cutting with the probe that is in the fistula, until the cut reaches where the probe's end reaches, and the probe is released and falls out.
Deinde mundifica illas carnes filtratas, quae assimilantur cannulae pennae auis, ut non remaneat ex eis aliquid.	Then cleanse those filtered flesh parts, which resemble the hollow of a bird's feather, so that nothing remains of them.
Si autem uincit te sanguis, et soluit inter te et inter operationem tuam ut seces illas carnes: tunc melius quod fit, et uelocioris iuuamenti, cauterizare eam cum igne, aut cum medicina acuta.	However, if blood overcomes you, and separates you from your operation as you cut those flesh parts: then it is better and quicker to help, to cauterize it with fire or with a sharp medicine.
Quoniam cauterium cum igne aggregat habitudines bonas, adustionem illarum carnium additarum, et abscisionem sanguinis, et exiccationem humiditatum.	Because cautery with fire aggregates good qualities, burning those added flesh parts, and cutting off the blood, and drying the moistures.
Deinde cura illud cum liciniis inuolutis in butyro, aut caulibus tritis, donec locus emittat pus, et egrediantur illae carnes adustae in pus.	Then treat it with cloths dipped in butter, or crushed herbs, until the place discharges pus, and those burned flesh parts emerge in the pus.
Deinde cura tunc uulnus cum unguentis consolidatiuis, generantibus carnem duram: et sunt medicinae in quibus sunt stipticitas et exiccatio.	Then treat the wound with consolidating ointments, which produce hard flesh: and there are medicines in which there are astringency and drying.
Nam quando restaurantur, tunc iam sanatur: et non times iterationem.	For when it is restored, then it is already healed: and you do not fear a recurrence.
Si autem Fistula iam peruenit usque ad profundum ani, et elongatur a superfluitate corporis: tunc intromitte digitum tuum in anum, et inquire cum eo.	If however the fistula has already reached the depth of the anus, and extends from the superfluity of the body: then insert your finger into the anus, and investigate with it.
Si ergo sentis tentam, et inter te, et inter eam est uelamen ex sifac, aut carne, et est propinqua penetrationi: tunc non est operatio in illo, nisi secundum uiam fiduciae et spei.	If therefore you feel a tightness, and between you and it is a covering of sifted material or flesh, and it is close to penetration: then there is no operation on it, except according to the way of trust and hope.
Quod est, quia administratur in eo unus trium modorum: aut ut cauterizes ipsam, sicut diximus: aut seces eam, donec consequaris concauitatem eius, ut sit possibile tibi intromittere licinia, et curationem ex proximo.	For this is because one of three methods is administered in it: either to cauterize it, as we said; or to dissect it, until you reach its concavity, so that it is possible for you to insert lint, and a cure from close by.
Et non procedas multum cum sectione, ut non incidas lacertum continentem anum, et accidat super infirmum exitus egestionis absque uoluntate.	And do not proceed too much with the incision, lest you strike the ligament containing the anus, and misfortune befall the patient's bowel movements without will.
Deinde cura illud cum eo quod diximus.	Then treat it with what we said.
Fortasse enim sanabitur: aut elonges ipsum uelamen, et mundes ipsum postquam secas ipsum usque prope anum, sicut diximus, aut cum tenta, aut cum instrumento alio acutae extremitatis.	Perhaps it will be healed; or you will draw back the covering, and cleanse it after you have cut it back close to the anus, as we said, either with probes or with another instrument with a sharp end.
Deinde mundifica illas carnes filtratas quae sunt in sectione, usque ubi potes cum perscrutatione.	Then cleanse those filtered flesh which are in the incision, up to where you can with examination.
Deinde conare restaurationem uulneris totius cum sectione, et orificio superiore ubi consolidatur: et remanet Fistula aperta in interiore parte anus, et erit leuius super infirmum.	Then attempt the restoration of the entire wound with the incision, and the upper opening where it consolidates; and a fistula remains open in the inner part of the anus, and it will be easier on the patient.
Et quandoque suitur Fistula secundum hunc modum: et est, quando intromittis tentam in Fistulam: et est in latere ani circa superficiem corporis cum cute et margine ani: tunc accipe tentam perforatae extremitatis, quae est sicut acus aleskef, id est, praeparantium coria, secundum hanc formam.	And sometimes the fistula is sutured in this manner: and it is, when you insert a probe into the fistula; and it is on the side of the anus around the surface of the body with the skin and edge of the anus; then take a probe with a perforated end, which is like a needle of aleskef, that is, of those preparing leather, according to this form.
Et intromitte in eam filum inuolutum ex quinque filis, et circiter ea.	And insert into it a thread wrapped with five threads, and approximately that.
Deinde intromitte tentam cum filo in Fistulam, donec consequatur concauitatem eius.	Then insert the probe with the thread into the fistula until it reaches the concavity of it.
Si ergo est penetrans in margine ani interius prope, tunc extrahe filum ex illo foramine: ita ut intromittas digitum tuum in anum, et extrahas extremitatem fili, et aggreges duas extremitates simul: et stringe utramque, et dimitte illud die uno, aut duobus diebus: et quanto plus incidit filum in carne, stringe ipsum bene, donec incidantur illae carnes quae sunt inter duas extremitates fili, et cadant: deinde cura uulnus, donec consolidetur, et sanetur.	If therefore it penetrates the inner edge of the anus nearby, then pull the thread out of that opening; so that you insert your finger into the anus, and pull out the end of the thread, and bring the two ends together; and tighten each, and leave it for one or two days; and the more the thread enters the flesh, tighten it well, until those flesh that are between the two ends of the thread are cut and fall away; then treat the wound until it consolidates and heals.
Si autem orificium Fistulae non est penetrans: tunc fac ipsum penetrare quocunque modo praeparatur tibi, nisi sit in profundo multum.	If however the opening of the fistula is not penetrating, then make it penetrate in whatever way is prepared for you, unless it is very deep.
Non enim inest tibi, ut facias illud propter lacertum, ut non incidas ipsum.	For you do not have the ability to do that for the sake of the muscle, so as not to injure it.
Deinde fac cum ea sicut diximus, donec sanetur.	Then do with it as we have said, until it heals.
Forma Spatumilis spinosi quo finditur Fistula, cuius curuitas est acuta ualde, et pars altera est non acuta, ut non incidat illud quod non est necesse, sicut uides.	A sharp, pointed spatula with which the fistula is split, whose curvature is very sharp, and the other part is not sharp, so that it does not injure that which is not necessary, as you see.
¶ De sutura Hemorroidarum, ex quibus currit sanguis ex incisione earum: et cura fissurarum.	Concerning the suturing of hemorrhoids, from which blood flows from their incision, and the treatment of fissures.
Caput LXXXI.	Chapter Eighty-One.
Sunt Hemorroides secundum duos modos.	Hemorrhoids are of two kinds.
Aut enim sunt intra anum, similes uesicis carbonum, uel prunarum: aut quasi ipsae sint grana uuae.	For they are either within the anus, like the bladders of coals or plums, or like grapes themselves.
Et ex eis sunt paruae, et magnae: et sanguis currit ex eis semper, et est una, et sunt multae.	And of them are small and large: and blood flows from them always, and there is one, and there are many.
Et sunt extra anum, et in extremitatibus eius.	And they are outside the anus, and at its extremities.
Verumtamen istae quae sunt extra anum, sunt secundum plurimum paucae humiditatis, ex quibus currit aqua citrina, aut parum sanguinis cursu assiduo: et sunt secundum colorem corporis.	However, those which are outside the anus, are for the most part few, moist, from which yellow water or a little blood runs with constant flow: and they are according to the color of the body.
Et curatio eius quae est intra anum, est, ut praecipias infirmo ut assellet: et exprimatur, donec egrediatur anus, et appareant athelil tibi.	And the treatment of that which is within the anus is, that you instruct the sick person to press: and it is to be expressed, until it issues from the anus, and appear clear to you.
Propterea ergo et suspende cum uncinis: aut tene eos cum ungue tuo.	Therefore also suspend them with hooks, or hold them with your fingernail.
Deinde incide eos apud radices suas.	Then cut them at their roots.
Si autem non retinentur in eis uncini, propter humiditatem eorum et ipsorum mollificationem: tunc cape eos cum panno aspero, aut cum coto ex diploide lanea, et extrahe eos cum digitis tuis.	However, if the hooks are not retained in them, due to their moisture and their softening, then take them with a rough cloth, or with cotton from doubled wool, and pull them out with your fingers.
Deinde incide eos, et pulueriza super eos post incisionem quosdam pulueres calidos, ut stent eis loco cauterii.	Then cut them, and after the incision, sprinkle some hot powders over them, so that they act as a cautery.
Aut cauteriza eos secundum quod praecessit in capitulo cauterizandi.	Or cauterize them according to what preceded in the chapter on cauterization.
Deinde cura eos cum reliqua curatione, donec sanentur.	Then treat them with the remaining treatment, until they heal.
Quod si non obedit anus egressioni, tunc clisteriza infirmum clisteri in quo sit mordicatio parua, ut lauetur cum eo quod est in ano, et obediat egressioni uelociter, quando exprimit se infirmus.	If the anus does not yield to the evacuation, then administer an enema to the sick person containing a small amount of mordicant, so that it may wash out what is in the anus, and yield to the evacuation quickly when the sick person expels it.
Si autem athelil sunt extrinseci ab ano, tunc res eorum est leuis, facilis: et est ut capias eos cum ungue tuo, aut capias eos cum uncino, et incidas eos.	If, however, the piles are external to the anus, then their removal is easy and simple:  you may grasp them with your fingernail or forceps and excise them.
Deinde cura eos cum eo quod diximus, donec sanentur.	Then treat them with what we have said, until they heal.
Et qui abhorret incisionem cum ferro, tunc oportet ut administres suturam eorum secundum hunc modum.	And whoever recoils from incision with iron, then it is necessary that you administer their suture in this manner.
Accipe filum inuolutum, et intromitte ipsum in acum.	Take a wrapped thread, and insert it into the needle.
Deinde extrahe athelil ad superiora, et fac ipsum penetrare cum acu in radice eius ex parte altera: et inuolue duas extremitates fili, in inferiori parte acus, et sint latitudinaliter: et stringe athelil strictura forti.	Then pull the piles upwards, and make it penetrate with the needle into its root on the other side: and wrap the two ends of the thread, at the lower part of the needle, and let them be laterally: and tighten the piles with a strong ligature.
Deinde noda filum, et extrahe acum.	Then tie the thread, and remove the needle.
Fac illud cum omnibus athelil, et dimitte ex eis unum: nec suas ipsum, ut currat ex eo superfluitas sanguinis.	Do that with all the piles, and leave one out of them: nor let it be such, that blood flows from it.
Deinde pone super anum pannum infusum in oleo rosato, aut caeroto, et pone ipsum super anum: et praecipe infirmo, ut quiescat.	Then place a cloth soaked in rose oil, or cera, over the anus, and place it over the anus: and instruct the sick person to rest.
Deinde dimitte ipsum, donec cadat.	Then leave it until it falls.
Cum ergo cadunt athelil, cura eos cum unguentis, et reliqua curatione, donec sanentur.	When therefore the piles fall, treat them with ointments and other treatment, until they are healed.
¶ De cura Fissurarum.	Concerning the treatment of Fissures.
Multotiens enim accidunt ex exiccatione stercoris, et constrictione naturae.	For they often occur from the drying up of feces and the constriction of nature.
Cum ergo antiquantur, et non ualet in eis medicina: tunc oportet ut radas cum puncta Spatumilis, aut cum ungue tuo, donec fiant humidae, et auferatur ab eis cortex superior qui prohibet eas a consolidatione.	When therefore they are old and medicine is of no avail for them, then it is necessary to scrape them with the point of a spatula or with your fingernail, until they become moist, and the upper bark which prevents their consolidation is removed.
Deinde cura eas, donec consolidentur secundum quod oportet.	Then treat them until they are consolidated as they should be.
Si autem non consolidantur: tunc itera eas cum rasione uehementiori quam prima, donec sanguinentur multum, et excorientur deinde cura eas, donec sanentur.	However, if they do not consolidate, then scrape them again with a more forceful instrument than the first, until they bleed much, and are then scaled; subsequently treat them until they heal.
¶ De curatione Almirmar inuersorum, et non inuersorum: et Athelil siccorum, et Formicae.	Concerning the treatment of inverted and non-inverted Almirmar, and of dry Athelil and Formicae.
Caput LXXXII.	Chapter LXXXII.
Scias quod Almirmar non est nisi nodus rotundus secundum colorem corporis, similis capiti claui: et fit in toto corpore, praecipue in inferioribus partibus pedum, et digitis: et accidit ex eis dolor apud ambulationem.	Know that Almirmar is nothing other than a round swelling the colour of the body, resembling the head of a nail; and it occurs throughout the body, especially in the lower parts of the feet and toes, and pain arises from them when walking.
Oportet ergo ut secetur quod est in circumitu claui, et teneatur cum forficibus, aut cum uncino, et eradicetur ex radice sua.	Therefore, it is necessary to cut that which is around the nail, and to hold it with scissors or a hook, and to eradicate it from its root.
Deinde cura illud: et si uis cauteriza illud secundum quod praecessit in capitulo suo.	Then treat it; and if you wish, cauterize it according to what has been described in its chapter.
Ex athelil autem siccis unus est eminentia parua, aspera, filtrata, rotunda supra superficiem corporis.	From dry athelil, one is a small, rough, filtered, round eminence on the surface of the body.
Et multotiens accidunt in manibus puerorum.	And they frequently occur in the hands of children.
Et curatio eius est, ut extendas athelil, et incidas ipsum: aut stringas ipsum cum filo de serico: aut cum pilo, donec cadat.	And its treatment is, to stretch the athelil, and cut it; or to bind it with silk thread; or with a needle, until it falls off.
Et si uis, cauteriza ipsum secundum quod praemissum est cum igne, aut cum medicina acuta: et iam eradicantur athelil inuersi, et non inuersi cum instrumento quod ego dicam.	And if you wish, cauterize it according to what was previously stated with fire, or with a sharp medicine; and now inverted athelil are eradicated, and not inverted with the instrument which I shall name.
Formica autem est etiam eminentia parua filtrata, grossa, super superficiem corporis, uadens in profundum ualde: et quando inuenit eam frigus, sentitur in ea simile mordicationi formicae, et fit in corpore toto: et plurimum eius fit in manibus.	A formica is also a small, filtered, thick eminence on the surface of the body, going deep into it very much; and when cold encounters it, a sensation similar to an ant's bite is felt in it, and it spreads throughout the body; and most of it occurs in the hands.
Et curatio eius est, ut accipias cannulam ex penna anseris, aut penna uulturis forti: et pone illam cannulam super Formicam, donec contineat circulus cannulae ex partibus eius.	And its treatment is, to take a cannula from a goose feather, or a strong vulture's feather; and place that cannula over the Formica, until the circle of the cannula encloses its parts.
Deinde reuolue manum tuam cum cannula, donec seces quod est in circumitu Formicae: et ponas eam in profundo carnis, et eradices Formicam ex radice eius.	Then turn your hand with the cannula, until you sever that which is around the Formica; and place it deep within the flesh, and eradicate the Formica from its root.
Et si uis, fac illud cum cannula aeris, aut ferri, secundum hanc formam.	And if you wish, do it with a cannula of air, or iron, according to this form.
Sit superius cannulae ad sublimitatem trahens surdum inuolutum, ut alleuietur super digitum apprehensio eius et ipsius reuolutio.	Let the upper part of the cannula be raised to draw the deaf wrapping, so that the grasping and turning of it and itself may be alleviated above the finger.
Et si uis cauteriza Formicam secundum quod praemissum est in cauterizatione Athelil in capitulo de cauterio.	And if you wish, cauterize the Formica according to what was stated previously in the cauterization of Athelil in the chapter on cautery.
¶ De formis Instrumentorum quae administrantur ad Clisteria in aegritudinibus Ani, et solutionis uentris, et colicae.	Of the forms of instruments that are administered for clysters in diseases of the anus, and evacuation of the bowels, and colic.
Caput LXXXIII.	Chapter LXXXIII.
Quandoque Clistere fit ex argento, aut ex aurichalco, aut ex aere fuso, aut malleato.	Sometimes a clyster is made of silver, or of brass, or of cast bronze, or of hammered bronze.
Et quandoque fit ex istis Instrumentis paruum, et magnum, secundum illos in quibus administrantur.	And sometimes it is made from these instruments small, and large, according to those in which they are administered.
Illud ergo quod administratur in curatione puerorum paruorum, sit paruum: et quorum ani sunt debiles, aut dolorosi, sic et clisteria eorum.	Therefore, that which is administered in the treatment of young children should be small; and those whose anuses are weak or painful, likewise their clysters.
Clistere magnum.	Large clyster.
Cistere paruum.	Small clyster.
Canna eius, id est, caput superius in quo ligatur uter, sit amplum secundum hunc modum: et sit ei distinctio ut ligetur uter sicut uides, et extremitas eius inferior quae intromittitur in anum, sit surda, id est, non aperta, lenis, ualde, trahens ad subtilitatem: et in uno laterum eius sint duo foramina, et in latere altero foramen unum.	Its tube, that is, the upper head in which the uterus is tied, should be wide according to this measure; and it should have a distinction so that the uterus is tied as you see, and its lower end which is introduced into the anus should be blunt, that is, not open, smooth, very much, drawn to subtlety; and on one side of it there should be two openings, and on the other side one opening.
Et sit amplitudo foraminis secundum grossitudinem radiorum, et grossius parum, et sit uter in quo ponuntur medicinae ex uesica animalis: aut ex charta ouis, quae sit secundum formam asofrati paruae: cuius radix sit palmus unus.	And the size of the opening should be according to the thickness of the rays, and a little thicker; and let the uterus into which the medicines are placed be from the bladder of an animal, or from the parchment of an egg, which should be according to the form of a small asofrat; whose root should be one palm.
Et perforetur foraminibus multis sicut reuoluitur, et sit spacium quod est inter omne foramen grossitudo digiti.	And let it be pierced with many holes as it is rolled, and let the space between each hole be the thickness of a finger.
Deinde intromitte in illa foramina filum forte ex filo crudo, quod sit ex decem filis, aut circiter ea, et aggrega cum eo utrem sicut asofrati.	Then introduce strong thread, made of ten threads or thereabouts, into those holes, and bind the uterus with it, like an asofrat.
Cum ergo ponitur in eo uter, stringatur in capite clisteris inter duo distinguentia constrictione forti.	When therefore the uterus is placed in it, it should be tightened at the head of the enema between two distinguishing constrictions with strong force.
Deinde clisteriza cum eo.	Then irrigate with it.
Et haec est forma circuli utris hic depicta, et foraminum.	And this is the form of the uterus depicted here, and the holes.
Qualitas autem clisterizandi cum eo, est: ut impleas utrem, aut uesicam ex medicina, quae sit calefacta secundum quantitatem tolerantiae infirmi: et caue ne sit calida ualde, aut frigida ualde.	However, the quality of irrigating with it is: that you fill the bladder or pouch with medicine that is warmed according to the patient's tolerance, and be careful that it is not excessively hot or cold.
Deinde resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum, et eleuet crura sua ad superiora: et pone sub eo inthaan, id est, corium super quod iacent homines, aut linteamen.	Then the patient should lie on their back, and elevate their legs upwards, and place beneath them a *inthaan*, that is, a skin upon which people lie, or a linen cloth.
Deinde inunge extremitatem Clisteris cum oleo, aut cum albugine oui, aut cum mucillagine foenugraeci, aut similium.	Then anoint the end of the clyster with oil, or with the white of an egg, or with the mucilage of fenugreek, or similar things.
Deinde intromitte ipsum in anum cum facilitate.	Then introduce it into the anus with ease.
Deinde accipiat minister utrem cum duabus manibus suis simul, et exprimat ipsum cum uehementia, donec euacuet totum quod est in Clisteri in intestinum.	Then let the attendant take the pouch with both hands together, and squeeze it forcefully, until all that is in the clyster is evacuated into the intestines.
Deinde extrahe Clistere, et eleuet infirmus crura sua ad parietem.	Then withdraw the clyster, and let the patient raise their legs towards the wall.
Quod si medicina cogit eum ad exitum, tunc teneat quantum potest.	If the medicine compels him towards an end, then let him hold on as long as he can.
Et si dormit cum ea nocte tota, est magis ultimum in iuuamento.	And if he sleeps with it all night, it is more beneficial in its aid.
Si autem clisterizas eum in aegritudinibus solutionis uentris, et festinat exitus eius: tunc itera clistere, donec sanetur.	If, however, you administer a clyster in diseases of the abdominal looseness, and his death is hastened, then administer the clyster again, until he is healed.
Quod si in ano sunt hemorroides, aut apostemata laedentia, tunc sit clistere subtile ualde, lene, ex clisteribus quibus clisterizantur pueri.	If there are hemorrhoids or damaging abscesses in the anus, then let the clyster be very fine, gentle, from the clysters with which children are given clysters.
Et haec sit forma clisteris subtilis super quod sit stricta cutis.	And this be the form of a fine clyster above which shall be tight skin.
¶ De curatione Vulnerum capitis sine fractura ossis.	Concerning the treatment of head wounds without fracture of the bone.
Caput LXXXIIII.	Chapter LXXXIV.
Iam dixi in diuisione de curatione uulnerum quod conueniebat libro, et ego dicam hic curationem eorum cum manu, et cum medicinis secundum complementum.	I have already spoken in the division of the treatment of wounds that it was fitting for this book, and I shall say here about their treatment with the hand, and with medicines according to their completion.
Dico ergo, quod uulnera diuersificantur secundum illud quo fiunt uulnera, et secundum locum super quem cadit uulnus.	I say therefore, that wounds are diversified according to that by which wounds are made, and according to the place upon which the wound falls.
Res ergo quibus fiunt uulnera multotiens, sunt sicut iactus lapidis: aut incisio ensis, aut cultelli: aut percussio cum lancea, aut ligno, aut sagitta: et similibus illis ex rebus multis.	The things by which wounds are made are often, as a stone's throw; or the incision of a sword or knife; or a blow with a spear, or wood, or an arrow; and by similar things from many things.
Vulnera autem quae fiunt secundum loca corporis sunt, sicut uulnus quod cadit super caput, aut collum, aut pectus, aut uentrem, aut epar: et similia ex eis membris.	And the wounds that occur according to the places of the body are, such as a wound that falls upon the head, or the neck, or the breast, or the belly, or the liver; and similar ones from those limbs.
Et ego sum narrans curationes quorundam uulnerum, ut ponam eam ratiocinationem et regulam super reliqua uulnera.	And I am narrating the treatments of some wounds, so as to set forth that reasoning and rule over the remaining wounds.
Et ego incipiam a uulneribus capitis simplicibus: quoniam rememoratio compositorum ueniet in principio capituli tertii.	And I shall begin with simple wounds of the head, because the recollection of composite wounds will come at the beginning of the third chapter.
Dico ergo.	I say therefore.
Quando accidit in capite uulnus simplex, et non est fractura ossis: considera tunc, si est ex iactu lapidis, aut ei similibus, et iam fregit cutem tantum: et est uulnus magnum, et times super infirmum euentum apostematis calidi: tunc propera, et phlebotoma cephalicam statim: et non tardes illud: et extrahe ei ex sanguine secundum quantitatem uirtutis eius: si non fuerit prohibens aliquid a phlebotomia, praecipue si fuerit sanguis qui egreditur ex uulnere paucus.	When a simple wound occurs on the head, and there is no fracture of the bone: consider then, if it is from the throwing of a stone, or similar things, and it has only broken the skin: and is a large wound, and you fear a bad outcome of a hot abscess: then hurry, and immediately perform a cephalic phlebotomy; and do not delay it; and draw from its blood according to the quantity of its strength; if nothing is preventing it from phlebotomy, especially if the blood issuing from the wound is scant.
Et sit phlebotomia ex contrario partis uulneratae.	And let the phlebotomy be on the opposite side of the wounded part.
Et caueat infirmus sibi a repletione, et uino, et cibis grossis.	And let the patient beware of repletion, and wine, and heavy foods.
Si autem minutionem prohibet aliquid, tunc minoretur ex cibo, et non appropinquet carnibus, neque uinis.	If, however, something prohibits lessening, then lessen from food, and let him not approach meats, nor wines.
Et pone super uulnus si accidit ei apostema calidum, cotum infusum in oleo rosato solo, aut cum uino in quo est stipticitas.	And if a hot abscess happens to him, place on the wound a poultice infused in rose oil alone, or with wine in which there is astringency.
Si autem securus fueris ab apostemate calido, tunc pone super uulnus, si est recens cum sanguine suo, et non mutauit ipsum aer, puluerem quem ego narrabo post paululum: et si iam mutauit ipsum aer, tunc pone super ipsum quaedam unguenta, donec sanetur.	If, however, you are certain about a hot abscess, then place on the wound, if it is fresh with its own blood, and the air has not changed it, the powder that I will describe shortly; and if the air has already changed it, then apply some ointments to it until it is healed.
Si autem uulnus est magnum, aut est ex incisione ensis, et similium: et non aggregantur labia eius per puluillos, tunc aggrega ipsa cum sutura, secundum quod ego narrabo in uulneribus uentris de sutura eorum.	If, however, the wound is large, or from a sword cut, and similar things: and its edges do not come together with bandages, then bring them together with sutures, according to what I will describe in wounds of the belly concerning their sutures.
Si autem uulnus iam detectum est ab osse, et pendet, et non est retentio eius, nisi in suspensorio paruo: tunc incide ipsum.	If, however, the wound is already exposed by bone, and hangs, and its retention is only in a small suspender: then cut it.
Deinde cura uulnus cum medicinis, et restaura in eo carnem duram loco cutis, et praecipe infirmo, ut alatur cibis in quibus est grossitudo, sicut sunt capita, et triticum coctum, donec sit ut puls: et eis similia.	Then treat the wound with medicines, and restore the hard flesh in it in place of skin, and prescribe to the sick person that he be nourished with foods in which there is thickness, such as heads [of animals] and cooked wheat, until it is like porridge, and similar things.
Quod si inuenis in cute putrefactionem, et non adhaeret ossi: tunc incide putrefactum totum, et proiice ipsum: deinde cura illud.	If you find putrefaction in the skin, and it does not adhere to the bone, then cut away the entire putrefied part and cast it off; then treat it.
Si autem in his uulneribus est arteria, aut uena ex qua fluit sanguis: et non abscinditur per medicinas, tunc inquire super arteriam.	If, however, in these wounds there is an artery or vein from which blood flows: and it is not stopped by medicines, then investigate the artery.
Si ergo inuenis eam non sectam, tunc seca eam cum Spatumili, aut liga eam.	If therefore you find it not severed, then sever it with a Spatumili, or tie it.
Quod si necessitas prouocat quando non confert illud quod diximus, tunc cauteriza eam, donec abscindatur sanguis.	If necessity demands when that which we have said is not helpful, then cauterize it until the blood is stopped.
Si autem uulnera ista sunt parua, simplicia, tunc res eorum est facilis, leuis: ita ut puluerizes super ea hunc puluerem: quoniam consolidat ea antequam mutet ea aer.	If, however, these wounds are small, simple, then their remedy is easy, slight: so that you pulverize this powder over them; because it consolidates them before the air alters them.
¶ Modus Pulueris incarnatiui.	Method of the flesh-healing powder.
Recipe olibani partem unam, et sanguinis draconis partes duas, et calcis non extinctae partes tres: teratur totum multum, et cribelletur: et impleatur ex eo uulnus, et constringatur constrictione bona, donec adhaereat super ipsum bene, et coaguletur cum sanguine.	Take one part of frankincense, two parts of dragon's blood, and three parts of quicklime: grind all thoroughly, and sift it: and fill the wound with it, and bind it with a good bandage, until it adheres well to it and coagulates with the blood.
Deinde stringe ipsum desuper cum puluillis, et dimitte ipsum, neque soluas ipsum dum permanet, ita quod non apostemetur.	Then bind it over with bandages, and leave it, and do not loosen it while it remains, so that it does not fester.
Nam non eradicatur ab eo medicina, donec sanatur.	For the medicine is not removed from it until it is healed.
Et quandoque facit illud calx sola, quando non sunt tibi in praesenti olibanum, et sanguis draconis etiam facit eandem operationem in multis ex uulneribus magnis, quando conuenit ut ponatur super ea et stringantur, et sunt uulnera recentia cum sanguine suo, quae non alterauit aer.	And sometimes lime alone does this, when you do not have frankincense and dragon's blood present; and dragon's blood also does the same operation in many large wounds, when it is suitable to be placed on them and bound, and are fresh wounds with their own blood, which the air has not altered.
Quod si iam alterauit ea aer quadam alteratione, praecipue quando est in tempore aestatis, tunc non est in positione huius pulueris intentio: cura ergo ipsum cum eo quod diximus, ita ut ponas super ea quaedam unguenta digestiua: aut ponas super ea pultes ex farina hordei, factas cum aqua et melle, donec emittant pus.	If it has already altered it by some change of the air, especially when it is in summer, then this powder is not suited for this purpose.  Therefore, treat it with what we have said, placing on it certain digestive ointments; or place on it poultices of barley flour made with water and honey until they discharge pus.
Deinde cura ea reliqua curatione, donec sanentur.	Then treat it with the rest of the treatment until they are healed.
Si uero accidat cum uulnere fractura in osse, et est parua, tunc extrahe illud cum Gesti: et ego iam dicam curationem fracturarum capitis in eo quod futurum est.	If, however, a fracture of the bone occurs with the wound, and it is small, then extract it with a forceps; and I will now describe the treatment of skull fractures in what is to come.
¶ De uulneribus Colli.	Concerning wounds of the Neck.
Caput LXXXV.	Chapter LXXXV.
SI Autem uulnus accidat in Collo, tunc non est inter ipsum differentia in medicatione, et inter uulnus capitis quando est simplex.	However, if a wound occurs in the neck, then there is no difference in its treatment from a simple wound of the head.
Si autem iam incisus est neruus Colli, aut arteria: tunc si est neruus, non est in eo ingenium, nisi ut deuitetur curatio eius cum eo quod facit stipticitatem uehementem, sicut ziniar, et zegi, et eis similia.	If, however, a nerve of the neck or artery has already been cut: then, if it is a nerve, there is no cure for it, except to avoid treatment that causes extreme astringency, such as ziniar, and zegi, and similar things.
Quoniam nocent neruis, et contrahunt eos.	Because they harm the nerves and constrict them.
Et non ponas super uulnus aliquid frigidum omnino: quoniam substantia neruorum est frigida, et continuatio eius est cum cerebro, quod est sublimius membrorum: et sit illud quo curatur ex medicinis lene, sicut calx lota cum aqua dulci aliquotiens infusa cum oleo, aut cum oleo rosato, et tuthia, quando abluitur etiam cum aqua dulci: et reliqui lapides minerales, secundum hunc modum, et unguenta humida.	And do not place anything cold on the wound at all, because the substance of nerves is cold, and its connection is with the brain, which is higher than the limbs: and let that by which it is cured be mild in medicines, such as lime washed with sweet water sometimes infused with oil, or with rose oil, and tutty, when it is also washed with sweet water: and the other mineral stones, in this manner, and moist ointments.
Si autem uulnus est magnum, tunc administra suturam: aut coarta labia eius cum puluillis.	If, however, the wound is large, then apply sutures: or constrict its lips with bandages.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then treat it until it is healed.
Si uero uulneri est profunditas, aut accidit in eo sinus in inferiori parte eius, in quo iam aggregatur pus, tunc perfora ipsum in magis depresso loco in eo.	If however the wound has depth, or a sinus occurs within it at its lower part, in which pus already gathers, then pierce it in the more depressed place within it.
Quod si iam incisa est in uulnere arteria, et consecutus est sanguinem eius fluxus: tunc separa, uel seca eam, et liga ipsam: aut cauteriza eam, si prouocat necessitas ad illud.	If, however, an artery has already been incised in the wound, and its blood flow has ensued: then separate, or cut it, and tie it: or cauterize it, if necessity prompts it.
Si autem iam incidit spondiles gutturis, aut totum, et saluatae sunt alhaudegi: tunc aggrega labia cutis cum sutura super cannam gutturis, et non tangas guttur, imo aequa ipsum, et reduc ipsum super figuram naturalem.	If, however, the larynx's cartilage has already been cut, or all of it, and the other parts have been saved: then bring together the skin's edges with sutures over the larynx's cartilage, and do not touch the larynx itself, rather, straighten it and return it to its natural shape.
Deinde stringe ipsum strictura decenti, et dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot.	Then bind it with a suitable bandage, and leave it for a few days.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguentis in quibus est stipticitas et exiccatio, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with ointments that possess astringency and drying properties, until it is healed.
Si autem uulnus iam fecit impressionem in osse, tunc perquire ipsum: tunc si in ipso sunt fragmenta ossis, extrahe ea omnia, aut quae potes ex eis: et quod non praeparatur, dimitte illud, donec putrescat uulnus, et separetur et alleuietur egressio eius.	If, however, the wound has already made an impression on the bone, then investigate it; then if there are fragments of bone within, remove all of them, or as many as you can: and that which cannot be removed, leave it, until the wound becomes suppurated, and the discharge from it is separated and lessened.
Quod si uulnus fuerit recens, tunc pulueriza super ipsum puluerem quem narraui.	If the wound is recent, then sprinkle the powder I mentioned upon it.
Si autem uidetur in uulnere os, et fit Fistula: tunc cura ipsam cum eo cuius rememoratio uenit in capitulo suo.	If, however, a bone is seen in the wound, and it becomes a fistula, then treat it with that which is recalled in its chapter.
¶ De uulnere in Spatulis.	Of a wound in the shoulder blades.
Caput LXXXVI.	Chapter LXXXVI.
SI Est percussio lanceae, aut cultelli: et uides eius profunditatem, tunc considera.	If there is a blow from a lance or a knife, and you see its depth, then consider.
Si ergo ex uulnere egreditur uentositas, quando anhelat ex eo infirmus, tunc scias, quia uulnus est mortale.	If, therefore, wind escapes from the wound when the sick person breathes heavily from it, then know that the wound is mortal.
Quod si non fuerit ei profunditas, et est recens cum sanguine suo: tunc non ponas in eo a prima hora puluerem, neque stringas ipsum, ut non retineatur sanguis in profunditate eius, et reuertatur ad cor, et interficiat infirmum: sed pone in ipso unguentum attractiuum, et solue ipsum in die bis.	If it does not have depth, and is fresh with its own blood, then do not put powder on it from the first hour, nor bind it, so that the blood is not retained in its depth, and returns to the heart, and kills the sick person: but put attracting ointment on it, and loosen it twice a day.
Si uero unguentum non est tibi praesens, tunc pone in orificio uulneris cotum uetustum, ut sugat illud quod egreditur de eo ex humiditatibus: et fac ut dormiat infirmus super uulnus, ut currat quod aggregatur in eo.	If, however, ointment is not present for you, then place an old cloth in the wound's opening, so that it sucks what escapes from it, from the humidities; and make the sick person sleep upon the wound, so that what is gathered in it may run.
Si uero iam praeterierint uulneri tres dies, aut plures, et non accidit infirmo spasmus, neque tremor cordis malus, neque strictura in anhelitu, et uides reliquas dispositiones eius bonas: tunc scias, quia uulnus est saluum.	If, however, three days or more have passed since the wound, and no spasm occurs to the sick person, nor bad tremor of the heart, nor constriction in breathing, and you see the other conditions of him good, then know that the wound is safe.
Cura ergo ipsum et cum liciniis, et reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Therefore treat him with bandages and the other treatment, until he is healed.
Si uero excusatur sanatio eius, et iam aperitur semper, tunc scias, quia iam factum est Fistula.	If, however, his healing is excused, and it continually opens, then know that a fistula has already formed.
Cura ergo ipsam ex capitulo suo.	Therefore treat it according to its chapter.
Et si uulnus est ex incisione ensis, aut cultelli, et est simplex in superficie pectoris, aut dorsi: tunc cura ipsum cum eo quod praecessit ex sutura, si est magnum: aut cum puluere, si est paruum.	And if the wound is from the cut of a sword or knife, and is simple on the surface of the chest or back, then treat it with what has preceded concerning sutures, if it is large, or with powder, if it is small.
Si autem iam fecit impressionem in osse, et incidit ex eo frusta: tunc inquire uulnus, et propera ad extrahendum illa frusta, si sunt separata.	If, however, it has already made an impression on the bone, and cut off fragments from it: then investigate the wound, and hasten to extract those fragments, if they are separate.
Si uero non sunt separata, tunc dimitte ea, donec putrefiat uulnus, alleuiatur enim extractio eorum.	If however they are not separate, then leave them until the wound putrefies, for the extraction of them will be eased.
Reliquorum autem uulnerum accidentium in reliquis membris iudicium in curatione, est iudicium eius quod diximus.	However, for the treatment of other accidental wounds in the other limbs, the judgment is that which we have stated.
¶ De uulneribus Ventris, et exitu intestini, et exitura eorum.	Concerning wounds of the belly, and the exit of the intestines, and their exit.
Caput LXXXVII.	Chapter LXXXVII.
Disruptio quae accidit uentri, est magna, et media, et parua.	A rupture that occurs in the belly is great, and medium, and small.
Ex magna igitur quandoque egreditur intestinum, aut numerus intestinorum.	From the great one, therefore, sometimes the intestine, or a number of intestines, emerges.
Quare fit intromissio eorum, et eorum sutura uehementior et difficilior.	Therefore, why does their intromission occur, and their suturing more vehement and more difficult?
Et disruptio parua etiam fit difficilis ex modo alio.	And a small rupture also becomes difficult in another way.
Sequitur ergo, ut sit reductio eorum difficilior, si non properas in intromissione sua ad locum suum statim: quoniam inflatur, aperitur, et ingrossatur: quare fit difficilis introitus eius.	Therefore it follows, that their reduction is more difficult, if you do not hasten their intromission to their place immediately: because it is inflated, opened, and thickened: wherefore its entrance becomes difficult.
Propter hoc ergo fit melior disruptionum disruptio media: quoniam cum ea non fit difficilis reductio intestini, sicut fit dissicilis in his duabus speciebus.	Therefore, a middle rupture is better, because when it occurs, the reduction of the intestine is not difficult, as it is in these two kinds.
Scias, quod sutura uenris est secundum quatuor modos.	Know that the suturing of the belly is according to four ways.
Duae suturae communes conueniunt in sutura uentris, et in sutura reliquorum uulnerum corporis: et duae suturae aliae proprie communicant reliquis uulneribus.	Two common sutures agree in the suturing of the belly, and in the suturing of the other wounds of the body: and two other sutures properly agree with the other wounds.
Verumtamen sunt magis propriae cum sutura uentris: et ego narro tibi unamquamque cum expositione, et declaratione.	However, they are more proper with the suturing of the belly: and I tell you each one with explanation and declaration.
Dico ergo, quia quando uulnus est paruum, et egreditur ex eo aliquid ex intestino, et fit difficile reducere ipsum: tunc illud est propter unum duorum modorum.	Therefore, I say that when the wound is small, and something from the intestine comes out of it, and it becomes difficult to reduce it, then that is because of one of two ways.
Aut propter paruitatem disruptionis, sicut diximus: Aut quoniam in intestino est inflatio propter frigus aeris.	Either because of the smallness of the disruption, as we said: or because there is an inflation in the intestine from the cold of the air.
Quando ergo illud est ita, tunc oportet ut calefacias ipsum, ita ut submergas spongiam, aut pannum humidum in aqua tepida sola.	When therefore that is so, then it is necessary to warm it, so that you submerge a sponge, or a damp cloth, in lukewarm water alone.
Aut decoquas in aqua squinantum, et cyperum, et spicam, et embroces cum ea intestinum, donec resoluatur inflatio.	Or boil it in water with squinants, and cyperus, and spike, and embrocate the intestine with it, until the inflation is resolved.
Quandoque facit illud uinum in quo est stipticitas: et est melius quam aqua sola in resolutione inflationis.	Sometimes wine in which there is astringency does it; and it is better than water alone in the resolution of the inflation.
Cum ergo uides inflationem iam resolui, tunc humecta intestinum cum aqua in qua decocta est altea, aut malua.	When therefore you see the inflation already resolved, then moisten the intestine with water in which marshmallow, or mallow, has been boiled.
Nam per illud alleuiatur introitus eius cum re parua.	For by it the entrance of it is eased with a small thing.
Si autem excusatur reditus eius post hanc curationem, tunc finde in disruptione parum, cum instrumento quo secantur hemorrhoides.	If however its return is excused after this treatment, then make a small incision in the disruption, with the instrument with which hemorrhoids are cut.
Et curatio prima est melior quando praeparatur, quam sectio: et non fit coactio ad secandum post necessitatem et defectum instrumenti.	And the first treatment is better when it is prepared than the incision; and no compulsion is made to incise after necessity and the instrument's failure.
Sit pars eius una quae est torta, acuta, et pars eius altera non acuta, et extremitas subtilis non sit cum subtilitate Spatumilis, imo sit obtusior parumper: et est illa quae similatur caiada, sicut uides.	Let one part of it be twisted and sharp, and the other part not sharp, and the subtle extremity not be with the subtlety of a spatula, rather be somewhat duller: and that is what resembles a caia, as you see.
Cum ergo amplificatur uulnus, et ingreditur intestinum, tunc oportet, ut sit reductio eius secundum formam suam naturalem in loco suo sibi proprio, si possibile est super illud: quoniam est melius.	Therefore, when the wound is enlarged, and the intestine enters, then it is necessary that its reduction be according to its natural form in its own proper place, if possible over it, since it is better.
Quando uero disruptio est ampla in inferiori parte uentris: tunc oportet ut facias iacere infirmum super dorsum suum, et pone crura sua altiora capite suo.	When, however, the disruption is wide in the lower part of the abdomen, then it is necessary that you make the sick person lie on their back, and raise their legs higher than their head.
Et si est in superiore parte uentris, tunc pone caput eius, et pectus ipsius altiora quam eius inferiora.	And if it is in the upper part of the abdomen, then place his head and chest higher than his lower parts.
Et similiter si est disruptio in una duarum partium uentris, tunc pone intentionem tuam, et tuam considerationem semper in hoc, ut pars in qua est uulnus sit altior parte altera.	And similarly, if the disruption is in one of the two parts of the abdomen, then place your intention and your consideration always in this, that the part in which the wound is be higher than the other part.
Et ita oportet, ut admimistres illud in uulneribus magnis, et in uulneribus mediis.	And thus it is necessary to administer that in large wounds, and in medium wounds.
In uulneribus autem paruis, pone illud secundum quod praeparatur tibi.	In small wounds, however, place it according to what is prepared for you.
Deinde fac ut sit praesens inter manus tuas minister pius, qui teneat disruptionem totam manu sua: et aggrega labia eius.	Then cause to be present between your hands a pious minister, who shall hold the entire disruption with his hand: and bring together its lips.
Deinde detege ex ea ei qui sequitur suturam aliquid post aliquid: et iste est modus suturae communis unius.	Then uncover from it to him who follows the suture something after something: and this is the method of a single common suture.
Et est, ut accipias acum, aut numerum acuum secundum quantitatem amplitudinis uulneris.	And it is, that you take a needle, or a number of needles according to the quantity of the wound's breadth.
Deinde dimitte ab extremitate disruptionis quantitatem digiti anularis, id est, medici: et fige acum unam praeter quod intromittas in eam filum in duabus extremitatibuis cutis, cum duabus extremitatibus sifac quod est sub cute ab interioribus, donec facias eam penetrare ab alia parte, et tu iam aggregasti duas extremitates cutis, et duas extremitates sifac: et fiunt quatuor ordines.	Then leave from the extremity of the disruption a quantity of the ring finger, that is, of the physician's: and fix a single needle past that, into which you introduce thread on both its ends, with both ends of which thread you do what is under the skin from the interiors, until you make it penetrate from the other side, and you have already brought together two extremities of skin, and two ends of the thread: and four rows are made.
Deinde stringe cum filo duplo in circumitu acus aliquotiens a duabus partibus simul, quousque sint aggregata duo labia uulneris aggregatione decenti.	Then tighten with the double thread in the circumference of the needle several times from both sides together, until both lips of the wound are brought together in a proper union.
Deinde dimitte grossitudinem digiti etiam, et fige in eis acum aliam: postea reta eam cum filo, sicut fecisti cum acu prima.	Then leave a thickness of a finger also, and fix another needle in them; afterwards pass it with the thread, as you did with the first needle.
Non ergo cesses facere illud cum eo quo indiges ex acubus, donec compleas constrictionem uulneris totius.	Therefore do not cease to do that with whatever needles you need, until you complete the constriction of the entire wound.
Et sint acus mediae inter grossitudinem et subtilitatem: quoniam acus subtiles ualde uelociter incidunt carnem: et grossae sunt difficilis introitus in cutem: propter illud oportet ut sint mediae in subtilitate, et grossitudine.	And let the needles be intermediate in thickness and thinness, because very thin needles pierce flesh very quickly, and thick ones are difficult to insert into the skin; therefore they ought to be intermediate in thinness and thickness.
Et non oportet, ut figatur acus in duabus extremitatibus cutis propinquae multum: ut non incidatur caro uelociter, et aperiatur uulnus ante consolidationem sui, et non elongentur etiam cum sutura, ut non prohibeatur uulnus a consolidatione.	And it is not fitting that the needle be fixed in the two closely positioned skin extremities too much, so that the flesh is not pierced quickly and the wound is opened before its consolidation, and nor should they be pulled out too far with the suture, so that the wound is not hindered from healing.
Deinde incide extremitatem acuum, ut non laedant infirmum apud somnum suum: et pone eis puluillos ex pannis ab omni parte, qui teneant extremitates acuum: et dimitte eos, donec scias quod uulnus iam consolidatum est.	Then cut the ends of the needles, so that they do not harm the sick person during their sleep; and place cushions of cloth on them from every side, which hold the ends of the needles; and leave them until you know that the wound is now healed.
Et haec quidem species suturae cum acubus taliter est conuenientior in uulneribus paruis.	And this type of suture with needles is indeed more suitable for small wounds.
Quoniam sufficit in sutura eorum acus una, aut duae, aut circiter eas.	Because one, or two, or about that many needles are sufficient in their suture.
Sutura autem secunda communis est, ut aggreges cum sutura extremitates quatuor: extremitates, duas cutis, et extremitates duas sifac in uice una, cum acu in qua sit filum inuolutum aequale in subtilitate, et grossitudine.	However, the second common suture is to gather together with the suture four extremities: two skin extremities and two sinew extremities at once, with a needle on which a thread is wound equal in fineness and thickness.
Deinde quando penetraueris cum acu has extremitates quatuor, reduc acum a parte a qua incaepisti eadem, ut cadat filum retatum a superiori parte uulneris: ut sit sutura, sicut sutura panni quo stringuntur panni, et pone inter omnem suturam quantitatem grossitudinis digiti minoris.	Then, when you have pierced these four extremities with the needle, withdraw the needle from the side from which you began, so that the thread is drawn back from the upper part of the wound; so that the suture will be like the suture of a cloth with which cloths are tied together, and place between each suture a quantity of thickness less than a small finger.
Hanc autem suturam sciunt homines.	However, men know this suture.
Et cum hac sutura ego sui uulnus quod acciderat uiro in uentre suo, qui fuerat uulneratus cum cultello, et erat disruptio uulneris maior palmo uno: et exierat ex intestinis circiter duos palmos ex intestino medio, et erat disruptio in medio uentris.	And with this suture I healed a wound that had happened to a man in his belly, who had been wounded with a knife, and the wound was a greater rupture than one palm: and about two palms of the middle intestine had protruded from the intestines, and there was a rupture in the middle of the belly.
Reduxi ergo illud postquam stetit intestinum eius extra uulnus xxiiii horis.	Therefore, I returned it after his intestine had remained outside the wound for twenty-four hours.
Consolidatum est ergo uulnus in spacio quod fuit circiter XV dies: et curaui ipsum, et sanatus est: et uixit post illud annis multis, conuersatus in suis dispositionibus.	Therefore, the wound was consolidated in a space of about fifteen days: and I treated it, and he was healed; and he lived after that many years, engaged in his affairs.
Et medici iudicauerant, quod non sanaretur.	And the physicians had judged that it would not be healed.
Et ex miraculo fuit, quod non curaui illud cum unguento.	And it was miraculous that I did not treat it with ointment.
Quoniam fui in loco in quo non inueniebatur unguentum, neque aliquid ex medicinis.	Because I was in a place where no ointment was found, nor any medicines.
Posui ergo super uulnus cotum uetustum bis in die, et assiduaui ablutionem eius cum aqua mellis, donec sanatum est.	Therefore I placed aged linen upon the wound twice a day, and I diligently washed it with honey water, until it was healed.
Duas autem species suturae proprias dicam secundum narrationem sermonis.	I will now describe two proper types of suture, according to the account of the speech.
Et est, ut incipias cum sutura acuta: et intromittas acum ab exteriori ad interiorem partem.	And it is, that you begin with a sharp suture: and you insert the needle from the exterior to the interior part.
Cum ergo penetrat acus in cutem, et in lacertum euntem secundum longitudinem et latitudinem totius corporis: dimitte extremitatem sifac in latere in quo intromisisti acum, et fac penetrare in extremitatem aliam ab interiori parte ad exteriorem in extremitate altera mirach.	When therefore the needle penetrates the skin, and the muscle proceeding along the length and breadth of the entire body: leave the extremity of the thread on the side where you inserted the needle, and cause it to penetrate to the other extremity from the interior part to the exterior, at the other extremity of the wound.
Cum ergo feceris eam penetrare, tunc fac eam penetrare secundum hoc in eadem hac extremitate mirach ab exteriori parte ad interiorem: et dimitte extremitatem sifac, quae est in hoc latere, et fac penetrare acum in extremitatem alteram ab interiori parte ad exteriorem: et fac penetrare cum penetratione tua qua facis eam penetrare in sifac extremitate mirach, quae est in parte eius, donec penetret in ipsum totum.	When you have thus caused it to penetrate, then cause it to penetrate in the same manner, at this extremity, from the exterior to the interior: and leave the extremity of the thread, which is on this side, and cause the needle to penetrate the other extremity from the interior to the exterior: and cause it to penetrate with your penetration, in the way you make it penetrate in the thread's extremity, which is on its side, until it penetrates the entire wound.
Deinde incipe etiam ab hoc eodem latere, et sue ipsum cum extremitate, quae est ex sifac in latere alio, et extrahe acum ex cute quam penetrauit.	Then begin also from this same side, and sew it with the extremity which is of the thread on the other side, and withdraw the needle from the skin which it has penetrated.
Deinde reduc eam in illam cutem, et sue extremitatem sifac, quae est in latere alio, cum hac extremitate mirach: et extrahe eam ex cute quae est ex parte eius, et fac illud uice una, et alia: et fac illud uice post uicem, usquequo suas extrinsecum totum secundum illud exemplum.	Then return it to that skin, and sew the extremity of the thread, which is on the other side, with this extremity of the wound: and withdraw it from the skin on its side, and do this successively, one and another: and do this turn by turn, until you have sewn the entire wound according to this example.
Et summa huius suturae, est ut suas sutura pellipariorum qua suunt pelles: ita ut suas sifac uice una ex parte una extremitate cutis: et ut dimittas eam uice alia ex parte alia, donec compleas.	And the summary of this suturing is that it should be sewn like the suturing of leatherworkers, who sew hides: so that you should sew the thread successively from one side of one extremity of the skin, and leave it successively from the other side, until you complete it.
Secunda species suturae propriae, quam dixit Gale nus.	The second kind of proper suture, which Galen said.
Iste eius sermo narratus est, ut suas eam secundum similitudinem, qua suunt eas quidam medicantium, ita quod aggregant omnem partem ad comparem suam conuenientem per naturam: et applicant extremitatem sifac ad eius aliam extremitatem, et extremitatem mirach ad extremitatem eius aliam.	His discourse relates that one should sew it according to the likeness in which certain physicians sew them, so that they assemble each part to its natural corresponding part: and they apply the extremity of the thread to its other extremity, and the extremity of the wound to its other extremity.
Et illud fit secundum quod narro tibi.	And that is done according to what I tell you.
Oportet ut figas acum in extremitatem mirach propinquam tibi ab exteriori parte, et facias eam penetrare ad interiorem in eo solo: et dimittas duas extremitates sifac.	You should insert the needle into the nearby extremity of the wound from the outside, and make it penetrate to the inside in that spot alone, and leave the two ends of the thread.
Deinde reuolue acum, et fac eam penetrare ab exteriori parte ad interiorem in duas extremitates sifac, scilicet utrinque.	Then turn the needle, and make it penetrate from the outside to the inside in the two ends of the thread, namely on both sides.
Deinde reuolue utrasque, etiam fac penetrare utrasque ab interiori usque ad exteriorem, in duas extremitates mirach alias, quae sunt in latere opposito.	Then turn both, also make both penetrate from the inside to the outside, into the two other extremities of the wound, which are on the opposite side.
Et iste modus suturae est melior sutura communi facili, et est sutura cuius praecessit rememoratio.	And this method of suture is better than the common easy suture, and is a suture whose recollection precedes.
Iste est ergo sermo Galeni etiam.	This is therefore also the speech of Galen.
Et dixerunt quidam.	And some said.
Retificatur sutura uentris cum duabus acubus.	The suture of the belly is rectified with two needles.
Quod est, ut intromittas in eis utrisque filum unum: et incipe cum intromissione acus, ex eo quod est apud te, et fac eam penetrare usque ad latus aliud, secundum suturam eorum qui suunt coria aequaliter.	That is, that you insert one thread into each of them: and begin with the insertion of the needle, from that which is with you, and make it penetrate to the other side, according to the suture of those who suture hides evenly.
Et scias, quod quando disruptio est in medio uentris: tunc sutura eius est difficilior quam reliquorum locorum uentris.	And know that when the rupture is in the middle of the belly, then its suture is more difficult than the other places of the belly.
Iudicium uero medicationis uulneris, est iudicium reliquorum uulnerum.	The judgment of the medication of a wound is the judgment of the other wounds.
Quod est, quia quando tu consequeris uulnus recens cum sanguine suo, antequam alteret ipsum aer: et reducis intestinum, et suis ipsum, et aptas ipsum: tunc pone super puluerem incarnatiuum.	That is, because when you obtain a fresh wound with its blood, before the air alters it, and you reduce the intestine, and suture it, and adapt it, then put over it powdered flesh-producing medicine.
Quod si aer iam alterauit uulnus: tunc pone super ipsum quaedam unguenta, quae sunt tibi praesentia, donec faciant pus: et cadant fila, et consolidentur sifac, et mirach.	If the air has already altered the wound, then put on it some ointments that are present to you, until they cause pus: and the filaments fall away, and they are consolidated, and mirach.
Deinde cura illud sicut est curatio reliquorum uulnerum, donec sanetur.	Then treat it as is the treatment of the other wounds, until it is healed.
Si autem non sunt tibi praesentes medicinae, tunc pone super ipsum statim, exquo incipit emittere pus, cotum uetus: et permuta ipsum bis in die, sicut docui te, donec sanetur.	However, if you do not have the remedies present, then put on it immediately, from when it begins to emit pus, old lint: and change it twice a day, as I taught you, until it is healed.
Nam tu non indiges medicatione alia in pluribus dispositionibus, quando uulnera sunt simplicia.	For you do not need another medicine in many dispositions, when the wounds are simple.
Si autem times, quod communicet uulnus membris principalibus in laesione, tunc oportet ut submergas lanam lenem in oleo temperatae caliditatis, aut in oleo rosato: et pone ipsam in circumitu locorum quae sunt inter inguina, et sub ascellas.	If, however, you fear that the wound will communicate with the main limbs in the injury, then you ought to submerge soft wool in oil of moderate warmth, or in rose oil, and place it around the areas between the groin and under the armpits.
Quod si sentit dolorem, aut punctiones, aut putrefactionem in intestinis suis (nam multotiens accidit illud) tunc clisteriza ipsum cum uino stiptico, nigro, tepido: praecipue si putredo iam peruenit in intestino, et facta est exitura penetrans usque ad concauitatem eius.	If, however, he feels pain, or prickings, or putrefaction in his bowels (for this often happens) then enema him with astringent, black, lukewarm wine: especially if putrefaction has already reached the bowel and made an exit penetrating to its concavity.
Et scias, quod illud quod est ex intestino grosso, est facilioris sanationis: et quod ex eis est ex subtili, difficilioris sanationis.	And know that that which is from the large intestine is of easier cure, and that which is from the small intestine is of more difficult cure.
Intestinum autem quod nominatur Ieiunum, non suscipit sanationem ex uulnere quod accidit in eo omnino: et illud est propter multitudinem eius, quod est ex uenis, et magnitudine earum, et propter subtilitatem corporis eius, et propinquitatem ipsius naturae neruorum.	However, the intestine called the Jejunum does not receive healing from a wound that occurs in it at all: and this is because of its multitude of veins, and their size, and because of the subtlety of its body, and the proximity of its nerve nature.
Si autem illud quod procedit ex uulnere est zirbum, et consequeris ipsum recens: reduc ipsum secundum reductionem tuam, qua reducis intestina aequaliter.	If, however, that which comes forth from the wound is a zirbum, and you obtain it fresh, reduce it according to your reduction, by which you reduce the intestines equally.
Si uero praeteriit ei spacium, et iam factum est uiride, aut nigrum: tunc oportet ut stringas ipsum cum filo supra locum qui denigratus est ex eo, ut non accidat fluxus sanguinis.	If, however, a space has passed it, and it has already become green or black, then it is necessary to tie it with a thread above the place that has become blackened by it, so that a flow of blood does not occur.
In zirbo enim sunt uenae et arteriae.	For in a zirbum are veins and arteries.
Deinde incide quod est praeter illud ligamentum, et pone duas extremitates fili pendentes ex inferiori parte uulneris extra ipsum: ut alleuietur super te attractio eius, et extractio ipsius apud casum zirbi, et emissionem pus uulneris.	Then cut that which is beyond that ligature, and place the two ends of the thread hanging from the lower part of the wound outside it, so that the traction of it may be eased upon you, and its extraction in the case of a zirbum, and the emission of the wound's pus.
¶ Rememoratio uulneris quod accidit in Intestino.	A remembrance of the wound that occurred in the Intestine.
Quando accidit disruptio in Intestino, et est parua: tunc possibile est, ut restauretur in quibusdam hominibus: propterea, quia ego uidi qui fuit uulneratus in uentre suo cum percussione lanceae, et erat uulnus a dextra stomachi, et antiquatum est uulnus: et factum Fistula, et exiuit ex eo egestio, et uentositas.	When a rupture occurs in the Intestine, and it is small, then it is possible that it may be restored in some people. For this reason, because I saw one who was wounded in his belly with a lance blow, and the wound was from the right side of the stomach, and the wound was old, and it became a fistula, and excrement and wind issued from it.
Posui ergo curationem, usque quod ego non fui confisus in sanatione eius: neque cessaui subtiliare ipsum, donec sanatus est, et consolidatus est locus.	Therefore, I applied treatment until I was not confident in his cure; nor did I cease to refine it until he was healed and the place was consolidated.
Postquam ego uidi locum iam consolidatum, timui super infirmum, quod accideret super infirmum accidens malum in uentre suo: et non accidit ei ex illo accidens malum.	After I saw the place already consolidated, I feared for the sick person, that an evil accident might befall him in his belly; and no evil accident befell him from that.
Et remansit in melioribus dispositionibus suis, comedens et bibens, et futuens, et intrauit balneum, et exercitatus est in dietis suis.	And he remained in better dispositions, eating and drinking, and having sexual relations, and entered the bath, and exercised in his daily activities.
Et iam dixerunt quidam experimentatorum, quia quando accidit in Intestino uulnus, et est paruum: tunc oportet ut ligetur secundum hunc modum.	And now some of the experimenters have said that when a wound occurs in the Intestine, and it is small, then it ought to be tied in this manner.
Et est, ut accipias formicas magnorum capitum.	And it is, that you should take ants of large heads.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris, et pone formicam unam ex eis quae habeant os apertum super duo labia uulneris.	Then bring together the two lips of the wound, and place one ant of those which have an open mouth upon the two lips of the wound.
Cum ergo capit super ea, et stringit os suum, abscinde caput eius, adhaeret enim, et non soluitur.	When therefore it takes hold upon them, and tightens its mouth, cut off its head, for it adheres, and does not come loose.
Deinde pone formicam aliam prope primam, et non cesses facere illud cum formica post formicam secundum quantitatem uulneris totius.	Then place another ant near the first, and do not cease to do that with ant after ant according to the quantity of the entire wound.
Deinde reduc ipsum, et sue uulnus.	Then reduce it, and sew the wound.
Illa enim capita remanent annexa in Intestino, donec cibetur Intestinum, et sanetur, et non accidat infirmo nocumentum penitus.	For those heads remain attached in the intestine, until the intestine is consumed, and healed, and no harm comes to the sick person at all.
Et iam possibile est, ut ligetur Intestinum etiam cum filo subtili: quod abstersum est ex intestino animalis, annexo cum eo postquam intromittitur in acum.	And now it is possible that the intestine be tied also with a fine thread: which has been scraped from the intestine of an animal, attached to it after it has been inserted into a needle.
Et est, ut accipias extremitatem huius fili ex intestino, et excarnetur multum.	And it is to take the extremity of this thread from the intestine, and to scrape it much.
Deinde liga in extremitate eius filum lini subtile inuolutum.	Then tie a fine linen thread wrapped around its extremity.
Deinde intromitte illud filum in acum, et sue cum eo intestinum.	Then insert that thread into a needle, and sew the intestine with it.
Deinde reduc ipsum in disruptionem.	Then reduce it into the disruption.
Et iste modus suturae cum formicis et intestino, non est nisi secundum uiam fiduciae et spei.	And this method of suturing with ants and intestine is only according to the way of trust and hope.
Scias, uulnus quod est magnum, amplum, praecipue si est in uno intestinorum gracilium: tunc non est ingenium nisi subtiliatio, neque est eius sanatio omnino.	Know that a wound which is large, wide, especially if it is in one of the small intestines, then there is no skill but refinement, nor is its healing complete.
¶ De cura Zuchemen, et Fistularum.	Concerning the treatment of Zuchemen, and Fistulas.
Caput LXXXVIII.	Chapter LXXXVIII.
Scias, quod omne uulnus, aut apostema quando ueterascit et antiquatur, et fit ulcus, et non consolidatur, et emittit pus semper, et non abscinditur: tunc nominatur uniuersaliter in quocunque membro fuerit Fistula, et nos nominamus ipsum Zuchemen.	Know that any wound, or abscess, when it grows old and becomes an ulcer, and does not heal, and always discharges pus, and is not cut off: then it is universally named a Fistula, wherever in the member it may be, and we call it Zuchemen.
Et Fistula quidem est secundum ueritatem nodatio filtrata, dura, alba: cum qua non est dolor, cui est concauitas pennae auis: et propter illud nominant eam quidam Risati, id est, pennam.	And a fistula, indeed, is, in truth, a filtered, hard, white knot: with which there is no pain, which has the concavity of a bird's feather; and on account of this some call it Risati, that is, feather.
Et est in quibusdam horis humida, quae emittit pus.	And in some instances it is moist, which emits pus.
Et fortasse scinditur humiditas in quibusdam horis.	And perhaps the moisture is cut open in some instances.
Et quandoque est haec humiditas multa, et est pauca: et est grossa, et est subtilis.	And sometimes this moisture is much, and sometimes little; and it is thick, and sometimes thin.
Et ego iam praemisi in diuisione, tunc cum dixi uulnera, quod omne ulcus quod non sanatur, neque nascitur in eo caro, non est illud nisi propter unam nouem caussarum.	And I have already mentioned in the division, when I said wounds, that every ulcer which does not heal, nor flesh grows in it, is not that unless for one of nine causes.
Quarum una est, aut propter paucitatem sanguinis in corpore: aut propter maliciam eius: aut quoniam inter ipsum, et super labia eius est caro dura, prohibens natiuitatem carnis: aut quia est multae sordis et sordiciei: aut quoniam ulcus in seipso est putridum, et materia quae mittitur ei est malae qualitatis: aut quoniam medicina est inconueniens in curatione eius: aut quoniam corruptio cadens in regione est genus pestilentiae, aut per proprietatem in regione, sicut accidit in Caesaraugusta: in qua fit difficilis digestio aegritudinum, et tardatur in ea sanatio apostematum per naturam: aut quoniam in eo est os unum, aut numerus ossium.	Of which one is, either because of the lack of blood in the body; or because of its bad quality; or because between it and the edges of it is hard flesh, preventing the growth of flesh; or because of much dirt and grime; or because the ulcer itself is putrid, and the matter which is applied to it is of bad quality; or because the medicine is unsuitable in its treatment; or because corruption prevailing in the region is a type of pestilence, or through a property in the region, as happens in Caesaraugusta, where there is difficult digestion of illnesses, and healing of abscesses is delayed by nature; or because there is one bone, or a number of bones, in it.
Et ego iam ostendi omnes istas caussas et signa earum, et curationes ipsarum cum medicinis in diuisione: et oportet hic ut faciam te scire curationem Fistulae et Zuken, quae fit per uiam operationis cum manu.	And I have already shown all these causes and their signs, and their treatments with remedies in the division; and it is necessary here to let you know the treatment of Fistula and Zuken, which is done by the way of surgery with the hand.
Scias ergo, quod Fistula accidit in omnibus membris corporis.	Know therefore, that Fistula occurs in all members of the body.
Nam ex eis sunt Fistulae quae perueniunt ad uenas magnas et arterias, aut neruos, aut sifac: aut ad intestinum, aut ad uesicam, aut ad aliquam ex costis: aut ad aliquam ex spondilibus dorsi, aut ad aliquam iuncturarum compositarum compositione: sicut manus, et pedis: et ex eis sunt quae uadunt ad propinquitatem membri principalis, et similium.	For among them are Fistulas that reach large veins and arteries, or nerves, or sinews; or to the intestine, or to the bladder, or to any of the ribs; or to any of the vertebrae of the back, or to any of the compound joints, such as hand and foot; and among them are those which go to the proximity of the principal limb and similar ones.
Quae ergo ex his Fistulis est secundum hunc modum, est ex aegritudinibus difficilis sanationis, et non recipit curationem, et occupatio cum ea est labor et ignorantia.	Therefore, which of these Fistulas is of this sort, is from illnesses difficult of healing, and does not receive treatment, and the work with it is labor and ignorance.
Quod si est ex Fistulis aliqua cuius profunditas non peruenit ad haec loca quae dixi: et speras, et confidis in curatione eius, et uis peruenire ad cognitionem illius, tunc accipe tentam ex aere, aut ferro, si Fistula tendit secundum rectitudinem, et perquire eam cum ipsa.	If, however, there is any Fistula among them whose depth does not reach these places which I have mentioned; and you hope and trust in its treatment, and wish to attain knowledge of it, then take a probe of air or iron, if the fistula tends in a straight line, and explore it with it.
Si autem in Fistula est tortuositas, tunc inuestiga eam cum tenta de plumbo subtili.	If, however, there is twisting in the Fistula, then investigate it with a thin lead probe.
Quoniam plumbum cum lenitate sui corporis alleuiatur, et curuatur circa tortuositatem.	Since lead, with the lightness of its body, is eased and bends around the twisting.
Quod si Fistula est habens orificia multa, non est tibi possibile ut significes super eam cum tenta.	If the Fistula has many openings, it is not possible for you to indicate upon it with a probe.
Clisteriza ergo ex eis orificium ex orificiis suis.	Therefore, irrigate it from its openings.
Nam humiditas qua clisterizas ipsum, uadit uersus orificia alia, et currit ex eis.	For the moisture with which you irrigate it goes towards the other openings and runs from them.
Deinde exquisite inquire secundum quem modum est tibi possibile: ut cognoscas quod illic est os, aut neruus, et est Fistulae concauitas longinqua, aut propinqua: aut est Fistula una cui sunt orificia multa, et sta super totum illud, cum summa fortitudinis tuae: cum interrogatione tua, qua interrogas infirmum, et inuentione doloris apud compressionem cum manu tua super locum, et similibus ex significationibus et caussis accidentibus apostemati.	Then inquire carefully in what way it is possible for you to know whether there is a bone or nerve there, and whether the fistula's cavity is distant or close; or whether it is a single fistula with many openings, and stand over the whole of it with all your strength, with your questioning, as you question the sick person, and with the discovery of pain on compression with your hand on the place, and with similar signs and causes of accidents happening to the abscess.
Cum ergo steteris super omnia illa statione uera, tunc uade ad curationem secundum confidentiam: et est, ut consideres tunc, si est Fistula propinqua apparens, aut in loco saluo longinquo a iunctura, aut a neruo, aut arteria, aut uena, aut uno locorum quae dixi tibi: tunc seca Fistulam secundum quod praemissum est ex narratione mea, et aufer quod est in ea ex filtratione, et carnibus corruptis, quod nascitur in orificio eius ex carne, aut thelul, et similibus: et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	When you have thus stood over all that place correctly, then proceed to treatment with confidence, considering if the fistula is a close, visible one, or in a safe place distant from a joint, or from a nerve, or artery, or vein, or one of the places I have told you: then cut the fistula as was previously explained in my account, and remove what is in it by filtration, and the corrupted flesh, that arises in its opening from the flesh or the whelk, and the like: and treat it until it is healed.
Si autem Fistula est longinquae profunditatis, et est secundum rectitudinem: tunc oportet ut seces eam in profundo quantum est tibi possibile.	If, however, the fistula is of distant depth, and is in a straight line, then it is necessary that you cut it in the depth as much as possible.
Deinde mundifica ipsam ex omnibus carnibus eius corruptis.	Then cleanse it from all its corrupted flesh.
Deinde administra licinia inuoluta in medicinis acutis: et intromitte ea usque ad concauitatem Fistulae quam comprehendisti cum ferro: fac cum ea illud aliquotiens, donec corrodat medicina acuta totum quod remansit in concauitate Fistulae ex corruptione.	Then apply strips wrapped in sharp medicines, and introduce them into the cavity of the fistula which you have grasped with the iron. Do this with them repeatedly until the sharp medicine corrodes all that remains in the cavity of the fistula from the corruption.
Deinde restaura ipsam cum unguentis quae generant carnem sanam, donec sanetur.	Then restore it with ointments which generate healthy flesh, until it is healed.
Si uero non sanatur per illud, tunc cauteriza ipsam secundum quod narrauimus.	If, however, it is not healed by that, then cauterize it according to what we have narrated.
Si ergo caussa Fistulae est os, et certificatur apud te illud: tunc inquire ipsum, et seca ipsum secundum quod narraui tibi: si non prohibet te aliquid ex uena, aut neruo, aut membro principali, sicut diximus.	If therefore the cause of the fistula is bone, and it is ascertained by you that it is so, then seek it out, and cut it out according to what I have told you; if nothing from a vein, or nerve, or principal limb hinders you, as we have said.
Si ergo detegitur tibi os, et est in eo quiddam corruptionis, et nigredinis: tunc rade ipsum, donec auferatur corruptio eius tota.	If therefore bone is detected by you, and there is something of corruption and blackness in it, then scrape it until all its corruption is removed.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod incarnat ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with that which causes it to flesh over, until it is healed.
Quod si non sanatur, et emittat pus sicut faciebat: tunc scias, quod tu non peruenisti ad totam eradicationem corruptionis.	If it is not healed, and emits pus as it did before: then know that you have not reached a complete eradication of the corruption.
Detege ergo super illud secundo, et exquisite fac rasionem eius, et mundificationem ipsius cum ultima fortitudine tua.	Therefore, expose it a second time, and thoroughly perform its scraping and cleansing with all your strength.
Deinde restaura ipsum.	Then restore it.
Si ergo sanatur, bonum est: et si non, tunc scias quod illa corruptio est in profunditate longinqua corporis, quam non es consecutus.	If therefore it is healed, it is good; and if not, then know that that corruption is in a deep and distant part of the body, which you have not reached.
Non est ergo tibi in ea ingenium, nisi dimittere ipsam naturae.	Therefore, you have no skill in it, unless you leave it to nature.
Quod si corruptum est os paruum, et est possibile tibi, attrahe ipsum cum forficibus subtilibus quae conueniunt ad illud.	If the small bone is corrupted, and it is possible for you, draw it out with fine forceps suited to it.
Si autem sunt ossa multa, tunc exquisite fac attractionem eorum omnium, neque dimittas ex eis aliquid cum tua fortitudine.	If however there are many bones, then carefully draw them all out, and do not leave any of them behind with your strength.
Si uero contrarietatem facit tibi aliquid ex humiditatibus, et non est in incisione eorum timor, uel error: tunc incide illas humiditates et carnes, si sunt illic, et libera ossa.	If, however, some moisture presents an obstacle, and there is no fear or error in their incision: then cut through those moistures and flesh, if there are any, and free the bones.
Si uero non est tibi praeparatio auferendi ossa ex hora tua, tunc pone super uulnus quod putrefaciat ipsum: et dimitte ipsum, donec putrefiat quod est in circumitu illorum ossium ex carnibus et humiditatibus.	If, however, you have no preparation for removing the bones from your hour, then place over the wound something that will corrupt it, and leave it until that which is around those bones, of flesh and moisture, is corrupted.
Et custodi uulnus ut non consolidetur.	And guard the wound so that it does not heal.
Et constringatur sectio quam tu secuisti in operatione tua.	And constrict the incision that you made in your operation.
Imo pone super ipsum, si times, cotum submersum sulfure trito cum oleo: aut cotum submersum in unguento aegyptio, aut aliquo unguentorum uiridium.	Indeed, place over it, if you fear, a poultice soaked in crushed sulfur mixed with oil, or a poultice soaked in Egyptian unguent, or any green unguents.
Nam quando putrefient illae scilicet humiditates, et separantur ex eis ossa, alleuiatur ablatio eorum, et ipsorum attractio.	For when those moistures, namely, putrefy, and the bones are separated from them, the removal and extraction of them is alleviated.
Si autem est os unum magnum, sicut os cruris, aut os coxae, et similia illis, et quod ex eo corruptum est, est pars magna: tunc rade ipsum rasione ultima, donec auferatur illa nigredo et corruptio.	If, however, there is one large bone, such as the bone of the leg or the bone of the hip, and similar to them, and that which is corrupted from it is a large part: then scrape it with the utmost scraping, until that blackness and corruption are removed.
Deinde restaura uulnus.	Then restore the wound.
Si uero quod est in eo corruptum, est pars magna, et corruptio iam consecuta est medullam ossis, tunc necesse est serrare ipsum, et incidere ipsum totum usque ad locum, ubi peruenit corruptio: tunc cura ipsum, donec consolidetur.	If however the corrupted part within it is large, and the corruption has already reached the marrow of the bone, then it is necessary to saw it and cut it entirely to the place where the corruption has reached; then treat it until it is consolidated.
Et ego narro tibi zuken, quae accidit uiro in crure suo: ut ponas ipsam exemplum et adiutorium super operationem tuam.	And I tell you a case, which happened to a man in his leg: that you might set it as an example and aid in your operation.
Fuit uir iuuenis aetate circiter triginta annos, cui accidit dolor in crure suo, a caussa quae mota est super ipsum intra corpus, id est, ab interioribus, donec peruenerunt materiae ad crus, et apostematum est apostemate magno: et non fuit ei caussa extrinseca.	There was a young man, approximately thirty years of age, upon whom pain arose in his leg, from a cause which arose within his body, that is, from the interior, until the materials reached his leg, and it became a large abscess; and there was no external cause for it.
Extensum est ergo cum eo tempus cum errore medicorum, donec apertum est apostema, et concurrerunt cum eo materiae multae.	Therefore, time passed with him and with the error of the physicians, until the abscess was opened, and many materials gathered together with it.
Et postposita est curatio eius, donec fistulatum est crus, et facta sunt in eo orificia multa: quae omnia emittebant pus, et humiditates corporis.	And his treatment was delayed until his leg became fistulous, and many openings were made in it; which all emitted pus and bodily humors.
Curauit ergo ipsum multitudo medicorum circiter duos annos, et non fuit in eo sapiens in arte manus, donec uocatus sum, et uidi crus eius, et materias quae currebant ex illis orificiis cursu magno: etiam omne uiri corpus iam tabuerat, et color eius citrinus erat.	Therefore, a multitude of physicians treated him for approximately two years, and there was no one skilled in the art of the hand among them, until I was called, and I saw his leg, and the materials flowing from those openings with great force; moreover, the entire body of the man had already decayed, and his complexion was yellow.
Intromisi ergo tentam in uno locorum orificiorum, et peruenit tenta ad os.	I therefore inserted a probe into one of the openings, and the probe reached the bone.
Deinde perscrutatus sum orificia omnia: et inueni ea peruenire ad se inuicem ex omnibus partibus cruris.	Then I examined all the openings, and found them to connect to each other from every part of the leg.
Properaui ergo, et secui super unum illorum orificiorum, donec detexi partem ossis: et inueni ipsum corruptum: quod iam corrosum erat, et denigratum, et putruerat, et perforatum erat, donec penetrauerat usque ad medullam.	I therefore hastened and cut open one of those openings, until I exposed a part of the bone; and I found it corrupted: it was already corroded, and blackened, and decayed, and perforated, until it had penetrated to the marrow.
Serraui ergo quod detectum est mihi, et praeparatum ex osse corrupto.	I therefore removed what was revealed to me, and prepared it from the corrupted bone.
Et deputaui, quod non esset in osse nisi illa corruptio, quam abscidi, et serraui.	And I judged that there was nothing in the bone except that corruption, which I cut away and removed.
Et ego iam eradicaueram eam.	And I had already eradicated it.
Deinde posui restaurationem uulneris cum medicinis consolidatiuis spacio longo.	Then I placed the restoration of the wound with consolidating medicines for a long time.
Et non est consolidatum.	And it was not consolidated.
Deinde tentaui, et detexi super os secundo supra detectionem primam: et inueni corruptionem continuam cum osse: et serraui quod apparuit mihi etiam ex illa corruptione.	Then I tried, and I discovered a second layer above the first layer over the bone: and I found continuous corruption with the bone: and I cut away what appeared to me also from that corruption.
Deinde conatus sum restaurationem eius.	Then I attempted its restoration.
Et non est restauratum.	And it was not restored.
Detexi ergo super ipsum iterum, et non cessaui incidere os particulatim, et conari restaurationem eius: et non est restauratum, donec incidi ex osse circiter palmum unum, et extraxi illud cum medulla sua.	Therefore, I probed it again, and I did not cease to cut the bone piece by piece, and to attempt its restoration: and it was not restored, until I cut away about one palm's width from the bone, and removed it with its marrow.
Deinde restauraui ipsum cum medicinis, et consolidatum est uelociter, et sanatum: et non fuit necessaria haec iteratio in operatione eius, et sectione ipsius, nisi propter dispositionem debilitatis infirmi, et paucitatem tolerantiae eius, et timorem meum super ipsum de morte: quoniam accidebat ei in omnibus horis ex superfluitate euacuationis syncopis mala.	Then I restored it with medicines, and it consolidated quickly, and was healed: and this repetition in its operation, and section, was not necessary, except because of the disposition of the patient's weakness, and his little tolerance, and my fear for him of death: since he was experiencing in every hour, from the excess of evacuation, bad syncopes.
Sanatus est ergo sanatione integra: et nata est in loco ossis caro dura, et bona facta est dispositio in corpore suo, et rediit uirtus eius: et conuersatus est in dispositionibus suis: et non fecit ei contrarietatem in ambulatione nocumentum omnino.	Thus, he was healed with complete healing: and hard flesh grew in the place of the bone, and a good disposition was made in his body, and his strength returned: and he was restored to his former condition: and no harm was done to him in walking at all.
Si autem os eminens in loco corporis iam fractum est: tunc oportet ut serres ipsum, secundum hunc modum: et est: ut accipias ligamentum, et stringe ipsum in extremitate ossis eminentis: et praecipe alicui, qui extendat ipsum ad sursum: et pone ligamentum aliud ex lana grossius ligamento primo.	If however a prominent bone in a previously fractured part of the body is present, then it is necessary to saw it, according to this method: and it is so that you take a ligature, and tighten it on the end of the prominent bone; and instruct someone to extend it upward; and place another thicker wool ligature over the first ligature.
Deinde liga ipsum super carne, quae est suh osse: et extende extremitatem eius, ut trahas carnem ad inferiora: et tu detegis carnem super locum quem uis serrare, ut non laedat Serra carnem.	Then bind it over the flesh which is under the bone: and extend its extremity, so that you pull the flesh downwards: and you uncover the flesh over the place you wish to saw, so that the saw does not injure the flesh.
Pone lignum, aut tabulam sub osse inferius decenter: quoniam quando facis illud, non prohibetur quin secet carnem corruptam.	Place wood, or a plank, under the bone properly below: because when you do that, it is not prevented from cutting the corrupted flesh.
Et oportet ut sit Serratura super locum corruptum parumper, ut non sit in concauitate ossis corruptio: et non appareat in apparitione sua sensui, et cogat ad Serraturam sui uice alia.	And it is necessary that the sawing be over the corrupted place for a short time, so that there is no corruption in the concavity of the bone: and it does not appear in its appearance to the senses, and compels another sawing in its place.
Quod si os est corruptum, et non est eminens, imo continuatur pars eius cum parte: et corruptio est in medio eius, aut in parte ipsius: tunc detege carnem ab omnibus partibus totam.	If the bone is corrupted, and is not prominent, but rather its part is continuous with another part, and the corruption is in its middle or in a part of it, then uncover the flesh from all sides completely.
Deinde pone lignum inferius.	Then place wood underneath.
Postea serra illud ex parte prima, ubi est corruptio, donec continuetur Serratura ex parte altera: et sit Serratura secundum longitudinem a corruptione parumper, secundum quod diximus.	Then saw it from the first part, where the corruption is, until the sawing is continued on the other part: and let the sawing be along the length from the corruption for a short distance, as we have said.
Quod si corruptio est in iunctura, incide ipsam iuncturam corruptam, et serra os ubi continuatur ex parte altera.	If the corruption is in the joint, cut the corrupted joint itself, and saw the bone where it continues on the other part.
Si uero corruptio est in continuatione duarum iuncturarum, tunc non est in ea ingenium nisi abrasio.	If, however, the corruption is in the continuation of two joints, then there is no cleverness in it but only abrasion.
Quod si corruptio est in pectine manus, aut in pectine pedis: tunc res in eo est difficilis ualde.	If the corruption is in the hand's or foot's hinge, then the matter is very difficult.
Verum oportet, ut inquiras corruptionem qualiter appareat tibi.	But you must inquire how the corruption appears to you.
Et abradas eam, et mundes ipsam secundum quamcunque dispositionem tibi possibile est, et cum quocunque ingenio rectificatur tibi: quando non facit tibi contrarietatem Vena, aut Neruus.	And abrade it, and cleanse it according to whatever arrangement is possible for you, and with whatever cleverness it is rectified for you, when the vein or nerve does not create opposition for you.
Et scias quod incisoria, et Serrae ad incidendum ista ossa sunt multa, secundum situm ossium, et praparationem eorum, et ipsorum grossitudinem, et subtilitatem eorum, et magnitudinem, et paruitatem ipsorum, et duriciem ipsorum, et eorum raritatem.	And know that there are many incisions and saws for cutting these bones, according to the position of the bones, and their preparation, and their thickness and thinness, and their size and smallness, and their hardness and their rarity.
Quapropter oportet, ut praepares omni speciei operationis instrumentum conueniens ad illam operationem.	Therefore, it is necessary to prepare a suitable instrument for every kind of operation.
Et scias, quod operationes istae significant tibi super speciem instrumenti quo indiges, quando tecum est studium longum.	And know that these operations indicate to you the kind of instrument you need, when you have a long study with you.
Et cognitio modorum huius artis, testimonium modorum aegritudinum: tunc enim iam inuenies per teipsum illud quod conuenit ei ex instrumentis ad omnem infirmitatem.	And knowledge of the methods of this art is a testament to the methods of illnesses: for then you will find within yourself that which suits it from the instruments for every infirmity.
Et ego sum firmans tibi in ultimo huius capituli numerum instrumentorum, quae pones exempla super quae incides, et probationem qua experiaris super alia.	And I am showing you in the final part of this chapter the number of instruments, which you will set as examples for those you cut and the proof with which you will test others.
Forma Serrae.	Saw shape.
Forma alterius Serrae.	Shape of another saw.
Forma Serrae alterius.	Shape of another saw.
Forma Serrae alterius.	Shape of another saw.
Haec forma Serrae depicta, sit decenter facta.	This saw shape depicted, let it be done properly.
Fiat arcus eius superior, acuitas eius ex ferro: et manubrium eius ex buxo, et sit pyramidale decenter factum.	Let its upper arch be sharp from iron; and its handle from boxwood, and let it be a pyramidally well-made one.
Forma Rasorii iuncturarum.	Shape of the connections of the razor.
Sit caput huius Rasorii, secundum formam capitis claui stellati: et puncta eius sint secundum formam punctorum elischetfegi.	Let the head of this razor be, according to the form of the head of a star-shaped nail; and its points be according to the form of the points of a flint-scraper.
Et non conuenit, nisi ut fricentur cum eo capita iuncturarum, quando corrumpuntur, aut os amplum, et magnum est.	And it is not suitable, unless the heads of the joints are rubbed with it, when they are damaged, or the bone is large and prominent.
Forma maioris Rasorii.	Form of the larger razor.
Forma medii Rasorii.	Form of the middle razor.
Forma Rasorii lati.	Form of the broad razor.
Forma Rasorii in quo est concauitas.	Form of the razor in which there is a concavity.
Forma Rasorii alterius subtilis.	Form of another slender razor.
Forma Rasorii alterius curuatae extremitatis.	Form of another razor with a curved end.
Forma Rasorii parui, subtilis tentae.	Form of a small, slender, taut razor.
Forma Rasorii cum quo inciduntur ossa.	Form of the razor with which bones are cut.
Forma etiam Rasorii magni.	Form also of a large razor.
Hoc similatur Radio, et extremitas est sicut Serra: exhibetur in locis multis ex rasione ossium.	This is similar to a saw, and its end is like a saw; it is shown in many places for the cutting of bones.
Forma Rasorii quod conuenit ad rasionem eius quod perforatum est ex ossibus.	Form of a razor suitable for cutting that which is perforated in bones.
Extremitas eius triangula, acutarum est extremitatum.	Its tip is triangular, with sharp edges.
Fit ex Indi.	It is made of Indian steel.
Et similiter oportet, ut fiant omnia quae diximus ex Rasoriis, et Incisoriis, et Serris.	And similarly, all that we have said about razors, and knives, and saws should be done.
¶ De incisione extremitatum, et Serratura ossium.	On the incision of extremities and the sawing of bones.
Caput LXXXIX.	Chapter LXXXIX.
Putrefiunt extremitates, aut ex caussa extrinseca, aut intrinseca.	Extremities putrefy, either from an external or internal cause.
Cum ergo medicatus fueris illam corruptionem curatione medicinarum, et non confert curatio: et uides corruptionem incidere in membrum, quam non repercutit aliquid: tunc oportet ut incidas illud membrum usque ubi consequitu corruptio, ut euadat infirmus per illud a morte, aut a malicia quae est maior defectu membri.	Therefore, if you have treated that corruption with medicinal cures, and the treatment does not help; and you see the corruption spreading to the limb, which nothing else repels; then it is necessary to cut off that limb, up to where the corruption reaches, so that it escapes from death or from the greater harm caused by the lack of the limb.
Et signum cui accidit illud est, quod denigratur membrum, donec putetur: quod ignis combussit ipsum, aut putrefit post nigredinem: donec inciditur illa putredo usque ad illud quod sequitur illud membrum, et serpit in totum corpus.	And the sign of this happening is that the limb darkens until it rots; that fire has burned it, or it rots after darkening; until that rot is cut away down to what follows that limb, and spreads throughout the entire body.
Propera ergo cum incisione eius, et similiter si caussa corruptionis est a percussione quorundam uenenosorum: sicut scorpionis marini, et uiperae, et rutellae, et similium.	Therefore, hurry with its incision, and similarly if the cause of the corruption is from the sting of certain venomous creatures, such as the sea scorpion, and viper, and adder, and similar ones.
Si ergo corruptio, aut percussio est in extremitate digiti, tunc incide digitum, et non des spacium corruptioni, ut incedat usque ad reliquam manum.	If, therefore, the corruption, or injury, is in the extremity of the finger, then cut off the finger, and do not give space to the corruption to spread to the rest of the hand.
Et similiter si accidit in manu, tunc incide eam ex radice focilis, et non des spacium corruptioni, donec capiat in focili brachii.	And similarly, if it happens in the hand, then cut it off at the root of the forearm, and do not give space to the corruption until it reaches the forearm.
Et si inuadit in eo, tunc incide brachium apud cubitum in iunctura sua.	And if it invades it, then cut off the arm at the elbow at its joint.
Si autem pertransit corruptio, et uides eum circiter cubitum: tunc in illo est mors infirmi.	If however the corruption passes, and you see it about the elbow, then in that is the death of the infirm.
Et administrare praeter illud ex curatione, est quantitas uirtus.	And to administer beyond that from a cure, is the amount of virtue.
Et similiter fac de pede, quando inuadit corruptio in digito, tunc incide ipsum apud unum nodorum: et si capit in pectine pedis, tunc incide pedem totum.	And similarly do with the foot, when corruption invades the toe, then cut it off at one of the joints; and if it reaches the foot's instep, then cut off the entire foot.
Si autem ascendit ad genu, tunc incide crus apud iuncturam genu.	If however it ascends to the knee, then cut off the leg at the knee joint.
Quod si corruptio iam peruenit supra genu, tunc non est in ea ingenium, nisi dimissio, et relinquere infirmum morti.	If however the corruption has already reached above the knee, then there is no skill in it, except for dismissal, and leaving the infirm to death.
Et modus incidendi membrum, aut serrandi ipsum est, ut stringas ligamentum in inferiori, quem uis incidere: et stringe ligamentum aliud supra locum.	And the method of cutting off a limb, or sawing it, is that you should tighten the ligament below the one you wish to cut: and tighten another ligament above the spot.
Et extendat minister ligamentum unum ad inferiora: et extendat minister aliud ligamentum superius ad sursum.	And let the assistant extend one ligament downwards, and let the other assistant extend the ligament upwards.
Et tu separa carnem quae est inter duo ligamenta, cum Spatumili lato, donec detegatur caro tota.	And you shall separate the flesh that is between the two ligaments, with a broad spatula, until all the flesh is exposed.
Deinde incidatur, aut serretur.	Then it shall be cut, or sawn.
Et oportet, ut ponas ab omnibus partibus pannum lini, et non tangat Serra locum sanum: et accidat infirmo laesio addita, et apostema calidum.	And it is necessary to place linen cloths on all sides, and let the saw not touch the healthy area: and let the patient suffer no further injury, and a hot abscess.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis interius dum operaris, tunc cauteriza locum uelociter: aut pone super ipsum quosdam pulueres abscindentes sanguinem.	If, however, an internal flow of blood occurs during your work, then cauterize the area quickly, or place upon it certain powders that staunch the blood.
Deinde redi ad medicationem tuam, donec compleatur.	Then return to your treatment, until it is completed.
Deinde liga membrum uulneratum cum ligamento conueniente ei, et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then bind the wounded limb with a suitable bandage, and treat it until it is healed.
Et ego narro tibi quod accidit uiro in pede suo, hoc idem accidens quod narro tibi.	And I tell you what happened to a man in his foot, the same accident that I am telling you about.
Quod est, quia accidit in pede suo nigredo, cum adustione quae assimilatur combustioni ignis: et corruptio illa in primis accidit in digito suo, donec coepit pedem totum.	That is because it happened in his foot with a blackness, like a burning that is similar to the burning of fire: and that corruption first happened in his toe, until it began the whole foot.
Properauit ergo uir ex seipso, postquam uidit corruptionem incidere in membro cum uehementia eius, quod inuenit ex dolore, et adustione eius: et incidit ipsum apud iuncturam, et sanatus est.	Therefore, the man hastened himself, after seeing the corruption descend upon his limb with its violence, which he found from its pain and burning: and it struck him at the joint, and he was healed.
Et postquam praeteriit ei tempus longum, accidit ei illa eadem corruptio in digito manus suae indice.	And after a long time passed, the same corruption happened to him in the index finger of his hand.
Venit ergo ad me, et conatus sum recuperare illam superfluitatem cum eo quod posui super manum ex medicinis post mundificationem corporis eius: et non repercussa est superfluitas, et coepit incedere in digitum alium: donec coepit coruptio in manum.	So he came to me, and I tried to recover that superfluity with what I placed on his hand from medicines after purifying his body: and the superfluity was not repelled, and it began to proceed to another finger: until the corruption began in his hand.
Vocauit ergo me, ad incidendum manum eius: et nolui illud, sperans ex me super repercussionem illius superfluitatis: et timui etiam super ipsum apud incisionem manus eius mortem.	Therefore, he called me to cut his hand: and I did not want that, hoping in myself concerning the repulsion of that superfluity: and I also feared for him death at the cutting of his hand.
Quoniam uirtus uiri erat super casum.	Because the man's strength was over the case.
Postquam ergo desperauit de me, reuersus est ad terram suam: et peruenit ad me de eo, quia properauit, et incidit manum suam totam: et sanatus est.	After he despaired of me, he returned to his land: and it reached me concerning him, that he hastened, and cut his whole hand: and he was healed.
Et non attuli hanc narrationem, nisi ut sit adiutorium super illud quod cadit de genere huius aegritudinis: et ut sit significatio qua significetur, et secundum quam agatur.	And I have not brought forth this account, unless that it be a help concerning that which falls under this sort of sickness: and that it be a signification by which it is signified, and according to which it is done.
¶ De cura Sinuum, et qualitate clisterizationis cum medicinis.	Concerning the treatment of sinuses, and the quality of clysterization with medicines.
Caput XC.	Chapter 90.
Quando accidit apostema in quibusdam membris carnosis, et prolongatur spacium apostematis, donec collectionem facit saniei: deinde rumpitur, aut perforatur, et egreditur quod in eo est ex sanie, et remanet locus uacuus quasi sit uas: et cutis quae est super ipsum sicut pannus qui iam subtiliatus est: et non peruenit ad ultimum in corruptione sua, neque imprimit in os, neque in neruum, neque in ligamentum: meretur ut nominetur Sinus: et non nominatur Fistula: uerumtamen si prolongatur spacium eius, donec imprimat corruptio in aliquid horum membrorum, tunc nominatur Fistula, aut zuken.	When an abscess occurs in certain fleshy limbs, and the space of the abscess is prolonged until it collects pus: then it bursts, or is pierced, and what is within it of pus emerges, and a hollow place remains, as if it were a vessel: and the skin over it is like a cloth which has already become thin: and it does not reach the ultimate stage of corruption, nor does it impinge on the bone, nor on the nerve, nor on the ligament: it deserves to be called a Sinus: and it is not called a Fistula: but nevertheless, if its space is prolonged until the corruption impinges on any of these members, then it is called a Fistula, or zuken.
Et cura eius est, ut incidas illam cutem totam sicut reuoluitur: et praecipue quando subtiliata est, et facta sicut pannus: et confidis quia non aaehaeret cum loco, propter corruptionem suam.	And its treatment is to cut away that entire skin as it is turned back; and especially when it is thin and made like a cloth: and you trust that it does not adhere to the place, because of its corruption.
Si autem speras quod adhaereat cutis, et non consequitur ex eo corruptio illa ultima consecutione: et si in cute est spissitudo ex carne, tunc cura ipsum cum Clisteri: et est, ut consideres ad Sinum.	However, if you hope that the skin adheres, and that corruption does not result from that ultimate adhesion; and if there is a thickness of flesh in the skin, then treat it with a clyster; and it is that you should consider it as a Sinus.
Tunc si est magnus, et pus quod emittitur ex eo est foetidi odoris: tunc clisteriza ipsum cum medicamine aegyptio, quod est aceti, et olei, et ziniar, partes recipiens aequales, aggregentur in uase: et decoquantur super ignem, donec rubeat medicamen: et ueniat in spissitudinem mellis.	Then, if it is large, and the pus that emerges from it has a foul odor, then clysterize it with Egyptian medicine, which is vinegar, and oil, and ziniar, taking equal parts, to be mixed in a vessel: and let them be boiled over the fire until the medicine turns red: and it comes to the thickness of honey.
Deinde accipe ex eo quod tibi necesse est: et dissolue ipsum cum aqua et melle, et clisteriza cum eo Sinum: et stringe orificium eius, et dimitte medicinam in eo ad quantitatem duarum horarum.	Then take from that what you need: and dissolve it with water and honey, and clysterize the Sinus with it: and tighten its opening, and leave the medicine in it for a quantity of two hours.
Deinde extrahe ipsum cum expressione: fac illud diebus tot, donec mundificetur Sinus, et remoueatur foetor.	Then extract it with pressure; do this for so many days, until the sinus is cleansed, and the foul odor is removed.
Et quandoque clisterizatur cum aqua cineris, quando non est tibi praesens hoc medicamen: et est, ut accipias cinerem lignorum uitis, aut cinerem ex lignis ilicis: et proiicias super eam aquam.	And sometimes it is clysterized with ash water, when this medicine is not present to you; and it is so that you should take the ash of vine wood, or the ash from the wood of the holly: and pour water over it.
Deinde cola eam, et clisteriza cum ea, donec confidas quod Sinus iam ablutus est.	Then strain it, and clysterize with it, until you are confident that the sinus is now cleansed.
Quod si infirmo non est tolerantia super medicamen aegyptium, neque aquam cineris, tunc clisteriza ipsum cum aqua et melle, cui iam permixtum est aliquid ex ziniar contrito.	If the patient does not tolerate the Egyptian medicine, nor the ash water, then clysterize him with water and honey, to which some crushed ziniar has already been mixed.
Aut clisteriza ipsum cum melle et uino permixtis, quoniam de proprietate mellis est, ut mundificet, et abluat: et uinum facit adhaerere Sinum, praecipue quando in uino est superfluitas stipticitatis et siccitatis.	Or clysterize him with mixed honey and wine, because of the property of honey to cleanse and wash away; and wine makes the sinus adhere, especially when there is an excess of astringency and dryness in the wine.
Cum facis illud aliquotiens, et confidis quod Sinus corruptio iam remota est: tunc clisteriza ipsum cum eo quod facit nasci carnem in eo.	When you have done this several times, and are confident that the corruption of the sinus is now removed, then clysterize him with that which causes flesh to grow in it.
Et est, ut accipias ex emplastro dyafinicon: et dissoluas ipsum cum oleo rosato, et uino stiptico: aut clisteriza ipsum cum quibusdam medicinis, et unguentis aliis, quorum proprietates scripsi in tractatu unguentorum.	And it is, that you take from the diafinicon plaster, and dissolve it with rose oil and astringent wine; or clysterize him with certain medicines and other ointments, whose properties I have written in the treatise on ointments.
Quod si orificium Sinus est strictum, in quo non capit cannula clisteris: tunc amplifica ipsum cum ferro parumper: aut pone in ipso licinium inuolutum in unguento aegyptio, aut in unguento basilicon, donec amplificetur.	If the sinus opening is narrow, in which the clyster tube does not fit, then enlarge it a little with iron; or place on it linen wrapped in Egyptian ointment, or in basilicon ointment, until it is enlarged.
Et similiter si est orificium etiam amplum, tunc aggrega labia eius cum sutura: et dimitte ex eo quantitatem in quam ingrediatur clistere sine additione.	And similarly if the opening is also wide, then gather its lips together with sutures, and leave in it a quantity into which the clyster can enter without addition.
Et similiter si orificium eius ex quo currit pus, est eleuatum ad superiora: tunc seca ipsum in depressiori loco qui est in ipso, ut currat ex eo pus usque inferius: quoniam pus quando coartatur in profunditate Sinus, prohibet carnem generari in eo.	And similarly, if the opening from which pus flows is elevated upwards, then cut it in the lower place within it, so that the pus flows downwards; because when pus is constricted in the depth of the sinus, it prevents flesh from growing in it.
Quod si non est tibi possibile secare Sinum circiter inferius eius secundum quod uis: tunc conare, ut praepares membrum praeparatione qua currat ex eo pus cum facilitate secundum quod praeparatur tibi.	If it is not possible for you to cut the sinus approximately below it as you wish, then try to prepare the limb in a way that the pus flows from it easily, as is prepared for you.
Conare, ut non retineatur in eo aliquid ex pus omnino: et accipe medicinas consolidatiuas quae ponuntur super signum, conuenientes ad illud quod uis.	Try that nothing of the pus is retained in it at all, and take consolidating medicines which are placed upon a sign, suitable for what you wish.
Et extende eas super pannum lini.	And spread them over a linen cloth.
Et sit pannus tantae quantitatis, qua fiat communicatio totius Sinus.	And let the cloth be of such a size that the whole sinus is covered.
Deinde incide cum forficibus in directo orificii Sinus foramen, amplius orificio Sinus parumper.	Then cut with scissors in the direction of the sinus opening a hole, a little larger than the sinus opening.
Deinde extende ex unguentis lenibus super pannum alium, secundum quantitatem foraminis: et pone eum super ipsum positione longinqua ab orificio Sinus, ut alleuietur exitus pus ex eo: et non auferas pannum magnum, nisi post dies aliquos uice una.	Then spread some gentle ointments onto another cloth, according to the size of the hole, and place it over it, some distance away from the sinus opening, so that the pus may more easily exit from it; and do not remove the large cloth, except after a few days, at once.
Ille autem qui est super orificium Sinus, est ille quem remoues in omni hora, ut egrediatur quod aggregatur in eo ex pus: et ut scias, an illud quod currit ex eo uirus, est multum, aut parum: aut digestum, aut indigestum.	However, the one over the sinus opening is the one you remove every hour, so that what collects in it from the pus may exit: and so that you may know whether the fluid running from it is much, or little; or digested, or undigested.
Et cum hoc iterum considera locum Sinus ipsius, an in ipso sentiat dominus eius dolorem, aut non sit in eo dolor, et an sit in eo apostema, aut non sit in eo apostema.	And with this, again consider the location of the sinus itself, whether the patient feels pain in it, or there is no pain, and whether there is an abscess in it, or not.
Cum ergo protenditur medicatio tua taliter, et uides materiam quae egreditur super orificium Sinus, tunc scias, quod Sinus iam adhaeret, aut approximat adhaerentiae: tunc ergo solue ipsum in mane, aut in tertio die: et quando soluis uulnus, tunc permuta pannum alium, et renoua unguentum.	When therefore your treatment is thus prolonged, and you see the material that exits over the sinus opening, then know that the sinus is now adhering, or approaching adhesion; then, therefore, loosen it in the morning, or on the third day; and when you loosen the wound, then change the cloth, and renew the ointment.
Si autem egreditur ex Sinu post spacium longum uirus subtile, tunc non desperes de adhaerentia eius, nam sanatio eius appropinquat, quoniam ex hominibus sunt qui tardant generationem carnis in uulneribus suis, et ex eis sunt qui agunt econtrario illius.	However, if after a long period a thin fluid exits from the sinus, then do not despair of its adhesion, for its healing is approaching, since there are people whose flesh generation in their wounds is slow, and there are others who act the opposite of that.
Si autem egreditur ex Sinu post dies multos pus indigestum, tunc scias quod sinus non adhaeret.	If, however, undigested pus exits from the sinus after many days, then know that the sinus does not adhere.
Si ergo tardatur adhaerentia Sinus, et prolongatur res eius: tunc adde in exiccatione medicinarum, uerum faciant medici, ut sint medicinae in substantia sua humidae, et in uirtute sua siccae: sicut unguentum dyafinicon, quando additur in eo superfluitas additionis ex zegi.	If therefore the adhesion of the sinus is delayed and its condition prolonged, then add to the drying medicines, but let the physicians see to it that the medicines are moist in their substance and dry in their potency; such as the unguentum dyafinicon, when added to it, the superfluous addition of zegi.
Et ex magis ultimo quo curatur, est, ut accipias unguentum dyafinicon, et soluatur cum oleo rosato, et roretur super ipsum uinum antiquum aequale in substantia sua.	And of the last remedies used for its treatment, it is that you should take the unguentum dyafinicon and dissolve it with rose oil, and sprinkle over it old wine equal in its substance.
Deinde confice ipsum cum eo, et utere ipso.	Then mix it with that, and use it.
Et iam facit simile huic actioni, quando non est tibi praesens unguentum dyafinicon, mel, quando decoquis ipsum, donec ingrossetur, et uteris eo.	And it does a similar action to this, when the unguentum dyafinicon is not present for you, honey, when you boil it until it thickens, and use it.
Aut accipe myrrham, et aloen, et olibanum: tere totum, et pulueriza illud super mel dum est super ignem.	Or take myrrh and aloes and frankincense: grind all of it and powder it over the honey while it is on the fire.
Deinde line super ipsum pannum, et stringe ipsum super Sinum: et line cum melle quod decoquisti, donec ingrossatum est: et pulueriza super ipsum species, et pone super ipsum pannum, et stringe eum.	Then line a cloth over it and tie it over the sinus: and line it with the honey that you boiled until it thickened: and powder spices over it, and place it over the cloth, and tie it.
Et quandoque administratur in illo aristolochia longa, et radices lilii coelestis, et est lilium: et farina herbi, et centaurea.	And sometimes long birthwort and the roots of the celestial lily, and the lily, and the herb's flour, and centaury are administered in it.
Utere eis simplicibus, aut aggregatis, tere ea, et cribella ipsa: et pulueriza super mel quod narraui, et utere eo.	Use them, simple or aggregated, grind them and sift them: and powder them over the honey I mentioned, and use it.
Quod si prolongatur res Sinus, et non sanatur hac curatione: tunc scias, quod in profundo eius est corruptio: aut iam facit impressionem in ossibus, aut in reliquis membris duris, aut ligamentis: tunc cura ipsum curatione Fistularum, secundum quod praemissum est.	If the sinus persists and is not healed by this treatment, then know that there is corruption deep within it; or it is already making an impression on the bones, or on other hard members, or ligaments: then treat it with the treatment for Fistulae, as was previously stated.
¶ De cura Panaritii et unguis attritae, et incisione digiti additi, et sectione.	Concerning the treatment of whitlow and a worn nail, and the incision of a swollen finger, and section.
Caput XCI.	Chapter XCI.
Panaritium est apostema quod nascitur sub ungue pollicis manus, aut pedis: et fortasse nascitur in reliquis digitis.	A whitlow is an abscess which arises under the nail of the thumb of the hand or foot, and perhaps arises in the other fingers.
Cum ergo prolongatur res eius, et negligitur curato eius, et apostematur apostemate calido: aut corrumpitur, et emittit pus, donec corrodit radicem unguis: et fortasse corrumpit eam totam, et fortasse peruenit corruptio ad os, donec est ei odor foetidus: et fit extremitas digiti lata, et fit color eius fuscus.	Therefore, when its condition prolongs, and its treatment is neglected, and the abscess becomes a hot abscess, or it is corrupted and emits pus until it corrodes the root of the nail, and perhaps it corrupts the whole nail, and perhaps the corruption reaches the bone, until it has a foul odour, and the end of the finger becomes broad, and its colour becomes dark.
Quando ergo tu curas ipsum, cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio tua: tunc oportet ut incidas cum ferro totam superfluitatem quae remansit ex ungue.	Therefore, when you treat it, according to what we have said before, and your treatment does not help, then it is necessary to cut away with an iron instrument all the excess remaining from the nail.
Deinde cauteriza uulnus post illud.	Then cauterize the wound after that.
Cauterium enim iuuatiuum est ualde.	For the cautery is very helpful.
Si uero os est sanum, et est unguis etiam sana, et additiones uacuae unguis iam comprimunt carnem ad interiora, et incipiunt pungere ipsam, et laedunt eam: tunc oportet ut ponas Radium subtilem sub angulo unguis quae pungit carnem, et impelle eam sursum: et incide eam carnem cum facilitate, et pone super illud quod remanet de carne ex medicinis comburentibus, corrosiuis, donec remoueatur totum eius.	However, if the bone is sound, and the nail is also healthy, and the unnecessary additions of the nail are now pressing the flesh inwards, and begin to prick it and injure it, then it is necessary to place a thin blade under the corner of the nail that pricks the flesh, and drive it upwards, and cut the flesh easily, and place upon what remains of the flesh burning, corrosive medicines, until the whole of it is removed.
Deinde cura illud cum unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with ointments until it is healed.
Si autem corruptio iam imprimit in os, tunc oportet ut incidas illud os, et extrahas ipsum: non enim sanatur unquam dum permanet in eo os corruptum.	If, however, corruption has already taken hold of the bone, then it is necessary to cut that bone and remove it: for it will never be healed while corrupt bone remains in it.
Quod si uides corrosionem et corruptionem incedere in digitum, tunc incide eum in uno nodorum, secundum quod praemissa est eius rememoratio.	If you see corrosion and decay entering the finger, then cut it at one of its joints, according to the prior description of it.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then treat it until it is healed.
Si autem accidat ungui attritio, aut percussio: et contingit in ea dolor uehemens, tunc oportet ut phlebotomes infirmum in primis.	If, however, the nail suffers attrition or a blow, and severe pain results, then it is necessary to first bleed the afflicted person.
Deinde seca unguem cum Spatumili acuto sectione transuersa de sursum ad uisum.	Then cut the nail with a sharp spatula, making a transverse cut from above to below.
Et custodi, ne sectio perueniat ad carnem quae est sub ungue, nam tu facies accidere per illud super infirmum dolorem uehementem, et erit caussa ad natiuitatem carnis additae in loco.	And be careful that the cut does not reach the flesh beneath the nail, for you will cause great pain to the sufferer, and it will be the cause of the birth of additional flesh in that place.
Deinde cura locum cum eo quod sedat dolores.	Then treat the area with something that relieves pain.
Digitus uero additus qui nascitur in quibusdam manibus hominum, fortasse est carnosus totus: et fortasse sunt in quibusdam eorum ossa, et fortasse est in eo unguis: et quidam eorum nascitur in radice iuncturae, aut est natiuitas eius in quibusdam nodis digiti.	The extra finger that is born in some people's hands is perhaps entirely fleshy; and perhaps some have bones in them, and perhaps there is a nail on it; and some of them are born at the joint's root, or its birth is in some of the finger's knots.
Ille ergo qui nascitur in quibusdam nodis digiti, non mouetur: et ille qui nascitur apud iuncturam digiti, fortasse mouetur.	Therefore, the one that is born in some of the finger's knots does not move; and the one that is born near the finger's joint, perhaps moves.
Eius ergo qui ex eis est carnosus, sectio eius facilis est.	Therefore, the one that is fleshy among them, its incision is easy.
Quod est, ut incidas ipsum apud radicem suam cum Spatumili lato.	That is, to cut it at its root with a wide scalpel.
Eius autem cuius natiuitas est in radice iuncturae curatio, est difficilis.	However, the treatment of the one whose birth is at the root of the joint is difficult.
Abstine ergo ab incisione eius.	Therefore, abstain from its incision.
In illo uero qui nascitur in digito apud ultimum nodorum, tunc oportet ut incidas in primis carnem eius incisione rotunda usque ad os.	In that one which is born on the finger at the last of the nodes, then it is necessary to cut first its flesh in a circular incision, up to the bone.
Deinde serra os cum una illarum Serrarum conuenientium ad illud.	Then saw the bone with one of those saws suitable for it.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then treat it until it is healed.
Consolidatio autem quae accidit digitis adinuicem, multotiens accidit aut ex natiuitate hominis, id est, nascitur cum eo, aut a consolidatione uulneris, aut combustione ignis, et similibus.	The consolidation that occurs between fingers often happens either from the man's birth, that is, he is born with it, or from the consolidation of a wound, or from burning by fire, and similar things.
Oportet ergo ut seces illam consolidationem, donec redeant digiti secundum formam suam naturalem.	Therefore, it is necessary to separate that consolidation, until the fingers return to their natural form.
Deinde pone inter eos licinia, aut pannos infusos in oleo rosato: ut non consolidentur uelociter, et separa inter eos: aut pone inter eos laminam plumbi subtilem, donec consolidetur locus secundum quod oportet.	Then place between them linen bandages, or cloths soaked in rose oil, so that they do not consolidate quickly, and separate them; or place a thin sheet of lead between them until the place is consolidated as it ought to be.
Et similiter si accidat consolidatio quibusdam digitis cum palma, tunc seca illam consolidationem, secundum quod praeparatur et conuenit figurae membri.	And similarly, if consolidation occurs between certain fingers and the palm, then cut that consolidation, according to what is prepared and appropriate for the shape of the limb.
¶ De incisione Vitium.	Concerning the incision of a defect.
Caput XCII.	Chapter Ninety-Two.
Uites sunt Venae inuolutae, grossae, plenae superfluitatibus melancholicis quae accidunt in pluribus membris corporis: et plurimum euentus earum est in cruribus, praecipue in cruribus iter agentium et laborantium, et portantium.	Ulcers are veins enveloped, thick, full of melancholic humors which occur in many members of the body; and their effect is most often in the legs, especially in the legs of those who travel and work, and those who carry heavy loads.
Oportet ergo ut administres excussionem corporis ex cholera nigra aliquotiens excussione forti.	Therefore, it is necessary that you administer a purging of the body of black bile sometimes with a strong purge.
Deinde phlebotoma patientis eas basilicam.	Then, phlebotomize the patient's arm.
Curatio uero earum cum ferro, est secundum duos modos.	The treatment of them with iron is according to two methods.
Vnus eorum est, ut secentur, et extrahatur sanguis niger.	One of them is that they be cut, and the black blood be extracted.
Et modus alter est, ut eleuetur Vena, et extrahatur tota.	And the other method is that the vein be raised, and the whole of it be extracted.
Sectio uero eius est secundum hunc modum.	However, the cutting of it is according to this method.
Embroca crus in primis cum aqua calida multum, donec resoluatur sanguis grossus faeculentus.	First, bathe the leg thoroughly with warm water, until the thick, foul blood is dissolved.
Deinde stringe crus infirmi a superiori parte coxae eius, usque ad inferiorem partem genu cum uitta.	Then bind the patient's leg from the upper part of the thigh, down to the lower part of the knee with a bandage.
Deinde seca uenam in loco uno, aut duobus, aut tribus sectione ampla.	Then cut the vein in one, or two, or three places with a wide incision.
Deinde eleua, id est, extrahe sanguinem in manu tua ab inferiori parte cruris, usque ad sursum, et a superiori oportet ut phlebotomes infirmum in primis.	Then elevate, that is, draw the blood in your hand from the lower part of the leg, upwards, and the physician should first bleed the patient from the upper part.
Deinde seca unguem cum usque inferius: donec egrediatur ex sanguine quantitas quam uides sufficere, et quam tolerat uirtus infirmi.	Then cut the nail downward until a quantity of blood emerges which you see as sufficient and which the patient's strength can tolerate.
Postea liga eam: et praecipe ei, ut abstineat a cibis generantibus choleram nigram: et itera euacuationem et phlebotomiam, quando implentur Venae, et nocet illud infirmo.	Afterwards, tie it off; and instruct him to abstain from foods that generate black bile; and repeat the evacuation and bloodletting when the veins are full and it harms the patient.
Eleuatio autem eius est secundum hunc modum.	The elevation of it is in this manner.
Rade crus infirmi, si in ea sunt pili multi.	Shave the leg of the patient if there are many hairs on it.
Deinde intromitte ipsum in balneum: aut embroca ipsum in crure eius cum aqua calida, donec rubeat, et exuberentur Venae: aut exercitetur exercitio forti, si non est ei praesens balneum, donec calefiat membrum.	Then immerse him in a bath; or embrocate his leg with hot water until it turns red and the veins swell; or have him exercise vigorously if a bath is not available until the limb warms up.
Deinde seca cutem in directo uenae sectione per longitudinem: aut in ultimo eius apud genu, aut in inferiori parte eius apud calcaneum.	Then cut the skin along the vein's course, either at its end near the knee, or at its lower part near the heel.
Deinde aperi cutem cum uncinis, et excoria uenam ab omni parte, donec appareat sensui: et est apud apparitionem eius, quod uides eam rubeam ad nigredinem decliuem.	Then open the skin with hooks, and scrape the vein from all sides until it is visible; and at its appearance, you will see it sloping from red to black.
Cum ergo uadit ex cute, uides eam albam quasi sit chorda.	When it emerges from the skin, you will see it white like a string.
Deinde intromitte sub ea Radium, donec quando eleuatur et egreditur de cute: suspende eam cum uncino caeco, leni.	Then introduce a probe beneath it until it rises and emerges from the skin; suspend it with a blunt, gentle hook.
Deinde seca sectionem aliam prope illam sectionem tribus digitis.	Then make another incision near that incision, three fingers away.
Deinde excoria cutem a superiori parte uenae, donec appareat.	Then scrape the skin from above the vein, until it appears.
Deinde eleua eam cum Radiis sicut fecisti, et suspende eam cum uncino alio, sicut fecisti in primis.	Then lift it with probes as you did, and suspend it with another hook, as you did at first.
Deinde seca sectionem aliam, aut sectiones plures, si indiges illo.	Then make another incision, or several incisions, if you need them.
Deinde eleua, et incide ipsam ultima sectione apud calcaneum.	Then lift it and cut it at the very last incision near the heel.
Deinde extrahe eam ad sectionem quae est supra eam.	Then pull it out to the incision above it.
Et fac illud, donec extrahas eam ex sectione quae est superior, uel altior sectionibus omnibus, donec quando egreditur tota: tunc incide eam.	And do that until you pull it out of the incision that is higher, or from all the higher incisions, until the whole thing comes out: then cut it.
Si autem non obedit tibi ad extrahendum, et eleuandum: tunc intromitte acum cum filo forti duplo, et liga eam, et extrahe ipsam: aut intromitte sub ea Radium: et reuolue manum tuam ad omnem partem, donec egrediatur.	However, if it does not yield to being pulled and lifted, then insert a needle with a strong thread doubled, and tie it, and pull it out; or insert a rod under it, and turn your hand around every part until it comes out.
Et caue, ne incidatur.	And beware that it is not cut.
Nam si incidatur, fit difficile tibi eleuare eam ualde, et ingreditur super infirmum ex ea nocumentum.	For if it is cut, it becomes very difficult for you to lift it, and it enters upon the weak from it harm.
Cum ergo extraxeris eam totam: tunc pone super locum uulnerum lanam submersam in uino et oleo rosato, aut oleo: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	When therefore you have pulled it all out, then put on the wound-place wool soaked in wine and rose-oil, or oil, and treat it until it is healed.
Quod si Vitis est contracta, habens tortuositatem cui sit inuolutio ad partes, et non est sicut diximus secundum rectitudinem: tunc oportet ut findas super eam ad omnem partem tortuositatis eius, et loca inuolutionis ipsius.	If the vine is contracted, having a twisting to which there is a wrapping to parts, and is not, as we said, according to straightness, then it is necessary that you cut along every part of its twisting and the places of its wrapping.
Deinde suspende eam cum uncinis, donec eleues eam totam: et caue apud sectionem tuam super eam ne incidas uenam, aut uulneres: nam difficile fiet super te eleuare, uel extrahere eam.	Then suspend it with hooks until you lift it all, and beware at your incision on it lest you cut a vein, or wound it: for it will become difficult for you to lift or extract it.
Conserua ergo prudentiam tuam.	Therefore, preserve your prudence.
Forma Incidentis quo sanatur Vitis.	Form of the Injury by which the Vine is Healed.
Forma Vncini caeci.	Form of the blind hook.
Non est ei curuitas sicut reliquis Vncinis, neque est acutae extremitatis, ut non uulneret uenam: et est grossae flectuositatis, lenis: quoniam si esset subtilis, incideret uenam subtilitate sua: imo sit ei superflua grossitudo, sicut diximus.	It does not have the curvature like the other hooks, nor is its end sharp, so as not to injure a vein; and it is of thick, smooth flexibility, for if it were subtle, it would cut a vein by its subtlety; indeed, it has superfluous thickness, as we said.
De extractione Venae cruris.	Of the extraction of the vein of the leg.
Caput XCIII.	Chapter XCIII.
Haec Vena generatur in cruribus in terris calidis, sicut Alizegi, et terra Arabum, et in terris aridis, calidis, paucae teneritatis, id est, in quibus non nascitur herba, neque arbor.	This vein is generated in the legs in hot lands, such as Al-Andalus, and the land of the Arabs, and in dry, hot lands, with little softness, that is, in which no grass grows, nor trees.
Et fortasse generatur in locis aliis corporis praeter crura.	And perhaps it is generated in other parts of the body besides the legs.
Et generatio quidem eius est a putrefactione quae accidit sub cute, sicut accidunt intra corpora serpentes et uermes ascarides, et uermes generati inter cutem et carnem.	And indeed its generation is from the putrefaction that occurs under the skin, as happens within the bodies of snakes and worms, ascarides, and worms generated between the skin and flesh.
Et signum incaeptionis euentus huius Venae est, quod accidit in crure inflammatio uehemens.	And the sign of the beginning of this Vein's occurrence is that a violent inflammation occurs in the leg.
Deinde uesicatur locus.	Then the place becomes blistered.
Deinde incipit Vena exire ex loco illius uesicationis, quasi sit radix plantae, aut animal.	Then the Vein begins to emerge from the place of that blistering, as if it were the root of a plant, or an animal.
Cum ergo apparet ex ea extremitas eius, tunc oportet ut inuoluas super ipsam frustum plumbi, cuius pondus sit ex drachma keil, usque ad drachmas II et noda ipsam: et dimitte plumbum suspensum ex crure.	Therefore, when its extremity appears from it, you must wrap a piece of lead around it, whose weight is from one drachma keil up to two drachmas, and tie it; and leave the lead hanging from the leg.
Quotiens ergo egreditur ex ea aliquid ad exteriora, inuolue illud in plumbo, et noda illud.	Whenever, therefore, something emerges from it to the exterior, wrap it in lead and tie it.
Quod si prolongatur multum, tunc incide partem eius, et inuolue residuum.	If it extends a great deal, then cut off part of it and wrap the remainder.
Et non incidas eam radicitus antequam egrediatur tota.	And do not cut it at the root before the whole of it emerges.
Quoniam si incidis, contrahitur, et ingreditur in carnem: et facit accidere apostema, et putredinem in loco, et ulcus malum.	Because if you cut it, it contracts and enters the flesh; and causes an abscess, and putrefaction in the place, and a bad ulcer.
Quapropter oportet, ut suauiter tractetur, et extrahatur paulatim, donec egrediatur ex ultimo sui, et non remaneat ex ea aliquid in corpore: et ex hac quidem Vena egreditur in quibusdam hominibus quod est in longitudine sua quinque palmorum et decem.	Therefore, it should be gently handled and pulled out gradually, until the last part emerges from it, and nothing of it remains in the body; and from this vein, in some people, emerges something that is in length five palms and ten.
Et iam peruenit ad me, quia exiuit uiro ex XX palmis.	And it has already come to my attention that it emerged from a man of twenty palms.
Si autem inciditur tibi in hora medicationis tuae: tunc intromitte radium in foramine eius, et perfora eam foramine longo, cum corpore, donec euacuetur totum quod est in ea ex materia: et administra putrefactionem loci cum medicinis diebus aliquot.	If, however, it is incised in your hour of medication, then insert a probe into its opening, and pierce it with a long hole, along with the body, until everything in it is evacuated from the material; and treat the putrefaction of the area with medicines for several days.
Deinde cura ipsum curatione apostematum.	Then treat it with the treatment for abscesses.
Et haec quidem Vena quandoque habet ramos multos, praecipue quando apparet in iunctura pedis, aut in pede ipso: et accidunt ei orificia multa, et egreditur ex omni orificio ramus.	And this vein sometimes has many branches, especially when it appears in the joint of the foot or in the foot itself; and many openings occur to it, and a branch emerges from every opening.
Cura ergo ipsam, sicut diximus in diuisione, et cum eo quod praemissum est.	Therefore, treat it as we said in the division, and with what was stated beforehand.
¶ De sectione super Vermes generatos sub cute, et dicitur Aegritudo bouina.	Concerning the incision on worms generated under the skin, and it is called the Cattle Disease.
Caput XCIIII.	Chapter Ninety-Four.
Haec Aegritudo nominatur in quadam terra apud nos Aegritudo bouina: propterea, quia multotiens accidit bouibus, et est uermis paruus unus, qui nascitur inter cutem et carnem.	This disease is called in a certain land among us the Cattle Disease; because it often happens to oxen, and is a small worm that is born between the skin and the flesh.
Et uadit in corpore toto, ascendendo et descendendo: et ostenditur sensui apud ambulationem eius de membro ad membrum, donec disrumpit ubicumque disrumpit in cute locum, et egreditur.	And it goes throughout the body, ascending and descending, and is noticeable to the senses as it moves from limb to limb, until it breaks through wherever it breaks through the skin, and emerges.
Et generatio eius est ex putredine quorundam humorum.	And its generation is from the putrefaction of certain humors.
Sicut accidunt uermes et serpentes, id est, lumbrici, et ascarides in uentre.	Just as worms and snakes, that is, intestinal worms, and ascarids, occur in the belly.
Et timetur ex malicia eius.	And it is feared because of its malice.
Quia quando ipse uadit in corpore, et eleuatur ad caput, et peruenit ad locum: tunc fortasse aperit in eo, et egreditur, et destruit oculum: et accidit illud multotiens.	Because when it travels through the body, and rises to the head, and reaches a place, then perhaps it breaks open there and emerges and destroys the eye, and this happens many times.
Cum ergo uis curare eum, et extrahere ipsum, tunc non fit illud nisi apud ambulationem eius, et apparitionem ipsius sensui.	Therefore, when one wishes to cure it and extract it, then this is not done except at its movement and its appearance to the senses.
Oportet ergo, ut stringas quod est supra eum, et quod est sub eo cum ligamento constrictione forti.	Therefore, it is necessary to tie that which is above it and that which is below it with a strong ligature.
Deinde seca super ipsum, et extrahe eum.	Then cut above it and extract it.
Quod si profundatur in carne, et non inuenis ipsum: tunc pone super locum cauterium cum igne, donec moriatur.	If it penetrates into the flesh, and you do not find it, then place a cautery on the area with fire until it dies.
Et maius quod timetur, est corruptio eius, qua corrumpit oculum, sicut diximus.	And the greater fear is its corruption, by which it corrupts the eye, as we said.
Si autem uides eum iam peruenisse in capite prope oculum, tunc stringe sub eo supercilium strictura bona.	If however you see it already having reached the head near the eye, then tie the eyebrow below it with a good ligature.
Deinde seca super ipsum, et extrahe eum.	Then cut above it and extract it.
Et oportet ut utatur infirmus mundificatione sui corporis, cum medicinis soluentibus humores putridos malos.	And it is necessary for the sick person to use a cleansing of their body, with medicines that dissolve bad putrid humours.
Et caueat sibi a cibis generantibus putrefactionem.	And let him beware of foods that generate putrefaction.
¶ De sectione super aegritudinem Nakir.	Concerning the incision above the ailment Nakir.
Caput XCV.	Chapter XCV.
Haec aegritudo nominatur in terra nostra Nakir: et est dolor qui accidit in quibusdam membris: deinde permutatur de membro ad membrum.	This ailment is called Nakir in our land: and it is a pain that happens in some limbs, then changes from limb to limb.
Et ego quidem iam uidi ipsum, secundum quod narro tibi.	And I myself have already seen it, as I tell you.
Vocatus sum ad mulierem infirmam in quibusdam uillis.	I was called to a weak woman in certain villages.
Et detexit brachium suum, et uidi inflationem paruam in uena funis brachii.	And she uncovered her arm, and I saw a small swelling in the vein of the arm's cord.
Et postquam remansi hora una, uidi unam inflationem incedere cum focili, sicut incedit uermis, ascendendo ad humerum eius uelocius quam esse potest: ut sit sicut argentum uiuum, quando currit de loco ad locum.	And after I remained one hour, I saw one swelling moving with the pulse, as a worm moves, ascending to her shoulder more quickly than is possible, so that it is like quicksilver when it runs from place to place.
Recessit ergo dolor ex illo loco, et fixus est in humero.	Therefore, the pain receded from that place and settled in the shoulder.
Deinde sedi hora una, et cucurrit in reliquum corpus, donec perueniret in brachium aliud.	Then I sat for one hour, and it ran through the rest of the body until it reached the other arm.
Deinde narrauit mihi, quia reuoluebatur in toto corpore suo, secundum quod uidi.	Then she told me that it was moving throughout her whole body, just as I had seen.
Miratus sum ergo de uelocitate permutationis eius de membro ad membrum.	Therefore, I was amazed at the speed of its movement from limb to limb.
Et ego quidem ante illud non uideram hanc aegritudinem oculis meis taliter secundum hunc modum.	And indeed, before that, I had not seen this illness with my own eyes in such a way.
Verumtamen uidi multos, qui inueniunt dolorem permutari de membro ad membrum: et non uidi ipsum oculis, sicut uidi eum in muliere.	However, I have seen many who experience pain moving from limb to limb, but I did not see it with my own eyes as I did in the woman.
Et ego non cogito illud esse, nisi quod est propterea, quod mulier fuit ex illis qui sunt ex uillis sicci corporis detectarum uenarum: hinc ergo apparet sensui illa uentositas permutata.	And I do not think it is so unless it is because the woman was from those who are of dry bodies with detected veins; hence this blowing about appears to the senses in that manner.
Et est necesse, ut non appareant secundum hanc rationem in illis qui sunt deliciosi, et corporibus humidis, occultarum uenarum.	And it is necessary that they do not appear in this way in those who are delicate, and with moist bodies, of hidden veins.
Cum ergo uis curationem eius, et sentit patiens illud dolorem: tunc si est apparens tibi oculo, sicut diximus, tunc stringe supra ipsum, et sub ipso uelociter: et seca supra ipsum, donec egrediatur illa uentositas coartata: et cauteriza locum.	When therefore you wish to cure it, and the patient feels the pain: then if it is evident to your eye, as we said, then draw tight upon it and beneath it quickly: and cut upon it, until that constricted windiness comes out; and cauterize the place.
Si autem non uides ipsum oculis tuis: tunc cura ipsum cum excussione corporis, et cum eo quod expellit uentositates, et carminat eas cum pillulis foetidis, et pillulis de serapino, et similibus.	If, however, you do not see it with your own eyes, then treat it with shaking of the body, and with that which expels winds, and soothes them with foul pills, and pills of serapion, and similar things.
¶ De extractione Sagittarum.	On the extraction of Arrows.
Caput XCVI.	Chapter XCVI.
Sagittae diuersificantur secundum species suas, et secundum loca in quibus cadunt ex corpore.	Arrows differ according to their types, and according to the places in which they enter the body.
Earum uero diuersitas est: quoniam ex eis sunt quae habent cuspides magnos, et paruos: et concauae, et surdae.	Their diversity is such, because among them are those with large points, and small: and concave, and blunt.
Et ex eis sunt quae habent tres angulos.	And among them are those with three angles.
Et ex eis quibus sunt linguae.	And among them are those with tongues.
Et ex eis quibus sunt astellae.	And among them are those with stars.
Illae uero quae sunt secundum membra in quibus cadunt, est secundum duos modos.	Those, however, that are according to the members on which they fall, are according to two methods.
Aut enim membra sunt ex membris principalibus concauis, sicut cerebrum, et cor, et epar, et pulmo, et renes, et intestina, et uesica, et eis similia.	For either the members are from the principal concave members, such as the brain, and heart, and liver, and lung, and kidneys, and intestines, and bladder, and similar to them.
Quando ergo cadit in aliquo horum membrorum, et apparent tibi signa mortis, quae ego narro tibi post, tunc oportet ut deuites extractionem illius sagittae ex eis, nam mors consequitur illum in quo est, in pluribus dispositionibus.	Therefore, when it falls into any of these members, and signs of death appear to you, which I relate to you later, then it is necessary to avoid extracting that arrow from them, for death follows it in whom it is, in many dispositions.
Et quando non apparent tibi ista signa mala, et sagitta non est absconsa in profunditate membri, tunc extrahe ipsam, et cura uulnus.	And when these bad signs do not appear to you, and the arrow is not hidden in the depth of the member, then extract it, and treat the wound.
Ex signis enim cerebri quando cadit in eo sagitta, et penetrat os, et egreditur siphac quod est super cerebrum, est: quoniam accidunt ex illo soda uehemens, et scotomia, et uertigo, et rubedo in oculis, et inflatio, et rubedo linguae, et spasmus, et permixtio intellectus, et uomitus cholerae.	For the signs of the brain, when an arrow falls into it, and penetrates the bone, and exits through the siphac that is above the brain, are: because vehement sweat, and scotoma, and dizziness, and redness in the eyes, and swelling, and redness of the tongue, and spasm, and confusion of intellect, and vomiting of cholera, result from it.
Et fortasse egreditur sanguis ex naribus, aut auribus.	And perhaps blood exits from the nostrils or ears.
Et fortasse abscinditur sermo, et destruitur uox.	And perhaps speech is cut off, and the voice is destroyed.
Et egreditur ex loco uulneris humiditas alba similis pulti.	And a white moisture like gruel exits from the place of the wound.
Et exit ex eo simile aquositati carnis.	And something like the watery part of flesh comes out of it.
Si ergo apparent tibi ista signa, tunc abstine a curatione, et extrahe sagittam si non egreditur.	If therefore these signs appear to you, then abstain from treatment, and remove the arrow if it does not come out.
Signa autem sagittae quando cadit in corde, sunt: quod ipsa est prope mammillam sinistram: et sentit cum ea quasi ipsa sit fixa in re dura, non in re uacua.	The signs of an arrow striking the heart are: that it is near the left breast; and that one feels as if it were fixed in a hard substance, not in an empty one.
Et fortasse sagittae est motus similis motui pulsus: et currit ex uulnere sanguis niger.	And perhaps the arrow's movement is similar to the movement of a pulse; and black blood runs from the wound.
Et sequitur illud frigus extremitatum, et sudor frigidus, et syncopis.	And that is followed by coldness of the extremities, and cold sweat, and fainting.
Scias ergo, quod mors descendit procul dubio.	Know therefore, that death descends without a doubt.
Et signum sagittae quando uulnerat pulmonem, est exitus sanguinis spumosi ex uulnere: et uasa quae sequuntur collum, apostematur, et mutatur color infirmi.	And a sign of an arrow wounding the lung is the exit of frothy blood from the wound; and the vessels following the neck become inflamed, and the sick person's colour changes.
Et expirat spiritum magnum, altum: et quaerit attractionem aeris frigidi.	And he breathes out a large, deep breath; and seeks the attraction of cold air.
Quod si cadat sagitta in uelamen, quod est in pectore: tunc est prope costas paruas: et fit anhelitus magnus cum dolore uehementi, cum suspirio: et mouentur omnia membra humerorum.	If an arrow strikes the covering, which is in the breast, then it is near the small ribs; and there is a great gasping with intense pain, with a sigh; and all the arm's limbs move.
Et si cadat sagitta in stomachum, tunc fortasse egreditur ex uulnere ex cibo aliquid indigestum.	And if an arrow strikes the stomach, then perhaps something undigested will exit from the wound from the food.
Et si cadit sagitta in Ventrem, et figitur in eo: egreditur aliquid stercoris ex uulnere, aut zirbum, aut intestinum quod iam disruptum est.	And if an arrow strikes the abdomen, and is fixed in it, something of the faeces, or zirbum, or the already ruptured intestine will exit from the wound.
Non est ergo spes in curatione eius, neque in extractione sagittae.	Therefore, there is no hope for its cure, nor in extracting the arrow.
Quod si sagitta cadat in Vesicam, et egrediatur urina: et procedit ex ea aliquid ad exteriora, et fortior sit dolor super infirmum: tunc scias, quia est mortale.	If an arrow strikes the bladder, and urine exits, and something flows from it to the outside, and the pain is stronger than the weakness, then know that it is mortal.
Reliqua autem membra, sicut facies, et collum, et guttur, et spatula, et adiutorium, et spondiles dorsi, et furcula, et coxa, et crus, et eis similia ex membris saluantur secundum plures dispositiones: quando non inuenit sagitta arteriam, aut neruum: et non est sagitta uenenosa.	However, the remaining members, such as the face, and neck, and throat, and shoulder, and arm, and the vertebrae of the back, and collarbone, and hip, and leg, and similar members are saved according to many dispositions when the arrow does not strike an artery or nerve and is not a poisoned arrow.
Et ego narro tibi quod uidi de esse harum sagittarum, ut significes per illud super curationem tuam.	And I tell you what I have seen concerning these arrows, that you may signify by it upon your treatment.
Quod est, quia cuidam uiro cecidit sagitta in lachrymali oculi eius, in radice nasi.	Because an arrow struck a man in the tear duct of his eye, at the root of his nose.
Extraxi ergo eam ipsi ex parte altera, sub adipe auris eius: et sanatus est, et non accidit ei in oculo eius nocumentum.	Therefore, I drew it out for him from the other side, beneath the fat of his ear; and he was healed, and no harm befell his eye.
Et extraxi sagittam aliam Iudaeo, quae cecidit ei in adipe oculi sui sub palpebra inferiori: et sagitta iam occultata erat, et non consecutus sum ex ea nisi extremitatem paruam eius, cum qua adhaeret in ligno suo: et erat sagitta magna ex sagittis arcuum Turcorum, cum ferro leni, in qua non sunt aures.	And I extracted another arrow from a Jew, which struck him in the fat of his eye beneath the lower eyelid; and the arrow was already hidden, and I was not able to obtain from it but a small tip, with which it adheres to its shaft; and it was a large arrow from the Turkish bows, with soft iron, in which there are no ears.
Sanatus est ergo Iudaeus, et non accidit in oculo eius accidens malum.	Therefore, the Jew was healed, and no ill accident befell his eye.
Et extraxi sagittam aliam ex gutture Christiani.	And I extracted another arrow from the throat of a Christian.
Et erat sagitta arabica, et est illa cui sunt aures.	And it was an Arabic arrow, and it is of the kind which has ears.
Secui ergo super ipsam inter duas guidegi: et iam submersa erat in gutture eius.	Therefore I cut upon it between the two guidegi: and it was already submerged in his throat.
Subtiliatus sum ergo cum ea, donec extraxi eam: et sanatus est Christianus.	Therefore I worked carefully with it, until I extracted it: and the Christian was healed.
Et extraxi sagittam aliam uiro quae ceciderat in uentre eius: et cogitauimus, quia moreretur ex ea.	And I extracted another arrow from the man which had fallen into his belly: and we thought that he would die from it.
Postquam ergo praeterierunt ei triginta dies, et non mutatum est super eum aliquid ex dispositionibus eius, secui super sagittam: et ingeniaui super eam, et extraxi eam: et sanatus est, et non accidit ei accidens malum.	After therefore thirty days had passed, and nothing had changed in his condition, I cut upon the arrow: and I worked upon it, and extracted it: and he was healed, and no evil accident befell him.
Et uidi uirum cui cecidit sagitta in dorso eius, et consolidatum est uulnus super eam.	And I saw a man upon whom an arrow fell on his back, and the wound on it was consolidated.
Postquam ergo fuit post septem annos, exiuit sagitta in radice coxae eius.	After therefore seven years had passed, an arrow emerged in the root of his hip.
Et uidi mulierem cui cecidit in uentre suo sagitta, et consolidatum est uulnus super eam, et remansit sagitta intra ipsam: et non mutata est ex dispositionibus eius aliqua, et mulier non inuenit ei nocumentum in aliqua ex operationibus suis naturalibus.	And I saw a woman on whom an arrow fell into her belly, and the wound on it was consolidated, and the arrow remained within her: and no change was there in her condition, and the woman found no harm in any of her natural functions.
Et uidi uirum alium, cui cecidit sagitta in facie sua: et consolidatum est uulnus, et remansit, non inueniens ei multum dolorem: et similia istis multa.	And I saw another man, upon whose face an arrow fell: and the wound was consolidated, and it remained, not causing him much pain: and many similar things to these.
Et extraxi sagittam uiro ex principibus Regis, quae ceciderat ei in medio nasi sui, et iam declinauerat ad partem dextram parumper: et occultata erat sagitta tota.	And I extracted the arrow from the king's chief officer, which had fallen into the middle of his nose, and it had already deviated slightly to the right side: and the arrow was entirely concealed.
Vocatus sum ergo ad curationem eius post casum sagittae usque ad tres dies.	I was therefore called to treat him after the arrow's impact for up to three days.
Inueni ergo uulnus sagittae strictum ualde.	I therefore found the arrow wound to be very tight.
Inquisiui ergo eam cum tenta subtili, et non sensi eam: et ipse quidem inueniebat punctionem et dolorem sub aure sua ex parte dextra.	I therefore sought it with a fine probe, and did not feel it: and he himself felt a prick and pain under his right ear.
Speraui ergo, quod erat illa punctio ex extremitate sagittae.	I therefore hoped that the prick was from the arrowhead.
Emplastraui ergo locum cum emplastro in quo erat uirtus attractiua, et digestiua, confidens apud me, quod apostemaretur locus, et appareret mihi signum sagittae, ut secarem super eam: et non accidit in loco accidens significans quod sagitta consecuta sit locum.	I therefore plastered the area with a plaster containing attractive and digestive properties, confident that the area would suppurate, and that I would see a sign of the arrowhead, so that I could cut over it: and there did not occur in the area any sign indicating that the arrow had struck the area.
Assiduaui ergo cum emplastro super eum diebus multis: et non accidit accidens, et consolidatum est uulnus interim: et remansit infirmus de extractione eius spacio dierum, donec sensit sagittam die quodam intra nasum suum.	I therefore applied the plaster to him over many days: and no sign occurred, and the wound meanwhile healed: and he remained weak from its extraction for several days, until one day he felt the arrow within his nose.
Et narrauit mihi illud.	And he told me that.
Posui ergo super illud uulnus medicinam acutam, corrosiuam diebus multis, donec apertum est: et cum tenta tentaui ipsum, et sensi extremitatem sagittae subtilem quae adhaeret in ligno.	I therefore applied a sharp, corrosive medicine to that wound for many days, until it opened: and when I probed it, I felt a thin arrowhead adhering to the wood.
Deinde addidi in apertione uulneris per illam medicinam acutam, donec apparuit nobis uisibiliter extremitas sagittae: et praeteriit mihi cum eo spacium temporis circiter quatuor menses.	Then I added to the opening of the wound with that sharp medicine, until the arrowhead became visible to us: and it took me approximately four months with that.
Deinde postquam amplificatum est uulnus, et possible fuit mihi intromittere forcipes in ipsam, et mouere ipsam, et non obediuit ad exitum: tunc non cessaui subtiliare, et ingeniare super eam cum modis ingeniorum, donec coepi super eam die quodam cum forcipibus decenter factis, secundum quod ueniet forma eorum in fine capituli, donec extraxi eam.	Then, after the wound had widened, and I was able to insert forceps into it and move it, and it did not yield to removal, I did not cease to refine and devise methods for it, until one day I began to use specially crafted forceps, as will be shown in the form they take at the end of the chapter, until I extracted it.
Deinde restauraui uulnus.	Then I restored the wound.
Et medici quidem iudicant, quod cartilago nasi non restauratur.	And indeed, physicians judge that the cartilage of the nose is not restored.
Restauraui ergo ipsam, et consolidatum est uulnus, et sanatus est infirmas sanitate integra: nec nocuit ei aliquid omnino.	Therefore, I restored it, and the wound was consolidated, and the patient was healed with complete health; and nothing harmed him at all.
Et ego narro tibi qualitatem extractionis quarundam sagittarum: ut ponas illud regulam et significationem super illud quod non dixi.	And I tell you about the quality of extracting certain arrows: so that you may set that as a rule and meaning upon what I have not said.
Quoniam partes huius artis et distinctiones earum non comprehenduntur cum narratione: neque comprehendit illud liber, et artifex prudens comparat cum pauco super multum: et cum eo quod est paesens, super illud quod est absens: et inuenit operationem nouam, et instrumentum nouum apud descensus rerum extranearum huius artis quando accidunt.	Because the parts of this art and their distinctions are not comprehended with the narrative; nor does the book encompass it, and a skillful craftsman compares the little with the much: and with what is present, over what is absent; and finds a new operation, and a new instrument, concerning the descent of foreign matters of this art when they occur.
Dico ergo, quod sagittae non egrediuntur ex membris quibus sunt fixae, nisi secundum duos modos.	I say therefore, that arrows do not emerge from the limbs in which they are fixed, except in two ways.
Aut per attractionem ex loco ex quo intrauit.	Or by extraction from the place from which it entered.
Aut contrario partis alterius.	Or by the contrary of another part.
Et illa quae egreditur unde intrauit, aut est sagitta procedens in loco carnoso: et attrahitur, et egreditur.	And that which emerges from where it entered, either is an arrow proceeding in a fleshy place: and is pulled, and emerges.
Quod si non obedit ad exitum ex hora in qua cadit: tunc oportet ut dimittas ipsam aliquot diebus, donec putrefiat caro quae est in circumitu eius: et alleuietur attractio eius, et eius egressio.	If it does not yield to exiting from the hour in which it falls, then it is necessary to leave it for a few days, until the flesh that is around it rots: and its extraction will be eased, and its emergence.
Et similiter si figitur in osse, et non obedit tibi ad exitum, tunc dimitte ipsam etiam aliquot diebus: et itera eam cum attractione et motione omni die, donec egreditur.	And similarly if it is fixed in bone, and does not yield to you for exit, then leave it also for a few days: and repeatedly pull and move it every day, until it emerges.
Quod si non obedit tibi ad exitum post dies, tunc oportet ut perfores in circumitu sagittae in ipso osse ab omni parte cum terebro subtili, donec amplificentur sagittae.	If it does not yield to you for exit after days, then it is necessary to pierce around the arrow in the bone itself from every side with a fine drill, until the arrow's path is enlarged.
Deinde attrahe eam, et extrahe ipsam.	Then pull it and extract it.
Si autem sagitta est fixa in capitis osse, et iam processit in uno uentrium cerebri, et apparent ex infirmo quaedam illorum accidentium quae dixi: tunc abstine ab attractione sagittae, et dimitte eam, donec aequetur esse eius post dies.	However, if the arrow is fixed in the bone of the head, and has already progressed into one of the ventricles of the brain, and some of the accidents which I have mentioned appear from the patient, then refrain from pulling the arrow, and leave it, until its state is equalized after days.
Nam si sagitta peruenit ad sifach, tunc mors non prolongatur ei.	For if the arrow reaches the sifach, then death is not prolonged for him.
Et si sagitta non est fixa, nisi in corpore ossis tantum, et non penetrat usque ad sifach: et remanet infirmus aliquot diebus, et non accidit ei ex illis accidentibus aliquid: tunc ingenia in attractione sagittae et extractione eius.	And if the arrow is not fixed, except in the body of the bone only, and does not penetrate to the sifach: and the sick person remains for a few days, and nothing from those accidents happens to him: then proceed with the extraction of the arrow.
Si autem est fixa ualde, et non obedit tibi ad attractionem: tunc administra terebella in circumitu sagittae, sicut narraui tibl: deinde cura locum, donec sanetur.	However, if it is fixed firmly, and does not obey you in extraction: then administer a drill around the arrow, as I have told you: then treat the place until it is healed.
Si autem Sagitta iam absconsa est in loco corporis, et occultatur et absconditur a sensu: tunc inquire eam cum tenta.	If however the arrow is already hidden in a place of the body, and is concealed and hidden from sight, then search for it with probes.
Si autem sentis eam, tunc attrahe eam cum quibusdam instrumentis quae conueniunt attractioni eius.	If however you feel it, then extract it with certain instruments suitable for its extraction.
Si autem non potes super eam, propter constrictionem uulneris, et propter longitudinem sagittae in profundo: et non est illic os, neque neruus, neque uena: tunc finde super eam, donec amplificetur uulnus, et sit possibile extrahere sagittam.	If however you cannot extract it, due to the constriction of the wound, and because of the arrow's length deep within: and there is no bone, nor nerve, nor vein there: then widen the wound above it, until the wound is enlarged, and it is possible to extract the arrow.
Quod si sunt ei aures quibus teneatur, tunc libera carnem fixam in eis ab omni parte, omni ingenio quo potes illud, et ingenia, si non potest super euasionem carnis in fractura aurium, et contorsione earum, donec euadat.	If it has ears by which it is held, then free the flesh fixed to them from every side, with any ingenuity that you can, and devices, if it is not possible by the escape of flesh in the fracture of the ears, and twisting of them, until it escapes.
Et tu quando administras extractionem Sagittae, in quocumque loco est, tunc utere contorsione manus tuae, cum forficibus ad partes omnes, donec facias eam euadere: et subtilia ultima subtilitate, ut non frangatur Sagita, et fiat difficilis tibi attractio eius, et ipsius extractio.	And when you administer the extraction of the arrow, wherever it is, then use the twisting of your hand, with forceps on all sides, until you make it escape: and with the utmost delicacy, so that the arrow is not broken, and its extraction becomes difficult for you.
Quod si non potes super eam ex hora una, tunc dimitte eam diebus aliquot, donec putrefiant quae sunt in circumitu eius.	If you cannot extract it within one hour, then leave it for a few days, until the things around it putrefy.
Deinde itera eam: alleuietur enim tuncia Si uero contrarietatem tibi facit fluxus sanguinis, tunc administra quod diximus ex curatione in capitulo suo: et custodi uirtutem tuam ab incisione uenae, aut nerui, aut chordae.	Then try again: for it will then be easier.  But if a contrary flow of blood troubles you, then administer what we have said concerning healing in its chapter: and guard your skill from incising a vein, or a nerve, or a tendon.
Et administra ingenium omni modo quo tibi possibile est euasionis Sagittae: et sit illud cum facilitate, et tranquillitate, uel tarditate, et firmitate, sicut narraui tibi.	And apply all the ingenuity you can to the escape of the arrow: and let it be with ease and calmness, or slowness and firmness, as I have told you.
Et oportet, ut facias cum trahis Sagittam, ut infirmus sit secundum figuram, secundum quam fuit apud casum Sagittae in ipso.	And it is necessary, when you pull out the arrow, that the wounded person be in the same posture as when the arrow entered.
Quoniam est magis iuuatiuum.	Because it is more helpful.
Si autem non est tibi possibile illud, tunc administra quod tibi est possibile ex figuris.	If, however, that is not possible for you, then administer what is possible for you from the figures.
Sagitta autem quae egreditur ex contrario partis alterius, aut iam procedit ex ea aliquid ad exteriora: aut facit gibbositatem extremitas Sagittae per sensum ex superiore parte cutis propinquae, et uides eam eminentem: seca ergo super eam, et sit sectio secundum quantitatem quod capiant in ea forcipes.	However, an arrow that emerges from the opposite side of the other part, either something already protrudes from it outward, or the arrowhead forms a swelling on the surface of the nearby skin, and you see it protruding: therefore cut above it, and let the cut be the size that forceps can grasp.
Deinde attrahe eam: ipsa namque fit facilis ad exitum.	Then pull it out: for it becomes easy to remove.
Si uero retinetur in osse, tunc torque manum tuam secundum rotunditatem, donec imprimat Sagitta in osse, et amplificet sibiipsi: deinde trahe ipsam.	If, however, it remains in the bone, then turn your hand in a circular motion until the arrow is pressed against the bone, and it enlarges itself; then pull it out.
Et si non: dimitte eam diebus aliquot: deinde itera eam, donec egrediatur.	And if not, leave it for a few days; then try again, until it emerges.
Quod si lignum Sagittae est in ea, tunc impelle ipsam cum eo.	If the arrow's shaft is in it, then push it along with it.
Si autem cecidit lignum, et uis administrare impulsionem: tunc intromitte ad eam instrumentum concauum, ut ingrediatur concauitas eius in caudam Sagittae: deinde impelle eam cum ipso.	If, however, the shaft has fallen off, and you wish to administer a push, then insert a concave instrument into it, so that its concavity enters the arrow's tail; then push it along with it.
Si autem Sagita est concaua, tunc impelle eam cum instrumento intrante in ipsam.	If, however, the arrow is concave, then push it with an instrument entering it.
Sagitta enim alleuiatur per illud.	For the arrow is eased by it.
Quod si Sagitta est toxicata, tunc oportet, ut concaues carnem totam, in qua est uenenum: si est tibi possibile illud.	If, however, the arrow is poisoned, then it is necessary to cauterize all the flesh in which the poison is, if it is possible for you.
Deinde cura eam cum eo quod conuenit ad illud.	Then treat it with what is appropriate for it.
Quod si Sagitta est cadens in pectore, aut in uentre, aut in uesica, aut in latere: et est propinqua ex eo quod tangis cum tenta, et possibile est tibi secare super eam: tunc seca, et caue ab incisione uenae, aut nerui, et extrahe eam.	If the arrow is lodged in the chest, or in the belly, or in the bladder, or in the side; and it is close to what you touch with the probe, and it is possible for you to cut above it; then cut, and beware of cutting a vein or a nerve, and pull it out.
Deinde sue uulnus, si uides, et cura illud, donec sanetur.	Then suture the wound, if you see fit, and treat it until it is healed.
Et haec est forma Forcipum, quibus extrahuntur Sagittae.	And this is the form of the forceps with which arrows are extracted.
Sint extremitates similes rostro auis, quae factae sunt sicut ferra: quando capiunt super Sagittam, non dimittunt eam.	Let the ends be similar to the beak of a bird, made of iron; when they grasp the arrow, they do not release it.
Et fiunt ex eis species multae, magnae, et paruae, et mediae, secundum quantitatem magnitudinis Sagittae, et paruitatis eius, et amplitudinis uulneris, et constrictionis eius.	And many forms of them are made, large, small, and medium, according to the quantity, size, and smallness of the arrow, and the breadth and constriction of the wound.
Forma Impellentis concaui.	The shape of the impelling concave.
Et forma Impellentis surdi.	And the shape of the impelling deaf.
Hoc est surdae extremitatis sicut Radius, ut alleuietur introitus eius in sagittam concauam, et impellatur cum eo.	This is a deaf extremity, like a radius, so that its entry into the concave arrow may be eased, and it may be propelled with it.
Huius extremitas impellentis concauae est concaua sicut penna auis: ut alleuietur introitus sagittae in ipsam et impulsio eius.	The extremity of this impelling concave is concave like a bird's feather, so that the entry of the arrow into it and its propulsion may be eased.
¶ De phlebotomia Venarum.	Concerning the phlebotomy of the veins.
Caput XCVII.	Chapter XCVII.
Uenae phlebotomandae, quarum cucurrit consuetudo in corpore, sunt triginta.	Thirty veins are those to be opened, whose use runs through the body.
Ex quibus in capite sunt sexdecim: duae Venae pulsatiles, quae sunt post aures, dictae duae Herbae: et duae Arteriae, quae sunt in duobus timporibus apparentes: et duae Venae quae sunt in duobus lachrymalibus duorum oculorum, quae dicuntur Aspicientes: et Vena praeparata in medio frontis: et uena quae est in extremitate nasi.	Of these, sixteen are in the head: two pulsating veins, which are behind the ears, called the two Herbs; and two arteries, which are apparent in the two temples; and two veins which are in the two tear ducts of the two eyes, called the Lookers; and the prepared vein in the middle of the forehead; and the vein that is at the tip of the nose.

Venae autem quae phlebotomantur in brachiis, sunt quinque uenae in omni brachio.	The veins, however, which are opened in the arms, are five veins in each arm.
Vna earum est Cephalica, et est ex latere syluestri: et nominat eam uulgus uenam capitis.	One of them is the Cephalic, and it is from the wild side: and the common people call it the vein of the head.
Et Fusca.	And the Fusca.
Et est Media uena, et est composita ex ramo Basilicae, et ramo Cephalicae: et nominat eam uulgus uenam corporis.	And the Middle vein, and it is composed of a branch of the Basilic and a branch of the Cephalic: and the common people call it the vein of the body.

Et Saluatella: et est uena quae est inter annularem et minimum: et sunt ei duo rami.	And the Saluatella: and it is the vein which is between the ring finger and the little finger: and it has two branches.
Et in crure et in pede sunt tres uenae.	And in the leg and foot there are three veins.

Et in crure alio sunt tres uenae similes illis.	And in the other leg are three veins similar to those.
¶ De phlebotomia duarum uenarum post Aures.	Concerning phlebotomy of the two veins behind the ears.
Phlebotomiae uero duarum uenarum quae sunt post Aures, iuuamentum est ad catarros antiquos, et hemigraneam, et sahafati, et ulcera capitis mala antiqua.	Phlebotomies of the two veins behind the ears are helpful for chronic colds, and hemiplegia, and sahafati, and bad chronic head ulcers.
Et qualitas phlebotomandi eam est secundum quod narro.	And the quality of the phlebotomy is according to what I describe.
Et est, ut radatur caput infirmi: et fricetur occipitium eius in loco duarum uenarum cum panno aspero fricatione bona.	And it is so that the head of the sick person is shaved, and his occiput is rubbed in the place of the two veins with a rough cloth, a good rubbing.
Deinde stringat infirmus collum suum cum uitta, donec appareant duae uenae.	Then let the sick person tie his neck with a cloth, until the two veins appear.
Et loca earum sunt post Aures in duobus locis depressis capitis.	And their locations are behind the ears in two depressed areas of the head.
Quaere ergo eas digito tuo, et ubi sentis pulsum earum sub digito tuo, illic signa cum encaustro.	Therefore, seek them with your finger, and where you feel their pulse beneath your finger, mark that place with ink.
Deinde accipe phlebotomum cultellarem, et est ille qui dicitur Incidens.	Then take a cupping lancet, and it is the one called Incidens.
Deinde intromitte ipsum sub uena in cute, donec perueniat phlebotomus ad os.	Then insert it beneath the vein in the skin, until the lancet reaches the mouth [of the vein].
Deinde eleua manum tuam cum uena et cute ad superiora, et incide uenam cum cute incisione incidente.	Then raise your hand with the vein and skin upwards, and cut the vein with the skin with an incisive incision.
Et sit longitudo incisionis quantitas duorum digitorum iunctorum, aut circiter illud: et fac exire ex sanguine quantum uis.	And let the length of the incision be the amount of two joined fingers, or approximately that: and cause as much blood to come out as you wish.
Deinde stringe eam cum puluillis, et dimitte eam, donec sanetur.	Then bind it with compresses, and leave it until it is healed.
Et iam praecessit in principio libri incisio earum, et ipsarum cauterizatio.	And already in the beginning of the book was the incision of them, and their cauterization.
¶ De phlebotomia duarum Arteriarum in timporibus.	Concerning the phlebotomy of two arteries in the temples.
Duarum uero Arteriarum quae sunt in duobus timporibus phlebotomiae iuuamentum, est ad hemigraneam antiquam: et sodam prauam, et obtalmiam assiduam: et cursum superfluitatum effusarum acutarum ad oculos.	Phlebotomy of the two arteries located in the two temples is beneficial for old hemiplegia, and crookedness of the neck, and continual ophthalmia, and the discharge of excess acute fluids to the eyes.
Et qualitas phlebotomandi eas est secundum quod narro tibi.	And the quality of phlebotomizing them is according to what I tell you.
Stringat infirmus collum suum multum, donec appareant duae uenae sensui apparitione manifesta: et demonstretur pulsus earum sub digito tuo.	Let the sick man hold his neck tight, until two veins become clearly visible; and their pulse be shown under your finger.
Tunc enim signa cum encaustro.	Then mark them with ink.
Deinde eleua cutem desuper uenam ad superiora cum digito tuo indice, et intromitte phlebotomum incidentem desubtus, et eleua uenam ad superiora.	Then lift the skin above the vein upward with your index finger, and insert the lancet underneath, and lift the vein upward.
Et incide eam, sicut fecisti in duabus uenis aliis: et fac currere ex sanguine secundum quantitatem necessitatis tuae.	And cut it, as you did in the other two veins, and make the blood flow according to your need.
Deinde solue coartationem infirmi, et pone digitum tuum super uenam hora una.	Then loosen the sick person's constriction, and place your finger on the vein for an hour.
Postea pone super ipsam cotum et puluillos, et stringe ipsum desuper constrictione forti: et dimitte ipsam, donec sanetur.	Afterwards, place a cloth and pads over it, and bind it tightly over the constriction; and leave it until it is healed.
Et iam praecessit rememoratio earum, et ipsarum incisio, et earum extractio in principio libri.	And already the remembrance of them, and their incision, and their extraction were previously mentioned at the beginning of the book.
¶ De phlebotomia uenae frontis post phlebotomiam Cephalicae.	Concerning the phlebotomy of the frontal vein after phlebotomy of the cephalic vein.
Iuuamentum uero phlebotomiae uenae frontis est post phlebotomiam Cephalicae, ad aegritudines faciei antiquas: et ad hemigraneam, et rubedinem: et ulcera foeda.	Indeed, the benefit of phlebotomy of the frontal vein, after phlebotomy of the cephalic vein, is for old facial ailments; and for hemicrania, and redness; and foul ulcers.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, secundum quod narro tibi.	And the quality of its phlebotomy is, according to what I tell you.
Coartet infirmus collum suum cum uitta, donec appareat uena.	The infirm patient tightens his neck with a bandage until the vein appears.
Deinde accipe instrumentum quod nominatur Fossorium.	Then take the instrument called a Fossorium.
Cuius haec est forma.	Its form is this.
Pone acumen eminens quod est in capite Fossorii super ipsam uenam, et percute super ipsum cum pectine, aut cum re alia in modo eius: et dimitte sanguinem currere secundum quantitatem quam uis.	Place the prominent point that is on the head of the Fossorium above the vein itself, and strike upon it with a spatula, or with something else in its manner; and allow the blood to run according to the quantity you desire.
Deinde solue perforationem infirmi, et stringe eam, donec sanetur.	Then loosen the wound of the infirm person, and bind it, until it is healed.
Et quandoque aperitur cum phlebotomo lato.	And sometimes it is opened with a broad phlebotom.
Verumtamen non oportet, ut sit phlebotomus acutae extremitatis, sicut reliqui phlebotomi, imo sit latae extremitatis.	However, it is not necessary that the phlebotom have a sharp end, like the other phlebotoms, but rather a broad end.
Et phlebotoma eam secundum transuersionem: quoniam os est propinquum: et fortasse in eo frangetur phlebotomus quando est subtilis.	And lance it across the vein; because the bone is near, and perhaps the phlebotom will break in it when it is slender.
¶ De phlebotomia Venarum in duobus Lachrymalibus.	Concerning the lancing of the veins in the two tear ducts.
Iuuamentum autem duarum Venarum quae sunt in duobus Lachrymalibus duorum oculorum, est ad oculum ex scabie et rubedine: et sebel in oculo, et aegritudinibus faciei.	The lancing of the two veins in the two tear ducts is for the eye from scabies and redness, and for spots in the eye, and diseases of the face.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae earum est, ut stringat infirmus collum suum cum uitta.	And the quality of lancing them is that a weak person tightens his neck with a bandage.
Deinde phlebotoma eas: et tu sis stans super caput eius.	Then lance them, and you should stand over his head.
Et fiat phlebotomia secundum transuersum ad longitudinem parum, cum phlebotomo paruo, lato parumper, nam in loco non est caro.	And let the lancing be transverse, slightly along the length, with a small, somewhat wide lancet, for there is no flesh in the place.
Si enim phlebotomus est subtilis extremitatis, fortasse frangitur.	For if the lancet is of slender make, perhaps it will break.
Deinde fac currere ex sanguine quantum est tibi necesse.	Then make the blood run out as much as you need.
Et pone super eas cotum, et stringe eas nocte una, et solue eas.	And place a compress over them, and bind them one night, and unbind them.
¶ De phlebotomia uenarum Nasi.	Concerning the lancing of the veins of the Nose.
Venae autem Nasi phlebotomia, est conferens ad febrem acutam, et sodam uehementem, et aegritudines faciei, sicut hemigraneam, et rubedinem quae accidit in facie: praecipue quando est antiqua.	The lancing of the veins of the Nose is beneficial for acute fevers, and violent headaches, and diseases of the face, such as hemicrania, and redness which occurs on the face, especially when it is chronic.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut stringat infirmus collum suum.	And the quality of its phlebotomy is such that the weak person tightens his neck.
Deinde tene nasum eius manu tua sinistra, et accipe phlebotomum subtilem, longum: et fige eum in medio leporis ipsius, inter illud quod distinguit nasum secundum rectitudinem.	Then hold his nose with your left hand, and take a slender, long lancet, and place it in the middle of his nostril, between that which distinguishes the nose in terms of its straightness.
Quoniam uena non apparet sensui illic, et quia sanguis incipit fluere statim.	Because the vein is not visible there to the eye, and because blood begins to flow immediately.
Et oportet, ut ultimes manum tuam cum phlebotomo parumper: et facias currere ex sanguine secundum necessitatem tuam.	And you should hold your hand with the lancet for a little while, and make the blood flow according to your need.
Deinde liga ipsam nocte una.	Then tie it with one bandage.
Ipsa enim restauratur uelociter.	For it is restored quickly.
¶ De phlebotomia uenarum Guidegi.	Concerning the phlebotomy of the veins of the Guidegi.
Duarum uero Guidegi phlebotomiae iuuamentum, est ad constrictionem anhelitus, et incaeptionem leprae, et aegritudines melancholicas, et impetiginem et ulcera mala, et corrodentibus, id est, herpetibus estiomenis.	Indeed, the benefit of Guidegi phlebotomy is for the constriction of breathing, and the inception of leprosy, and melancholic illnesses, and impetigo and evil ulcers, and those that corrode, that is, eruptive herpes.

Deinde fac similiter de uena alia.	Then do likewise with the other vein.
Postea solue ligamentum, et stringe duas uenas strictura media: ut non praefocetur infirmus.	Afterwards, loosen the bandage, and bind the two veins with a middle constriction, so that the infirm person is not over-constricted.
Et dimitte eam usque mane.	And leave it until morning.
Sanatur enim uulnus.	For the wound is healed.
¶ De phlebotomia uenarum Algeberich.	Concerning the phlebotomy of the veins, by Algeberich.
Venae autem Algeberich phlebotomiae iuuamentum est: quia confert ad alcolam in ore, et corruptionem gingiuae: et ulcera mala: et fissuras labiorum, et ulcera mala, etiam quae sunt in naso, et in circumitu eius.	However, Algeberich's vein-opening is helpful, because it contributes to ulcers in the mouth, and gum corruption; and bad sores; and lip cracks, and bad sores, even those that are on the nose and its surroundings.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae earum est, ut facias sedere infirmum coram te: et stringe collum eius cum uitta.	And the quality of their phlebotomy is such that you should make the infirm person sit before you, and tie his neck with a strip.
Deinde reuolue labium eius, et aspice ad duas uenas: quarum una est a dextera labii, et secunda a sinistra eius: et demonstratio utriusque est per nigredinem ambarum.	Then, turn back his lip, and look at the two veins: of which one is to the right of the lip, and the second to its left; and the demonstration of each is by the blackness of both.
Et illud uerum est: quia in circumitu earum sunt uenae minutae, nigrae.	And that is true, because in their surroundings are small, black veins.
Incide ergo utramque incisione incidente.	Therefore, cut each with a cut coming in.
Si autem dubitatio est super te, et non scis quae earum est: tunc intende ad incisionem maioris earum, et ipsarum manifestiorem.	However, if there is doubt upon you, and you do not know which of them it is, then aim at the incision of the larger of them, and the more manifest of them.
Et similiter fac de duabus uenis quae sunt in labio superiore: et plurimum quidem currit consuetudo cum eo: et incide duas uenas quae sunt in labio inferiori.	And similarly do concerning the two veins which are in the upper lip; and indeed the custom runs most with it; and cut the two veins which are in the lower lip.
¶ De phlebotomia Venae sub lingua post Cephalicae phlebotomiam.	Concerning phlebotomy of the veins under the tongue after the phlebotomy of the cephalic vein.
Duarum uero Venarum quae sunt sub lingua phlebotomiae iuuamentum: est, quod phlebotomia Cephalicae est ad praefocationes quae sunt in gutture, et aegritudinem uuulae, et aegritudines oris.	However, the benefit of the phlebotomy of the two veins which are under the tongue is that phlebotomy of the cephalic vein is for the suffocations which are in the throat, and the illness of the uvula, and the illnesses of the mouth.
Et qualitas phlebotomandi eas est, ut sedeat infirmus inter manus tuas coram sole: et eleualinguam eius, et aspice sub lingua a latere eius uno uenam, et a latere eius alio uenam: et color utriusque decliuis ad nigredinem.	And the quality of phlebotomizing them is such that the sick person sits between your hands in the presence of the sun; and raise his tongue, and look under his tongue on one side of it for a vein, and on the other side of it for a vein; and the color of each of them slopes toward blackness.
Phlebotoma ergo utramque: et custodi, ne ultimes manum tuam in phlebotomando eas.	Therefore phlebotomize each of them; and beware lest you finally place your hand on phlebotomizing them.
Nam sub eius sunt arteriae, et fortasse accidet fluxus sanguinis ex illis arteriis.	For under them are arteries, and perhaps a flow of blood from those arteries will occur.
¶ De tribus Venis in cubito.	Concerning the three veins in the elbow.
Venae autem tres quae phlebotomantur in cubito, sunt in quarum phlebotomia cucurrit consuetudo in omnibus hominibus.	The three veins, however, which are phlebotomized in the elbow, are those whose phlebotomy is customary in all men.
Et phlebotomia earum fit secundum duos modos.	And their phlebotomy is done according to two methods.
Aut pungendo cum phlebotomo myrtino lato: aut oliuari ad subtilitatem decliui: aut secando cum phlebotomo cultellari, et est Alnesil.	Either by puncturing with a broad myrtle phlebotome, or an olive-like one to the sharpness of a slope, or by cutting with a knife phlebotome, and it is Alnesil.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form.
Sic Alnesil est, quod conuenit ad sectionem.	Thus Alnesil is, that which is suitable for cutting.
Et ex eis sunt species latae, et subtiles secundum amplitudinem uenarum et stricturam earum Forma phlebotomi myrtini sit lata, sicut uides.	And of them there are broad and narrow types, according to the width and narrowness of the veins. The form of the myrtle phlebotome is broad, as you see.
Et conuenit ad aperiendas uenas concauas, plenas, procedentes, apparentes, grossas, et illas quae continent sanguinem grossum, turbidum.	And it is suitable for opening concave, full, proceeding, apparent, large veins, and those that contain thick, turbid blood.
Et iste phlebotomus est minoris latitudinis, et subtilioris extreminatis.	And this phlebotome is of lesser width, and of finer extremity.
Et conuenit ad phlebotomiam uenarum subtilium, quae continent sanguinem subtilem citrinum	And it is suitable for the phlebotomy of thin veins, which contain thin, yellow blood.
¶ De phlebotomia Basilicae.	Of the phlebotomy of the Basilic vein.
Basilicae autem quae est una harum trium uenarum phlebotomiae iuuamentum est.	The Basilic vein, which is one of these three veins, is an aid to phlebotomy.
Quia extrahit sanguinem ex aegritudinibus, quae sunt sub gutture et collo, ex eo quod sequitur pectus, et uentrem: et conuenit phlebotomatori cum phlebotomat eam, ut caueat, et sit super timorem ex ea nam sub ea est arteria.	Because it draws blood from illnesses which are beneath the throat and neck, from there following to the chest, and the abdomen: and it is fitting for the phlebotomist, when phlebotomizing it, to be cautious and to be above fear from it, for there is an artery under it.
Si ergo errat, et addit in punctura phlebotomi, incidet illam arteriam, et accidet fluxus sanguinis.	Therefore, if he errs, and adds in the puncture of phlebotomy, he will cut that artery, and a flow of blood will occur.
Quapropter oportet, ne phlebotomet eam cum phlebotomo pungente: imo sit secans cum Alnesil.	Therefore, it is necessary that he not phlebotomize it with a phlebotomy lancet; rather, let him be cutting with a scalpel.
Quod si non apparet Basilica apparitione manifesta, tunc oportet, ut alienes ipsam, et permuteris ad aliam, aut quaeras aliquem ramum eius: aut phlebotomes loco eius Funem brachii.	If the Basilic vein is not clearly visible, then it is necessary to seek another, and change to another, or seek one of its branches; or phlebotomize the brachial vein in its place.
Ipsa enim est manifesta, et seca eam cum phlebotomo Anesil, sicut diximus.	For it is indeed clear, and cut it with a phlebotomy lancet, as we have said.
Si autem uis phlebotomiam ipsius eiusdem, tunc oportet ante stricturam brachii, ut tangas locum, donec cognoscas locum pulsus.	If, however, you wish to phlebotomize the same arm, then it is necessary before the constriction of the arm, that you touch the place, until you know the location of the pulse.
Deinde signa super locum cum encaustro, postea brachium, et seca uenam sectione concaua cum phlebotomo Alnesil, sicut diximus.	Then mark the spot with ink, afterwards the arm, and cut the vein with a concave incision using the phlebotomy lancet, as we have said.
Et caue ne cadat percussio per spacium a loco arteriae.	And beware that the blow does not fall in a space from the location of the artery.
Et quando uides, cum tu stringis ligamen, inflationem in loco quem signasti cum encaustro, tunc illa inflatio est inflatio arteriae: deuita ergo eam.	And when you see, when you constrict the ligature, an inflation in the place which you marked with ink, then that inflation is the inflation of the artery: therefore avoid it.
Quod si uides sanguinem apud phlebotomiam salire, sicut urina pueri, et est sanguis subtilis, rubeus: tunc scias, quia est ex sanguine arteriae.	If you see blood at the phlebotomy leaping, like a child's urine, and it is thin, red blood: then know that it is from the blood of the artery.
Tunc ergo propera, et pone digitum tuum super ipsum spacio longo, deinde aufer digitum tuum.	Then quickly place your finger over it for a long space, then remove your finger.
Si ergo abscinditur sanguis (multotiens namque abscinditur) tunc stringe brachium, et dimitte ipsum: et caueat infirmus a motione eius: et sit super timorem eius.	If, therefore, blood is cut off (for it is often cut off), then constrict the arm, and release it; and let the sick person be cautious of its movement; and let it be upon his fear.
Et non moueat ipsum diebus aliquot, donec sanetur.	And do not move it for several days, until it is healed.
Si autem non abscinditur sanguis, et uincit te: et non est tibi praesens in momento tuo medicina, tunc incide arteriam, si apparet tibi.	If, however, the blood is not cut off, and it overcomes you, and there is no medicine present for you at that moment, then cut the artery, if it appears to you.
Nam extremitates eius contrahuntur, et abscinditur sanguis.	For its extremities contract, and the blood is cut off.
Aut accipe corticem fistici, et finde eum: accipe medietatem unam, et stringe eam super locum uenae strictura decenti, cum ligamento et puluillis usque ad diem alium.	Or take the bark of a fig tree, and split it: take one half, and tie it over the place of the vein's proper constriction, with a bandage and dressings until another day.
Tunc si abscinditur sanguis, est bonum.	Then if the blood is cut off, it is good.
Et si non: tunc cura ipsum cum eo cuius praecessit rememoratio ex loco puluerum abscindentium fluxum sanguinis: et abscisio sanguinis eius non est difficilis in pluribus dispositionibus, propter locum paruum uulneris, et possibilitatem ligamenti ex brachio.	And if not, then treat it with that which preceded in memory from the place of powders cutting off the flow of blood: and the cutting off of its blood is not difficult in many cases, on account of the small place of the wound, and the possibility of a bandage from the arm.
¶ De phlebotomia uenae Fuscae.	Concerning the phlebotomy of the Fusca vein.
Venae autem Fuscae phlebotomiae iuuamentum est, quod trahit sanguinem ex superiori parte capitis, et inferiore corporis: propterea, quia est composita ex ramo Basilicae, et ramo Cephalicae, sicut diximus.	The phlebotomy of the Fusca vein is helpful, because it draws blood from the upper part of the head, and the lower part of the body; because it is composed of a branch of the Basilica vein and a branch of the Cephalica vein, as we have said.
Et conuenit phlebotomanti eam, ut sit super timorem ex phlebotomia eius, nam sub ea est neruus.	And it is fitting for the phlebotomist that she be cautious regarding her phlebotomy, for there is a nerve beneath it.
Si ergo addit in punctura phlebotomi, et inuenit neruum, accidit in ea stupor, et difficilis fit sanatio eius, et fortasse non sanatur penitus.	If therefore the phlebotomist adds in the puncture, and finds a nerve, there occurs in her numbness, and the healing of it becomes difficult, and perhaps it is not healed completely.
Et iste neruus multotiens apparet sensui.	And this nerve frequently appears to the sense.
Si autem occultatur in quibusdam hominibus, et est subtilis, et non ostenditur: tunc oportet ut ponas phlebotomiam tuam qua eam phlebotomas, sectionem cum Alnesil, et deuita neruum cum fortitudine tua.	However, if it is hidden in some people, and is subtle, and does not show itself: then it is necessary that you place your phlebotomy, whereby you phlebotomize, the incision with Alnesil, and avoid the nerve with your strength.
Quod si uena est inter duos neruos, tunc finde uenam in longitudine.	If the vein is between two nerves, then split the vein lengthwise.
¶ De uena Cephalica.	Concerning the Cephalic vein.
Phlebotomiae autem uenae Cephalicae iuuamentum est, quia attrahit sanguinem ex capite, et confert ad aegritudines oculorum.	Phlebotomy of the Cephalic vein is helpful, because it draws blood from the head, and is beneficial for diseases of the eyes.
Et oportet in hac uena proprie, si uis, ut phlebotomes eam pungendo cum phlebotomo oliuari, aut cum phlebotomo myrtino: quoniam est saluior uenarum omnium, quoniam non est subea arteria, neque neruus.	And it is necessary in this vein properly, if you wish, that you phlebotomize it by piercing with an olive-shaped lancet, or with a myrtle-shaped lancet, because it is safer than all the veins, because there is no artery, nor nerve, beneath it.
Verumtamen conuenit tibi apud phlebotomiam, ut deuites cum phlebotomo caput lacerti tantum, et quaeras locum leniorem: et non nocet ei, si non inuenitur cum percussione prima, ut iteretur super eam cum phlebotomia aliquotiens.	However, it befits you in phlebotomy to avoid the head of the forearm with the lancet, and to seek a smoother place.  And it does not harm it if it is not found with the first puncture, so that it is repeated with phlebotomy several times.
Verumtamen fortasse apostematur in quibusdam hominibus quando non phlebotomatur in percussione prima, sed non nocet ei illud apostema in aliquo.	However, perhaps it becomes a boil in some people when it is not phlebotomized on the first puncture, but that boil does not harm them in any way.
¶ De utilitate Phlebotomiae, et cautelis in ea obseruandis.	On the usefulness of phlebotomy, and the precautions to be observed in it.
Qualitas autem Phlebotomiae, et accidentia eius ex ea, in cuius rectificatione oportet te cogitare.	The quality of phlebotomy, and the accidents that arise from it, which you must consider to correct.
Primum ergo illius est de quo oportet ut scias, quod phlebotomia non administratur, nisi in conseruatione sanitatis, et perseuerantia eius, et cautela ab aduentu aegritudinum.	First, you should know that phlebotomy is not performed except for the preservation of health, and its persistence, and caution from the onset of illnesses.
Et ut fiat phlebotomia in una uenarum trium quae sunt in cubito, scilicet Cephalica, et Fusca, et Basilica.	And so that phlebotomy is performed in one of the three veins in the elbow, namely the Cephalic, the Basilic, and the Median cubital vein.
Et ut fiat phlebotomia in principio Veris super ieiunium, in uere, et aestate: et autumno, et hyeme post comestionem, quando apparent significationes repletionis.	And that phlebotomy should be performed at the beginning of spring on an empty stomach, in spring and summer; and in autumn and winter after eating, when signs of fullness appear.
Et fiat phlebotomia in die primo, aut in tertio, postquam praeterierint de die tres horae.	And phlebotomy should be performed on the first or third day after three hours have passed.
Phlebotomia autem quae administratur in aegritudinibus, non habet horam determinatam: sed quando prouocat conuenientia et necessitas ad illud, in nocte, aut die, et in omni hora, et in omni tempore.	However, phlebotomy administered in illnesses does not have a determined hour; but when the appropriateness and necessity call for it, by night or day, and in every hour and every time.
Et non oportet, ut phlebotomentur pueri, donec ueniant super eos quatuordecim anni.	And it is not appropriate for boys to be bled until they reach fourteen years of age.
Neque phlebotometur mulier praegnans, nisi a mense quarto usque ad septimum.	Nor should a pregnant woman be bled, except from the fourth to the seventh month.
Neque phlebotomentur senes, qui iam pertransierunt sexaginta annos.	Nor should elderly people who have already passed sixty years be bled.
Cum ergo aliquis uult phlebotomari propter quemcumque modum sit: oportet, ut mundificet intestina sua ante phlebotomiam cum clisteri leni, si in eis est stercus multum retentum: ut non attrahant uenae apud phlebotomiam ex intestinis superfluitates putridas nocentes membris principalibus.	Therefore, when someone wishes to be bled, no matter for what reason, it is necessary that they cleanse their bowels before the phlebotomy with a gentle clyster, if there is much retained stool within them, so that the veins during the phlebotomy do not draw out putrid impurities harmful to the main limbs from the intestines.
Neque phlebotometur patiens toctina, id est, satietatem nauseatiuam: neque crapulatus, neque euadens ab ebrietate, donec remoueatur illud ab eis.	Nor should a patient suffering from nausea, or surfeit, or recovering from drunkenness be bled until that is removed from them.
Neque infirmus cum hydropisi.	Nor the sick person with dropsy.
Et caueatur phlebotomia iterum post colicam passionem, et uomitum, et fluxum uentris, et multiplicationem coitus, et laboris, et exercitii, et uigiliarum, et ieiunii, et omnis quod dissoluit uirtutem ex re corporea aut animali.	And phlebotomy should be avoided again after colic, vomiting, diarrhea, excessive intercourse, labor, exercise, wakefulness, fasting, and anything that dissolves strength from the body or the animal.
Deinde considera in subtilitate humorum ante illud, si sanguis est grossus cum cibis et potibus, et medicinis: si possibile est ei illud.	Then consider in the subtlety of the humors beforehand, if the blood is thick with foods and drinks and medicines; if it is possible for him to do so.
Deinde introeat balneum, si non prohibet ipsum aliquid: aut exercitetur aliquo exercitio, ut subtilietur sanguis.	Then let him enter a bath, if nothing prevents him; or let him exercise with some exercise, so that the blood is made more subtle.
Et pone phlebotomiam eius in pectore, circa tertiam diei, sicut diximus: et conare, ut euacuetur pectus eius illa die ex omnibus accidentibus animalibus malis: sicut angustia, et ira, et timor: et ex omnibus accidentibus corporeis, sicut labor, et poena, et superfluicoitus, et illis similia.	And place his phlebotomy on his chest, around the third day, as we said: and strive that his chest be emptied that day of all bad animal accidents, such as anxiety, anger, and fear; and of all bodily accidents, such as labor, pain, excessive discharge, and similar things.
Et sedi suae faciat esse praesentes res cum quarum usu cucurrit consuetudo hominum ex aromaticitate, et odoramento, et tripudio et similibus illis per quantitatem possibilitatis.	And let him have present in his seat things with the use of which men are accustomed to run, from aromatics, and scents, and dancing and things similar to those to the extent possible.
Deinde sedeat phlebotomator super puluinari, quod sit altius quam puluinar phlebotomandi: postea extrahat brachium suum, et fricet ipsum phlebotomator manu sua bis, aut ter.	Then let the phlebotomist sit on a cushion higher than the phlebotomist's cushion; afterwards, let him draw his arm out, and let the phlebotomist rub it with his hand twice or three times.
Deinde stringat ligamentum cum corrigia, et inuoluat eam bis.	Then bind the ligament with a strap, and wrap it twice.
Et sit strictura temperata, quoniam strictura quando est inaequalis, aut per superfluitatem in strictura, tunc prohibet cursum sanguinis: aut in mollificatione, tunc etiam prohibet cursum sanguinis.	And let the constriction be moderate, for when the constriction is unequal, or by excess in the constriction, then it hinders the flow of blood; or in loosening, then it also hinders the flow of blood.
Deinde post stricturam oportet, ut fricet phlebotomandus manus suas simul adinuicem, donec inflentur uenae, et declarentur sensui.	Then after the constriction, it is necessary that the phlebotomist rub his hands together until the veins swell and become apparent to the senses.
Deinde abstergat phlebotomator phlebotomum cum pauco oleo, antiquo proprie.	Then the phlebotomist should wipe the phlebotomized area with a little old oil, properly.
Deinde ponat digitum suum indicem manus sinistrae super ipsam uenam sub loco cuius phlebotomiam uult, parum: ut non fugiat uena, et cassetur percussio.	Then let him place his left index finger on the vein itself, just under the place where he wishes to phlebotomize it, a little: so that the vein does not escape, and the incision is not missed.
Quoniam ex uenis est quam inuenis sicut chordam fugientem apud phlebotomiam: et ex eis est quae est plena uentositate: et quando ponis phlebotomum super eam, contrahitur sub phlebotomo, et decipitur phlebotomator, et non aperit phlebotomus uenam: et si aperit eam, est stricta: propter illud ergo oportet, ut firmetur phlebotomator, et sit sollicitus in his rebus omnibus.	Because there are veins that, like a fleeing chord during phlebotomy, and from them are those that are full of windiness; and when you place the phlebotom on them, it contracts under the phlebotom, and the phlebotomist is deceived, and does not open the vein; and if he opens it, it is constricted; therefore, for this reason, it is necessary that the phlebotomist be firm and careful in all these matters.
Deinde deponat phlebotomum.	Then he should remove the phlebotom.
Si ergo aperitur uena ex uice una, tunc bonum est.	If therefore the vein is opened on one attempt, then it is good.
Et si non, tunc itera illud uice alia sub illo loco parum, aut supra ipsum cum festinatione: si non apostematur locus.	And if not, then repeat it another time a little under that place, or above it with haste, if the place is not becoming inflamed.
Quod si apostematur, aut expauescit infirmus, tunc dimitte eum die, aut duobus diebus: et non stringat ligamentum.	If, however, it becomes inflamed, or the patient becomes frightened, then let him be left alone for a day or two days, and do not tighten the ligature.
Fortasse enim attrahet apostema calidum.	For perhaps it will attract a hot abscess.
Neque ingrediatur balneum.	Nor let him enter a bath.
Deinde iteret phlebotomiam, si amat.	Then he should repeat the phlebotomy, if he desires.
Quod si apertio est parua, aut currit sanguis subtiliter: et times ut non egrediatur ex sanguine quantitas quam uis: tunc itera phlebotomum in foramine ipso secundum rectitudinem, et adde in operatione parum.	If the opening is small, or the blood flows subtly, and you fear that the desired quantity will not flow from the blood, then repeat the phlebotomy in the same opening in a straight line, and add a little in the procedure.
Et fac illud cum festinatione, antequam apostemetur locus, apostematus enim locus est in multis hominibus apud operationem paruam.	And do this with haste, before the place becomes an abscess, for a place becomes abscessed in many people from a small operation.
Si ergo uides ipsum iam apostematum, tunc non iteres super ipsum omnino, non enim excusat apud te aliquid.	If therefore you see it already abscessed, then do not repeat on it at all, for nothing excuses it in your view.
Et pone super ipsum aliquid ex faece olei: quoniam alleuiat cursum sanguinis.	And place something from the dregs of oil on it, because it alleviates the flow of blood.
Et est melior in hoc loco quam oleum ipsum, et quam reliqua olea.	And it is better in this place than the oil itself, and than other oils.
Et similiter administra faecem olei in omni phlebotomia tua, qua phlebotomas uenas apud prohibitionem cursus sanguinis: et faciunt illud tyriaca alfarach, et sagzenea, quando ponitur ex una earum super locum.	And similarly administer the dregs of oil in all your phlebotomies, where phlebotomies cut veins to prohibit the flow of blood: and the Tyrian alfarach and sagzenea do it, when one of them is placed on the place.
Sanguis enim subtiliatur et resoluitur, quando est grossus.	For blood is refined and resolved when it is thick.
Quod si accidat in loco phlebotomiae apostema magnum, nam multotiens accidit, praecipue ei qui non est phlebotomatus nisi uice illa, aut est apertio uenae parua, tunc propera et pone super locum spongiam infusam in aqua et sale, calefacta parumper: et stringe eam hora una: quoniam soluitur.	If a large abscess should occur at the site of the phlebotomy, for it often happens, especially to one who is not a phlebotomist but that occasion, or if the vein opening is small, then quickly place a sponge soaked in water and salt, warmed slightly, upon the place, and compress it for one hour, because it is resolved.
Et oportet, ut facias illud post exitum sanguinis ex uena ipsa, cum complemento sui, aut ex uena alia.	And it is necessary that you do this after the blood has exited from the vein itself, with its completion, or from another vein.
Quod si remanet in loco post dies aliquid nigredinis, aut uiriditatis, non nocet illud: et si uis, pone super ipsum aliquid aloe, aut myrrhae solutorum: aut aliquid ex succo menthastri, id est, calamenti aut simile illius.	If any blackness or greenness remains at the site after a few days, it does no harm. And if you wish, place some dissolved aloe or myrrh on it, or something from the juice of mint, that is, calamint or something similar to it.
Et multotiens quidem accidunt apostemata et eminentiae apud phlebotomiam Basilicae.	And very often indeed, abscesses and swellings occur at phlebotomy in the Basilica.
Pone ergo manum tuam super ipsam, tunc si inuenis molliciem apud compressionem tuam super ipsam, tunc illa eminentia est mala.	Therefore, place your hand upon it; then, if you find softness upon pressing it, then that swelling is bad.
Caue ergo, ut ponas super eam aliquid ex eo quod diximus.	Therefore, be careful to place something upon it from what we have said.
Nam fortasse fluet ex ea sanguis arteriae.	For perhaps blood from an artery will flow from it.
Sed fac emplastrum ei cum eo in quo est stipticitas, ut induretur locus.	But make a plaster for it with that which has astringency, so that the place may be hardened.
Deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with the rest of the treatment, until it is healed.
Et oportet, ut extrahas omni homini ex sanguine secundum quantitatem uirtutis suae.	And it is necessary to extract from every man's blood according to the quantity of his strength.
Et quod apparet ex colore uincente super sanguinem.	And what appears from the color prevailing over the blood.
Nam sanguis si est niger, tunc dimitte ipsum exire, donec rubeat: et similiter si uides ipsum grossum: tunc dimitte eum, donec subtilietur: et similiter si est acutus, donec auferatur acuitas eius.	For if the blood is black, then let it be allowed to exit until it turns red; and likewise, if you see it thick, then let it be allowed to exit until it becomes thin; and likewise, if it is sharp, until its sharpness is removed.
Et oportet ei qui est plenus, fortis, et indiget extractione sanguinis uice una, ut amplificetur phlebotomia uenae, et sit phlebotomus latus: et in eo qui est debilis, sit econtrario illius.	And it is necessary for him who is full, strong, and needs bloodletting in one instance, that the phlebotomy of the vein be widened and the phlebotomist be wide: and in him who is weak, let it be the opposite of that.
Et oportet, ut extrahat ipsum in uicibus, et ut sit foramen strictum: et melius quod administratur in phlebotomia uenae est, ut sit transuersa sectio, non punctura.	And it is necessary to extract it in stages, and that the opening be narrow: and better for the administration in the phlebotomy of the vein is that it be a transverse incision, not a puncture.
Et iste modus phlebotomiae est saluus a fluxu sanguinis, et ab incisione nerui: et est laudabilior, et saluior quam phlebotomia per latitudinem et longitudinem.	And this method of phlebotomy is safe from a flow of blood, and from the incision of the nerve: and is more praiseworthy, and safer than phlebotomy by width and length.
Et cui consueuit peruenire apud phlebotomiam syncopis, oportet ut cibes ante phlebotomiam modico pane infuso in aqua granati muzi: aut secaniabin, si est calefactus: et extrahas ei ex sanguine in tribus uicibus, aut quatuor.	And to whom it is customary to reach syncope during phlebotomy, it is necessary that he eat before phlebotomy a little bread soaked in pomegranate juice water; or secaniabin, if it is warmed; and draw from his blood in three or four instances.
Et si est infrigidatae complexionis, tunc accipiat ante phlebotomiam panem infusum in syrupo miua, aut in syrupo de melle aromatizato cum speciebus, aut in syrupo aromatizato odorifero.	And if he is of a cold complexion, then let him take before phlebotomy bread soaked in quince syrup, or in syrup of scented honey with spices, or in fragrant scented syrup.
Quod si accidat syncopis apud phlebotomiam, et est caussa eius exitus sanguinis multi: tunc oportet, ut sumat in potu aquam carnis, et syrupum odoriferum subtilem: et utatur aromaticitate cum algalia, et liniatur pectus eius cum ea: et utatur reliquis quae diximus in diuisione in capitulo syncopis ex euacuatione.	If syncope occurs during phlebotomy, and its cause is the outflow of much blood, then it is necessary that he take in drink water from meat, and a subtle fragrant syrup; and that he use aromatics with algalia, and that his chest be lined with it; and that he use the rest that we said in the division in the chapter of syncope from evacuation.
Qui autem uult euentare brachium suum, et soluere sanguinem suum secundo: oportet ei cuius phlebotomia est propter euacuationem multam, et uirtus eius est debilis, ut soluat sanguinem paulatim per quantitatem uirtutis in diebus continuis.	Whoever wishes to evacuate his arm, and resolve his blood a second time: it is necessary for him whose phlebotomy is for great evacuation, and whose strength is weak, to resolve his blood little by little by the amount of strength in continuous days.
Qui uero uult euentare brachium suum, et soluere sanguinem suum secundo, et est corpus eius forte: tunc faciat illud post septem horas, aut nouem a phlebotomia sua prima.	However, whoever wishes to evacuate his arm, and resolve his blood a second time, and his body is strong: then let him do it after seven or nine hours from his first phlebotomy.
Qui autem uult attrahere sanguinem ex corpore suo ad contrarium partis ad quam declinat: oportet ut euentetur ei in die secundo, aut in tertio.	Whoever wishes to draw blood from his body to the opposite part to which it inclines: it is necessary that it be evacuated for him on the second or third day.
In cuius uero corpore est sanguis multus iam calefactus, et acuitur, et facit accidere febrem: oportet, ut egrediatur ex eo sanguis in uice una, et extrahatur ex eo quantitas multa: et amplificetur apertio usquequo accidat syncopis: postquam tu fueris conseruans omnes conditiones phlebotomiae: et ut ponas manum tuam super pulsum eius apud cursum sanguinis, ut non accidat mors loco syncopis.	In whose body, however, is much blood already heated and sharpened, and causes fever to occur: it is necessary that blood depart from it in one turn, and a great quantity be drawn from it; and the opening be amplified until syncope occurs; after you have observed all the conditions of phlebotomy; and that you place your hand upon his pulse at the flow of blood, so that death does not occur in place of syncope.
Multotiens enim accidit illud, quando ignorat phlebotomator, et cadit negligentia.	For often that happens, when the phlebotomist is ignorant and negligence occurs.
Et non oportet quando uis soluere brachium, et soluere sanguinem secundo, cum iam clausum sit orificium uenae, et fiat difficilis exitus sanguinis, ut prematur super ipsum cum uehementia, et curuatum extendatur uelociter.	And it is not appropriate, when you wish to resolve the arm, and resolve the blood a second time, when the opening of the vein has already closed, and the exit of blood becomes difficult, to press upon it with vehemence, and quickly bend or extend it.
Nam illud est malum ualde, imo dimitte ipsum, donec phlebotometur secundo.	For that is very bad; indeed, leave it, until it is phlebotomized a second time.
Aut remoue cum acuitate phlebotomi illud quod coagulatum est ex sanguine in orificio uenae, et pone super ipsum aliquid salis dissoluti in aqua.	Or remove with the sharpness of the phlebotomist that which is clotted from the blood in the opening of the vein, and place upon it some dissolved salt in water.
Et pone super ipsum aliquid ex tyriaca alfaroch, aut sagzenea, et pone ipsum compressione leni, donec egrediatur sanguis.	And place upon it something of tyriaca alfaroch, or sagzenea, and place it with gentle pressure, until blood comes forth.
Si uero iam apostemata est uena, tunc dimitte eam, et non tegas eam, donec sedetur apostema.	If however the vein is already suppurated, then leave it, and do not cover it, until the suppuration subsides.
Quod si necessitas prouocat ad soluendum sanguinem secundo, et non est excusatio, tunc aut phlebotoma ipsum supra illum locum, aut in brachio alio in uena alia.	If necessity provokes you to draw blood a second time, and there is no excuse, then either phlebotomize it above that place, or in another arm in another vein.
Funis autem brachii phlebotomatur loco Fuscae, et Basilicae, cum non inueniuntur, et sunt occultae, quoniam est composita ex eis.	However, the arm's vein is phlebotomized in the place of the Fusca and Basilica veins, when these are not found, and are hidden, since it is composed of them.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut intromittat infirmus manum suam in aqua calida, donec rubeat focile, et appareat uena manifeste.	And the quality of the phlebotomy is such that the weak person should immerse their hand in warm water, until the skin reddens easily and the vein becomes clearly visible.
Deinde stringatur super ipsam cum ligamento parum constrictione media.	Then a ligature is to be tied around it with moderate constriction.
Deinde phlebotoma secundum transuersationem paulatim, non latitudinaliter, neque secundum longitudinem: et sit apertio ampla, et sit phlebotomia tua qua eam phlebotomas super iuncturam manus parumper.	Then phlebotomize along a transverse cut, gradually, not laterally, nor lengthwise; and let the opening be wide, and let your phlebotomy be a little above the joint of the hand.
Quod si prohibetur exitus sanguinis, tunc itera manum in aqua calida, et dimitte sanguinem currere in aqua, donec consequaris necessitatem tuam.	If the flow of blood is stopped, then immerse the hand again in warm water, and let the blood run into the water until you achieve your desired outcome.
Si autem fueris in diebus aestatis, tunc excusaris ab iteratione manus in aqua calida.	However, if you are in the days of summer, then you are excused from repeating the immersion of the hand in warm water.
Et plurimum quidem ponitur cursus sanguinis in aqua calida in tempore hyemis.	And indeed, the flow of blood is most often placed in warm water in the time of winter.
Et phlebotomia huius uenae est saluior omnibus uenis, quoniam non est sub ea uena pulsatilis, neque neruus.	And phlebotomy of this vein is safer than all veins, since there is no pulsating vein nor nerve beneath it.
Phlebotomia uero Saluatellae manus dextrae, est conferens aegritudinibus epatis.	Phlebotomy of the Saluatella vein of the right hand is helpful for liver ailments.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut stringas mahason manus cum ligamento, aut manu tua, postquam tu intromittis eam in aquam calidam, donec infletur uena, et demonsteretur sensui ualde.	And the quality of its phlebotomy is such that you should tighten the mahason of the hand with a bandage, or with your hand, after you immerse it in warm water, until the vein swells, and is clearly visible to the sense.
Deinde phlebotoma eam transuersando.	Then, cut the vein transversely.
Et si incidis eam totaliter, non nocebit ei illud in aliquo.	And if you cut it completely, it will not harm it in any way.
Et conserua, ne ultimes manum tuam cum phlebotomo.	And be careful not to injure your hand with the lancet.
Sub ea enim sunt nerui digitorum denudati ex carne.	For under it are the nerves of the fingers, bare of flesh.
Deinde itera manum ad aquam calidam, et dimitte currere sanguinem in ea.	Then return the hand to warm water, and let the blood flow into it.
Nam si tu non iteras eam in aqua calida, coagulatur sanguis in orificio uenae, et prohibetur a cursu.	For if you do not return it to warm water, the blood clots in the vein's opening and is prevented from flowing.
Cum ergo extraxeris ex sanguine quantitatem necessitatis, tunc pone super uenam oleum et sal: ut non consolidetur uelociter.	When therefore you have extracted the necessary quantity of blood, then place oil and salt over the vein: so that it does not quickly solidify.
Et similiter oportet, ut facias cum omni ramo stricto.	And similarly it is necessary that you do with every tight branch.
Iuuamentum uero phlebotomiae eius ex manu sinistra, est: quoniam est conferens ad aegritudines splenis: et similiter fac in phlebotomia eius, sicut fecisti in secunda aequaliter.	The benefit of phlebotomy from the left hand, however, is: because it is beneficial to diseases of the spleen: and similarly, do in its phlebotomy as you did in the second equally.
Saphenae autem phlebotomiae iuuamentum, est ad aegritudines quae sunt in inferiori parte corporis, sicut aegritudines matricum, et retentionem menstruorum, et infirmitates renum, et ulcera coxarum et crurium antiqua, et similia ex aegritudinibus.	The benefit of saphenous phlebotomy, however, is for illnesses in the lower part of the body, such as illnesses of the womb, and retention of menses, and weaknesses of the kidneys, and old ulcers of the hips and legs, and similar illnesses.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut intromittat infirmus pedem suum in aquam calidam: et faciat super ipsum fricationem, donec exuberent uenae: et liga supra iuncturam pedis cum corrigia.	And the quality of its phlebotomy is that the sick person should immerse their foot in warm water, and apply friction to it until the veins swell, and tie above the joint of the foot with a strap.
Et uenae quidem locus est apud calcaneum, apparens uersus pollicem: et ramificantur ex ea in facie pedis rami multi.	And indeed the vein's location is near the heel, appearing towards the big toe, and branching from it into many branches on the foot's surface.
Phlebotoma ergo eam in ampliore ramo eius, aut apud calcaneum in aggregatione eius: quoniam est melius et saluius.	Therefore, phlebotomize it in its larger branch, or near the heel in its confluence, because it is better and safer.
Quod si phlebotomas eam in facie pedis, tunc caue a neruis qui sunt sub ea super faciem pedis.	If you phlebotomize it on the foot's surface, then beware of the nerves that are under it on the foot's surface.
Et pone phlebotomiam tuam qua eam phlebotomas ex transuerso, quasi tu uelis incidere eam: et sit phlebotomus Nesil.	And place your phlebotomy where you will phlebotomize it transversely, as if you wish to cut it: and let the phlebotomist be skilled.
Si autem prohibetur exitus sanguinis, tunc itera pedem eius in aqua calida: et dimitte sanguinem currere in eam, donec euacuatur.	If however the exit of blood is prohibited, then repeatedly immerse his foot in warm water, and allow the blood to flow into it, until it is evacuated.
Quod si errat uenam phlebotomator in prima uice, tunc iteret cum phlebotomia ad superiora parumper, nam locus est saluus, et non times ex eo maliciam, quando tu caues a neruis, sicut diximus.	If, however, the phlebotomist errs in the first instance, then repeat the phlebotomy a little higher up, for the place is safe, and you do not fear harm from it, when you beware of the nerves, as we said.
Et similiter cum Saphena pedis alterius aequaliter.	And similarly with the saphena of the other foot equally.
Venae autem Sciaticae locus, sicut diximus, est apud calcaneum ex latere syluestri.	The Sciatic vein's location, as we said, is near the heel on the outer side.
Et iuuamentum phlebotomiae eius est, ad dolorem anchae, quando est propter sanguinem calidum.	And the application of phlebotomy is beneficial for the pain of the hip, when it is due to hot blood.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut ingrediatur infirmus balneum, et festinet: et stringe crus eius a latere anchae usque supra calcaneum quatuor digitis, cum uitta subtili longa: non enim apparet nisi propter illud.	And the method of the phlebotomy is that the sick person should enter a bath and hurry; and tighten his leg from the side of the hip up to the heel by four fingers with a long thin bandage; for it does not appear unless because of that.
Quando ergo apparet, tunc phlebotoma eam secundum quodcumque ingenium est tibi possibile, aut secundum transuersionem: et est melius, aut ut incidas eam incisione, aut seces eam sectione.	Therefore, when it appears, then the phlebotomist should cut it according to whatever ability is possible for you, either transversely; and it is better either to pierce it with an incision, or to cut it with a section.
Locus enim eius est saluior, et ipsa est in pluribus hominibus occulta ualde.	For its location is safer, and it is very hidden in many people.
Quod si non inuenis eam, et non apparet sensui omnino: tunc phlebotoma aliquem ramum eius, et est ille qui apparet in dorso pedis, et uersus auricularem: et caue a neruis, et fac currere ex sanguine quantitatem quam uis.	If you do not find it, and it does not appear to the senses at all, then the phlebotomist should cut one of its branches, and that is the one which appears on the back of the foot and towards the ear; and beware of the nerves, and make the blood flow in the quantity that you wish.
Deinde solue stricturam, et pone super locum phlebotomiae corium, et stringe locum.	Then loosen the constriction, and place a skin over the phlebotomy site, and tighten the place.
Uelociter enim sanatur.	For it heals quickly.
¶ De Ventosatione, et qualitate usus eius.	Concerning Cupping, and the quality of its use.
Caput XCVIII.	Chapter XCVIII.
Uentosae fiunt ex cornibus, et ex aere, et ex uitro.	Cupping instruments are made from horns, and from air, and from glass.
Et Ventosatio quidem fit secundum duos modos.	And cupping indeed is done according to two methods.
Cum scarificatione, et extractione sanguinis: et alter est uentosatio sine scarificatione.	One with scarification, and the extraction of blood; and the other is cupping without scarification.
Et haec Ventosatio quae est sine scarificatione, est secundum duos modos.	And this cupping which is without scarification, is according to two methods.
Aut enim est cum igne.	For it is either with fire.
Aut est absque igne.	Or it is without fire.
Et uentosis quae administrantur cum scarificatione et extractione sanguinis sunt quatuordecim loca corporis.	And cuppings which are administered with scarification and the extraction of blood are fourteen places of the body.
Quorum unus est, Ventosatio Alnocrati, et est postremum capitis: et Alkehel, et est medium colli: et uentosae Alhagdahim, et sunt duae laminae colli a duabus partibus simul: et uentosae menti, et est sub mandibula in inferiori oris: et uentosae duarum spatularum: et uentosae Alachosos super finem caudae: et uentosae duorum focilium, et sunt medium duorum brachiorum: et uentosae duorum crurium: et uentosae duarum cauillarum.	Of which one is the cupping of Alnocrati, and it is at the back of the head; and Alkehel, and it is in the middle of the neck; and the cuppings of Alhagdahim, and they are two blades of the neck on both sides together; and the cuppings of the chin, and it is beneath the jaw in the lower part of the mouth; and the cuppings of the two shoulder blades; and the cuppings of Alachosos above the end of the tail; and the cuppings of the two armpits, and they are in the middle of the two arms; and the cuppings of the two thighs; and the cuppings of the two calves.
Et Ventosatio quidem non extrahit sanguinem tibi ex uenis minutis sparsis in carne, et propter illud non cadit uirtus ex eis, sicut est casus eius ex phlebotomia.	And indeed cupping does not extract blood from the tiny veins scattered in the flesh, and because of that no virtue is lost from them, as is the case with phlebotomy.
Neque oportet, ut administretur uentosatio siue cum igne, aut absque igne in aliqua aegritudinum quae fiunt ex repletione, donec euacuetur totum corpus.	Nor should cupping, whether with or without fire, be administered for any illness arising from fullness until the whole body is evacuated.
Quod si necessitas prouocat ad Ventosationem ex aegritudine, aut propter consuetudinem, administramus eam in omni hora in principio mensis, in fine eius, et in medio ipsius, et in quocumque tempore fuerit.	If necessity prompts cupping for an illness or because of custom, we administer it at any time during the beginning, end, or middle of the month, and at any time whatsoever.
Quod est, quia ex hominibus est qui quando multiplicatur in eo sanguis, donec indiget extractione eius per uentosationem, inuenit in capite suo grauedinem, et sodahan.	This is because there are people who, when blood accumulates in them until they need its extraction by cupping, find heaviness and dullness in their head.
Et ex eis est qui inuenit repletionem et rubedinem in facie sua, capite suo, et collo suo.	And among them are those who find fullness and redness in their face, head, and neck.
Et ex eis est qui inuenit pruritum in facie sua, et fronte sua, et tenebrositatem, et hebetudinem in oculis suis.	And among them are those who find itching in their face and forehead, and darkness and dullness in their eyes.
Et ex eis est qui scalpit locum uentosationis suae.	And among them is one who scratches the place of their cupping.
Et ex eis est cuius risus multiplicatur.	And among them is one whose laughter increases.
Et ex eis est qui inuenit gustum sanguinis in ore suo: aut apostematur lingua, et expuit sanguinem.	And among them is one who finds the taste of blood in their mouth: or the tongue is suppurated, and they spit blood.
Et ex eis est cuius somnus multiplicatur.	And among them is one whose sleep increases.
Et ex eis est qui uidet in somno suo sanguinem et rubedinem, et interfectos, et plagas, et quae sunt similia illis.	And among them is one who sees in their sleep blood and redness, and slain ones, and wounds, and things similar to those.
Quando ergo uidemus aliquid ex illis, et proprie si est in tertia media mensis: praecipimus tunc uentosationem fieri, postquam praeterierunt de die duae horae, aut tres.	Therefore, when we see any of these, and especially if it is in the middle third of the month, we then order a venesection to be performed, after two or three hours have passed during the day.
Iuuamentum autem Ventosationis nuchae, est: quoniam ipsa confert ad grauitatem in capite, et quod effunditur ad oculos.	The benefit of venesection of the nape of the neck is, because it contributes to the heaviness in the head, and what is discharged to the eyes.
At uero oportet, ut sit illud post euacuationem totius corporis.	But it is necessary for it to be after the evacuation of the whole body.
Et haec quidem Ventosa est loco phlebotomiae Cephalicae.	And this indeed is a ventosa in place of a cephalic phlebotomy.
Et non licet, ut utatur ea qui est frigidae complexionis, aut in quo est catarrus.	And it is not permitted to use it for one who is of cold disposition, or in whom there is a catarrh.
Nam infert ei nocumentum magnum.	For it brings him great harm.
Et propter illud non oportet, ut utantur ea senes, et in cuius capite sunt aegritudines frigidae.	And therefore it is not appropriate for the elderly to use it, nor for those with cold ailments in their heads.
Qui autem super eam fit assiduus, generatur super eum obliuio.	But whoever becomes assiduous over it, forgetfulness is generated in him.
Et propter illud oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ut deponat manum suam cum uentosa parumper ad inferiora, timendo ex generatione obliuionis.	And therefore it is necessary to instruct the wind-sucker to lay his hand a little lower with the wind, fearing the generation of forgetfulness.
Ventosatio aut Alkehel, est loco phlebotomiae Fuscae, et phlebotomiae Basilicae, et propter illud confert asmati, et constrictioni anhelitus, et fissurae instrumenti anhelitus, et tussi, et repletioni.	Wind-sucking, or Alkehel, is in the place of dark phlebotomy and basilica phlebotomy, and therefore it benefits asthma, and constriction of breathing, and fissure of the breathing instrument, and cough, and repletion.
Et oportet, ut impellatur Ventosa Alkehel parumper, quoniam si ponitur inferius, generat debilitatem in corde, et stomacho.	And it is necessary that the Alkehel cupping be impelled for a short time, because if it is placed lower, it generates weakness in the heart and stomach.
Ventosatio uero alhagdahim, confert doloribus accidentibus in capite, et obtalmiae, et hemigraneae, et perforationi, et dolori in radicibus dentium: et est loco phlebotomiae Basilicae.	Wind-sucking, however, of the alhagdahim, benefits accidental pains in the head, and ophthalmia, and hemiplegia, and perforation, and pain in the roots of the teeth: and it is in the place of basilica phlebotomy.
Et oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ne premat manum suam cum scarificatione: ut non incidat arteriam, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	And it is necessary that you instruct the wind-sucker not to press his hand with the scarification, so that he does not hit an artery, and a flow of blood occurs.
Ventosatio autem sub mento, confert alcolae in ore, et corruptioni gingiuae, et similibus eis ex aegritudinibus quae sunt in ore: et stat loco phlebotomiae alieherich, quae sunt in duobus labiis.	Wind-sucking under the chin benefits sores in the mouth, and corruption of the gums, and similar to them from diseases that are in the mouth: and it is in the place of alieherich phlebotomy, which are on the two lips.
Ventosatio autem spatularum, confert ad alchafacham, quae fit ex replexione, et caliditate.	Wind-sucking of the spatulas, benefits the alchafacham, which is produced from reflection and heat.
Ventosatio uero interiorum partium duorum focilium, confert iuuamentum phlebotomiae uenarum trium, Basilicae, et Fuscae, et Cephalicae: quoniam ipsa attrahit sanguinem ex omnibus illis uenis minutis, quae sunt in carne: et attrahunt illae uenae minutae ex uenis aliis grossioribus eis, donec peruenit attractio ad uenas tres.	Wind-sucking of the interior parts of the two foci, benefits the help of the phlebotomy of the three veins, Basilica, and Fusca, and Cephalica: because it attracts blood from all those small veins that are in the flesh: and those small veins attract from other larger veins than them, until the attraction reaches the three veins.
Et oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ne multum procedat in scarificatione: quoniam locus est denudatus carne, et sub eo sunt nerui et arteriae.	And it is necessary that you instruct the wind-sucker not to proceed much in the scarification, because the place is denuded of flesh, and beneath it are nerves and arteries.
Ventosa autem quae uentosatur super alchausos, confert hemorroidibus Ani, et ulceribus inferioribus.	A cupping that is applied over alchausos benefits hemorrhoids of the anus, and lower ulcers.
Et oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ut sit uentosa magna, et ut sit ex aere: quoniam locus indiget suctione forti, et fortasse franguntur Ventosae subtiles: et scarificetur scarificatione magna.	And it is necessary that you instruct the cupper that the cupping be large and made of air, because the place needs strong suction, and perhaps the small cupping vessels break: and it should be scarified with a large scarification.
Ventosae autem crurium minuunt diminutione manifesta: quoniam attrahunt sanguinem ex toto corpore, et conferunt doloribus antiquis in renibus, et matricibus, et uesica: prouocant menstrua, et conferunt bothor, et ademenul: et stant loco phlebotomiae duarum saphenarum, et alhorcobeni.	However, cupping of the legs produces a clear lessening: because they draw blood from the whole body, and benefit old pains in the kidneys, and the uterus, and the bladder: they induce menstruation, and benefit bothor, and ademenul: and they stand in place of phlebotomy of the two saphenous veins, and alhorcobeni.
Verumtamen debilitant corpus multum, et faciunt accidere syncopim in pluribus hominibus.	However, they weaken the body greatly, and cause fainting in many people.
Et Ventosarum alhorcobeni iuuamentum est propinquum iuuamento Ventosarum duorum crurium.	And the benefit of alhorcobeni cupping is close to the benefit of cupping both legs.
Qualitas positionis Ventosarum est, ut ponas uentosam in primis uacuam, et sugas suctione temperata: et non prolonges positionem uentosarum, sed pone eas uelociter, et remoue eas uelociter, ut ueniant humores ad locum aduentu aequali: et non cesses iterare illud et continuare, donec uideas locum iam rubere et inflari, et appareat rubedo sanguinis: tunc ergo scarifica, et itera suctione paulatim.	The quality of cupping is that you should place the cupping vessel initially empty and apply moderate suction; and do not prolong the application of the cupping vessels, but place them quickly and remove them quickly, so that the humors come to the place with equal arrival; and do not cease repeating this and continuing it until you see the place already reddened and swollen, and the redness of blood appears; then, therefore, scarify, and repeat suction gradually.
Deinde considera in dispositione corporum.	Then consider the disposition of the bodies.
Nam qui ex hominibus est tenerae carnis, rarorum pororum, oportet ut scarifices ipsum semel, non plus: ut non ulceretur locus.	For one who is of tender flesh, with rare pores, it is necessary to scarify him once, no more, so that the place is not ulcerated.
Et praecipe Ventosatori, ut amplificet scarificationem, et profundet parum: et temperet suctionem in facilitate, et uelocitate, et motu suaui.	And instruct the cupper to widen the scarification slightly, and to deepen it a little; and to moderate the suction with ease, speed, and smooth motion.
Quod si in sanguine est grossitudo, tunc oportet, ut scarifices ipsum bis.	If there is thickness in the blood, then it is necessary to scarify him twice.
In uice quidem prima aperitur uia subtiliationi sanguinis, et aquositati eius: et in secunda quidem perscrutationi exquisitae extractionis sanguinis grossi.	In the first instance, a path is opened to the thinning of the blood and its liquefaction; and in the second, to the thorough investigation of the extraction of thick blood.
Si uero sanguis est faeculentus ualde, tunc fiat scarificatio uice tertia: ut consequatur ultimum.	If the blood is very foul, then let the scarification be done a third time, so as to achieve the final result.
Et ad ultimum, quando uolumus extrahere sanguinem paulatim, uel parumper, sufficit nobis scarificatio una.	And finally, when we wish to extract blood gradually, or a little bit, one scarification is sufficient for us.
Quod si uolumus extractionem sanguinis multi, scarificamus scarificatione plurima.	If we wish for the extraction of much blood, we scarify with many scarifications.
Et si nos mensuramus, quod sanguis est grossus: tunc oportet, ut scarificetur scarificatione profunda: et terminus aequalis in scarificatione, est profunditas cutis.	And if we measure that the blood is thick, then it is necessary that it be scarified with a deep scarification; and the equal limit in scarification is the depth of the skin.
¶ Quid sit illud quod oportet administrari ex oleis apud positionem Ventosarum, et quid caueat uentosandus.	What is that which ought to be administered from oils at the application of cupping glasses, and what should the cupper beware of?
IN illo quidem cuius cutis est grossa, dura, fusca, et pori eius sunt stricti, oportet ut ungantur loca Ventosare cum oleis apertiuis, lenitiuis, resolutiuis: si est in tempore aestatis, sicut est oleum alkeiri, aut oleum uiolatum, aut oleum de amigdalis dulcibus, aut oleum de semine cucurbitae.	In that one whose skin is thick, hard, dark, and whose pores are narrow, it is necessary that the cupping places be anointed with opening, soothing, and resolving oils: if it is in the time of summer, such as the oil of alkeiri, or violet oil, or oil from sweet almonds, or oil from pumpkin seed.
Et si est in tempore hyemis, tunc oleum narcissinum, aut oleum de lilio, aut oleum camomellinum, aut sarbatinum: et eis similia.	And if it is in the time of winter, then narcissus oil, or lily oil, or camomile oil, or sarbantine oil: and similar to them.
Si uero superfluitas est grossa, frigida: tunc oleum sit amaracinum, aut oleum de balsamita aut oleum alben, aut oleum anetinum: et eis similia.	If however the excess is thick, cold: then the oil should be amaranth oil, or balm oil, or white oil, or anise oil: and similar to them.
Si uero uentosandus est amplorum pororum, tenerae carnis: tunc oportet, ut prohibeatur ab oleo, et oportet ut isti abluant loca Ventosarum earum post uentosationem cum aqua rosata, aut cum aqua frigida, aut cum aqua solatri, aut cum aqua cucurbitae, aut cum aqua portulacae: et similibus eis.	If however the cupper has large pores and soft flesh, then it is necessary that he abstain from oil, and it is necessary that these wash the cupping places afterward with rose water, or with cold water, or with soothing water, or with pumpkin water, or with purslane water: and similar to them.
Ille autem cuius sanguis est multae humiditatis, abluat uentosas cum aceto, aut cum aqua myrti, et sumach: et similibus eis.	But he whose blood is of much moisture, let him wash the cupping places with vinegar, or with myrtle water, and sumac: and similar to them.
Cuius autem superfluitates sunt grossae, abluat uentosas suas cum uino antiquo, aut cum aqua samsuci, aut decoctione aneti, aut camomillae: et eis similibus.	But he whose superfluities are thick, let him wash his cupping places with old wine, or with sorrel water, or with anise decoction, or chamomile: and similar to them.
Et oportet, ut caueatur uentosatio in balneo, aut in uestigio balnei, imo oportet, ut administretur post exitum ex balneo per horam, aut per horas duas.	And it is necessary that cupping be avoided in a bath, or in the vicinity of a bath; indeed, it is necessary that it be administered after leaving the bath by an hour, or by two hours.
Et non oportet, ut dormiat aliquis post uentosationem.	And it is not necessary that anyone sleep after cupping.
¶ Quid est quo oportet ut regatur Ventosandus, aut Phlebotomatus ante uentosationem.	What is it that cupping or bloodletting should be regulated before cupping?
ET post eam oportet, ut consideres in primis: tunc si Ventosatus, aut Phlebotomatus sit cholericus, et uincunt super sanguinem eius acuitas et inflammatio: tunc oportet, ut accipiat infrigidantia, sicut granatum muzum: et etiam endiuiam cum aceto et lactuca, et secaniabin, et iuleb: et eis similia.	And after it, it is necessary, first of all, to consider: then if the cupper or the bloodletter is choleric, and sharpness and inflammation conquer over his blood: then it is necessary that he take refrigerants, such as pomegranate juice: and also endive with vinegar and lettuce, and secaniabin, and iuleb: and similar to them.
Et pone cibaria eius pullos, et carnes ouium sekebiget, et cibos conditos cum agresta: et eis similia.	And place his food poultry, and mutton sekebiget, and seasoned foods with sorrel: and similar to them.
Et cuius complexio est frigida, oportet ut sumat in potu syrupum de melle, aut de almiua, aut alsecaniabin de seminibus factum: et sumat uinum odoriferum medium, quod est inter uetus et nouum: et praecipiatur, ut utatur paucitate cibi.	And whose complexion is cold, it is necessary that he take in drink syrup of honey, or of almiua, or alsecaniabin made from seeds: and let him take medium fragrant wine, which is between old and new: and let it be prescribed that he use a small amount of food.
Et pone cibum eius pullos, et canebir: et passeres, id est, paruas aues: et pullos columborum issiadebet.	And place his food poultry, and canary birds: and sparrows, that is, small birds: and young pigeons issiadebet.
Et oportet, ut potus die uentosationis et phlebotomiae plus sit quam cibus: et oportet, ut detur in potu in quibusdam hominibus in horis tyriaca alfaroch, aut medicamen de musco, id est, muscata, aut alesselithe ante uentosationem: et ante phlebotomiam, aut post: ut confortentur membra principalia, et subtilietur sanguis.	And it is necessary that the drink on the day of cupping and bloodletting be more than the food: and it is necessary that in some men's drink be given in the hours tyriaca alfaroch, or medicine from musk, that is, musk, or alesselithe before cupping: and before bloodletting, or after: so that the principal limbs may be strengthened, and the blood refined.
Et non oportet, ut sumant eam in potu calefacto.	And it is not necessary that they take it in heated drink.
¶ De Ventosis sine scarificatione.	Concerning cupping without scarification.
Uentosae autem quae sunt sine scarificatione, sunt Ventosae quae ponuntur super epar, et splenem, et podagram, et super uentrem, umbilicum, et loca renum, et pixidem anchae: quoniam ista membra non sufferunt scarificationem super se.	However, cupping without scarification are cupping that are placed upon the liver, and spleen, and gout, and upon the belly, navel, and kidney regions, and the chest cavity: since these limbs do not tolerate scarification upon them.
Et non quaeritur per eas, nisi aut attactio ex membro sanguinis ad membrum: sicut ponimus Ventosam super mammillas in aegritudine fluxus sanguinis narium.	And they are not sought for, unless either the attachment of blood from a member to a member: just as we place cupping upon the breasts in an illness of nosebleed.
Et utimur eis, ut soluamus a membro uentositatem frigidam inuiscatam in membro: sicut ponimus uentosam super uentrem, et umbilicum.	And we use them to dissolve cold, viscous windiness in a limb: such as placing a cupping on the stomach and navel.
Ipsa enim rarificat membrum, et calefacit ipsum, et remouet dolorem propterea, quia resoluit illam uentositatem.	For it itself rarefies the limb, and heats it, and removes the pain therefore, because it dissolved that windiness.
Etiam ponitur super renes, quando accidit in eis opilatio, aut lapis.	It is also placed upon the kidneys, when obstruction or a stone occurs in them.
Uirtute enim attractionis suae fortasse aperit opilationem, aut eradicat lapidem ex loco suo.	For by its power of attraction perhaps it opens the obstruction, or uproots the stone from its place.
Et similiter facit quando ponitur super epar, et splenem apud uentositatem terendam in eis utrisque.	And similarly it acts when placed upon the liver and spleen when windiness is to be broken in both of them.
Et istae Ventosae administrantur uacuae cum sectione tantum.	And these cupping instruments are administered empty with only a cut.
Et quandoque administrantur cum igne.	And sometimes they are administered with fire.
Et quandoque administrantur plenae aqua tepida in aegritudinibus pleuresis: et illud est, ut impleatur Ventosa, et sit magna, aqua calida sola, aut aqua in qua decoctae sint herbae quae conueniunt.	And sometimes they are administered full of lukewarm water in diseases of pleurisy; and that is, so that the cupping instrument is filled, and is large, with just warm water, or with water in which herbs suitable for the condition have been boiled.
¶ Forma Ventosae administratae cum igne.	Form of cupping instrument administered with fire.
Sit amplitudo orificii eius duorum digitorum apertorum, secundum quod formauimus: et quantitas eius in profundo sit medietas palmi: et sit in latere eius in loco qui est circiter medium eius, foramen paruum, secundum quantitatem quod ingrediatur ipsum acus: fiat ex aere simul, aut citrino, grossorum marginum, lenium, aequalium, tersorum: ut non laedat membrum apud positionem suam super ipsum: et sit in medio eius uirga transuersa ex aere, aut ferro, ubi ponitur candela cum igne.	Let the width of its opening be two open fingers, according to what we have formed; and let its depth be half a palm; and let there be a small hole on its side, at a point approximately in its middle, in proportion to what an awl will enter; let it be made of brass or tin, with thick, smooth, equal, and polished edges, so that it does not injure the limb where it rests upon it; and let a transverse bar of brass or iron be in its center, where a candle with fire is placed.
Et iam fit haec uentosa magna, maior ea quam narrauimus, et parum minor illa, secundum aegritudines et aetatem eius qui utitur.	And now this cupping instrument is made large, larger than the one we have described, and slightly smaller than that, according to the illnesses and the age of the one who uses it.
Ventosae enim puerorum, et extenuatorum sunt aliae, quam uentosae uirorum, et grossorum corporum.	For the cupping instruments of children and those who are thin are different from the cupping instruments of men and those with large bodies.
Qualitas autem ponendi hanc uentosam cum igne super membrum, est, ut accendas licinium cum igne ex lino decenter, aut candelam paruam ex caera: et pone eam super medium uirgae transuersae quae est in medio uentosae: ut sit accensus ignis circiter inferiorem partem uentosae, ut non comburatur corpus infirmi.	The method of placing this cupping instrument with fire on the limb is as follows: light a wick with fire, made of linen properly, or a small candle of wax; and place it over the middle of the transverse bar that is in the middle of the cupping instrument; so that the fire is ignited approximately at the lower part of the cupping instrument, so that the sick person's body is not burned.
Deinde ponatur super membrum: et digitus sit super foramen quod dixi, donec quando tenemus uentosam: dum indigemus, auferamus digitum, et egredietur uapor super illud foramen, et soluetur uentosa statim.	Then it is placed on the limb; and a finger should be placed on the opening that I mentioned, until when we hold the cupping instrument; as long as we need it, we should remove the finger, and vapor will come out through that opening, and the cupping instrument will be released immediately.
Deinde igni licinium secundum modum suum, et itera eam, si indiges illa.	Then light the linen wick according to its method, and repeat it if you need it.
In Ventosa autem quae administratur in aegritudine pleuresis cum aqua, non est uirga transuersa, neque foramen: et non administratur, nisi quia impletur aqua, et ponitur super membrum tantum.	However, in the cupping instrument administered for pleurisy with water, there is no transverse bar, nor an opening; and it is not administered unless it is filled with water, and placed on the limb only.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form.
Et haec Ventosa quanto plus est magna, ut capiat aquam multam, est melior.	And the larger this cupping instrument is, so that it can hold a lot of water, the better it is.
¶ De suspensione Sanguisugarum.	Concerning the suspension of leeches.
Caput XCIX.	Chapter Ninety-Nine.
Sanguisugae non administrantur in pluribus, nisi in quibus membris non est possibilis positio uentosarum, propter paruitatem eorum, sicut labium, et gingiua, et eis similia.	Leeches are not applied in multiple locations unless in those limbs where the application of cupping is not possible, due to their small size, such as the lip, and the gums, and similar parts.
Aut in membro denudato a carne, sicut digitus, et nasus, et eis similia.	Or on a limb stripped of flesh, such as the finger, and the nose, and similar parts.
Et qualitas utendi eis est: ut ueneris ex Sanguisugis quae sunt in aquis dulcibus, mundis a putredinibus.	And the quality of using them is: that you obtain leeches which are from fresh, clean, putrid-free waters.
Deinde dimittantur die et nocte in aqua dulci, donec famelicae sint, et non remaneat in uentre earum aliquid.	Then let them be placed in fresh water by day and by night, until they are hungry, and nothing remains in their bellies.
Deinde euacuetur corpus in primis cum phlebotomia, et cum uentosis.	Then the body should be emptied first with phlebotomy, and with cupping.
Deinde absterge membrum infirmi, donec rubeat.	Then cleanse the sick limb until it is red.
Postea ponantur super ipsum.	Afterwards, place them upon it.
Cum ergo implentur, et cadunt, et est possibilis suctio loci cum uentosa, tunc est magis ultimum in iuuamento: et si non, tunc ablue locum cum aceto.	Therefore, when they are filled, and fall, and suction of the place with cupping is possible, then this is most beneficial; and if not, then wash the place with vinegar.
Deinde cum aqua multa, et fricetur, et exprimatur.	Then with much water, and it shall be rubbed, and squeezed out.
Quod si prolongatur cursus sanguinis post casum Sanguisugarum, et est illud resudando: tunc infunde pannum lini in aqua frigida, et pone ipsum desuper, donec abscindatur resudatio.	If the course of blood, after the fall of the Sanguisugarum, and it is by oozing: then pour a linen cloth into cold water, and place it above, until the oozing is cut off.
Quod si multiplicatur sanguis, tunc pulueriza super ipsum zegi tritum, aut gallas, et similia eis ex stipticis: donec abscindatur sanguis.	If the blood multiplies, then powder on it ground zegi, or gall nuts, and things similar to them from astringents, until the blood is cut off.
Aut ponantur super locum medietates fabarum excorticatarum: et dimittantur, donec adhaereant fabae in loco, nam sanguis abscinditur.	Or, place on the place the halves of shelled beans, and let them remain, until the beans adhere to the place, for the blood is cut off.
Et oportet si necessaria est iteratio Sanguisugarum, quando est possibile, mutare eas.	And it is necessary, if a repetition of Sanguisugarum is necessary, when possible, to change them.
Si autem prohibentur Sanguisugae a suspensione, tunc abstergatur locus cum sanguine recenti.	If, however, leeches are prevented from being suspended, then the place should be wiped with fresh blood.
Aut fige acum in locis, donec egrediatur aliquid ex sanguine.	Or, pierce the place with a needle, until something comes out of the blood.
Deinde ponantur, nam ipsae quando sentiunt aliquid ex sanguine, adhaerent statim.	Then they are placed, for when they feel something from the blood, they immediately adhere.
Quando ergo uis ut cadant, pulueriza super eas aliquid ex aloe trito, aut salem, aut cinerem: et cadent statim.	When therefore you wish them to fall off, sprinkle something of crushed aloe, or salt, or ashes on them: and they will fall off immediately.

¶ Liber Chirurgici Albucasis Pars III.	Book of the Surgery of Albucasis, Part III.
¶ Sermo uniuersalis de restauratione, et dislocatione, et curatione torsionis, et similibus.	A universal discourse on restoration, and dislocation, and the treatment of twisting, and similar things.
Caput I.	Chapter 1.
Hoc Capitulum etiam multotiens est necessarium in arte Medicinae, et est restauratio fracturae, et dislocationis accidentium in ossibus.	This chapter is also very necessary in the art of medicine, and it is the restoration of fractures and dislocations of accidents in the bones.
Scitote o Filii, quia iactant se de hoc Capitulo stolidi medicorum et uulgi, et qui non inspexerunt unquam antiquorum librum, neque legerunt ex eo literam.	Know, O children, that the foolish physicians and the common people boast about this chapter, and those who have never examined the ancient book, nor read a letter from it.
Et propter hanc caussam fit, quod iste modus ex scientiis in terra nostra est priuatus.	And for this reason, this method is private among the sciences in our land.
Et ego non obuiaui in eo unquam bono omnino, et non adeptus sum ex eo illud, quod sum adeptus nisi propter longitudinem lectionis librorum antiquorum, et studium super intellectum eorum, donec extraxi scientiam illius ex eis.	And I never encountered any good in it at all, and I did not obtain that which I have obtained from it except because of the length of reading ancient books and the study beyond understanding them, until I extracted the knowledge of it from them.
Deinde adhaesi experimento et studio longitudine uitae meae.	Then I adhered to experiment and study for the length of my life.
Et iam descripsi uobis ex illo in hoc Capitulo totum quod continet scientia mea: et super quod praeteriit experimentum meum, postquam abbreuiaui illud uobis, et liberaui illud ex occupatione elongationis, et abbreuiaui illud fine abbreuiationis, et ostendi illud fine declinationis: et formaui in eo formas multas ex formis instrumentorum quae administrantur in eo, cum sit ex additione declinationis, sicut feci in duobus Capitulis praecedentibus.	And now I have described to you from it in this chapter all that contains my knowledge: and upon which my experiment has passed, after I have abbreviated it for you, and liberated it from the occupation of elongation, and abbreviated it to the end of abbreviation, and shown it at the end of declination: and I have formed in it many forms from the forms of instruments which are administered in it, since it is from the addition of declination, as I did in the two previous chapters.
¶ Summae, et collectiones ex esse fracturae ossium, ex eis quarum praemissio necessaria est, antequam incipiamus rememorationem membrorum fractorum, et diuersorum, si uniuscuiusque.	Summaries, and collections from the being of broken bones, from those of which a premise is necessary, before we begin the recollection of broken limbs, and diverse, if of each one.
Caput II.	Chapter II.
Oportet, ut dicamus in prologo huius Capituli, summas sermonis, et capitula, ad quarum intellectum cogitur in primis artifex ad stationem super earum ueritatem: scilicet ut uos, et qui sunt prompti, sciant, uel addiscant hanc artem nobilem, et alii a uobis.	It is necessary, as we say in the prologue of this chapter, that the summaries of the discourse and the chapters, the understanding of which the artisan is compelled in the first instance to attain in relation to their truth: namely, so that you, and those who are ready, may know, or learn, this noble art, and others from you.
Dico, ergo, quod quando accidit alicui fractura, aut dislocatio, aut torsio, aut casus: tunc oportet, ut properes in primis ad phlebotomandum eum, et soluendum ipsum, aut utraque simul: si non prohibeat aliquid, sicut debilitas uirtutis: aut est ille cui accidit aliquid ex illis puer, aut senex decrepitus: aut est tempus uehementis caloris, aut uehementis frigoris ualde.	I say, therefore, that when a fracture, or dislocation, or twisting, or fall, happens to someone, then it is necessary, in the first instance, to hasten to bleed him, and to loosen him, or both together: if nothing prohibits it, such as weakness of strength; or is he to whom something of those things happens a child, or a decrepit old man; or is the time of vehement heat, or vehement cold very much.
Deinde sit contentus in cibo suo, oleribus frigidis, et carnibus auium, et haedorum: et prohibe uinum, et carnes grossas, et repleri ex cibis et omni cibo qui replet uenas sanguine.	Then let him be content in his food, with cold vegetables, and the flesh of birds, and of kids: and prohibit wine, and coarse meats, and to be filled with food and any food that fills the veins with blood.
Donec quando securus sis ex apostemate calido, et non times effusionem materiei ad membrum: tunc redeat infirmus ad regimen suum primum cum quo cucurrit consuetudo eius.	Until when you are sure of the hot abscess, and do not fear the effusion of matter to the limb: then let the sick man return to his first regimen with which his custom ran.
Cum ergo incipit os fractum restaurari, tunc oportet, ut cibetur infirmus cibis nutrientibus nutrimento multo, grosso, graui, in quibus sit uiscositas: sicut cibaria facta ex tritico cocto cum aqua, et rizum, et capita, et pedes, et uentres uaccarum, et oua, et pisces recentes: et uinum grossum, et similia illis.	When, therefore, the fractured bone begins to be restored, then it is necessary that the sick person be fed with nourishing foods, with much, thick, heavy nourishment, in which there is viscosity: such as foods made from cooked wheat with water, and rice, and heads, and feet, and bellies of cows, and eggs, and fresh fish: and thick wine, and things similar to them.
Cum hoc enim regimine fit coagulatio fracturae uelocius, et melius.	For with this regimen the coagulation of the fracture is done more quickly and better.
Et scias, quod ossa fracta, quando sunt in uiris qui sunt in prima senectute, et decrepitis, non est possibile, ut continuentur et consolidentur secundum naturam suam semper, propter exiccationem membrorum eorum: et consolidantur et continuantur quae ex eis sunt in fine lenitatis, sicut ossa puerornm paruorum.	And know that fractured bones, when they are in men who are in early old age, and decrepit, it is not possible that they be joined together and consolidated according to their nature always, on account of the drying up of their limbs: and those which are in them at the end of gentleness are consolidated and joined together, like the bones of small children.
Verumtamen natura annectit super os fractum ex omni parte aliquid simile glutino, in quo est grossitudo, quo adhaeret et stringit ipsum, donec conglutinantur adinuicem, et ligantur adinuicem, donec uenit in fine fortitudinis et firmitudinis, sicut fuit in primis, donec non prohibet ipsum aliquid ab operationibus suis: et propter hanc caussam est necesse, ut ponas nutrimentum infirmi cibaria, in quibus sunt grauitas, et uiscositas, et grossitudo, sicut diximus.	However, nature attaches something like glue, in which there is thickness, to the fractured bone from every side, by which it adheres and binds it, until they are glued together and bound together, until it reaches the end of strength and firmness, as it was at first, until nothing hinders it from its functions: and for this reason it is necessary that you place the sick person's nourishment, foods in which there is heaviness, and viscosity, and thickness, as we have said.
Et scias, quod fracturae species sunt diuersae, secundum diuersitatem membrorum: quoniam fractura cruris, est diuersa a fractura ossis capitis: et fractura ossis pectoris, est diuersa a fractura ossis dorsi: et similiter reliqua membra omnia diuersa existunt adinuicem: et ego ueni cum rememoratione omnis speciei fracturae expositae in Capitulo suo distinctae ab alia.	And know that fractures are of different kinds, according to the diversity of the limbs: for the fracture of the leg is different from the fracture of the skull; and the fracture of the breastbone is different from the fracture of the spine; and similarly all the other limbs are different from each other: and I have come with a recollection of every kind of fracture, set out in its own chapter, distinct from another.
Et diuersificantur species fracturae ossis etiam in seipsa.	And the types of bone fractures are diversified even within themselves.
Quoniam fit fractura eius arcuata, praeter quod accidant in ea astellae.	Because its fracture occurs arched, besides which splinters occur in it.
Et quandoque fit fractura eius secundum longitudinem ossis: et sunt fracturae eius satagiae, id est, astellae, et additiones procedentes, sicut sunt in calamo, cum aptatur cultello ad scribendum.	And sometimes its fracture occurs along the length of the bone: and its fractures are splintery, that is, splinters and additions proceeding, as they are in a reed, when it is sharpened with a knife for writing.
Et non procedentes: et est fractura cum uulnere et disruptione in capite: et est fractura fissura parua.	And not proceeding: and there is a fracture with a wound and disruption at the head; and there is a fracture of a small fissure.
Et omni speciei est ingenium, uel instrumentum proprium in restauratione eius, secundum quod ueniet rememoratio eius, distincta in locis suis.	And each type has its own nature or instrument in its restoration, according to which its recollection will come, distinct in their places.
Et ex eo quo cognoscitur fractura ossis, est tortuositas eius, et ipsius eminentia: et apparitio eius sensui, et sonitus eius quando comprimis ipsum manu tua.	And from that by which the fracture of the bone is known, is its twisting, and its own prominence; and its appearance to the senses, and its sound when you compress it with your hand.
Quando ergo non est in loco tortuositas apparens, neque sonitus apud tactum tuum cum tangis os cum agitatione, neque inuenit infirmus magnum dolorem: tunc non est illic fractura, imo possibile est, ut sit tortuositas, aut fissura parua: non ergo oportet, ut moueas ipsum cum manu et compressione omnino, imo pone super ipsum ex medicinis, quarum uenit rememoratio, post momentum illud quod conuenit loco: deinde stringatur strictura subtili.	Therefore, when there is no apparent twisting in the place, nor sound upon your touch when you touch the bone with agitation, nor does the infirm person find great pain there: then there is no fracture there, rather it is possible that there is twisting or a small fissure; therefore it is not necessary that you move it with your hand and compression at all, but rather place upon it from the medicines, of which recollection comes, after that moment which suits the place; then a delicate bandage is bound.
Et scias, quod locus quando arcuatur, et scinditur in duo, praeter quod accidant in eo satagiae, uerumtamen remouetur omnis pars a compari sua: tunc oportet tibi, ut incipias ab hora tua ad rectificationem eius, aequando ipsum antequam accidat ei apostema calidum.	And know that when a place is bent and split in two, besides what efforts occur in it, nevertheless, every part is removed from its mate; then it is necessary for you to begin from your hour to rectify it, straightening it before a hot abscess occurs on it.
Si autem accidat ei apostema calidum, tunc dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot, donec quiescat apoestema.	If however a hot abscess occurs on it, then leave it for a few days, until the abscess rests.
Deinde aequa ipsum secundum quemcunque modum potest ex lenitate et ingenio.	Then straighten it according to whatever way is possible by gentleness and ingenuity.
Et scias, quod restauratio eius, et ipsius aequatio, est facilior quam ossis, in quo accidunt satagiae.	And know that the restoration and straightening of it is easier than of a bone, in which efforts occur.
Deinde stringe ipsum, secundum quod ueniet tibi rememoratio eius.	Then bind it, according to how its memory comes to you.
Si uero in osse sunt satagiae, tunc necessaria est extensio huius membri fracti ex duabus partibus, si manus sit, aut pes: aut cum manu tua, si membrum est paruum: aut cum duobus funibus, aut cum fune et manu.	If however there are efforts in the bone, then the extension of this broken limb is necessary, from two parts, if it is a hand or foot; or with your hand, if the limb is small; or with two ropes, or with a rope and a hand.
Et sit positio tua qua ponis membrum super locum aequalem, secundum figuram suam naturalem, donec quando extenduntur partes membri fracti: tunc conare, ut redire facias illas additiones omni ingenio, et secundum quemcunque modum potes in locis suis: et caue secundum fortitudinem tuam, ne accidat super infirmum per operationem tuam dolor, neque laesio: et conare secundum fortitudinem tuam, ut applices unum duorum ossium cum socio suo, secundum meliores formas.	And let your position be such that you place the limb upon an equal place, according to its natural form, until when the parts of the broken limb are extended; then strive to restore those additions to their places with all ingenuity, and in whatever way you can; and beware, according to your strength, lest pain or injury befall the weak through your operation; and strive, according to your strength, to apply one of the two bones with its fellow, according to the better forms.
Et oportet in illa hora, ut tentes et tangas ipsum manu tua.	And it is necessary at that time to try and touch it with your hand.
Si ergo uides illic aliquid diuersum, rectifica ipsum, et aequa illud per quantitatem tuae uirtutis.	If therefore you see anything different there, rectify it and make it equal by the amount of your strength.
Et caue extensionem uehementem, et compressionem fortem, sicut faciunt multi stolidorum.	And beware of violent extension and strong compression, as many foolish ones do.
Multotiens enim faciunt accidere per operationem illam suam apostema calidum, aut contractionem in membro: sicut iam uidimus illud ex operationibus eorum multotiens.	For many times they cause a hot abscess or contraction in the limb through their operation, as we have already seen from their operations many times.
Deinde annecte post aequationem, et decentem operationem, et stricturam illius membri, et quietem, et tranquillitatem: et mone infirmum super ipsum.	Then bind after the equalisation, and proper operation, and constriction of that limb, and rest, and tranquility; and admonish the infirm one about it.
Et fac ipsum cauere, ne moueat ipsum in hora suarum uigiliarum, et somni sui apud reuolutionem suam, et agitationem suam, et apud egestionem suam, et omnes motus suos ultima uirtute sua.	And make him beware lest he move it in the hours of his waking, and his sleep at its turning, and his stirring, and at his excretion, and all his movements with all his strength.
Et ut caueat, ne sit positio membri positio cum qua sequatur dolor.	And that he beware that the limb's position not be one that brings pain.
Quod est, quia quando sentit in dispositione positionis membri dolorem, aut laesionem: tunc oportet, ut permutes ipsum ad dispositionem aliam ab illa cum qua non sentiat dolorem.	Because when he feels pain or injury in the position of the limb, then it is necessary that he change it to another position in which he does not feel pain.
Et caue cum illo, ut sit positio eius illa aequalis, recta: ut non accidat in membro tortuositas, quando restauratur.	And beware with him that his position be equal, straight, so that there be no twisting in the limb when it is restored.
Et qualitas stricturae membri fracti est, secundum quod narro.	And the quality of the fracture of the limb is as I describe.
Scias, quod membra fracta diuersificantur in paruitate sua, et eorum magnitudine, et ipsorum forma.	Know that fractured limbs differ in their smallness, and their size, and their shape.
Quae ergo ex eis sunt parua, sicut brachium, et digitus, et focile, et similia eis, tunc oportet, ut sit inuolutio panni mollis, subtilis.	Therefore, those of them that are small, such as the arm, and the finger, and the foot, and similar to them, then it is necessary that there be a wrapping of soft, thin cloth.
Quae autem ex eis sunt grossa, sicut coxa, et crus, oportet ut sit in eis inuolutio lata, dura.	But those of them that are large, such as the thigh and the leg, it is necessary that there be a broad, hard wrapping in them.
Quoniam ligamentum latum, connectit membrum magnum, et stringit ipsum ab omni parte strictura aequali, ita quod non ingreditur ipsum macula.	Because a broad ligament connects the large limb and binds it from every part with equal constriction, so that no spot enters it.
Deinde incipe post euacuationem tuam ab aequatione ponere linimentum conueniens ad illud, in stuppa leni super locum fracturae ipsius.	Then, after your evacuation, begin to place a suitable liniment on it, in soft linen over the place of the fracture itself.
Deinde incipe inuoluere ligamentum super locum fracturae ipsius tribus inuolutionibus, aut quatuor, secundum quod meretur membrum: et stringe manum tuam parumper cum ligamento.	Then begin to wrap the ligament over the place of the fracture itself with three or four wraps, according to what the limb deserves: and hold your hand briefly on the ligament.
Deinde uade cum eo ad partem superiorem a loco fracturae, et stringe minus quam fuit strictura tua, qua strinxisti locum fractum.	Then proceed with it towards the upper part from the place of the fracture, and bind less tightly than your constriction with which you bound the fractured place.
Deinde elonga te cum inuolutione a loco fracturae parumper, et mollifica stricturam paulatim, donec capias ex loco sano rem magnam.	Then draw back with the wrapping from the place of the fracture a little, and gradually loosen the constriction, until you take away a large part from the sound place.
Deinde accipe uittam aliam, et inuolue eam iterum super locum fractum inuolutionibus.	Then take another strip, and wrap it again over the fractured place with wraps.
Postea uade cum inuolutione ad partem inferiorem a fractura.	Afterwards, proceed with the wrap towards the lower part from the fracture.
Et sit operatio tua in strictura inuolutionis, et mollificatione eius, secundum quod diximus in inuolutione prima superiore.	And let your operation be in the constriction of the wrapping, and its loosening, according to what we said in the first wrapping above.
Deinde pone inter inuolutiones ex stuppa leni, aut panno, cum quo aequetur tortuositas fracturae, si est in ea tortuositas: et si non, non ponas in ea aliquid.	Then place between the wraps soft linen, or cloth, with which the twisting of the fracture is equalized, if there is twisting in it; and if not, do not place anything in it.
Deinde inuolue super ipsam uittam aliam.	Then wrap another strip over it.
Postea aequa super has inuolutiones astellas decenter factas statim, si non est in loco inflatio, neque apostema calidum.	Then place on top of these wraps properly made stars immediately, if there is no swelling in the place, nor a hot abscess.
Si autem in ea est inflatio, aut apostema: tunc pone super eam quod sedet illud apostema, et auferat inflationem: et dimitte eam aliquot diebus.	However, if there is swelling in it, or an abscess: then place over it that which will subdue that abscess and remove the swelling; and leave it for several days.
Deinde stringe super ipsam tunc astellas.	Then bind the stars over it.
Et sint Astellae ex medietatibus cannae latae, rasae, formatae sapienter: aut sint ex ligno unde fiunt cribra, quae fiunt ex pino, aut geraid, id est, ramis palmae, aut calingi: et sit amplitudo omnis Astellae, secundum hanc formam, et hanc eandem figuram.	And the stars should be made from the halves of broad canes, shaved and cleverly shaped; or they should be made of the wood from which sieves are made, which are made from pine, or gerard, that is, palm branches, or calingi; and let the width of each star be according to this form, and this same figure.
Verumtamen oportet, ut Astella quae ponitur super ipsam tracturam, sit grossior et latior parumper, quam reliquae Astellae: et longitudo Astellae sit secundum quod licet membro ex magnitudine et paruitate.	However, it is necessary that the star placed upon the wound itself be somewhat thicker and wider than the other stars; and the length of the star should be according to the size and shape of the limb.
Deinde stringe super Astellas cum uitta alia, secundum stricturam primam eandem.	Then bind over the stars with another bandage, in the same way as the first binding.
Deinde liga desuper cum filis decenter, secundum quod diximus de strictura: et est, ut sit strictura tua super locum fracturae plus: et quanto plus elongatur a fractura sit, strictura minor.	Then bind over it with threads properly, as we have said about the binding: and it is to be such that your binding is tighter over the place of the fracture; and the further away it is from the fracture, the looser the binding.
Et oportet, ut sint fila media in grossitudine et subtilitate, et sint ex lino molli.	And it is necessary that the threads be medium in thickness and fineness, and be of soft linen.
Quoniam si fila sunt grossa, sicut uidi ex operatione stolidorum ponentium fila sua ex chordis lini tortis, est error magnus: quoniam cadit strictura cum eis extra qualitatem.	For if the threads are thick, as I have seen from the practice of foolish men who put their threads of twisted linen cords, it is a great error; because the binding with them falls outside the proper quality.
Et fila subtilia iterum non conueniunt: quoniam tu non consequeris per stricturam cum eis illud quod uis.	And again, fine threads are not suitable, because you will not achieve with them through the binding that which you want.
Et non oportet, ut sit inter astellam et astellam minus quam digitus.	And it is not necessary that there be less than a finger's breadth between staple and staple.
Quod si laeditur infirmus per extremitates astellarum post stricturam in locis sanis: tunc pone sub eis ex stuppa leni, aut lana carminata, donec nihil laedatur ex illo.	If the patient is injured by the ends of the staples after the binding in healthy places, then place under them soft tow, or dyed wool, until nothing is damaged from it.
Quando autem est fractura cum uulnere, et accidit disruptio in cute, ego ueniam cum rememoratione eius in capitulo secundum singularitatem.	However, when there is a fracture with a wound, and a tearing occurs in the skin, I will come with a recollection of it in the second chapter concerning its singularity.
Et scias, quod non omne membrum fractum oportet ut stringatur cum astellis a primo die.	And know that not every fractured limb should be bound with staples from the first day.
Quod est, quia membrum quando est magnum, non oportet ut ponas superipsum astellas, nisi post quinque dies, aut septem, aut plus, secundum securitatem tuam ab euentu apostematis calidi.	Because when a limb is large, you should not place staples on it unless after five days, or seven, or more, according to your safety from the outcome of a hot abscess.
Et iste est modus emplastrorum, quibus restaurabant antiqui, quae ponuntur super fracturam et dislocationem.	And this is the method of plasters, by which the ancients restored those that are placed over a fracture and dislocation.
¶ Modus Emplastri communis abbreuiati, restaurans fracturam, conueniens pluribus complexionibus, praecipue mulieribus, et pueris: quoniam est ex eo super quod non uincit calor, neque frigus.	A method of a common abbreviated plaster, restoring a fracture, suitable for many complexions, especially women and children; because it is from that which neither heat nor cold overcomes.
Et est, ut accipias ex puluere molendini, et est medulla farinae quae pendet in parietibus molendini apud motum molae: et conficias ipsum sicut est, praeter quod cribelles ipsum cum albugine oui: et pone confectionem eius non spissam, neque subtilem.	And it is, to take from the mill's dust, which is the flour's medulla hanging on the mill's walls by the movement of the millstone: and to form it just as it is, except that you sieve it with egg white: and place its mixture not thick, nor thin.
Deinde utere eo.	Then use it.
¶ Modus Emplastri alius, restaurantis fracturam, et dislocationem, et torsionem.	Another method of plaster, restoring fracture, dislocation, and twisting.
Recipe almess, et laudani, et acaciae, et enulae, et mugath: et suc, omnium ana ʒ X myrrhae, et aloes amborum ana ʒ V et alethil ʒ XX terantur omnia, et cribellentur, et misceantur cum aqua alethil: aut cum albugine oui, si complexio infirmi est calefacta.	Take almonds, laudanum, acacia, enula, and mugath; and juice, of all, an ounce. Myrrh and aloes, of both, half an ounce. And alethil, twenty ounces. Grind all together, and sieve them, and mix with alethil water; or with egg white, if the patient's complexion is heated.
Deinde utere hoc emplastro.	Then use this plaster.
Nam ipsum est bonae compositionis, restaurat ossa fracta uelociter, et confert pluribus hominibus.	For it is of good composition, restores broken bones quickly, and benefits many people.
¶ Modus Emplastri alius, quod etiam confert fracturae et torsioni.	Another method of plaster, which also benefits fracture and twisting.
Recipe mugath, et mess, et alteae albae, omnium ana ʒ X myrrhae, et aloes amborum ana ʒ V acaciae ʒ VI boli armeni ʒ XX terantur omnia contritione multa, et cribellentur, et conficiantur cum aqua, aut albugine oui: et administrentur.	Take mugath, and mess, and white marsh-mallow, of all, an ounce. Myrrh, and aloes, of both, half an ounce. Acacia, six ounces. Armenian bole, twenty ounces. Grind all together with much grinding, and sieve them, and mix with water, or egg white: and administer.
¶ Modus Emplastri ad iuncturas, et ossa separata ex locis suis: et sedat dolorem accidentem eis, et scissuram ossis, et fracturam.	A method of plaster for joints and bones separated from their places; and it relieves the pain that occurs to them, and the splitting of bone, and the fracture.
Sumatur lana succida, et submergatur in aceto, et oleo decocto: et ponatur super locum.	Take wool, cut it, and immerse it in vinegar and boiled oil; and place it on the affected area.
Et in hoc quidem Emplastro non est uirtus restaurationis, sed est bonum in sedatione apostematis calidi: et expellit dolores proprie.	And in this plaster there is no virtue of restoration, but it is good for calming a hot abscess; and it expels pains properly.
¶ Modus Emplastri, quod restaurat os fractum.	A method of plaster that restores a broken bone.
Sume folia fici surdi, et folia papaueris syluestris: et tere omnia, et fac emplastrum ex utrisque.	Take leaves of wild fig and leaves of wild poppy; and grind them all, and make a plaster from both.
¶ Modus Emplastri abbreuiati, administrati apud restaurationem fracturae ossis: et quando tu uis resolutionem residui apostematis.	A method of a shortened plaster, administered in the restoration of a broken bone; and when you wish resolution of the remaining abscess.
Recipe radicis alteae, et camomillae, et florum uiolarum, et farinae herbi, omnium ana partem unam: terantur omnia, et conficiantur cum uino, si non est membrum calefactum.	Take root of marshmallow, and chamomile, and violet flowers, and herb flour, of each one part: let all be ground, and mixed with wine, if the limb is not inflamed.
Si uero est calefactum, tunc confice illud cum aqua coriandri humidi, aut cum aqua, et utere eo.	If however it is inflamed, then mix it with water of damp coriander, or with water, and use it.
¶ Modus Emplastri alius fortioris in resolutione, quam istud primum, quando accidit apostema durum apud restaurationem membri.	A different, stronger plaster for resolution, than this first one, when a hard abscess occurs during the restoration of the limb.
Recipe radicis alteae, et seminis lini, et balaustiae, et melliloti, et samsuci, et floris uiolarum, et camomillae, omnium ana, partem unam, terantur omnia, et conficiantur cum aqua salicis, aut cum aqua dulci, aut cum uino.	Take root of marshmallow, and linseed, and pomegranate rind, and melilot, and mallow, and violet flowers, and chamomile, of each one part: let all be ground, and mixed with willow water, or with fresh water, or with wine.
Totum illud secundum caliditatem membri, et quietem caloris eius.	All of that according to the heat of the limb and the calming of its heat.
Hippocrates uero non dixit in libro suo, quod ponatur super membrum fractum apud restaurationem eius, nisi caerotum factum ex caera, et oleo: non aliud: et narrauit, ut sit medium inter grossitudinem et subtilitatem.	However, Hippocrates did not say in his book that anything should be placed on a fractured limb during its restoration except a plaster made of wax and oil: nothing else.  And he related that it should be of a medium thickness or thinness.
Galeno autem uisum est, ut ponantur super membrum fractum apud restaurationem eius res, in quibus est exiccatio caliditatis, sicut myrrha, et aloes et olibanum, et similia eis ex eis quae narrauimus.	However, Galen considered that things should be placed on a fractured limb during its restoration, which dry out heat, such as myrrh, and aloes, and frankincense, and similar things to those which we have mentioned.
¶ Modus Emplastri quod confert ad laesionem et dolorem.	Method of the plaster which is beneficial for injury and pain.
Recipe mugath, et ciceris, et capillorum hominis incisorum, aut pennae auis, et alteae, et salis partes aequales: terantur, et cribellentur, et conficiantur: et fiat ex eo emplastrum.	Take mugwort, chickpeas, cut human hair, or bird's feathers, and marshmallow root, and salt, equal parts: grind, sieve, and mix: and make a plaster from it.
Quantitas autem secundum quam oportet, ut remaneat ligatura, deinde soluatur, est, ut consideres tunc, si non accidit infirmo dolor, neque pruritus, neque mouetur os fractum a loco suo: tunc non resoluas ipsum diebus multis.	However, the amount of time for which the bandage should remain, before being removed, is as follows: if the patient experiences no pain, no itching, and the fractured bone is not displaced from its position, then do not remove it for many days.
Quod si accidat ei in loco pruritus uehemens, aut dolor inquietans, aut inflatio: tunc propera, et solue in hora ipsum, et aufer emplastrum ab eo: et accipe pannum lenem, aut spongiam marinam lenem, humidam: et submerge eam in aqua tepida, et ablue cum ea locum, donec quiescat pruritus, et sedetur dolor.	But if he experiences intense itching, or disturbing pain, or swelling in the area, then quickly remove it immediately, and take the plaster away from him: and take a soft cloth, or soft sea sponge, wet: and immerse it in lukewarm water, and wash the area with it, until the itching subsides and the pain ceases.
Deinde dimitte membrum quiescere una hora.	Then let the limb rest for one hour.
Deinde pone super ipsum lanam succidam, submersam in aceto et oleo, aut oleo rosato: et liga super ipsum nocte una, donec sis securus ab apostemate calido, et quiescat inflatio membri, et remoueatur dolor eius.	Then place upon it cut wool, soaked in vinegar and oil, or rose oil: and bind it upon it for one night, until you are secure from a hot boil, and the limb's swelling subsides, and its pain is removed.
Deinde itera ipsum ad stricturam subtilem, et emplastrum paruum: et non stringas ipsum constrictione tua prima, et subtilia cum eo, donec sanetur.	Then again apply a subtle bandage, and a small plaster: and do not tighten it with your initial tightness, and make it subtle with it, until it is healed.
Quod si uides, quod apostema, et rubedo, et dolor, et inflatio, et omnia accidentia iam remota sunt penitus, et indiges emplastro et strictura, tunc itera illud sicut fecisti in primis aequaliter.	If you see that the boil, redness, pain, swelling, and all the other occurrences have completely disappeared, and you no longer need a plaster and bandage, then treat it again in the same manner as you did at first.
Quod si non accidit membro aliquid ex eis quae diximus, tune non soluas ipsum, nisi post tres dies, aut quatuor, aut quinque, aut septem.	If none of the things we have stated occur to the limb, then do not remove it, unless after three, or four, or five, or seven days.
Et quando que dimittitur uiginti diebus totum illud, secundum quod apparet tibi ex solutione membri, sicut diximus, donec quando adhaeret fractura, et approximat coagulatio carnis super eam: adde etiam tunc in strictura plus quam strictura tua prima tota: et adde etiam in ingrossatione cibi infirmi, secundum quod praecessit rememoratio eius.	And when twenty days have passed for all of it, according to what appears to you from the limb's release, as we have said, until when the fracture adheres and the flesh's coagulation nears it: then add also to the bandage more than your initial bandage entirely: and add also an increase in the nourishing food, in accordance with the previous remembrance of it.
Si autem uides locum fracturae iam exiccari, et extenuari plus quam oportet: tunc scias, quod nutrimentum prohibetur peruenire ad ipsum.	If, however, you see the fracture site already drying up and becoming more emaciated than necessary, then know that nourishment is prevented from reaching it.
Embroca ergo ipsum cum aqua tepida apud omnem uicem qua soluis ipsum, et sit illud in omnibus tribus diebus, et alleuia stricturam parumper.	Therefore, bathe it with lukewarm water every time you loosen it, and let it be for all three days, and slightly reduce the bandage.
Per hanc ergo operationem currit ad membrum nutrimentum, et sanatur uelociter.	By this operation, therefore, nourishment flows to the limb, and it heals quickly.
Illud autem quod faciunt stolidi restauratores ex fractura membri uice alia, quando non restauratur in primis, secundum quod oportet, et restauratur secundum tortuositatem, est error ex operatione eorum, et timor magnus: et si esset rectum, dixissent illud antiqui in libris suis, et operati fuissent cum eo.	However, that which foolish restorers do with a broken limb a second time, when it is not restored properly at first, and is restored according to a twisting, is an error of their operation and great fear: and if it were correct, the ancients would have said it in their books, and operated with it.
Et ego non uidi alicubi eorum uestigium in illo omnino, et rectius est, ut non fiat illud.	And I have seen no trace of it anywhere at all, and it is better that it not be done.
¶ De factura accidente in capite.	Concerning the accidental injury to the head.
Caput III.	Chapter III.
Species fracturae sunt diuersae, et figurae eius multae: et caussae eius sunt distinctae.	The types of fracture are diverse, and its shapes numerous; and its causes are distinct.
Nam ex fractura est quae fit a percussione cum ense: et percussio aufert os totum usquequo peruenit ad siphac, quod est sub osse, sicut facit axia in ligno: et propter illud nominatur haec species fracturae Axialis.	For there is a fracture which is caused by a blow with a sword; and the blow removes the bone completely as far as it reaches the siphac, which is beneath the bone, just as an axe does in wood; and because of that, this type of fracture is called Axialis.
Aut ensis incidit quiddam ossis, et incidit faciem eius, et non penetrat incisio usque ad ultimum eius: et nominatur haec species fracturae Kalaan, id est, Leuatio absolute.	Or the sword cuts a part of the bone, and cuts its surface, and the incision does not penetrate to its end; and this type of fracture is called Kalaan, that is, a simple elevation.
Et est uulnus duarum fracturarum, aut magnum, aut paruum.	And there is a wound of two fractures, either large or small.
Et ex fractura est, quae est contritio, aut attritio: et caussa eius est percussio cum lapide, aut casus super lapidem, aut eis similia.	And there is a fracture which is a crushing or abrasion; and its cause is a blow with a stone, or a fall on a stone, or similar things.
Et haec fractura est etiam aut penetrans, quae iam appropinquat panniculo, quod est sub osse: aut est in facie ossis: et est uulnus harum duarum fracturarum etiam aut paruum, aut magnum.	And this fracture is also either penetrating, which now approaches the tissue beneath the bone, or is on the surface of the bone; and the wound of these two fractures is also either small or large.
Et ex fractura est, quae est occulta in osse in subtilitate capilli: et est fissura parua, et propter illud nominatur haec species fracturae Capillaris.	And there is a fracture that is hidden in the bone to the fineness of a hair; and it is a small fissure, and because of that this type of fracture is called Capillaris.
Et ex eis est fractura, quae fit a casu, aut percussione lapidis, et eis similium, quae faciunt ingredi laminam ossis ad interiora, et fit loco concauitas: sicut accidit caldariis aeris, quando occurrit eis percussio, et ingreditur pars eorum ad interiora.	And of these there is a fracture that is made by a fall, or by the blow of a stone, and things similar to them, that causes a lamina of bone to enter inward, and a concavity is made; just as it happens with copper kettles when a blow strikes them, and part of them enters inward.
Et plurimum quidem fit illud in capitibus humidorum ossium, sicut sunt capita puerorum.	And this most often happens in the heads of moist bones, such as the heads of children.
Et fiunt omnibus istis speciebus fracturae satagiae separatae, et ego ueniam cum rememoratione illius totius in loco suo.	And all these types of fractures are separate efforts, and I will come with a recollection of it all in its proper place.
Et cognoscimus omnes has species fracturae per detectionem super eam, et inquisitionem earum cum tentis, et ablationem carnium corruptarum, quae sunt super eas.	And we recognize all these types of fractures through probing upon it, and examining them with probes, and the removal of corrupted flesh that is upon them.
Species uero Capillaris cognoscitur per hoc, quod detegitur super os, et abstergitur, et linitur super ipsum cum encaustro: fractura enim apparet nigra.	However, the capillary type is recognized by this, that it is detected upon the bone, and is scraped clean, and is anointed upon it with ink: for the fracture appears black.
In curatione autem fracturae, considera in primis accidentia infirmi: tunc si uides ex accidentibus quod significet significatione manifesta super timorem, sicut uomitus cholerae, et extensio, et amissio intellectus, et abscisio uocis, et syncopis, et febris acuta, et egressus oculorum, et rubedo eorum, et similia eis ex accidentibus in pluribus dispositionibus, proculdubio non sanatur: et si uides accidentia non terrentia te, et speras salutem: tunc incipe curationem eius.	In the treatment of a fracture, first consider the patient's symptoms: then, if you see from the symptoms that it signifies a clear sign of fear, such as vomiting, cholera, extension, loss of intellect, loss of voice, fainting, acute fever, eye discharge, redness of the eyes, and similar symptoms in various dispositions, undoubtedly it will not be healed.  And if you see symptoms that do not terrify you, and you hope for recovery, then begin its treatment.
Quod est, si uenit ad te uulneratus in primis cum uulneratur: et est illud in diebus hyemis, tunc oportet, ut studeas in ablatione ossis ante diem quartumdecimum secundum omnem dispositionem.	If a wounded person comes to you at first, when he is wounded, and it is in the days of winter, then it is necessary that you strive to remove the bone before the fourteenth day according to every disposition.
Et si est in diebus aestatis, tunc oportet, ut properes remouere os ante diem septimum, antequam corrumpatur quod est sub osse ex panniculo, et accidant illa accidentia quae narrauimus.	And if it is in the days of summer, then it is necessary that you hasten to remove the bone before the seventh day, before that which is under the bone from the tissue rots, and those symptoms which we have recounted occur.
Quod si fractura ossis iam peruenit ad panniculum tangentem cerebrum, et est cum minutiis, et attractione: tunc oportet, ut incidas partem comminutam, et attritam, secundum quod narro tibi.	If the fracture of the bone has already reached the tissue touching the brain, and is with fragments and grinding, then it is necessary that you remove the broken and ground part, according to what I tell you.
Et est, ut radas caput uulnerati: et detege super os secundum quemcunque modum possibile est tibi: et secundum figuram uulneris, et quod leue est super infirmum.	And you must shave the head of the wounded person and uncover the bone in whatever way possible for you, and according to the shape of the wound, and what is easy on the patient.
Quod si accidat tibi apud detectionem ossis fluxus sanguinis, aut apostema calidum: tunc oppone ei cum eo quod oportet.	If during the uncovering of the bone, a flow of blood or a hot abscess occurs, then apply to it what is necessary.
Et est, ut impleas locum cum pannis infusis in uino, et oleo rosato: et facias quiescere uulnus, donec sedetur apostema, et sis securus a fluxu sanguinis.	And you must fill the place with cloths soaked in wine and rose-water, and make the wound rest until the abscess subsides, and you are secure from the flow of blood.
Deinde incipe in curatione ossis, et ablatione eius.	Then begin in the treatment of the bone, and the removal of it.
Et illud fit secundum unum duorum modorum.	And that is done according to one of two methods.
Modus quidem unus est, ut incidas os cum Incisorio strictae aciei: et haec est forma eius.	One method is to cut the bone with a scalpel of a sharp edge: and this is its form.
Dende administra Incisorium aliud post Incisorum latius eo parumper: et haec est forma eius.	Then administer another scalpel, after the first scalpel, somewhat broader: and this is its form.
Deinde administra etiam Incisorium aliud latius etiam quam secundum.	Then administer yet another scalpel, broader even than the second.
Et modus secundus est, ut sit apud te numerus Incisoriorum diuersorum: quorum quaedam sint latiora quibusdam, et quaedam eorum breuiora quibusdam: et sint in ultimo acuitatis extremitatum suarum, et sint ex ferro indo, aut fuled: et utere facilitate in percussione super Incisorium, ut non concutiat caput, et laedat ipsum.	And the second method is that you have a number of different scalpels: some broader than others, and some shorter than others; and that they are sharp at the extreme ends of their blades, and are made of tempered or hard steel; and use ease in striking upon the scalpel, so that it does not strike the head and injure it.
Si autem os est forte, durum: tunc oportet, ut perfores in circumitu eius, antequam tu administres Incisoria, cum Terebris quae nominantur Terebra non profundantia: et non nominantur ita, nisi quoniam ipsa non pertranseunt terminum ossis carnei ad illud, quod est post ipsum: propterea, quod Terebro est extremitas rotunda super illud, quod est sub capite eius acuto, similis margini, et circulus paruus prohibet submergi, et pertransire spissitudinem ossis.	However, if the bone is strong, hard: then it is necessary that you pierce around it, before you administer the scalpels, with drills called drills that do not penetrate deeply; and they are not called thus, except because they do not pass through the boundary of the fleshy bone to that which is after it: because the drill has a rounded end on that which is below its pointed head, similar to a margin, and a small circle prevents it from sinking in, and passing through the thickness of the bone.
Et conuenit tibi, ut accipias ex istis Terebris numerum multum, quorum unumquodque conueniat quantitati spissitudinis ossis, donec praesens sit tibi omni craneo Terebrum: cuius extremitatis acutae quantitas in longitudine et breuitate sit, secundum quantitatem spissitudinis illius cranei.	And it is fitting for you to take from these drills a multitude, each suited to the thickness of the bone, until you have a drill present for every skull: whose pointed end in length and shortness should be according to the thickness of that skull.
Et haec est forma trium specierum Terebrorum, uel Trepanorum.	And this is the form of three kinds of drills, or trepans.
Qualitas autem perforandi in circumitu ossis fracti, est: ut ponas Terebrum super os, et reuoluas ipsum digitis tuis, donec scias, os iam penetratum esse.	The method of piercing around the fractured bone is: that you place the drill on the bone, and revolve it with your fingers, until you know that the bone has been penetrated.
Deinde permuta Terebrum ad locum alium, et pone quod est inter omne foramen quantitatem grossitudinis radii, aut circiter illud.	Then change the drill to another place, and place what is between every hole the thickness of a radius, or approximately that.
Deinde incide cum Incisoriis quod est inter omne foramen ex osse: et fac illud subtilius quam potes super illud ex fine leuitatis, sicut diximus, donec eradices os, aut manu tua, aut cum aliquo alio ex quibusdam instrumentis, quae parasti ad illud: sicut tenaliae, et forpices subtiles.	Then cut with the chisels what is between each hole from the bone: and make it finer than you can over it from the end of lightness, as we said, until you remove the bone, either by your hand, or with some other of the instruments that you have prepared for that, such as pliers and fine forceps.
Et oportet, ut caueas omni cautela, ne tangat Terebrum, aut Incisorium aliquid ex siphac.	And it is necessary that you be cautious with every precaution, so that the drill or chisel touches nothing of the siphac.
Cum ergo circumieris os perforando, et separatum fuerit a siphac, si fuerit continuum cum eo, et extraxeris ipsum, oportet ut radas, et aeques extremitatem eius quod remanet in osse cum instrumento alio simili Incisorio.	When, therefore, you have encircled the bone by piercing, and it has been separated from the siphac, if it has been continuous with it, and you have extracted it, it is necessary that you scrape and make even the extremity of that which remains in the bone with another similar instrument to the chisel.
Verumtamen oportet, ut sit tenuis et subtilis magis aliis Incisoriis.	However, it is necessary that it be thinner and more delicate than other chisels.
Quod si remanet aliquid ex ossibus paruis, et satagiae: tunc accipe ea cum facilitate, cum eo quod est apud te ex instrumentis.	If, however, there remains anything of small bones and splinters, then take them with ease, with that which is with you of the instruments.
Deinde cura uulnus post illud cum liciniis, et unguentis quae diximus.	Then treat the wound after that with the bandages and ointments which we have said.
Et modus alius operationis est facilis, prorsus longinquus a timore: quem dixit Galenus, et laudauit ipsum laude magna: et iste est sermo eius.	And another method of operation is easy, completely remote from fear: which Galen said, and praised it with great praise: and this is his statement.
Necese est tibi in primis, ut incipias detegere partem ossis ex loco, in quo fractura est uehementior, et manifestior: donec quando detexeris illam partem, et posueris sub eo extremitatem huius Incisorii lenticularis, cuius haec est forma.	It is necessary for you in the first place, that you begin to uncover the part of the bone in the place where the fracture is more violent and clearer; until when you have uncovered that part and placed under it the extremity of this lenticular chisel, of which this is the shape.
Et pars lenticularis, lenis non incidit aliquid: et pars acuta eius in duabus lateribus eius uadens in longitudinem, sicut uides: ut sit pars lenticularis innixa ad siphac, facie eius incidente acuta in osse.	And the lenticular part, smooth, does not cut anything; and its sharp part, going lengthwise along its two sides, as you see; so that the lenticular part rests on the siphac, its sharp face meeting the bone.
Deinde percute super Incisorium a parte una cum malleo paruo, donec incidas totum os cum facilitate, sicut reuoluitur: et tu sis securus ex panniculo, quod non accidat in eo accidens, quod timeas prorsus.	Then strike on the chisel from one side with a small mallet, until you cut the whole bone with ease, as it turns; and you be secure from the bandage that no accident occurs in it, that you fear completely.
Et si medicans non esset stultior hominum, et magis ignarus eius, nec esset dormiens, tunc si remaneret aliquid annexum ossi ex panniculo in quibusdam locis, incideret ipsum ab eo cum extremitate incisorii lenticularis ipsius, et liberaret ipsum ab eo cum facilitate.	And if the physician were not more foolish than men, and more ignorant of it, and were not sleeping, then if anything remained attached to the bone from the bandage in certain places, he would cut it from it with the extremity of his lenticular chisel, and free it from it with ease.
Liberatur enim ab eo sine nocumento, et absque timore.	For it is freed from it without harm, and without fear.
Et si fractura ossis non penetret usque ad panniculum, et illud quod abscinditur ab osse est facies eius, et remanent in ipso asperitas et satagiae subtiles: tunc oportet, ut radas illam asperitatem, et eradices illas satagias cum rasoriis subtilibus ex quibus praeparasti numerum diuersarum quantitatum, ut sit tibi possibile administrare ex eis in omni loco conuenientiora eorum, et rectiora ipsorum, secundum illud ad quod perducit te operatio, et ipsum os fractum, et figura eius.	And if the fracture of the bone does not penetrate to the bandage, and that which is cut away from the bone is its face, and there remain on it roughness and fine irregularities: then it is necessary that you smooth out that roughness, and eradicate those irregularities with fine razors from which you have prepared a number of different sizes, so that it is possible for you to administer from them in every suitable place the best and straightest of them, according to that to which the operation leads you, and the fractured bone itself, and its shape.
Et oportet, ut administres in rasione tua, qua in primis radis os, latius illorum rasoriorum.	And it is necessary that you administer in your judgment, in which you first scrape the bone, more widely than those razors.
Deinde utere post ipsum subtiliore eo.	Then use after it a finer one.
Et non cesses facere illud secundum continuitatem, donec peruenias ad administrandum tenuius, et subtilius eorum omnium.	And do not cease to do it according to continuity, until you arrive at administering the thinnest and finest of them all.
In unaquaque autem fissurarum reliquarum paruarum capillarium, et fractura subtili, oportet ut administres curam, secundum illud quod perducit ad rectificationem eius.	In each of the remaining small fissures, and fine fractures, it is necessary that you administer care, according to that which leads to its rectification.
Et est res quae non occultatur super omnem, cui in hac arte est quodlibet studium, et stetit super illud quod scripsimus, et ostendimus in fracturis magnis.	And it is a matter not hidden from everyone who has any concern in this art, and has stood upon what we have written and shown in large fractures.
Si autem panniculus detectus retinetur, quando tu eradicas os: tunc oportet, ut accipias pannum lini, secundum quantitatem uulneris, et submerge ipsum in oleo rosa, et pone ipsum super orificium uulneris.	If, however, the flap is retained when you remove the bone, then it is necessary to take a linen cloth, according to the size of the wound, and immerse it in rose oil, and place it over the wound opening.
Deinde accipe pannum alium duplicatum, aut triplicatum, et submerge ipsum in uino et oleo rosa, et pone ipsum super pannum primum: et fac illud quam facilius potes super illud, ut non grauetur siphac.	Then take another cloth, doubled or tripled, and immerse it in wine and rose oil, and place it over the first cloth: and do it as easily as you can on it, so that it is not burdened by this.
Deinde administra supra ipsum ligamentum latum: et non stringas ipsum, nisi per quantitatem quae teneat uulnus tantum: et dimitte ipsum cum hac cura die uno, aut diebus duobus, donec sis securus ab apostemate calido.	Then administer a wide bandage over it: and do not tie it, except to the extent that it merely holds the wound together: and leave it with this treatment for one day or two days, until you are sure of being free from a hot abscess.
Deinde solue ipsum, et administra post illud medicinas cum quibus est superflua siccitas: sicut radices lilii, et farina herbi, et puluis thuris, et aristolochia, et similia eis: et est, ut facias ex istis medicinis puluerem, qui puluerizetur super uulnus sicut sunt siccae.	Then loosen it, and administer after it medicines with which superfluous dryness is relieved: such as lily roots, and herb flour, and frankincense powder, and birthwort, and similar to them: and it is so that you make a powder from these medicines, which is powdered over the wound as if they are dry.
Et uniuersaliter administra in illo omnem medicinam de proprietate cuius est ut abstergat, et non mordicet.	And universally administer in it any medicine whose property is to cleanse, and not to bite.
Et caue secundum tuam uirtutem, ut uulnus in curatione tua sit limpidum: neque sit in ea sordes unguenti, neque sordicies.	And carefully, according to your ability, ensure that the wound in your treatment is clean: neither be there any filth of ointment, nor any dirt.
Neque dimittas uirus aggregari in eo omnino: quoniam quando uirus aggregatur super panniculum cerebri, corrumpit eum, et putrefacit ipsum, et accidit super infirmum post illud malicia magna: et iam accidit in siphac capitis, cum mundificatur ab eo os, praecipue quando negligitur cura eius, nigredo in superficie eius.	Nor allow any infection to accumulate in it at all: because when infection gathers on the brain membrane, it corrupts it, and makes it putrid, and great harm comes upon the sick person afterwards: and this happens in a head wound, when the bone is freed from it, especially when its treatment is neglected, a blackness on its surface.
Considera ergo tunc, si accidunt infirmo accidentia quae diximus, scias, quia est pernitiosum proculdubio.	Therefore, consider then, if the ailments we have mentioned befall the sick person, know that it is undoubtedly dangerous.
Et si nigredo non accidit, nisi a medicina quae ponitur super ipsum, et est in uirtute illius medicinae, ut faciat illam nigredinem: tunc oportet, ut accipias ex melle partem unam, ex oleo rosato partes tres, et linias cum eis pannum.	And if the blackness does not occur except from the medicine placed upon it, and it is in the nature of that medicine to produce such blackness: then it is necessary to take one part of honey, three parts of rose oil, and linen with them.
Deinde pone ipsum super siphac: postea cura ipsum cum speciebus curationis quae conueniunt, donec sanetur.	Then place it upon the wound: afterward treat it with the kinds of treatment that are suitable until it is healed.
¶ De restauratione Nasi quando frangitur.	Concerning the restoration of the Nose when it is broken.
Caput IIII.	Chapter IV.
Scias, quod non franguntur ex Naso nisi duae partes eius superiores simul, aut una earum: propterea, quod ipse sunt duo ossa: quoniam inferius eius est cartilaginosum, non frangitur, et non accidit ei nisi attritio, et tortuositas, et simitas.	Know that only the two upper parts of the nose break simultaneously, or one of them, because it is made of two bones.  Since the lower part is cartilaginous, it does not break, and only attrition, twisting, and distortion occur to it.
Si frangitur una duarum partium eius, tunc oportet, ut intromittas digitum paruum in foramen Nasi, et aeques illam fracturam digito tuo indice, et pollice deforis, donec redeat Nasus super figuram suam naturalem: et fiat illud arte, cum facilitate.	If one of the two parts breaks, then you should insert a small finger into the nostril and straighten that fracture with your index finger and thumb from the outside, until the nose returns to its natural shape; and do this skillfully and easily.
Et caue, ne accidat per operationem tuam illam super infirmum dolor.	And beware that your operation does not cause pain to the sick person.
Quod si fractura est in superiore parte Nasi, et non perueniat ad illam digitus: tunc oportet, ut aequetur extremitate radii, in quo sit grossitudo parua.	If the fracture is in the upper part of the nose, and the finger does not reach it, then it should be straightened with the end of a radius bone, one having a small thickness.
Si uero fractura est in duabus partibus, tunc fac simile illius: et propera cum restauratione eius in die primo fracturae, si est possibile.	If, however, the fracture is in two parts, then do the same; and hasten its restoration on the first day of the fracture, if possible.
Et si non, tunc post diem septimum, aut decimum apud quietem apostematis calidi.	And if not, then after the seventh or tenth day, at rest from a hot abscess.
Deinde intromitte in extremitate Nasi licinium ex panno lini, si fractura est in parte una: aut intromite duo licinia si fractura est in duabus partibus: et sit in licinio grossitudo tantae quantitatis, quae impleat foramen Nasi.	Then insert into the end of the nose a linen bandage, if the fracture is in one part; or insert two bandages if the fracture is in two parts; and let the bandage have a thickness equal to that which fills the nasal opening.
Et dixerunt quidam antiquorum restauratorum, ut infundantur licinia in butyro, et permutentur omni die.	And some of the ancient restorers said that the bandages should be soaked in butter and changed every day.
Illud uero non uidetur mihi, imo oportet, ut infundatur licinium in albugine oui, confecto cum puluere molendini.	However, that does not seem to me to be correct; rather, the bandage should be soaked in the white of an egg, mixed with mill dust.
Deinde dimitte licinium, donec firmetur os, et induretur cartilago.	Then leave the bandage until the bone is strengthened and the cartilage hardened.
Et quandoque intromittitur in Nasum loco licinii penna anseris, postquam inuoluitur super ipsam pannus lenis: et fit, quod ipsa tenet fracturam Nasi uehementius, et ut non prohibeatur infirmus ab inspiratione.	And sometimes a goose feather is inserted into the nose in place of a bandage, after a soft cloth has been wrapped around it; and this holds the nasal fracture more firmly and prevents the patient from being hindered in breathing.
Et non est haec res necessaria.	And this is not necessary.
Si uis, fac illud: et si uis, fac licinia.	If you wish, do it; and if you wish, make bandages.
Quod si accidat Naso iterum dum operaris apostema calidum, emplastra nasum cum caeroto, aut cum coto infuso in oleo rosato, aut modico ex dyaquilon.	If, while treating a hot abscess, the nose should swell again, plaster the nose with cerote or with cotton infused in rose oil or a little diachylon.
Si autem non accidit apostema calidum, tunc oportet, ut emplastres ipsum cum farina sisami, et puluere thuris confecti cum albugine oui.	If, however, a hot abscess does not occur, then you should plaster it with sesame flour and powdered frankincense mixed with egg white.
Deinde pone super ipsum stuppam lenem, et non liges Nasum cum aliquo omnino.	Then place soft linen over it, and do not bind the nose with anything at all.
Si uero franguntur ossa Nasi fractura parua, aut comminuuntur, tunc oportet, ut scindas super ea, et extrahas ipsa cum instrumentis quae conueniunt eis.	If, however, the bones of the nose are broken or crushed in a small fracture, then you should cut away over them and extract them with instruments suited to them.
Deinde sue scissuram, et cura ipsum cum eo quod incarnat, et consolidat ex emplastris conuenientibus ad illud, uel unguentis.	Then sew the wound, and treat it with what causes healing and consolidation by suitable plasters or ointments.
Quod si accidat inter Nasum uulnus, tunc oportet, ut cures ipsum cum liciniis: et administres cannulam de plumbo, donec sanetur.	If a wound occurs between the nostrils, then you should treat it with bandages and administer a lead cannula until it heals.
¶ De restauratione Mandibulae inferioris, quando disrumpitur.	Concerning the restoration of the lower jaw when it is broken.
Caput V.	Chapter V.
Quando disrumpitur Mandibula inferior, et fractura eius non est cum uulnere: conspice tunc si est fractura eius deforis tantum, et non frangitur in duo, et curuatur ad interiora: tunc cognitio eius est facilis.	When the lower jaw is broken, and its fracture is not with a wound, then examine if its fracture is only on the outside, and it is not broken into two pieces, and bends inward: then its recognition is easy.
Oportet ergo, si est fractura eius in parte dextra, ut intromittas digitum indicem sinistrae in os infirmi: similiter si fractura est in mandibula sinistra, tunc intromitte indicem manus dextrae: et impelle cum eo gibbositatem fracturae deintus cum facilitate ad exteriora cum manu tua altera ab interiori parte ossis decenter, et cum eo aequa ipsam.	Therefore, if its fracture is on the right side, you should insert the index finger of your left hand into the patient's mouth; similarly, if the fracture is on the left jaw, then insert the index finger of your right hand; and with it push the curvature of the fracture from the inside towards the outside with your other hand from the inside of the bone properly, and with it straighten it.
Quod si fractura mandibulae iam separata est in duo, tunc oportet, ut administres extersionem a duabus partibus, secundum rectitudinem: donec possibilis sit aequatio eius.	If the fracture of the jaw has already separated into two pieces, then it is necessary to apply external traction from both sides, according to the correct alignment, until its alignment is possible.
Si autem iam accidit in dentibus commotio, aut disruptio: tunc stringe illos de quibus speras quod remaneant cum filo auri, aut argenti, aut seta.	If, however, movement or breakage has already occurred in the teeth, then bind those which you hope will remain with gold thread, or silver, or silk.
Deinde pone super mandibulam fractam caerotum.	Then place a poultice on the fractured jaw.
Deinde pone super ipsum pannum duplicatum, et pone super pannum astellam magnam decenter factam: aut frustum cutis soleae aequale, in longitudinem mandibulae.	Then place a doubled cloth over it, and place a large, properly made bandage over the cloth, or a piece of leather sole equal in length to the jaw.
Deinde liga ipsum desuper, secundum quod praeparatur tibi ligatura eius, et conuenit ipsius applicatio, donec non destruitur: et praecipe infirmo, uti tranquillitate et quiete: et pone cibum eius sorbitiones lenes.	Then tie it from above, according to how its tying is prepared for you, and its application is suitable, until it is not undone; and order the patient to use tranquility and quiet, and give him soft drinks.
Si autem estimas, quod iam alteratur aliquid figurae aliquo modorum: tunc propera, et solue ipsum in die tertio.	If, however, you estimate that something of its shape has already changed in some way, then hurry and loosen it on the third day.
Deinde rectifica quod alteratum est ex eo, et emplastra ipsum ex puluere molendini, cum albugine oui, aut cum farina sisami, postquam tu abstuleris caerotum: et pone super emplastrum lanam lenem.	Then rectify what has changed in it, and plaster it with mill dust, with egg white, or with sesame flour, after you have removed the poultice; and place soft wool over the plaster.
Dum ergo permanet annexum illud emplastrum super ipsum, et non alteratur ossis dispositio, dimitte ipsum, ne soluas, donec sanetur: aut stringe fracturam.	While that plaster remains attached to it, and the bone's position does not change, leave it, do not loosen it, until it is healed; or bind the fracture.
Multotiens enim stringitur haec fractura in tribus septimanis.	For this fracture is often bound for three weeks.
Quod si interim accidat apostema calidum, tunc administra illud quod diximus multotiens in sedatione eius, donec remoueatur illud apostema.	If, however, a hot abscess happens in the meantime, then administer what we have said many times for its sedation, until that abscess is removed.
Et si fractura est cum uulnere, considera.	And if the fracture is with a wound, consider it.
Namsi iam separatur ex osse frustum, aut a satagie: tunc subtilia te in hoc, ut auferas illa frusta satagiae cum eo quod conuenit tibi in ablatione eorum ex instrumentis.	If a piece is already separated from the bone, or from the surrounding tissue, then be careful in this, so that you remove those fragments with what is suitable for you in removing them from the instruments.
Si uero orificium uulneris est strictum, tunc amplifica ipsum cum phlebotomo secundum quantitatem necessitatis tuae.	If, however, the wound opening is narrow, then widen it with a lancet according to your needed amount.
Deinde quando abstuleris illa satagie, et non remanserit ex eis aliquid, sue tunc orificium uulneris, si est amplum: et si non, pone super ipsum ex emplastris quae conueniunt ad illud, et incarnant illud, donec sanetur.	Then, when you have removed those fragments, and nothing remains of them, close the wound opening, if it is wide; and if not, place over it from dressings that are suitable for it, and cause it to knit, until it is healed.
¶ De restauratione Furculae, quando frangitur.	Concerning the restoration of the Furcula, when it is broken.
Caput VI.	Chapter VI.
Plurimum quidem frangitur Furcula ab anteriore parte ex parte humeri, et fractura eius fit secundum unum trium modorum.	Indeed, the Furcula is most often broken at the anterior humeral part, and its fracture occurs in one of three ways.
Aut enim frangitur et separatur in duo, praeter quod accidant in ea satagiae: et est facilius ad restaurationem eius.	Either it breaks and separates into two, besides which fragments may occur within it; and it is easier to restore it.
Aut ita, quod accidunt in osse satagiae: et est difficilius ad restaurationem.	Or, in such a way that fragments occur within the bone; and it is more difficult to restore it.
Aut ita, quod est fractura cum uulnere.	Or, it is a fracture with a wound.
Et operatio in ea quando fractura est absque uulnere, est, ut facias praesentes esse duos ministros, ut teneat unus eorum adiutorium quod sequitur Furculam fractam, et alter extendat collum uersus partem.	And the operation for it, when the fracture is without a wound, is that you have two attendants present, so that one of them holds the supporting aid that follows the fractured Furcula, and the other extends the neck towards the part.
Deinde aequa fracturam digitis tuis, donec fiat forma eius, secundum quod oportet: et non sit in ea eminentia, neque concauitas.	Then straighten the fracture with your fingers until its shape is as it should be: and there should be neither prominence nor concavity in it.
Quod si indiges extensione plus, tunc oportet, ut ponas sub titillico infirmi spheram ex panno, aut lana: et sit magnitudo eius secundum quantitatem necessitatis tuae: et extende, et eleua Furculam, et coarta spheram manu tua, donec aeques fracturam, secundum quod oportet.	If you require more extension, then you ought to place under the patient's armpit a sphere of cloth or wool; and its size should be according to your needs; and extend and elevate the Furcula and constrict the sphere with your hand, until you make the fracture even, as it should be.
Quod si non potes trahere extremitatem Furculae ad exteriora: propterea, quia peruenit ad profundum: tunc oportet, ut resupinetur infirmus super ceruicem suam: et ponas sub humero eius puluinar medium in magnitudine, et premat minister humerum eius ad inferiora, donec eleuetur os Furculae quod est in profundo ad sursum: atque tunc rectifica fracturam, et aequa eam digitis tuis.	If you cannot pull the extremity of the Furcula outwards, because it has reached deep within, then it is necessary for the patient to lie on their neck; and you should place a pillow of medium size under their shoulder, and let the attendant press down on their shoulder until the bone of the Furcula that is deep inside is lifted upwards; and then straighten the fracture and make it even with your fingers.
Si autem sentis sathaiatum ex Furcula, et mouetur: tunc oportet, ut findas super illud, et extrahas ipsum alsathaiatum cum facilitate.	If you feel a splinter from the Furcula, and it moves, then you ought to cut around it and extract the splinter with ease.
Si autem est retentum in osse, tunc ingenia in incisione eius cum uno Incisoriorum quae praeparasti ad illud, postquam tu posueris sub Furcula instrumentum quod seruat sifach: et est instrumentum ex ligno, aut ex ferro.	If it is however retained in the bone, then make an incision in it with one of the incisions you have prepared for it, after you have placed under the Furcula the instrument which preserves sifach: and the instrument is of wood or iron.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form.
Assimilatur cochleari cui non est concauitas.	It resembles a spoon which has no cavity.
Et sit latitudo eius secundum illud quo indiges eo ex magnitudine ossis, et paruitate eius.	And let its width be according to that which you need of it from the size of the bone, and its smallness.
Longitudo uero eius etiam secundum quod possibile est tibi ad operationem.	Its length, however, also according to what is possible for you for the operation.
Et habeat duas extremitates, sicut uides: et extremitas una sit ampla, et altera stricta.	And let it have two ends, as you see: and one end be wide, and the other narrow.
Si autem disruptio uulneris quod scidisti quando extraxisti sathaiatum ossis, est ampla, et securaris ab apostemate calido: tunc aggrega duo labia uulneris cum sutura.	If however the rupture of the wound which you have made when you have extracted the fragment of bone is wide, and you secure yourself from a hot abscess: then bring together the two lips of the wound with suture.
Et si disruptio est parua, aut times apostema calidum: tunc imple uulnus cum pannis, et puluillis secundum quantitatem scissurae uulneris.	And if the rupture is small, or you fear a hot abscess: then fill the wound with cloths, and pledgets according to the amount of the wound's fissure.
Quod si accidat apostema calidum, tunc infunde pannum in oleo rosato, et aceto, et uino, et pone super ipsum.	If a hot abscess should occur, then immerse a cloth in rose oil, and vinegar, and wine, and place it upon it.
Strictura uero ossis quando est absque uulnere, et absque sectione, est, ut ponas super os emplastrum factum ex farina molendini cum albugine oui.	A constriction of the bone, however, when it is without a wound, and without a section, is such that you should place upon the bone a plaster made from mill flour with egg white.
Et pone stuppam lenem super ipsum.	And place soft linen over it.
Deinde pone spheram sub titillico eius, si indiges illa.	Then place a sphere under its (the affected area's) point, if you need it.
Deinde accipe himematem, id est, rotam quam tenent Saraceni, quae sit longa ualde: et sit latitudo eius palmi unius, aut circiter illud.	Then take a himematem, that is, a wheel which the Saracens hold, which is very long; and its width should be one palm, or about that.
Deinde pone puluillum duplicatum super stuppam et emplastrum.	Then place a doubled cushion over the linen and plaster.
Deinde accipe astellam ex tabula subtili, cuius latitudo sit trium digitorum, et in longitudine similiter.	Then take a thin board, whose width is three fingers and likewise in length.
Deinde inuolue eam in panno.	Then wrap it in cloth.
Deinde inuolue pannum illum cum astella in loco alhimemati qui cadit super fracturam et locum.	Then wrap that cloth with the board in the place of the alhimemati which falls upon the fracture and the location.
Deinde pone alhimemati super fracturam sicut reuoluiur, et inuolue eam super collum eius, et sub titillico eius sano, et sub titillico eius infirmo: et reduc eam super omnem partem, et quomodo uides quod strictura tenet fracturam strictura decenti: et est illud, quod non occultatur super te, et totum, ut non remoueatur astella desuper os fractum.	Then place the alhimemati over the fracture as it revolves, and wrap it over its neck, and under its healthy and under its infirm titillico: and reduce it over every part, and how you see that the constriction holds the fracture with a decent constriction: and it is that which is not concealed from you, and entirely, so that the board is not removed from above the fractured bone.
Et propter hoc oportet, ut aspicias infirmum in omni die.	And therefore it is necessary that you look after the sick person every day.
Quotiens ergo mollificatur ligamentum, et uides astellam iam remoueri: tunc rectifica illud, et stringe ligamentum.	Therefore, whenever the ligament softens, and you see the board being removed, then straighten it, and tighten the ligament.
Deinde pone somnum infirmi super dorsum eius, et pone sub titillico eius apud somnum eius puluinar paruum in nocte, ut cum eo eleuetur adiutorium eius a latere ipsius.	Then place the sick person's sleep on his back, and place a small pillow under his side by his sleep at night, so that with it his help will be raised from his side.
Eleuatur ergo fractura furculae per eleuationem humeri.	Therefore, the fracture of the fork is lifted by the elevation of the humerus.
Aut liga brachium eius ad collum ipsius: et non soluas ligamentum, si non accidat in loco accidens ex pruritu, aut ab apostemate, usque ad duodecim dies.	Or bind his arm to his neck, and do not loosen the bandage if it does not happen in a place where an accident arises from itching or from an abscess, up to twelve days.
Deinde renoua emplastrum, si uideris faciem eius ad illud.	Then renew the plaster, if you see his face toward it.
Et adde in strictura, et dimitte ipsum, donec restauretur et coaguletur.	And add to the constriction, and leave him until it is restored and congealed.
Et fractura quidem furculae stringitur et confortatur secundum plurimum in uigintiocto diebus: et quandoque fit in quibusdam hominibus in minore illo.	And indeed the fracture of the fork is tightened and strengthened according to the most part in twenty-eight days: and sometimes it happens in some men in a shorter time than that.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Spatulae.	Concerning the restoration of a fractured scapula.
Caput VII.	Chapter VII.
Raro frangitur Spatula, et in loco lato eius: et non franguntur ex ea nisi margines eius.	The scapula is rarely broken, and in its broad area: and only its margins are broken from it.
Quando ergo frangitur ex eo locus, et frangitur in medio eius, et non cognoscitur illud nisi per tactum: tunc secundum quod est figura fracturae conare praeparationem eius.	Therefore, when a portion of it is broken, and it is broken in its middle, and it is not recognized except by touch: then, according to the nature of the fracture, endeavor its preparation.
Et reduc eam super figuram naturalem omni modo ingenii, quod est tibi possibile.	And restore it to its natural shape by every means of ingenuity which is possible for you.
Deinde pone super locum puluerem molendini cum albugine oui, et stuppam lenem, et pone desuper puluillum ex panno duplato.	Then place on the area pulverized millstone with egg white, and soft linen, and place a cushion of folded cloth on top.
Deinde pone super ipsum astellam latam ex tabula subtili secundum quantitatem Spatulae totius, aut ampliorem ea parum.	Then place upon it a broad splint of thin board, according to the size of the entire scapula, or a little larger.
Si uero sub astella est concauitas in aliquo locorum Spatulae, tunc aequa illam concauitatem cum stuppa leni, donec descendat astella secundum aequalitatem.	If, however, there is a concavity under the splint in any place of the scapula, then equalize that concavity with soft linen, until the splint descends according to equality.
Deinde ftringe desuper cum alhimemati longa, constrictione decenti, et firmitudine astellae, donec non remoueatur a loco suo.	Then bind over it with a long bandage, with fitting constriction, and firmness of the splint, until it is not removed from its place.
Et considera ligamentum in omni die.	And consider the bandage every day.
Quotienscunque ergo mollificatur ligamentum, stringe ipsum, et aequa astellam si remoueatur a loco suo: et iaceat infirmus super latus suum sanum.	Whenever, therefore, the bandage softens, tighten it, and equalize the splint if it is removed from its place; and let the sick person lie on his sound side.
Et Spatula quidem restauratur in uiginti diebus, aut in uigintiquinque diebus.	And indeed, the scapula is restored in twenty days, or in twenty-five days.
Quando ergo completur iste numerus, tunc solue ligamentum: et tu sis in securitate.	When therefore this number is completed, then loosen the bandage; and you will be in safety.
Nam ipsa est ex ossibus quorum communitio non timetur, neque eorum solutio.	For it is from bones whose connection is not feared, nor their separation.
Si autem procedat ex osse frustum, et pungit sub cute: tune scinde super ipsum, et aufer ipsum.	If however a fragment proceeds from the bone, and pierces under the skin: then cut over it, and remove it.
Et fac quod diximus in fractura furculae ex sedatione apostematis calidi, si accidat ex eo aliquid.	And do what we said in the fracture of the furcula from the subsidence of a hot abscess, if anything happens from it.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Pectoris.	On the restoration of a fractured breast.
Caput VIII.	Chapter VIII.
Pectus quandoque frangitur in medio sui, et raro accidit illud.	The breast sometimes breaks in the middle of itself, and that rarely happens.
Extremitates eius quidem plurimum franguntur, et comminuuntur ex accidentibus eius.	Its extremities, indeed, are broken and crushed very much from its accidents.
Quando frangitur eius medium, quod declinat ad inferiora, et accidit ei dolor uehemens, et difficultas in anhelitu, et tussis: et fortasse euomit sanguinem, et declaratur concauitas in osse fracto, et non occultatur sensui, Restauratio eius est, ut resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum: et pone inter Spatulas eius puluinar.	When its middle breaks, which inclines downwards, and great pain and difficulty in breathing and coughing occur to it; and perhaps it vomits blood, and a hollow is shown in the broken bone, and is not hidden from the senses. Its restoration is that the sick person be laid supine on their back, and a pillow be placed between their shoulder blades.
Deinde preme humeros eius, et aggrega costas a duabus partibus uel lateribus cum manibus: et subtiliare in aequatione eius, secundum omnem modum quo possibile est illud et conuenit, donec redeat figura ossis, secundum quod oportet.	Then press on his shoulders, and assemble the ribs from both sides with the hands, and make them equal in their alignment according to every way that is possible and suitable, until the shape of the bone returns as it should.
Deinde pone super ipsum emplastrum et stuppam, et pone desuper astellam ex tabula subtili ex salice, aut chalingi, et ex eis similibus in leuitate, postquam tu inuoluis eam in panno.	Then place a plaster and a bandage on it, and place on top of it a splint of thin wood from willow, or chalingi, or similar materials in lightness, after you have wrapped it in cloth.
Deinde subtiliare in ligando eam super os fractum, ut non remoueatur: et uade cum ligatura secundum rotunditatem ad dorsum aliquotiens, et stringe ipsum strictura decenti.	Then carefully bind it over the broken bone so that it does not move; and proceed with the bandage around the back several times, and tighten it with a proper constriction.
Deinde considera ligaturam in omni hora, et quotienscumque mollificatur, stringe eam: et si necessitas eius prouocat ad solutionem eius apud pruritum, uel corrosionem quae accidit in loco, aut dolorem, aut apostema: tunc propera, et solue eam, et eradica emplastrum, et rectifica quod accidit cum modo curationis eius.	Then observe the bandage every hour, and whenever it softens, tighten it. And if its necessity calls for its removal due to itching, or corrosion that occurs in the area, or pain, or abscess, then quickly untie it, and remove the plaster, and correct whatever happens with its method of treatment.
Deinde reduc emplastrum, si uides ad illud faciem: et annecte ei stricturam, donec sanetur.	Then replace the plaster, if you see fit: and apply a bandage to it until it heals.
¶ De restauratione Costarum, quando franguntur.	Concerning the restoration of ribs when they are broken.
Caput IX.	Chapter IX.
Scias, quod Costarum fractura non accidit, nisi in locis grossis quae sequuntur dorsum, et ex extremitatibus earum ab anteriori parte.	Know that a fracture of the ribs does not occur except in the thick parts that follow the back, and from their extremities on the front side.
Et non accidit eis attritio, nisi propterea, quia sunt cartilaginosae.	And abrasion does not happen to them unless because they are cartilaginous.
Et cognitio ipsius non occultatur sensui apud inquisitionem cum digitis.	And its knowledge is not hidden from the sense in investigation with the fingers.
Et restauratio eius fit ita, ut aeques fracturam cum digitis secundum modum possibilem, donec aequetur figura, secundum quod oportet.	And its restoration is done so that one adjusts the fracture with the fingers according to the possible way, until the shape is equal, as is appropriate.
Deinde emplastra, et stringe os fractum cum astella, si indiget illo.	Then plasters, and bind the broken bone with splints, if it needs that.
Et si fractura Costarum est decliuis ad interiora: tunc accidit infirmo dolor uehemens, et punctura, sicut punctura illa quae accidit illi qui habet pleuresim: propterea, quod os pungit uelamen, et etiam ei accidit difficultas anhelitus, et tussis, et uomitus sanguinis multi: et haec est difficilis curationis.	And if the fracture of the ribs is sloping inward, then a violent pain and a stabbing sensation happen to the sick person, like the stabbing sensation that happens to one who has pleurisy, because the bone pierces the covering, and also difficulty in breathing, and coughing, and vomiting of much blood happen to him: and this is a difficult condition to treat.
Et iam ingeniati sunt antiqui in ea cum ingeniis multis: et ex eis sunt qui dicunt, ut ponas cibos infirmi qui generent inflammationem et uentositatem, ut inflammetur uenter, et extendatur, et impellatur fractura ad exteriora.	And the ancients have already been ingenious in this with many methods: and among them are those who say that you should give the sick person foods that produce inflammation and windiness, so that the stomach is inflamed, and is stretched, and the fracture is driven outward.
Nos uero abhorremus, ut non fiat caussa uelox ad faciendum apostema calidum, si non accidit.	But we abhor that a quick cause for making a hot abscess should be made, if it does not occur.
Si autem iam accidit, tunc addit in eo.	If however it has already occurred, then add to it.
Et dixerunt quidam eorum: ponatur super locum uentosa, deinde sugatur cum fortitudine, et est similius ratiocinationi.	And some of them said: let a windy thing be placed on the place, then it should be sucked with force, and this is similar reasoning.
Verumtamen timetur, quod attrahat uentosa superfluitates ad locum, propter dispositionem debilitatis.	However, it is feared that the windy thing will draw superfluities to the place, because of the weakened condition.
Et dixerunt quidam eorum: oportet ut cooperiatur locus cum lana quae iam submersa est in oleo calido: et ponantur puluilli inter Costas, donec impleatur: ut sit ligatura aequalis quando inuoluis eam secundum rotunditatem.	And some of them said: the place should be covered with wool that has already been immersed in hot oil, and cushions should be placed between the ribs, until it is full, so that there is an equal bandage when you wrap it according to the roundness.
Deinde curetur infirmus curatione pleuresis ex cibo et medicina.	Then the sick person should be treated with the treatment for pleurisy, through food and medicine.
Quod si coartat infirmum res uehemens, quam non tolerat, et os pungit uelamen punctura laedente, et timemus super infirmum: tunc oportet, ut scindamus super locum, et detegamus a Costa fracta.	If a violent thing constricts the sick person, which they cannot tolerate, and the mouth is pierced or the wound hurts, and we fear for the sick person, then it is necessary to cut open the place and expose the broken rib.
Deinde ponamus super ea instrumentum quod conseruat sifac, cuius rememoratio praecessit: et incidamus os cum facilitate, et incidamus ipsum.	Then we should place upon it the instrument that preserves the sifac, whose description preceded: and cut the mouth easily and cut it.
Deinde aggregemus duo labia uulneris, si est magnum cum sutura: et curemus ipsum cum emplastris, donec sanetur.	Then we should bring together the two lips of the wound, if it is large, with sutures, and treat it with plasters until it is healed.
Quod si accidat interim apostema calidum, tunc propera, et infunde puluillos in oleo rosato, et pone super locum: et curetur infirmus cum eo quod conuenit apostemati.	If, meanwhile, a hot abscess occurs, then hurry, and pour powders in rose oil, and place it over the place, and let the sick person be treated with what suits the abscess.
Interim etiam resupinetur super latus super quod dormit, donec sanetur.	Meanwhile, let him lie on his side on which he sleeps, until he is healed.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Spondilium dorsi et colli.	On the restoration of a fractured vertebra of the back and neck.
Caput X.	Chapter X.
Ossibus quidem colli quandoque aduenit fractura, et raro accidit eis attritio: et similiter Spondilibus dorsi etiam.	A fracture of the neck bones sometimes occurs, and attrition rarely happens to them; and similarly to the vertebrae of the back also.
Cum ergo accidit illud alicui, et uis scire, an sanetur, an non sanetur: tunc confidera.	If this happens to someone, and you wish to know whether it will heal or not, then consider.
Nam si uides manus eius iam mollificatas, et stupefactas, et mortuas: et non potest mouere eas, neque extendere eas, neque constringere eas: et quando constringis eas cum digitis tuis, et pungis eas cum acu, non sentit illud, et non sentit in eis dolorem: tunc scias, quia non sanatur, et in pluribus dispositionibus est mortale.	For if you see his hands already softened, and stunned, and dead; and he cannot move them, nor extend them, nor contract them; and when you grasp them with your fingers, and prick them with a needle, he does not feel it, and does not feel pain in them: then know that it does not heal, and in most cases is fatal.
Quod si mouet eas, et sentit in eis constrictionem cum digitis et puncturam: tunc scias, quia nucha ossis salua est, et quod infirmus sanabitur cum curatione.	If, however, he moves them, and feels the contraction with his fingers and the prick, then know that the neck bone is sound, and that the patient will be healed with treatment.
Quod si eueniat Spondilibus dorsi simile illius, et uis scire, an sanetur etiam, an non: tunc considera ad pedes eius: tunc si uides quod mollificati sunt, et accidit in eis illud quod accidit in manibus: deinde quando iacet super dorsum suum, egreditur uentositas et egestio absque uoluntate: et quando resupinatur super uentrem suum, egreditur egestio sine uoluntate: et quando resupinatur super dorsum suum, et uult mingere, et non potest: tunc scias, quia est mortale.	If a similar condition occurs to the vertebrae of the back, and you wish to know whether it will also heal or not, then consider his feet.  Then if you see that they are softened, and the same thing happens to them as happened to the hands; then when he lies on his back, wind and waste issue forth involuntarily; and when he lies on his stomach, waste issues forth involuntarily; and when he lies on his back, and wishes to urinate, and cannot, then know that it is fatal.
Non ergo labores in curatione eius.	Therefore, do not labor in his treatment.
Si uero non accidit ei aliquid ex illo, res est leuior.	If, however, nothing of that occurs to him, the condition is less serious.
Et curatio eius quod accidit ex illo est, ut coneris sedationem apostematis calidi: ita, ut ponas super Spondilem attritam oleum rosatum solum: aut cum uitellis oui assati.	And the treatment of what occurs from that is, that you should try to relieve the hot abscess.  So that you place on the bruised vertebra, simply rose oil, or with the yolks of roasted eggs.
Pone super ipsam illud aliquotiens in die, donec quando sedatur apostema calidum: tum pone super locum unum ex emplastris confortantibus, exiccantibus, et stringe super ipsum cum ligamento: et praecipe infirmo, ut utatur quiete et tranquillitate.	Place that upon it several times a day, until when the hot abscess is calmed; then place upon the area one of the strengthening, drying plasters, and bind it with a bandage; and order the sick person to use rest and quiet.
Nec dormiat super partem cum qua inuenit dolorem, donec sanetur.	And let him not sleep upon the part where he finds pain until it is healed.
Quod si accidit apud attritionem ossis sathaiatum, aut aliquid quod iam separatum fit ex eo: tunc oportet, ut seces super cutem, et auferas illud.	If, however, it happens at the attrition of the bone, or something which is already separated from it: then it is necessary that you should cut through the skin and remove it.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris, si est magnum, cum sutura.	Then bring together the two lips of the wound, if it is large, with sutures.
Deinde cura ipsum cum aliquo incarnatiuo, ex unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with some healing ointment until it is healed.
Si uero frangitur postremum ossis alhausos, et est finis caudae: tunc oportet, ut intromittas pollicem manus sinistrae in anum, et aeques os fractum manu altera, secundum quod possibile est, et secunda aequatione.	If, however, the last bone of the alhausos, and the end of the tail, is broken: then it is necessary that you should insert the thumb of your left hand into the anus, and straighten the broken bone with the other hand, as far as possible, and with a second straightening.
Deinde pone super ipsum, et aufer ipsum: et cura uulnus cum curatione quae praecessit, donec sanetur.	Then place it over it and remove it: and treat the wound with the previous treatment until it is healed.
¶ De restauratione Anchae.	Concerning the restoration of the Ancha.
Caput XI.	Chapter XI.
Raro franguntur ossa Ancharum.	Bones of the Anchar are rarely broken.
Quod si franguntur, tunc fractura eorum non est, nisi comminutio in extremitatibus ipsorum: et scinduntur in longitudine, et declinantur ad interiora: et accidit infirmo dolor in loco, et punctura: et stupescit crus quod frangitur.	If they are broken, then their fracture is not, unless it is a shattering at their extremities; and they are split lengthwise, and bent inwards; and pain and a puncture occur in the affected area; and the leg that is broken becomes numb.
Et restauratio quidem eius est, ut extendas manum tuam super ipsum, donec stes super fracturam qualiter est figura eius.	And its restoration is indeed to extend your hand upon it, until you stand over the fracture as its figure is.
Quod si fractura est in extremitatibus eius tantum, tunc aequa illam fracturam, secundum quod praeparatur tibi ex aequatione, donec assimiletur figurae suae naturali.	If the fracture is only at its extremities, then set that fracture, according to what is prepared for you by alignment, until it is made similar to its natural shape.
Si autem fractura est in longitudine, aut iam declinat ad interiora: tunc fac iacere infirmum super uentrem suum, donec praeparetur tibi restauratio illius fracturae.	If, however, the fracture is lengthwise, or already bends inwards, then make the sick person lie on their stomach, until its fracture's restoration is prepared for you.
Quando ergo aequaueris ipsam, pone super ipsam emplastrum: deinde pone super ipsam astellam ex ligno, aut ex cute: et stringe strictura super quam non timeas permutationem fracturae, neque remotionem astellae.	When therefore you have aligned it, place a plaster over it; then place a splint of wood, or of leather, over it; and bind a bandage over it, such that you fear neither the change in the fracture, nor the removal of the splint.
Et aequa concauitatem illorum cum eo quod impleat eam, donec capiat eam strictura secundum aequalitatem: et praecipe infirmo, ut dormiat super dorsum suum, aut super latus suum sanum.	And align the concavity of those with that which fills it, until the bandage takes it according to the alignment; and order the sick person to sleep on their back, or on their healthy side.
Si autem accidat ei apostema calidum: tunc cessa ab extensione eius, et ipsius restauratione, donec sedetur apostema calidum: et pone super ipsum quod sedet ipsum, secundum quod praecessit, deinde redi ad restaurationem eius: et stringe ipsum sicut oportet.	If, however, a hot abscess occurs to him, then cease from its extension and its restoration, until the hot abscess is settled; and place upon it that which settles it, according to what preceded, then return to its restoration; and bind it as is proper.
Si uero accidit in osse satagie, aut comminuitur, extrahe.	If however it occurs in the bone's shaft, or is crushed, extract it.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Adiutorii.	Concerning the restoration of the fracture of the arm.
Caput XII.	Chapter XII.
Adiutorium est illud, quod est inter cubitum usque ad caput Spatulae.	The arm is that which is between the elbow and the shoulder blade.
Si ergo frangitur, tunc restauratio eius est secundum unum duorum modorum.	If therefore it is broken, then its restoration is according to one of two methods.
Quorum unus est: ut accipias lignum planum mediae grossitudinis, secundum hanc formam, quae sequitur.	One of which is: to take a piece of wood of medium thickness, according to this shape, which follows.
Et ligentur in duabus extremitatibus duo ligamenta.	And two bandages are tied at the two ends.
Deinde suspendatur ex loco eleuato: et sedeat infirmus super sedem.	Then it is hung from a raised place, and the sick person sits upon a seat.
Deinde proiiciat brachium suum fractum super lignum, donec perueniat ad titillicum eius, in cuius medio sit annexa curuitas ligni.	Then he should place his broken arm upon the wood, until it reaches the tickling of it, in whose middle the curvature of the wood is attached.
Deinde suspende desuper ipsum aliquid graue, ut extendat ipsum minister ad inferiora.	Then suspend something heavy above it, so that the attendant extends it downwards.
Deinde aequet medicus fracturam manibus suis simul, donec redeat fractura, secundum quod oportet.	Then the physician should join the fracture with his hands together, until the fracture returns to what is proper.
Et modus alter est, ut resupinetur infirmus super ceruicem suam: et suspende manum eius a collo ipsius cum ligamento.	And another method is that the sick person is laid upon their neck, and suspend their hand from their neck with a bandage.
Deinde praecipe duobus ministris, ut teneat unus eorum illud quod est supra fracturam cum manibus suis: et ut alter teneat inferius eius, et extendat unusquisque eorum ad partem suam.	Then command two attendants, that one of them hold that which is above the fracture with their hands, and that the other hold below it, and let each of them extend to their own side.
Et si uis, ut sit extensio fortior, tunc stringe sub fractura cum ligamento, et supra ipsam cum ligamento alio: et extendat ea unusquisque duorum ministrorum ad duas partes suas.	And if you wish the extension to be stronger, then bind below the fracture with one bandage, and above it with another bandage; and let each of the two attendants extend them to their two sides.
Si ergo fractura est propinqua extremitati humeri, tunc oportet, ut ponatur unum ligamentum sub titillico, et alterum sub fractura uersus cubitum.	If therefore the fracture is near the extremity of the humerus, then it is necessary that one bandage be placed under the armpit, and another under the fracture towards the elbow.
Et similiter si fractura est propinqua cubito: tunc oportet, ut ponatur ligamentum super illum locum, et super cubitum ipsum.	And similarly if the fracture is near the elbow, then it is necessary that a bandage be placed over that place, and over the elbow itself.
Deinde aequa fracturam cum facilitate absque labore, donec quando aequatur fractura secundum quod oportet, et applicatur applicatione bona: tunc stringe eam, si non accidit apostema calidum.	Then straighten the fracture with ease, without effort, until when the fracture is straightened as it should be, and a good application is applied; then bind it, if a hot abscess does not occur.
Si uero accidit apostema calidum, tunc dimitte stricturam usque ad diem septimum.	If however a hot abscess occurs, then leave the binding until the seventh day.
Et pone super ipsum lanam succidam imbibitam in aceto et oleo rosato, donec quando quiescit apostema: tunc stringe eam: et modus stringendi eam est, ut ponas emplastrum super fracturam.	And place upon it moist, cut wool soaked in vinegar and rose oil, until when the abscess subsides; then bind it; and the manner of binding it is, that you place a plaster over the fracture.
Deinde pone inuolutionem ex panno nouo super emplastrum.	Then place a bandage of new cloth over the plaster.
Deinde aggreget brachium super adiutorium ipsum, et ponat manum suam apertam super humerum suum.	Then support the arm with the aid itself, and place his open hand on his shoulder.
Et pone pannum, et stringe super adiutorium brachium, ut brachium stet loco astellarum: si non prohibet te ab illo aliquid, neque alteretur super te aliquid ex osse fracto.	And place a cloth, and bind the supporting arm, so that the arm stands in its proper place; if nothing hinders you from doing so, nor does anything from the broken bone move on you.
Quod si times, quod alteretur super te ex osse fracto aliquid, tunc utere astellis: et est, ut ponas super fracturam ipsam astellam quae sit latior et fortior reliquis astellis.	If you fear that something from the broken bone might shift on you, then use splints: and it is that you place a splint over the fracture itself, which is wider and stronger than the other splints.
Et ponas inter omnem astellam latitudinem digiti: et sit longitudo astellarum secundum fracturam cum additione trium digitorum ab omni parte.	And place the width of a finger between each splint; and the length of the splints should be according to the fracture, with the addition of three fingers on every side.
Deinde stringe super astellas strictura quam dixi in principio capituli.	Then bind the splints with the binding I mentioned at the beginning of the chapter.
Et est, ut sit strictura tua super locum fracturae strictior.	And it should be that your binding is tighter over the place of the fracture.
Et quanto plus elongatur fractura, sit strictura minor.	And the more the fracture is extended, the less tight should the binding be.
Si ergo uides situm astellarum et stricturam, sicut diximus, in hora qua restauras membrum statim, tunc fac: et si times apostema calidum, tunc dimitte stricturam et astellas usque ad diem septimum, sicut diximus.	If therefore you see the placement of the splints and the binding, as we said, at the hour when you restore the limb immediately, then do it; and if you fear a hot abscess, then leave the binding and the splints until the seventh day, as we said.
Deinde considera ligamentum in omnibus tribus diebus, ut non accidat in loco pruritus, aut inflatio, aut prohibeatur cibus peruenire ad membrum, propter dispositionem superfluitatis stricturae.	Then consider the ligament for all three days, so that there be no itching or swelling in the place, or that food be prevented from reaching the limb, on account of the disposal of excess fluid from the binding.
Rectifica ergo illud totum, secundum quod diximus.	Therefore, rectify all of it, according to what we have said.
Si uero es super fiduciam, ut non accidat ex illo aliquid: tunc non soluas ligamentum, nisi post tres dies, aut plus.	If however you are confident that nothing will come from it, then do not loosen the binding unless after three days, or more.
Et sit dormitio infirmi super dorsum suum, et manus eius super stomachum suum: et pone sub adiutorio culcitram plenam lana aequaliter.	And let the patient's sleep be on his back, and his hands on his stomach; and place under the aid a mattress filled with wool evenly.
Et considera in omni hora noctis, aut diei, ut non soluatur figura membri fracta, aut mollificetur ligamentum.	And consider at every hour of the night or day that the fractured limb's shape is not loosened, or the binding is not softened.
Rectifica ergo illud totum uirtute tua.	Therefore, rectify all of it by your power.
Et pone cibum infirmi secundum ordinem quem praemisimus, ita ut sit cibus subtilis in primis, donec incipiat os stringi: tunc oportet, ut ingrosses cibum eius.	And give the patient food according to the order we have previously given, so that there should be subtle food at first, until the mouth begins to draw together; then it is necessary that you thicken his food.
De consuetudine enim adiutorii et cruris est, ut stringatur in quadraginta diebus: tunc ergo oportet, ut soluatur, et administretur balneum, et medicetur cum unguentis quae rectificant illud.	For it is the custom of the aid and the leg that it draw together in forty days; then, therefore, it is necessary that it be loosened, and a bath be administered, and it be medicated with ointments that rectify it.
Quod si fractura fuerit foeda, attrita: tunc non soluas ab ea ligamentum et astellas usque ad quinquaginta dies, et usque ad duos menses.	If the fracture is foul, bruised, then do not loosen the bandage and splints from it until fifty days, and even up to two months.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Brachii.	Concerning the restoration of a fractured arm.
Caput XIII.	Chapter XIII.
Brachium est compositum ex duobus ossibus, quae nominantur duo focilia.	The arm is composed of two bones, which are called two small sticks/rods.
Quorum unum est paruum: et est illud quod sequitur pollicem.	One of which is small; and it is that which follows the thumb.
Et alterum est magnum, et est illud quod est positum sub paruo ab inferiori parte.	And the other is large, and it is that which is placed under the small one at the lower part.
Fortasse ergo frangitur focile maius solum, aut paruum: et fortasse franguntur simul.	Perhaps therefore the larger rod breaks alone, or the smaller one, and perhaps they break together.
Quando ergo frangitur focile paruum superius, tunc restauratio eius est facilis, et sanatio eius est facilior.	When therefore the smaller rod breaks above, then its restoration is easy, and its healing is easier.
Et quando frangitur focile inferius, est fractura eius mala, et sanatio eius difficilis.	And when the rod breaks below, its fracture is bad, and its healing is difficult.
Et deterior ea est, quando franguntur duo ossa simul.	And worse is that when two bones break simultaneously.
Si ergo os quod frangitur est focile parum superius, tunc conuenit medico apud restaurationem eius, ut ponat extensionem paruam cum facilitate, donec aequet ipsum.	If therefore the bone that breaks is the smaller rod above, then it is fitting for the physician at its restoration to place a small extension with ease, until he makes it equal.
Si uero focile magnum est illud quod fractum est: tunc oportet, ut ponat stricturam fortiorem ualde.	If however the rod is large that which is broken: then it is necessary, that he places a very strong constriction.
Et oportet, ut ponat figuram manus apud restaurationem eius, et ipsius extensionem extensam super puluinar.	And it is necessary that he place the shape of a hand at its restoration, and its extended extension upon a pillow.
Et sit pollex manus ad superiora altior omnibus digitis: et sit articularis inferior omnibus digitis, uel reliquis: et infirmus sedens quadratus super seipsum, et sit puluinar coram eo, uel in directo eius, in altitudine, ut non incurrat infirmus laborem.	And let the thumb of the hand be higher than all the fingers, and let the joint be lower than all the fingers, or the others: and let the patient sit square on himself, and let the pillow be before him, or directly in front of him, in height, so that the patient does not incur labor.
Deinde extendat minister Brachium ab inferiori parte, aut manu sua, aut cum ligamento.	Then let the attendant extend the arm from the lower part, either with his hand or with a bandage.
Et minister alius extendat desuper similiter.	And another attendant extend it from above similarly.
Deinde aequet medicus os, donec reducat ipsum secundum meliorem figuram quam potest.	Then the physician should align the bone until he restores it to the best possible shape.
Quod si in fractura ossis sunt satagiae, tunc conare reducere omne frustum in loco suo uirtute tua.	If in the fracture of the bone there are splinters, then try to reduce every splinter into its place by your skill.
Si uero apparet in eo sathaiatum separatum, et pungit cutem, et non est tibi spes in restauratione eius: tunc finde super ipsum, et aufer ipsum secundum modum quem diximus in eis quae praemissa sunt.	If however a separate splinter appears in it, and it pierces the skin, and you have no hope of restoring it, then cut over it and remove it according to the method we have mentioned in what has gone before.
Si autem fractura est cum uulnere, ego iam feci ad illud capitulum singulare, ergo accipe curationem illius inde.	If however the fracture is with a wound, I have already made a separate chapter to it, therefore take the treatment of that from there.
Quod si accidat in principio tuae restaurationis apostema calidum, tunc line pannum cum caeroto facto ex oleo rosato, et caera alba, et sit medium inter spissitudinem et subtilitatem: et stringe pannum super ipsum strictura subtili, donec quando sedatur apostema: tunc remoue caerotum, et pone emplastrum praeparatum ex puluere molendini cum albumine oui.	If, however, a hot abscess occurs at the beginning of your restoration, then line a cloth with a cerate made from rose oil, and white wax, and let it be between thick and thin: and bind the cloth over it with a fine bandage, until when the abscess subsides: then remove the cerate, and apply a plaster prepared from mill dust with egg white.
Deinde pone astellas, et sit astella quae ponitur super fracturam ipsam latior parumper, et fortior.	Then place splints, and let the splint placed over the fracture itself be somewhat wider and stronger.
Et scias, quod numerus astellarum Brachii est sex in pluribus dispositionibus: siue sit fractura in focili uno, aut in duobus focilibus simul.	And know that the number of splints for the arm is six in most arrangements, whether the fracture is in one or in two forearm bones simultaneously.
Deinde pone stricturam tuam super locum fracturae fortiorem et uehementiorem, et aliquanto plus cum strictura ad superiora fracturae, aut ad inferiora eius: aut pone stricturam molliorem strictura eius parumper, secundum quod praecessit rememoratio eius in principio capituli.	Then apply your bandage over the fracture site more strongly and forcefully, and somewhat more with the bandage towards the upper or lower parts of the fracture; or apply a bandage that is slightly softer than its preceding bandage, according to what the prior description of it mentioned at the beginning of the chapter.
Et sint panni qui inuoluuntur super fracturam, panni lenes, humidi: et non sint duri, asperi.	And let the cloths that wrap around the fracture be soft, moist cloths; and they should not be hard, rough.
Et sit filum quo stringitur ex lino proprie, medium inter subtile et grossum, sicut narrauimus.	And let the thread with which it is tied be of linen properly, medium between thin and thick, as we have narrated.
Et considera membrum et ligamentum post dies.	And consider the limb and the ligament after days.
Quod si accidat aliquid cuius rectificatio sit necessaria, sicut pruritus qui accidit membro: tunc oportet, ut embroces membrum cum aqua calefacta, donec quiescat ille pruritus, et dimittas membrum non constrictum, donec quiescat, deinde itera stricturam.	If anything happens requiring correction, such as itching occurring in the limb, then it is necessary to embrocate the limb with heated water until that itching subsides, and to leave the limb unbound until it subsides, then to reapply the bandage.
Quod si strictura iam mollificata est, et os iam remotum, et similia illis: tunc rectifica illud totum uirtute tua, et considera iterum.	If the bandage has now softened, and the bone has now been moved, and things similar to these: then correct it all with your skill, and consider again.
Nam si nutrimentum prohibetur peruenire ad membrum, propter superfluitatem stricturae, tunc oportet, ut mollifices ipsum parumper, et dimittas ipsum aliquot diebus, donec currat ad ipsum nutrimentum, deinde stringe ipsum.	For if nourishment is prevented from reaching the limb, because of the excessive tightness of the bandage, then it is necessary to soften it a little, and to leave it for a few days, until nourishment flows to it, then to bind it.
Si autem non accidit infirmo aliquid eorum quae diximus, tunc non oportet, ut soluatur, nisi post uiginti dies, aut circiter hos.	If however, nothing of what we have said happens to the sick person, then it is not necessary to loosen it, unless after twenty days, or about this many.
Deinde suspendatur manus infirmi ad collum eius.	Then the sick person's hand is to be suspended from his neck.
Et sit collum eius aequale, et custodiatur uirtute sua a motibus agitatiuis.	And let his neck be level, and be guarded by its own strength from agitated movements.
Et fac eum dormire super dorsum suum.	And make him sleep on his back.
Et scias, quod haec fractura in triginta diebus, aut in triginta duobus diebus restauratur: et fortasse restauratur in uigintiocto diebus.	And know that this fracture is restored in thirty days, or in thirty-two days: and perhaps it is restored in twenty-eight days.
Totum illud est secundum dispositiones complexionum, et dispositiones uirtutis.	All that is according to the dispositions of the complexions, and the dispositions of the strength.
¶ De restauratione fracturarum Manus.	Concerning the restoration of fractures of the Hand.
Caput XIIII.	Chapter XIV.
Scias, quod pectini Manus, et nodis digitorum raro accidit fractura.	Know that fracture of the hand's pectines and the joints of the fingers rarely occurs.
Et non accidit ei, nisi attritio multotiens.	And it does not happen to them unless by very frequent attrition.
Quando ergo accidit plantae fractura, aut attritio: tunc oportet, ut sedeat infirmus quadratus: et coram eo sit sedes secundum aequalitatem.	Therefore, when a fracture or attrition of the sole occurs, then it is necessary that the infirm person sit squarely, and a seat be in front of him according to equality.
Deinde pone Manum eius super eam extensam.	Then place his hand upon it extended.
Deinde extendat minister ossa fracta, et aequet ea medicus, donec quando coniunguntur coniunctione bona.	Then let the attendant extend the broken bones, and let the physician adjust them until they are joined by a good union.
Tunc oportet, ut ponat emplastrum et stuppam, si non accidat apostema calidum.	Then it is necessary that he apply a plaster and tow, if a hot abscess does not occur.
Deinde pone astellam desuper secundum quantitatem loci: et tu iam inuoluisti eam in panno lini.	Then place a bandage over it according to the size of the place, and you have already wrapped it in linen cloth.
Si autem fractura est ad inferiora circiter uentrem plantae, tunc fac simile spherae ex panno: et praecipe infirmo, ut coartet super eam cum planta sua fracta: deinde stringatur cum panno longo.	If however the fracture is toward the lower part of the sole of the foot, then make something like a sphere out of cloth; and order the sick person to compress it with his broken foot; then bind it with a long cloth.
Et sit astella ex corio, in quo sit lenitas, ut applicetur corium cum corpore plantae: et stringe eam, secundum quod oportet.	And let the bandage be of leather, in which there is softness, so that the leather is applied to the body of the foot; and bind it, according to what is appropriate.
Si autem fractura est ad exteriora, tunc oportet: ut ponas astellam desuper, et astellam aliam ab inferiori in planta: et sit manus aperta recta.	If however the fracture is outward, then it is necessary: that you place a bandage on top, and another bandage from below on the foot; and let the hand be open and straight.
Deinde pone stricturam, sicut reuoluitur manus: et extende inter digitos cum ligamento.	Then apply a bandage, as the hand is turned; and extend it between the fingers with a ligament.
Quod si accidat fractura alicui nodorum digitorum, tunc si est pollex, aequetur secundum quod oportet.	If, however, a fracture occurs in any of the joints of the fingers, then if it is the thumb, it should be made equal according to what is appropriate.
Deinde stringatur cum planta: et si amas, pone ei astellam rectam, paruam: ut eleuetur fractura, et non moueatur.	Then it is bound to the foot; and if you wish, place a small, straight bandage on it, so that the fracture is raised and does not move.
Si autem fractura est reliquis digitis, sicut medio, et indici, aut auriculari, et anulari, tunc aequetur, et ligetur cum digito sano qui sequitur eum: aut ligentur omnes secundum continuationem: et est melius.	If however the fracture is in the remaining fingers, such as the middle, and index, or ring, and little finger, then it should be made equal, and bound to the healthy finger that follows it; or all should be bound according to their continuation; and it is better.
Aut pone super ipsum astellam paruam, sicut diximus in pollice.	Or place a small bandage on it, as we said for the thumb.
Et considera in restauratione tua, et post ipsam dispositionem apostematis calidi: et oppone cum eo quod oportet, quando accidit aliquid ex illo, secundum quod iteratur eius narratio.	And consider in your treatment, and after the disposition of the hot abscess: and apply with it what is appropriate, when something from it happens, according to the repetition of its narration.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Coxae.	Concerning the restoration of a fractured hip.
Caput XV.	Chapter XV.
OS Coxae multotiens frangitur, et declaratur sensui: quoniam conuertitur ad interiorem et posteriorem partem.	The hip bone is frequently fractured, and is evident to the senses, because it is turned towards the inner and posterior part.
Et restauratio eius fit ita, quod stringitur ligamentum supra fracturam, et ligamentum aliud sub fractura.	And its restoration is done thus, that a ligament is tightened above the fracture, and another ligament below the fracture.
Et infirmus prostretur super faciem suam.	And the sick person should lie on their face.
Deinde extendat omne ligamentum minister ad partem suam secundum aequalitatem: et hoc, quando est fractura in medio ossis.	Then let the attendant extend all the ligaments on their side according to equality: and this, when the fracture is in the middle of the bone.
Si autem est fractura propinqua radici Coxae, tunc sit ligamentum ad partem pectinis, ut cadat extensio ad sursum: et ligamentum aliud sub fractura.	If however the fracture is near the root of the hip, then let the ligament be on the side of the crest, so that the extension falls upwards: and another ligament below the fracture.
Et sic similiter si est fractura propinqua genu, tunc sit ligamentum propinquum genu, ut sit extensio ad inferiora.	And similarly if the fracture is near the knee, then let the ligament be near the knee, so that the extension is downwards.
Deinde aequet medicus os utriusque manibus suis, donec reducat ipsum secundum similitudinem figurae naturalis: et coniugatur os coniunctione bona.	Then the physician should equalize the bone with both their hands until they reduce it according to the likeness of its natural shape: and the bone is joined with good union.
Tunc oportet, ut ponas emplastrum et stricturam, si non accidit membro apostema.	Then it is necessary to apply a plaster and a bandage, if a swelling does not occur in the limb.
Quod si accidat in eo apostema: tunc dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot, donec sedetur apostema calidum, deinde redi ad curationem tuam.	But if a swelling occurs in it: then leave it for a few days, until the hot swelling subsides, then return to your treatment.
Strictura autem eius ita sit.	However, its bandage should be such.
Oportet ut inuoluas super fracturam imema duram, id est, bindam: et dupla eam bis, aut ter: et remaneat ex ea superfluitas.	It is necessary to wrap a hard bandage over the fracture, that is, a bandage: and double it twice or thrice: and let there remain excess from it.
Deinde inuolue crus, donec perueniat calcaneus apud radicem natis.	Then wrap the leg, until the heel reaches the root of the buttocks.
Et intromitte filum longum inter Coxam et crus prope genu ad inferiora, et ueniant extremitates fili a superiori parte duarum partium.	And introduce a long thread between the thigh and the leg near the knee to the lower parts, and let the ends of the thread come from the upper part of the two sections.
Deinde reuolue super Crus et Coxam quod superfluit ex alimema.	Then roll over the leg and thigh what is in excess from the bandage.
Deinde pone super Coxam in loco fracturae ipsius astellas, et pone ex eis astellam unam super os cruris.	Then place on the thigh, at the place of the fracture itself, splints, and place one splint on the bone of the leg.
Deinde imple uacuitates inter crus et coxam cum pannis lenibus, ut aequetur strictura.	Then fill the spaces between the leg and thigh with soft cloths, so that the tightness is equalized.
Deinde incipe cum strictura forti a medio super locum fracturae tribus inuolutionibus, aut quatuor.	Then begin with a strong bandage from the middle over the fracture site with three or four wraps.
Et quanto plus elongaris cum ligamento a loco fracturae, sit strictura tua minor et mollior, et lenior.	And the further you move away from the fracture site with the bandage, the smaller, softer, and gentler should your bandage be.
Deinde intende ad duas extremitates fili, quod tu intromisisti inter coxam et crus.	Then pull on the two ends of the thread, which you inserted between the thigh and leg.
Liga ergo cum utrisque tres astellas quae sunt desuper.	Tie therefore with both ends the three splints which are above.
Deinde uade cum duabus extremitatibus fili ad inferiora, donec peruenias ad cauillam pedis.	Then proceed with the two ends of the thread to the lower parts, until you reach the ankle.
Et cum utrisque stringe etiam extremitates astellarum a parte altera: ut non remoueatur ligamentum ex loco suo.	And with both ends tighten also the ends of the splints on the other side, so that the bandage does not move from its place.
Deinde dimitte stricturam super illud, dum permanet, ita quod non accidat membro corrosio, neque apostema, neque inflatio, et similia eis.	Then release the tightening on it, while it remains, so that no erosion, abscess, or swelling, and similar things happen to the limb.
Quod si accidat aliquid ex illo.	If anything of that sort happens.
Propera ergo cum solutione eius, et rectifica illud quod accidit inde totum, secundum quod diximus multotiens.	Therefore, hasten with its removal, and rectify whatever happens from it entirely, according to what we have said many times.
Si uero in osse est frustum ex osse quod pungat: tunc oportet, ut aeques illud, si est tibi possibile.	If indeed there is a piece of bone in the bone that pricks: then it is necessary that you make it even, if it is possible for you.
Et si non, finde super illud, et remoue illud: et cura cum eo cuius praecessit rememoratio, donec sanetur.	And if not, split over it, and remove it: and treat it with what has been previously mentioned, until it is healed.
Et quandoque stringitur haec fractura Coxae, praeter quod addantur ei astellae, sicut diximus in adiutorio et brachio.	And sometimes this fracture of the hip is bound, apart from which splints are added to it, as we said in the aid and arm.
Verumtamen in restauratione eius taliter fracta, non accidit infirmo claudicatio.	However, in the restoration of it thus fractured, lameness does not happen to the sick person.
Et si restauratur sola, praeter quod applicetur ei crus alterum, tunc necesse est, ut claudicet ille cuius est, semper.	And if it is restored alone, apart from which the other leg is applied to it, then it is necessary that that person limp, always.
Et scias, quod Coxa stringitur in quinquaginta diebus, uel additur parum, aut minuitur parum: totum illud est secundum diuersitatem complexionum, et reliquarum dispositionum.	And know that the hip is bound for fifty days, or a little is added, or a little is diminished: all this is according to the diversity of complexions and other dispositions.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Rotulae genu.	Concerning the restoration of a fractured kneecap.
Caput XVI.	Chapter XVI.
Scias, quod Rotulae genu raro accidit fractura, sed accidit ei attritio multotiens.	Know that a fractured kneecap rarely occurs, but it is often subject to abrasion.
Si uero accidit ei fractura, tunc non nisi aut fissura, aut foramen in partibus suis.	If indeed a fracture occurs, then it is only either a fissure or a hole in its parts.
Et est illud cum uulnere, et absque uulnere.	And it is with a wound, and without a wound.
Et statur super illud totum cum sensu.	And it stands over the entire thing with sensation.
Et restauratio eius est ita, ut aequetur quod disruptum est ex partibus eius cum digitis, donec aggregetur, et coniungatur secundum quod possibile est ex aequatione et facilitate, et fabricatione.	And its restoration is such that what is disrupted from its parts is equalized with fingers, until it is aggregated and joined as much as possible by means of equalization, facility, and fabrication.
Deinde pone emplastrum ex farina sisami, uel molendini, cum albumine oui: et pone super ipsum astellam rotundam, si indiges illa: et stringe desuper strictura conueniente ad illud.	Then apply a plaster of sesame flour, or mill flour, with egg white; and place a round disc upon it, if you need it; and bind it from above with a suitable bandage.
Deinde considera omnes dispositiones quas narrauimus in reliquis fracturis: sicut apostema calidum, et similia illi: ita, ut opponas omni accidenti cum eo quod conuenit ei, donec sanetur.	Then consider all the treatments that we have described in other fractures, such as a hot abscess and things similar to it, so that you oppose every accident with that which is appropriate to it, until it is healed.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Cruris.	Concerning the restoration of a fractured leg.
Caput XVII.	Chapter XVII.
Scias, quod Cruri sunt duo ossa, quorum unum est grossum, et nominatur nomine Cruris: et alterum subtile, et nominatur Focile.	Know that the leg has two bones, one of which is thick and is called the Cruris; and the other thin, and is called the Focile.
Et accidit utrisque ex speciebus fracturae quod accidit duobus ossibus brachii: et propter illud fit restauratio eius, sicut restauratio brachii aequaliter, et operatio est una.	And the same kinds of fractures occur in both, as occur in the two bones of the arm; and because of that, its restoration is done in the same way as the arm's restoration, and the procedure is the same.
Quod si franguntur duo ossa simul, conuertitur Crus ad omnes partes.	If both bones are fractured at the same time, the leg will turn in all directions.
Et si frangitur os subtilius, conuertitur Crus ad anteriorem partem.	And if the thinner bone is fractured, the leg will turn towards the front.
Et si frangitur os grossius, inuenis illud inferius: et est ex eis quae non occultantur tibi.	And if the thicker bone is fractured, you will find it lower; and it is among those which are not hidden from you.
Deinde administra extensionem, et aequationem, et ligationem astellarum secundum illud aequaliter.	Then administer extension, and straightening, and the tying of splints, according to that, equally.
Verumtamen oportet, si fractura Cruris est fractura foeda, habens sethagie multa: ut sit extensio minor, et lenior alleuiatione tua.	However, if the fracture of the leg is a foul fracture, having much blood: that the extension should be less, and your alleviation more gentle.
Et in Crure quidem est ex operatione quiddam super brachium: et est, ut quando tu aequas astellas, et comples omnem operationem tuam, tunc accipe duas fascias ex ligno pini, quod administratur in fabricatione solariorum quod ponitur sub tabulis: et fiunt ex spatulis palmae: et elige ex eis quibus est grossitudo parua, et neque sint ex minutis: et sit longitudo earum secundum longitudinem Cruris a genu usque inferius.	And in the leg indeed there is something from the operation above the arm: and it is that when you have straightened the splints, and completed all your operation, then take two splints of pine wood, which are used in the construction of roofs placed below the planks: and they are made from the palm of a hand: and choose from those which have little thickness, and let them not be made from thin ones: and let their length be according to the length of the leg, from the knee down.
Deinde inuolue super unamquamque pannum duabus inuolutionibus secundum longitudinem eius.	Then wrap each one in a cloth with two wraps along its length.
Et pone unam partem Cruris a parte una, et alteram a parte altera: et sint ex genu usque inferius pedis.	And place one part of the leg on one side, and the other on the other side: and let them be from the knee down to the foot.
Deinde liga duas fascias in tribus locis ex duabus extremitatibus et medio.	Then tie the two splints in three places, from the two ends and the middle.
Cum enim strictura prohibetur, Crus declinat ad dextram et sinistram, et stat statione bona.	For when the constriction is forbidden, the leg bends to the right and left, and stands in a good position.
Et iam quidem administretur cunabulum ex ligno secundum longitudinem Cruris, et ponatur in eo Crus, ut conseruet ipsum a motu.	And now indeed let a cradle of wood be administered according to the length of the leg, and let the leg be placed in it, so that it may be kept from movement.
Et plurimum quidem oportet, ut facias illud in fractura quando cum ea est uulnus proprie.	And it is very necessary indeed, that you do this in a fracture when there is a wound properly with it.
Deinde considera Crus in omni die, et stude cum eo studio ultimo ab apostemate, aut inflatione, aut reliquis aliis.	Then consider the leg every day, and strive with utmost diligence against the abscess, or swelling, or other similar conditions.
Si ergo accidit aliquid ex illis, tunc oppone ei cum eo quod oportet, usquequo sanetur, si Deus uoluerit.	If therefore anything of those things happens, then oppose it with what is necessary, until it is healed, if God wills.
De fractura ossium Pedis, et Digitorum.	Of the fracture of the bones of the Foot and Toes.
Caput XVIII.	Chapter XVIII.
Calcaneo quidem non accidit fractura penitus.	A fracture of the heel bone does indeed not happen completely.
Ossibus uero Pedis accidit quandoque fractura, et Digitis parum etiam accidit fractura: et non accidit eis nisi attritio in pluribus dispositionibus.	However, fractures of the bones of the Foot sometimes occur, and fractures of the Toes also occur infrequently; and they do not occur to them except for abrasion in most cases.
Quod si accidit ossibus Pedis fractura, et uides illa ossa sublimari super se adinuicem, tunc ponat infirmus Pedem suum super terram praeparatam, sicut ambulans.	If a fracture of the bones of the Foot occurs, and you see those bones rising up above one another, then let the patient place his foot on prepared ground, as if walking.
Deinde sta tu, et pone Pedem tuum super illud quod eleuatur ex illis ossibus: postea preme, uel calca eam: et aequa ipsam, donec redeat in locis suis.	Then stand you, and place your foot upon that which is elevated from those bones; afterward press or tread it; and straighten it, until it returns to its place.
Deinde pone emplastrum, et stuppam desuper: et pone sub uentre Pedis tabulam paruam, cui sint duo capita plana.	Then place a plaster, and tow upon it; and place a small board under the sole of the foot, having two flat ends.
Deinde stringe eam cum Pede strictura decenti, postquam tu inuoluis eam cum pannis, et reliquis quibus indiget.	Then bind it with a suitable bandage, after you have wrapped it with cloths and whatever else it needs.
Cum ergo praetereunt ei tres dies, aut quatuor, tunc solue ligamentum.	When therefore three or four days have passed, then loosen the bandage.
Nam tu inuenies ossa aequata, siue sint fracta, aut sint dislocata.	For you will find the bones straightened, whether they were broken or dislocated.
Operatio ergo in eis est, sicut uides.	Therefore, the operation on them is as you see.
Si autem franguntur aliqui digiti, tunc restaura eos, et aequa ipsos secundum quod narraui tibi in restauratione digitorum manus.	If, however, some fingers are broken, then restore them and straighten them according to what I have told you concerning the restoration of the fingers of the hand.
Deinde pone digito tuo astellam secundum longitudinem digiti, et sit latior eo parumper: deinde pone sub Pede hanc tabulam quam narraui tibi, et stringe eam strictura decenti.	Then place a splint under the finger, the length of the finger, and a little wider; then place under the foot this board which I have told you, and bind it with a suitable bandage.
Si uero quod frangitur ex ossibus est duo, aut tria, aut plus, tunc pone super omnem digitum astellam suae quantitatis, inuolutam in panno lini: et stringe tabulam in inferiori Pedis: et sit stans super unum capitum tabulae extra uentrem Pedis, ut teneat retentione bona.	If, however, the broken bone is two, or three, or more, then place a splint of its appropriate size, wrapped in linen cloth, over each finger; and bind the board at the lower part of the foot; and let it stand on one end of the board outside the foot, so that it holds well.
Et conuenit tibi, ut non obliuiscaris, quin consideres omnia quae dixi tibi in reliquis fracturis ex accidentibus quae diximus: et oppone omni accidenti cum eo quod oportet.	And it befits you not to forget to consider everything that I have said to you concerning other fractures from accidents that we have discussed, and oppose each accident with what is appropriate.
¶ De fractura Vuluae mulieris, et ossis pectinis, et uirgae uiri.	Concerning the fracture of a woman's vulva, and the breastbone, and a man's penis.
Caput XIX.	Chapter XIX.
Quando frangitur Vulua mulieris, tunc fac eam sedere quadratam.	When a woman's vulva is fractured, then make her sit upright.
Deinde inclina eam ad partem dorsi ipsius parumper, et teneatur retro.	Then incline her slightly towards her back, and hold her back.
Deinde impleat obstetrix Vuluam eius coto, donec impleat eam: et fiat in Vulua ex eo sicut sphera.	Then let the midwife fill her vulva with wool, until it fills it: and let there be made in the vulva from it as a sphere.
Deinde concutiatur mulier, et eleua dorsum eius paulatim.	Then let the woman be shaken, and raise her back gradually.
Illud enim cotum egreditur, donec fiat ante portam Vuluae sicut sphera, et os fractum redit.	For that wool will emerge, until it becomes like a sphere before the vulva's opening, and the fractured opening returns.
Deinde pone puluillum super dorsum eius.	Then place a cushion on her back.
Quando ergo uult mingere, remoueat cotum cum facilitate, deinde mingat: et reduc ipsum secundum modum, quo intromisisti ipsum in primis: deinde redeat ad puluillum suum primum.	Therefore, when she wishes to urinate, remove the wool easily, then let her urinate: and return it according to the manner in which you first introduced it: then return to her original cushion.
Faciat illud septem diebus, aut circiter, os ipsum enim restauratur.	Let her do that for seven days, or thereabouts, for the opening itself is restored.
Et si uis, accipe uesicam ouis, et stringe super foramen eius cannulam arundinis, et intromitte uesicam totam in Vuluam eius.	And if you wish, take a sheep's bladder and string a reed cannula over its opening, and introduce the entire bladder into her vulva.
Deinde suffla in cannulam cum uirtute, donec infletur uesica intra Vuluam, fractura enim redit.	Then blow into the cannula with force, until the bladder inflates inside the vulva, for the rupture will return.
Deinde impleatur cum coto, et stet aliquot diebus, secundum quod narrauimus, donec sanetur.	Then fill it with wool, and let it stand for several days, according to what we have described, until it is healed.
Et quando frangitur os Pectinis uiri, aut mulieris, tunc administra in restauratione eius, et ipsius aequatione illud quod narrauimus in osse Anchae.	And when the bone of the pubic arch of a man or woman breaks, then administer in its restoration and its equalization that which we have described in the bone of the pelvis.
Et non occultatur rectum in his fracturis propinquis, quae parum contingunt, praecipue cui est quiddam studii, uel usus.	And the rectum is not hidden in these nearby fractures, which rarely occur, especially in those who have some degree of skill or experience.
Et intellige librum meum istum multum, quoniam fractura ipsa significat tibi in pluribus dispositionibus uiam rectam in restauratione sui, et strictura sui: intellige ergo.	And understand my book well, for this fracture itself will show you in many ways the correct path in restoring it and in tightening it: understand therefore.
In Virga autem uiri quando frangitur, accipe guttur anseris: et intromitte uirgam in ipso.	In the penis of a man, when it is broken, take the throat of a goose; and introduce the penis into it.
Deinde pone super ipsum inuolutionem ex panno, et inuoluatur, et dimittatur tribus diebus, aut circiter eos, et sanabitur, si Deus uoluerit.	Then place upon it a wrapping of cloth, and let it be wrapped up and left for three days, or thereabouts, and it will heal, if God wills.
¶ De restauratione fracturae ossium, quando est cum uulnere.	Concerning the restoration of a fractured bone, when it is with a wound.
Caput XX.	Chapter XX.
Conuenit ei cui accidit fractura cum uulnere, praecipue si est magnum, sicut os coxae, aut adiutorii, aut simile illi, ut properes, et phlebotomes ipsum statim: si attestantur tibi conditiones phlebotomiae, sicut praemisimus.	It is fitting for one who has a fracture with a wound, especially if it is large, such as the hip bone, or the auxiliary bone, or similar to it, that you hasten and immediately bleed him: if the conditions for bleeding attest to you, as we have mentioned previously.
Quod si uulnus effluit sanguinem, tunc oportet, ut properes ad abscisionem eius, ita ut puluerizes super ipsum zegi tritum: si non est tibi praesens aliud.	If the wound flows blood, then it is necessary that you hasten to its excision, so that you pulverize upon it ground zegi: if another is not present to you.
Deinde incipe restaurare fracturam in illo eodem die: et non postponas illud, si non accidit apostema.	Then begin to restore the fracture on that same day: and do not postpone it, if an abscess does not occur.
Si uero accidit apostema calidum, tunc dimitte restaurationem eius usque ad diem nonum, donec sedetur apostema.	If however a hot abscess occurs, then postpone its restoration until the ninth day, until the abscess subsides.
Et non appropinques ei in die tertio, et quarto omnino, nam tu faceres ei accidere accidentia mala.	And do not approach him on the third and fourth days at all, for you would cause him to experience bad accidents.
Si autem os fractum est eminens super cutem detectum: tunc oportet, ut coneris reducere ipsum, et aequare ipsum manibus tuis cum facilitate et extensione parua.	If however the fractured bone is prominent above the skin, exposed: then it is necessary that you attempt to reduce it, and to align it with your hands with ease and little extension.
Si autem non praeparatur extensio eius, et ipsius aequatio manibus tuis: tunc reduc ipsum cum isto instrumento.	If however its extension and alignment with your hands are not prepared, then reduce it with this instrument.
Et est instrumentum quod fit ex ferro, cuius longitudo est quantitas septem digitorum, aut octo: et eius latitudo est secundum quantitatem uulneris.	And it is an instrument made of iron, whose length is the amount of seven fingers, or eight; and its width is according to the amount of the wound.
Et propter illud necesse est medico, ut accipiat ex eis tria, aut quatuor secundum quantitatem qua indiget ad illud ex curatione in omni specie fracturae.	And because of that, it is necessary for the physician to take from them three, or four, according to the amount he needs for that treatment in every type of fracture.
Et sit rotundum: et sit in eo grossitudo parua, ut non duplicetur apud compressionem super ipsum in hora operationis: et sit acutae extremitatis, cui sit margo in extremitatibus suis.	And let it be round; and let it have a small thickness, so that it is not doubled when pressed upon it during the operation; and let it be sharp-pointed, with a margin on its ends.
Et sit superius eius ad grossitudinem ex medietate eius usque ad inferiora.	And let its top be at the thickness of its middle, down to its bottom.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its shape.
Oportet in Hac Operatione, ut ponatur extremitas eius acuta curuata super extremitatem ossis eminentis: et impelle ipsum cum eo uice una, donec quando redit os et aequatur quadam aequatione.	It is necessary in this operation that its pointed bent end be placed on the protruding bone end, and push it with it at once, until when the bone returns and is equalized in a certain manner.
Conare ergo aequare extremitates fracturae adinuicem.	Therefore, try to equalize the fractured ends together.
Quod si extremitates eius fracta est subtilis, et non accipit eam instrumentum accaeptione bona, tunc opotet, ut incidas extremitatem illius ossis, donec instrumentum potestatem habeat eius.	If its fractured ends are delicate, and the instrument does not grasp them properly, then it is necessary that you cut the end of that bone, until the instrument has power over it.
Si uero non potes reducere eos cum eo quod narrauimus omnino, tunc incide ipsum cum eo quod conuenit ei ex Incisoriis quae diximus: aut serra ipsum cum una serrarum quocunque modo possibile est tibi.	If, however, you cannot reduce them with what we have described completely, then cut it with one of the incisions we have mentioned; or saw it with one of the saws, in whatever way possible for you.
Deinde rade illud quod remanet in osse ex asperitate et corticibus minutis.	Then scrape away what remains on the bone of roughness and small pieces.
Cum ergo reducitur os, et inuenit infirmus post reductionem eius dolorem uehementem laedentem, tunc scias, quod os non rediit ad locum suum naturalem.	Therefore, when the bone is reduced, and the infirm person finds intense pain after its reduction, then know that the bone has not returned to its natural place.
Fac ergo illud.	Therefore, do that.
Nam tu confers infirmo iuuamentum magnum, cum completur restauratio tua quam facis ossi.	For you confer great aid to the infirm person, when your restoration of the bone is completed.
Tunc submerge pannum in uino stiptico, nigro.	Then immerse a cloth in astringent, black wine.
Et proprie si est in aestate.	And properly if it is in summer.
Et non ponas super uulnus caerotum, neque aliquid in quo sit oleum: ut non faciat accidere in ipso putredinem et corruptionem.	And do not place over the wound a carrot, nor anything in which there is oil, so that it does not cause putrefaction and corruption within it.
Deinde administra astellas in hora complementi tui a restauratione ossis.	Then administer the splints at the hour of completion of your restoration of the bone.
Et dimitte uulnus detectum: ita, ut incidas cum forficibus foramen in inuolutionibus secundum quantitatem uulneris.	And leave the wound uncovered; so that you cut with scissors a hole in the dressings according to the size of the wound.
Et caue omni cautela, ne stringas uulnus cum fractura.	And beware with all caution not to bind the wound with the fracture.
Multotiens enim fecerunt istud stolidi medici: et fecerunt accidere super infirmos suos aut mortem, aut corrosionem, aut zuchem, id est, saniem.	For many times foolish physicians have done this, and caused upon their sick patients either death or corruption or züch, that is, pus.
Et sit strictura tua mollis, lenis, diuersa stricturae fracturarum reliquarum.	And let your binding be soft, gentle, unlike the binding of other fractures.
Quod si uulnus est malum, aut est uulnus magnum, et times super ipsum quaedam accidentia mala quae narrauimus, et inuenis dolorem in loco suspensum: tunc non oportet, ut ponas super ipsum astellas.	If the wound is bad, or is a large wound, and you fear some bad accidents which we have described, and find pain in a suspended place: then you should not put splints upon it.
Et fac eis inuolutiones ex pannis duris in loco astellarum, et stringe ipsum cum eis.	And make them bandages from hard cloths in the place of splints, and bind it with them.
Cum autem est post diem unum, aut dies duos, et uides uulnus iam incipere, ut in eo generetur pus: tunc aufer desuper ipsum pannum quem posuisti super ipsum cum uino.	When, however, it is after one day or two days, and you see the wound beginning to generate pus: then remove from above it the cloth which you placed upon it with wine.
Deinde administra licinia, et unguenta cum quibus de consuetudine nostra est, ut medicemur uulnera: sicut unguentum tetrapharmacon, et similia illi.	Then administer bandages and ointments with which it is customary for us to treat wounds, such as tetrapharmacon ointment, and similar ones.
Et conuenit tibi, ut soluas ligamentum.	And it befits you to loosen the bandage.
Et considera uulnus in omni die mane et uespere, donec consolidetur, et sanetur.	And consider the wound every day morning and evening, until it consolidates and heals.
Et oportet, ut praeparetur membrum taliter, ut currat ex eo pus ad inferiora cum facilitate.	And it is necessary that the limb be prepared in such a way that pus runs from it downwards with ease.
Quod si praetereunt uulneri dies multi, et non consolidatur, neque abscinditur pus ab eo: tunc scias, quod illic sunt satagie ossis parua.	If many days pass over the wound, and it does not consolidate, nor is pus separated from it: then know that there are small bone splinters there.
Quare oportet, ut inquiras uulnus cum tenta.	Therefore it is necessary that you investigate the wound with probes.
Quot uero ex illis alsatagie sunt separata, remoue ea, et extrahe ipsa.	However, remove those splinters that are separated, and extract them.
Et quae ex eis sunt non separata, et pungunt membrum, et faciunt accidere dolorem, conare incidere ea, et auferre ea omni modo quo possibile est tibi illud.	And those of them which are not separated, and which pierce the limb, and cause pain to occur, try to cut them and remove them by every means possible to you.
Quod si accidat uulneri zuchen, aut ekileten, id est, estiomenus, aut species alia corruptionis et putrefactionis: tunc oportet, ut opponas unicuique ex eis cum eo quod conuenit ei ex curatione, cuius praecessit narratio in capitulo suo.	If any ulceration, or suppuration, or other species of corruption or putrefaction occurs in the wound, then it is necessary to apply to each of these whatever remedy is suitable, according to the description in its appropriate chapter.
Et ex eo in quo oportet ut stet sermo meus, et cui facias praesentem mentem tuam quando frangitur os, et eminet super membrum, sicut os coxae, et adiutorii, et similia eis ex membris magnis, est, ut non praesumas attractionem eius, multotiens enim accidit ex illo mors, imo dimitte ipsum, donec putrefiat.	And in the case where you must direct your attention, when a bone is broken and protrudes from the limb, such as the hip bone, and other large bones, do not attempt to pull it back, for often death ensues from it; rather, leave it until it has decayed.
Fortasse enim cadet per se post uiginti dies, aut triginta.	Perhaps it will fall out by itself after twenty or thirty days.
Tunc ergo cura uulnus, si uidetur tibi: et sinon, dimitte ipsum.	Then, if the wound appears to you to need it, treat it; if not, leave it.
¶ De curatione Nodationis in uestigio fracturae.	Concerning the treatment of a swelling at the site of a fracture.
Caput XXI.	Chapter 21.
Multoties accidit haec Nodatio in uestigio sanationis fracturae.	This swelling often occurs at the site of a healing fracture.
Praecipue, quae est prope iuncturas: et foedatur ex ea figura membri.	Especially those near the joints; and the shape of the limb is disfigured by it.
Et fortasse prohibet membrum ab operatione sua naturali.	And perhaps it hinders the limb from its natural function.
Considera ergo tunc, si nodatio est recens: administra in ea medicinas quae stipticitatem habent, sicut aloe, et olibanum, et myrrha, et sarcocolla, et acacia, et similia eis.	Therefore, if the swelling is recent, apply medicines that have a styptic effect, such as aloe, frankincense, myrrh, sarcocolla, acacia, and similar ones.
Ita, ut accipias ex istis quasdam, aut omnes eas: et confice eas cum uino stiptico, aut cum albumine oui, aut cum aceto: et pone eas super nodationem in stuppa, et stringe eas super ipsam strictura bona.	So that you take some, or all, of these: and mix them with astringent wine, or with egg white, or with vinegar; and place them on the swelling in a linen cloth, and bandage them well over it.
Et dimitte stricturam, nec soluas eam diebus multis.	And leave the bandage, and do not loosen it for many days.
Deinde solue eam, et itera aliam, donec remoueatur nodatio.	Then loosen it, and apply another, until the swelling is removed.
Aut stringe super ipsam laminam plumbi decenter.	Or bandage over it a lead plate properly.
Plumbo enim est proprietas remouendi omne quod timetur ex membris.	For lead has the property of removing everything that is feared from the limbs.
Si autem nodatio iam in lapidem conuersa est, et stricta est, et festine prouocat necessitas ad auferendum eam: tunc finde super eam ex superiori parte eius, et incide superfluitatem eminentem: aut rade eam cum quibusdam rasoriis, donec remoueatur: et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	However, if the swelling has already turned to stone, and is tight, and necessity quickly prompts its removal: then cut above it on its upper part, and cut away the protruding excess; or scrape it with certain scrapers, until it is removed; and treat it until it is healed.
¶ De curatione quando restauratur, et remanet membrum post illud subtile, non secundum naturam suam.	Concerning the treatment when it is restored, and a limb remains after it delicate, not according to its own nature.
Caput XXII.	Chapter XXII.
Quando restauratur fractura ossis, et remanet membrum post illud subtile, debile: tunc non fit illud nisi propter caussas multas.	When a bone fracture is restored, and a limb remains after it delicate, weak: then that does not happen except for many reasons.
Quarum una est, multitudo solutionis ligamenti et ligationis eius non secundum quod oportet: aut propter superfluitatem stricturae ligamentorum, donec prohibeatur nutrimentum currere ad membrum: aut propter multitudinem embrocationis superfluae in non sua hora: aut propter paucitatem sanguinis in corpore infirmi, et debilitatem eius.	Among which one is the multitude of loosening the ligament and its tying not as it should be: or because of the excess of tightening of the ligaments, until the nourishment is prevented from running to the limb: or because of the multitude of superfluous embrocation at an inappropriate time: or because of the scarcity of blood in the body of the infirm, and its weakness.
Et curatio illius est, cibare infirmum, et tenerum facere corpus eius, donec multiplicetur sanguis in eo.	And the treatment of that is, to nourish the infirm, and to make his body tender, until the blood is multiplied in him.
Et administra balneum.	And administer a bath.
Et intromitte gaudium et laeticiam super eum.	And introduce joy and gladness upon him.
Deinde pone picem super membrum: ut attrahat pix ad ipsum nutrimentum multum.	Then place pitch upon the limb: so that the pitch will attract much nourishment to it.
Et assiduet embrocationem eius cum aqua tepida, donec currat nutrimentum, et redeat ad figuram suam naturalem.	And apply continuous embrocation to it with warm water, until the nourishment flows, and it returns to its natural form.
¶ De curatione ossium fractorum quando restaurantur tortuose.	Concerning the treatment of fractured bones when they are restored crookedly.
Caput XXIII.	Chapter XXIII.
Quando accidit membro iam restaurato post sanationem eius tortuositas, et eminentia ossi fracto, aut nodatio: et foedatur per illud forma membri, uerumtamen membrum non prohibetur ab operatione sua naturali: tunc non oportet ut recipias sermonem eius, qui existimat, ut frangatur membrum denuo.	When, in a limb already restored after its healing, crookedness, and prominence of the fractured bone, or knotting, occur, and the limb's form is disfigured, yet the limb is not hindered from its natural function, then you should not heed the opinion of him who believes that the limb should be broken again.
Et iam fuerunt multi stolidorum medicorum et restauratorum, qui fecerunt illud in terra nostra.	And many foolish physicians and surgeons have done that in our land.
Et haec quidem operatio est uituperabilis ualde, perducens ad mortem, uel timorem magnum, ut scilicet sit mortalis.	And this practice is indeed highly reprehensible, leading to death, or great fear, so that it is lethal.
Verum si claudicatio et nodatio sunt recentes: tunc oportet, ut embrocetur cum aqua tepida, in qua decoctae sint herbae mollificantes, sicut folia alteae, et radix eius, et mellilotum, et illis similia.	But if the lameness and knotting are recent, then it is necessary to soak it in warm water, in which softening herbs have been boiled, such as marshmallow leaves and its root, and melilot, and similar ones.
Et fiat ei emplastrum cum emplastro mollificatiuo, sicut dyachilon decenter factum.	And a plaster should be made with a softening plaster, such as a well-made diachylon.
Aut sumatur mucilago radicis alteae, et concutiatur cum adipe gallinae, aut oleo sisamino: et emplastretur cum eo.	Or take marshmallow root mucilage and mix it with chicken fat or sesame oil, and plaster it with that.
Aut sumantur ficus pingues, et terantur cum fimo columbino, et similibus eis quae nominantur ex medicinis diminuentes consolidationem.	Or take fat figs and grind them with pigeon dung and similar medicinal substances that are known to lessen consolidation.
Et quandoque soluitur nodatio cum fricatione assidua, antiqua, et leni, quae fit cum manibus humidis.	And sometimes the knotting is loosened with constant, ancient, and gentle rubbing, done with moist hands.
Et administretur motus membri ad omnem partem in horis omnibus.	And movement of the limb should be administered to every part at all hours.
Si autem tortuositas iam antecessit, et fortis facta est, et conuersa est in lapidem, et prouocata est necessitas ad curatonem eius cum ferro: tunc oportet, ut secetur superius eius, et soluatur continuatio ossis, et incidatur quod superfluit ex nodatione aut osse cum Incisoriis subtilibus: et administretur facilitas in illo cum sollicitudine et studio.	However, if twisting has already occurred, and it has become strong and turned into stone, and the need arises to treat it with iron: then it is necessary to cut above it, and to loosen the continuity of the bone, and to cut away whatever is superfluous from the knot or bone with sharp knives; and ease should be administered to it with care and effort.
¶ De sermone in Dislocatione.	Concerning the speech in Dislocation.
Caput XXIIII.	Chapter XXIV.
Dislocatio est exitus alicuius iuncturarum a loco suo.	Dislocation is the departure of any joint from its place.
Quare prohibetur a motu suo, et foedatur figura membri.	Therefore, it is prohibited from its motion, and the figure of the limb is disfigured.
Et facit accidere super infirmum dolores, et laesiones uehementes.	And it causes grievous pains and violent injuries to the sufferer.
Quando ergo accidit alicui dislocatio, tunc oportet festinare ad restaurationem eius: neque tardet eam omnino.	Therefore, when any dislocation occurs, one must hasten to restore it: nor should one delay it at all.
Nam si tardatur, apostematur locus, et fortasse cum eo reductio dislocationis.	For if it is delayed, the place becomes suppurated, and perhaps the reduction of the dislocation along with it.
Propter illud ergo non oportet, ut moueatur, neque extendatur in hora apostemationis eius.	Therefore, it is not fitting that it be moved or stretched during the time of its suppuration.
Quoniam multotiens facit accidere spasmum, et dolores laedentes.	Because it frequently causes spasm and painful injuries.
Verum quando accidit illud, tunc oportet, ut properes ad phlebotomiam infirmi.	But when that occurs, then it is necessary that you hasten to perform phlebotomy on the sick person.
Deinde dimittatur, donec quiescat apostema.	Then let it be left alone until the abscess subsides.
Deinde embrocetur membrum cum aqua calida et oleo.	Then the limb should be bathed with warm water and oil.
Deinde reducatur cum facilitate.	Then it should be reduced gently.
Et curetur omne membrum cum eo cuius rememoratio ueniet in loco suo.	And every limb should be treated with whatever remedy will restore it to its place.
Ego quidem iam ordinaui capitula dislocationis, etiam secundum quod praecessit in fractura, a superiori parte corporis usque ad inferiorem eius.	I have indeed already arranged the chapters on dislocations, even as was done before concerning fractures, from the upper part of the body to its lower part.
¶ De cura dislocationis Mandibulae inferioris.	Concerning the treatment of a dislocated lower jaw.
Caput XXV.	Chapter 25.
Parum dislocantur duae Mandibulae nisi raro.	The two jaws are rarely dislocated except rarely.
Et dislocatio ambarum fit secundum unum duoru modorum.	And the dislocation of both occurs according to one of two ways.
Aut enim remouentur a locis suis remotione parua, et mollificantur parumper.	For either they are removed from their places by a small movement and softened for a little while.
Aut dislocantur dislocatione integra, completa, donec mollificentur ad partem pectoris, donec currat saliua infirmi, et non possit tenere eam, neque possit claudere os suum, et inuoluatur lingua eius cum sermone.	Or they are dislocated by a complete dislocation, until they are softened to the chest area, until the sick person's saliva runs, and he cannot hold it, nor can he close his mouth, and his tongue is wrapped up with his speech.
Quando autem dislocatio eius est parua, tunc redit in pluribus dispositionibus per se cum paucitate.	When however its dislocation is small, then it returns in many dispositions by itself with little effort.
Si uero est dislocatio completa, integra: tunc oportet, ut administretur reductio eius uelociter, et non tardetur penitus: et est, ut teneat minister caput infirmi: et intromittat medicus pollicem manus suae unius in radicem Mandibulae dislocationis inter os eius, si dislocatio est a parte una.	If however it is a complete, entire dislocation, then it is necessary that its reduction be administered quickly, and not delayed at all; and it is that the minister should hold the sick person's head; and the physician should insert the thumb of one of his hands into the root of the jaw of the dislocation between his mouth, if the dislocation is on one side.
Aut intromittat duos pollices suos simul, si dislocatio est a duabus partibus.	Or he should insert two of his thumbs together, if the dislocation is on two sides.
Et reliqui digiti manuum eius sint extra, quibus aequet.	And the remaining fingers of his hands should be outside, with which he balances.
Et praecipe infirmo, ut mundificet Mandibulas suas, et absoluat eas ad manducandum ad omnem partem.	And instruct the sick person to cleanse his jaws and make them free to eat on every side.
Et medicus aequet Mandibulam, et impellat Mandibulam, donec redeat ad locum suum.	And the physician should balance the jaw, and push the jaw until it returns to its place.
Quod si difficilis sit reductio eius, praecipue si sunt ambae Mandibulae simul: tunc administra uaporationem cum aqua calida, et oleo, donec fiat facilis reductio ambarum: neque tardes reductionem ambarum omnino, sicut diximus.	If its reduction is difficult, especially if both jaws are simultaneously affected, then administer vaporization with warm water and oil until the reduction of both becomes easy; do not delay the reduction of both at all, as we have said.
Cum ergo redeunt et aequantur, et clauditur os infirmi, et non mollificantur: tunc pone super eas puluillos pannorum, cum ceroto quod sit factum ex cera: et oleo rosato.	When therefore they return and are balanced, and the sick person's mouth is closed, and they are not softened, then place on them cushions of cloth, with cerate made from wax and rose oil.
Deinde ligetur cum facilitate cum ligamentis mollibus.	Then it should be bound with ease with soft bandages.
Et sit somnus infirmi super dorsum suum: et caput eius sit stans inter duo puluinaria, ut non moueat ipsum ad dextram et sinistram: neque conetur, uel cogatur masticare aliquid: imo ponatur cibus eius sorbitio lenis, donec quando remouentur dolores, et nodatur Mandibula: tunc comedat quod uult, et administretur illud cum facilitate.	And let the sick person's sleep be on their back, and let their head be propped up between two pillows, so that they do not move it to the right and left, nor attempt or be forced to chew anything; rather, let their food be soft drinks, until when the pains are removed, and the jaw is fixed, then let them eat what they wish, and let it be administered with ease.
Non laboret super operationem oris sui apud comestionem et potum, et oscitationem, donec nodetur Mandibula, et sanetur.	Let them not exert themselves over the operation of their mouth in eating and drinking and yawning until the jaw is fixed and healed.
Quod si difficilis fiat reductio duarum Mandibuiarum, quando dislocantur in hora aliqua, et non conuertuntur ad loca sua: tunc multotiens accidunt inde febres, et soda assidua: et fortasse soluitur uenter infirmi, et fortasse uomit choleram puram.	If the reduction of the two jaws becomes difficult, when they are dislocated at any time, and they do not return to their places, then fever and constant sweating often result; and perhaps the sick person's stomach is loosened, and perhaps they vomit pure bile.
Cum ergo uides illud: tunc scias, quia est perditio, et multotiens moritur ille cui accidit illud in decem diebus.	Therefore, when you see this, know that it is a loss, and often the one who experiences this dies within ten days.
¶ De reducione dislocationis Furculae, et extremitatis humeri.	On the reduction of the dislocation of the collarbone and the arm.
Caput XXVI.	Chapter XXVI.
Furcula quidem non dislocatur ex latere intrinseco, propter continuationem suam cum pectore.	The collarbone does not dislocate from the inner side, because of its continuity with the chest.
Et dislocatur quandoque ad exteriora: et declaratur illud sensui.	And it sometimes dislocates outward, and this is evident to the senses.
Et restauratio eius est, ut iaceat infirmus super dorsum suum, et extendat brachia sua.	And its restoration is that the patient lie on their back, and extend their arms.
Deinde coarta locum cum palma tua coartatione forti, nam ipsa redibit.	Then grasp the place with a strong hand-grip, for it will return.
Deinde pone super ipsam emplastrum, et puluillos, et stringe eam.	Then place a plaster and cushions over it, and bind it.
Extremitates uero eius quae sequuntur cubitum, et continuantur cum eo, non dislocantur, nisi raro.	However, its extremities that follow the elbow, and continue with it, are not dislocated, except rarely.
Quod si dislocatur die aliquo: tunc oportet, ut reducatur et aequetur secundum quod diximus, et quod praeparatur tibi.	If it is dislocated on any day, then it is necessary that it be reduced and set according to what we have said, and what is prepared for you.
Deinde pone super ipsam emplastrum, et puluillos, et stricturam.	Then place a plaster, and cushions, and a bandage over it.
Et praecipe infirmo, adhaerere tranquillitati et quieti, donec sanetur.	And instruct the sick person to adhere to tranquility and quiet until healed.
Et cum hac eadem curatione reducitur extremitas Humeri, quando separatur etiam a loco suo.	And with this same treatment, the humerus extremity is reduced when it is also separated from its place.
¶ De reductione dislocationis Humeri.	Concerning the reduction of the dislocation of the Humerus.
Caput XXVII.	Chapter XXVII.
Scias, quod Humerus non dislocatur, nisi secundum tres modos.	Know that the Humerus is not dislocated except according to three ways.
Quorum unus est, ut dislocetur ad partem titillici ad inferiora.	One of which is that it is dislocated to the side of the armpit below.
Secundus est, ut dislocetur ad partem pectoris.	The second is that it is dislocated to the side of the chest.
Et fortasse dislocatur ad superiorem partem Humeri: et illud fit raro.	And perhaps it is dislocated to the upper part of the Humerus; and that happens rarely.
Et non dislocatur ad posteriora, propter spatulam.	And it is not dislocated to the back, because of the scapula.
Et non dislocatur ad anteriora, propter neruos.	And it is not dislocated to the front, because of the nerves.
Et plurimum quidem dislocatur et egreditur ad inferiora uersus titillicum: praecipue in illis, quorum carnes sunt paucae.	And very often it is dislocated and emerges downwards towards the lower part of the leg; especially in those whose flesh is scanty.
Quoniam egrediur in eis uelociter, et ingreditur uelociter.	Because it emerges quickly in them, and enters quickly.
In illis autem quorum carnes sunt multae, est econtrario illius, scilicet quia egreditur cum difficultate, et ingreditur cum difficultate.	However, in those whose flesh is abundant, it is the opposite, namely that it emerges with difficulty, and enters with difficulty.
Et fortasse accidit quibusdam hominibus percussio, aut casus, et apostematur Humerus apostemate calido, et putatur propter illud, quia iam dislocatus est.	And perhaps it happens to some people through a blow or a fall, and the humerus becomes inflamed with a hot abscess, and it is thought to be because it has already been dislocated.
Oportet ergo, ut experiaris illud, donec stes super certitudinem eius, et tunc procedas in curatione eius.	Therefore, it is necessary that you test it until you are certain of it, and then proceed with its treatment.
Et cognoscitur dislocatio, quando est ad inferiora uersus titillicum: et distinguas inter Humerum dislocatum, et humerum sanum.	And dislocation is recognized when it is directed downwards towards the tickle: and distinguish between a dislocated humerus and a healthy humerus.
Nam tu inuenis inter eos diuersitatem manifestam, et inuenis in capite Humeri concauitatem, et sub titillico apud tactum caput humeri quasi ipsum sit ouum: et non potest infirmus reducere manum ad aurem suam, neque mouere eam omnibus motibus.	For you find a clear difference among them, and you find a concavity in the head of the humerus, and below the tickle, at the touch, the head of the humerus is like an egg itself; and the weak person cannot bring his hand to his ear, nor move it in all directions.
Et similiter, si dislocatur uersus pectus, aut ad sursum: tunc inuenis manifestum tactum, neque occultatur.	And similarly, if it is dislocated towards the chest, or upwards, then you find a clear touch, and it is not hidden.
Et huius quidem dislocationis fit facilis reductio, quando est recens, aut infirmus est puer.	And indeed, a reduction of this dislocation is easy when it is recent, or the patient is a child.
Et reductio eius est, ut eleuet minister manum suam ad superiora.	And its reduction is that the attendant should raise his hand upwards.
Deinde pone tu pollices tuos sub titillico eius, et eleua iuncturam cum fortitudine ad sursum ad locum suum: et minister eleuet manum suam, et extendat eam ad sursum.	Then place your thumbs under its tickle, and raise the joint with strength upwards to its place; and the attendant should raise his hand and extend it upwards.
Deinde ponat eam inferius, ipse enim redit uelociter.	Then he should place it lower, for it will quickly return.
Si autem non redit per illud quod diximus, et sunt a principio quo accidit dislocatio dies multi: tunc oportet, ut balneetur infirmus in aqua calida, et administretur embrocatio quae mollificat et lenit, sicut si decoquantur radices alteae, et foenugraecum, et mellilotum in aqua, et administretur.	However, if it does not return through what we have said, and there are many days since the dislocation occurred, then it is necessary that the patient be bathed in warm water, and an embrocation be administered which softens and soothes, such as if the roots of marshmallow, and fenugreek, and melilot are boiled in water, and administered.
Deinde resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum: et ponatur sub titillico eius sphera et lana, quae sit aequalis inter lenitatem et stricturam.	Then the patient should lie supine on his back; and a sphere and wool should be placed under his tickle, which should be equal between softness and tightness.
Deinde ponat medicus calcaneum suum super spheram, et eleuet caput humeri cum uirtute, et attrahat manum infirmi ad inferiora.	Then the physician should place his heel on the sphere, and lift the shoulder head with force, and pull the patient's hand downwards.
Et minister alius teneat caput infirmi, ut non moueatur ad inferiora: ipse namque redit statim.	And another assistant should hold the patient's head so that it does not move downwards; for it will immediately return.
Et si uis, reduc eum secundum modum hunc: et est, ut facias esse praesentem uirum qui sit longior infirmo, et stet a parte lateris, et intromittat humerum suum sub titillico infirmi: et eleuet titillicum eius ad superiora, donec sit infirmus suspensus in aere.	And if you wish, reduce him according to this method: and it is necessary to have a man present who is taller than the patient, and stand on the side, and insert his shoulder under the patient's armpit: and lift his armpit upwards, until the patient is suspended in the air.
Et minister alius trahat manum infirmi ad inferiora uentris eius.	And another assistant should pull the patient's hand downwards to his abdomen.
Si autem infirmus est leuis: tunc oportet, ut suspendatur cum eo aliquid aliud, ut grauet ipsum: nam redit dislocatio statim.	If however the patient is light, then it is necessary to suspend something else with him, so that it weighs him down; for the dislocation returns immediately.
Et reducitur etiam secundum modum alium: et est, ut figatur in terra lignum longum, cuius caput sit rotundum figura: sicut manica mortarii: quod non sit grossum, neque subtile.	And it is also reduced according to another method: and it is necessary to fix a long piece of wood in the ground, whose head is round in shape, like a mortar's sleeve; which should not be thick, nor thin.
Deinde ponatur sub infirmo postquam ponuntur super caput ligni panni lenes: et infirmus sit stans secundum longitudinem ligni.	Then the patient is placed underneath, after soft cloths are placed on the top of the wood; and the patient stands along the length of the wood.
Deinde extendatur manus eius ad inferiora a parte altera, et extendatur corpus eius ab altera parte cum fortitudine: nam iunctura redit ad locum suum cum uelocitate.	Then his hand should be extended downwards on one side, and his body extended from the other side with strength; for the joint returns to its place with speed.
Quod si difficilis sit eius reductio per omnia quae diximus, tunc utere hac cura: et est, ut accipias lignum cuius longitudo sit quantitas duorum brachiorum, et eius latitudo quantitas quatuor digitorum, et grossitudo eius quantitas duorum digitorum: cui sit caput rotundum, ut alleuietur introitus eius in profundum titillici, secundum hanc formam.	If his reduction is difficult by all that we have said, then use this treatment: and it is to take a piece of wood whose length is the size of two arms, and its width the size of four fingers, and its thickness the size of two fingers; to which there is a round head, so that its entry into the deep cavity of the joint is alleviated, according to this form.
Deinde ligentur super caput rotundum panni lenes, ut non laedat lignum infirmum.	Then soft cloths are tied over the round head, so that the wood does not injure the patient.
Deinde ponatur sub titillico infirmi, ut extendatur manus, aut brachium super lignum usque ad inferiora: et ligetur lignum super adiutorium et brachium et extremitatem manus.	Then place the wood under the patient's joint, so that the hand or arm is extended downwards over the wood; and tie the wood to the support and arm and hand.
Deinde ponatur brachium super gradum scalae per latitudinem, et extendatur manus ad inferiora, et dimittatur reliquum corpus suspensum a parte altera.	Then place the arm on a step of a ladder in width, and extend the hand downwards, and let the rest of the body hang suspended on the other side.
Iunctura enim ingreditur statim.	The joint immediately enters.
Cum ergo completur introitus eius secundum quemcunque modum possibile est: tunc oportet, ut ponas sub titillico spheram aequalis quantitatis ex lana.	When therefore its entry is completed in whatever way is possible, then it is necessary that you place a sphere of equal quantity made of wool under the joint.
Deinde pone emplastrum praeparatum ex puluere molendini cum olibano, et albumine oui super humerum totum, sicut reuoluitur desuper.	Then place a prepared plaster made of mill dust with frankincense and egg white over the entire shoulder, as it revolves from above.
Deinde stringe sub titillico strictura decenti: et reuoluatur ligamentum super emplastrum desuper: et annectatur manus eius ad collum ipsius, et dimittatur, neque moueatur manus eius septem diebus.	Then tie a suitable bandage under the joint, and the bandage should be wound over the plaster from above, and his hand should be bound to his neck, and it should be left undisturbed for seven days, neither should his hand be moved.
Et oportet, ut ponatur cibus infirmipaucus, donec confortetur membrum: quoniam est uelocius ad sanationem eius.	And it is necessary that little food be given to the weak one, until the limb is strengthened; because this is more rapid for its healing.
Deinde ponatur amplior post septem dies, aut quinque, et ex ercitetur cum motu.	Then a larger one should be placed after seven days, or five, and it should be exercised with movement.
Si ergo firmatur et non mollificatur, tunc iam sanatus est.	If therefore it is strengthened and does not soften, then it is already healed.
Si uero iunctura dislocatur multotiens, propter humiditatem quae accidit ei, aut propter caussam aliam: tunc oportet, ut administretur in ea cauterium cum tribus foraminibus, secundum quod praemissum est in capitulo de cauterio.	If, however, the joint dislocates many times, due to the moisture that occurs in it, or because of another cause, then it is necessary that a cautery with three holes be applied to it, according to what was previously stated in the chapter on cautery.
Quod si fiat hoc totum, et soluatur ligamentum post septem dies, et non confirmetur iunctura, et reducatur emplastrum et strictura super ipsum aliquotiens, et non firmetur, et cadat, et non possit eleuare ipsum ad superiora: tunc scias, quod nerui eius qui sunt ad caput humeri, iam incisi sunt, aut extensi, aut mollificati: et scias, quod iunctura nunquam figetur in loco suo.	If all this is done, and the ligament loosens after seven days, and the joint is not strengthened, and the plaster and constriction are applied to it several times, and it is not strengthened, and it falls, and cannot be lifted to its higher position: then know that the nerves belonging to the shoulder head are already cut, or stretched, or softened; and know that the joint will never be fixed in its place.
Dislocationis autem quae fit uersus pectus et mammillam, aut ad posteriora reductio, fit cum impulsione et extensione cum manibus: donec redeat, et administretur in ea reliqua strictura et cura, donec sanetur.	However, the reduction of a dislocation that occurs towards the breast and nipple, or to the rear, is done with pushing and stretching with the hands, until it returns, and the remaining constriction and treatment are applied to it, until it is healed.
Quod si accidat post sanationem grauitas in membro, et tarditas in motu eius, tunc utatur infirmus balneo multotiens, donec leniatur illa grauitas, et redeat ad naturam eius primam.	If, after healing, heaviness occurs in the limb, and slowness in its movement, then the sick person should use the bath many times, until that heaviness is lessened, and it returns to its original nature.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Cubiti.	Concerning the treatment of elbow dislocation.
Caput XXVIII.	Chapter XXVIII.
Scias, quod iunctura Cubiti dislocatur cum difficultate, et similiter redit cum difficultate etiam: et ipsa quidem dislocatur ad omnes partes, et praecipue ad anteriorem, aut ad posteriorem.	Know that the elbow joint dislocates with difficulty, and similarly returns with difficulty also: and indeed it dislocates to all sides, and especially to the front or to the back.
Et eius dislocatio non occultatur tibi: quoniam est cadens sub uisu, et sub tactu, secundum quamcunque figuram dislocetur.	And its dislocation is not hidden from you, since it is apparent to the eye and to the touch, regardless of how it is dislocated.
Et quando coniungis cubitum dislocatum cum sano, declaratur tibi illud manifeste.	And when you join the dislocated elbow with the healthy one, that will be clearly evident to you.
Concauatur enim iunctura, et non potest duplicare brachium, neque tangere cum eo humerum suum.	For the joint is hollowed out, and cannot double the arm, nor touch its own shoulder with it.
Et oportet, ut properes, et reducas dislocationem statim, antequam accidat ei apostema calidum.	And you should hasten and reduce the dislocation immediately, before a hot abscess occurs in it.
Nam si accidit ei apostema calidum, difficilis fit eius reductio: et fortasse non sanatur omnino, praecipue quando est ad posteriora.	For if a hot abscess occurs in it, its reduction becomes difficult; and perhaps it will not be completely healed, especially when it is towards the back.
Est enim deterior omnibus speciebus dislocationis, et uehementioris doloris eis: et multotiens descendit cum ea mors.	For it is worse than all kinds of dislocations, and causes more intense pain in them; and often death comes with it.
Et restauratio eius quando est ex eis quae possibile est reducere, est, ut extendatur manus eius cum duabus manibus: et brachium eius sit expansum, et manus medici sint supra cubitum et sub eo, et ipse impellat iuncturam cum pollicibus manuum suarum simul, aut cum radice palmae suae, donec redeat ad locum suum.	And its restoration, when it is among those that can be reduced, is that his hand should be extended with two hands; and his arm extended, and the physician's hands be above and below the elbow, and he should push the joint with the thumbs of his hands together, or with the base of his palms, until it returns to its place.
Aut uero dislocatio est ad anteriora: tunc redit ita, ut duplicet manum cum manu sua, donec percutiat cum radice palmae suae cubitum qui est dislocatus.	Or indeed the dislocation is towards the front: then it returns thus, so that he should double his hand with his hand, until he strikes with the base of his palm the elbow which is dislocated.
Quod si non obedit dislocatio ad reductionem, tunc administra extensionem uehementem, fortem ualde: et est, ut extendant brachium duo ministri: et teneant ipsum duo ministri etiam, ut non remoueatur apud extensionem.	If the dislocation does not yield to reduction, then administer a very strong, forceful extension; and it is so that two attendants should extend the arm; and two attendants should also hold it so that it is not moved during the extension.
Deinde reuoluatur brachium ad omnem partem postquam inuoluitur super manum eius pannus duplicatus longus, aut ligamentum latum.	Then the arm should be rotated to every part after a long doubled cloth, or a wide bandage, has been wrapped around it.
Et quando tangit medicus manu sua iuncturam, inungat ipsam cum oleo: ut sit illud ex eis quae adiuuant in lubricitate iuncturae cum facilitate.	And when the physician touches the joint with his hand, he should anoint it with oil; so that it is one of those things that assist in the lubrication of the joint with ease.
Deinde impellat iuncturam impulsione uehementi, donec redeat.	Then he should drive the joint with a forceful impulse until it returns.
Et post reductionem eius oportet, ut ponatur super ipsam emplastrum, in quo sit stipticitas, et exiccatio cum albugine oui: et stringatur strictura decenti.	And after its reduction, it is necessary to place a plaster upon it, in which there is astringency and drying with egg white; and a decent bandage should be tied.
Et suspendatur brachium a collo infirmi: et dimitte diebus aliquot.	And let the arm be suspended from the patient's neck, and leave it for some days.
Deinde soluatur.	Then let it be loosened.
Si ergo firmatur iunctura in loco suo, tunc solue ligamentum ab ea, et dimitte ipsam.	If therefore the joint is strengthened in its place, then loosen the bandage from it, and leave it.
Et si uides iuncturam non bene stringi, tunc itera emplastrum, et ligamentum, et dimitte ipsam diebus aliquot, donec stringatur.	And if you see the joint not being well bound, then apply the plaster and bandage again, and leave it for some days, until it is bound.
Deinde solue ipsam.	Then loosen it.
Si autem accidit ei grauitas post reductionem iuncturae, et dispositio sit in motu: tunc administra humectationem in balneatione, et fricationem subtilem, et compressionem, donec liniatur, aut pone super iuncturam iliati, id est, natem arietis pinguem.	If however there happens to it a heaviness after the reduction of the joint, and the disposition is in motion: then administer moistening in a bath, and gentle friction and compression, until it is lined, or place upon the joint a fat ram's buttock.
Deinde ligetur, et dimitte ipsam super eam die et nocte.	Then it shall be bound, and leave it upon it day and night.
Deinde aufer eam, et intromitte ipsum in balneum.	Then remove it, and introduce it into the bath.
Cum ergo sudat, tunc frica iuncturam fricatione temperata.	When therefore it sweats, then rub the joint with tempered friction.
Deinde itera super ipsam aleliati uice una, et secunda, et tertia cum introitu balnei, donec leniatur.	Then repeat upon it the aleliati in one, and second, and third turn with the entrance into the bath, until it is soothed.
Et si uis, pone super ipsam stercus uaccinum, humidum, calefactum cum butyro, et stringe super ipsum.	And if you wish, place upon it a cow dung, moist, heated with butter, and bind over it.
Fac illud aliquotiens.	Do it several times.
Ipsa namque lenitur, et redit ad dispositionem suam.	For it is soothed, and returns to its proper condition.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Almahassem.	Concerning the treatment of dislocation of the Almahassem.
Caput XXIX.	Chapter XXIX.
Mahassem manus multotiens dislocatur, id est, iunctura quae est inter brachium et manum.	The joint connecting the arm and hand, the Mahassem, is dislocated many times.
Et reductio dislocationis eius est facilis.	And the reduction of its dislocation is easy.
Econtrario reliquarum iuncturarum.	Contrary to other joints.
Verumtamen oportet, ut uelocitas sit in reductione dislocationis eius in hora in qua dislocatur, antequam apostemetur locus: aut accidat in eo apostema calidum.	However, speed is necessary in reducing its dislocation at the time it is dislocated, before the area becomes suppurated; or a hot abscess occurs there.
Et reductio dislocationis in eo est, ut ponas Mahassem manus infirmae super tabulam, et extendat minister manum eius: et ponat medicus palmam suam super eminentiam iuncturae, et impellat eam, donec redeat.	And the reduction of the dislocation is that you place the dislocated hand on a table, and the assistant extends the hand: and the physician places his palm on the prominence of the joint, and pushes it until it returns.
Verumtamen oportet, ut consyderetur, si palma iam recessit ad uentrem manus: tunc ponat infirmus dorsum manus suae super tabulam apud extensionem et reductionem: et si dislocatio est procedens ad dorsum manus, tunc sit positio manus eius intrinsece super tabulam, id est, interior pars manus eius super tabulam ponatur, ut cadat manus medici super ipsam eminentiam iuncturae.	However, it is necessary to consider, if the palm has already receded to the hand's back; then the patient should place the back of his hand on the table at the extension and reduction; and if the dislocation is proceeding to the back of the hand, then the position of his hand should be placed inside on the table, that is, the inner part of his hand placed on the table, so that the hand of the physician falls onto the very prominence of the joint.
Si ergo redit statim, bonum est: et si non, tunc stringe eam cum emplastro sedante apostema: et dimitte ipsum, neque iteres illud.	If therefore it returns immediately, it is good; and if not, then bind it with a soothing plaster for the abscess: and leave it, and do not repeat it.
Nam si non tolerat, neque potes super reductionem eius, postquam praetereunt ei dies, uerumtamen iunctura remanet secundum tortuositatem suam: et non nocet infirmo aliquid, nisi quod mollificatur manus, et non potest stringere aliquid: tunc scias, quod nerui sunt abscissi, aut attriti.	For if it does not tolerate it, nor can you accomplish its reduction after days have passed, nevertheless the joint remains in its twisted state: and it does not harm the patient anything except that the hand softens and cannot grasp anything; then know that the nerves are severed or bruised.
Non est ergo ingenium in ea, nisi ut stringatur cum cauterio prope casum eius.	Therefore, there is no remedy for it, except that it be cauterized near the affected area.
Et fortasse non confert illud aliquid.	And perhaps it does not help at all.
Cum ergo non redit Almahassem, tunc pone super ipsum emplastrum, quod narrauimus.	When therefore Almahassem does not return, then apply the plaster, which we have described, to it.
Deinde stringatur, et dimittatur quinque diebus: postea soluatur et dimittatur, et exercitetur manus.	Then it should be bound and left for five days; afterwards it should be released and left, and the hand should be exercised.
Si autem priuatur motus eius, et accidat in ea aliquid grauitatis: tunc leni eam cum aqua calefacta, et fricatione aliquotiens, donec leniatur.	If, however, its movement is impaired, and something serious happens to it, then gently treat it with warm water, and friction several times, until it is relieved.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Digitorum.	Concerning the treatment of the dislocation of the fingers.
Caput XXX.	Chapter Thirty.
Quando dislocatur ex eis Digitus ad omnem partem, uel ex eis Digitus ad dorsum palmae, aut uentrem eius: tunc extende Digitum, et impelle dislocationem pollicibus tuis, donec redeat.	When a finger is dislocated in any direction, or a finger is dislocated towards the back of the palm, or the front of it, then extend the finger, and drive the dislocation with your thumbs until it returns.
Deinde sustenta caput Digiti, et suspende ipsum uersus partem ad quam dislocatur, et dimitte ipsum duobus diebus.	Then support the head of the finger, and suspend it towards the part to which it is dislocated, and let it be for two days.
Deinde suspende eum, et extende ipsum, donec aequetur rectus in illo die suo.	Then suspend it, and extend it, until it is made straight on that day of its own.
Cum ergo fuerit nox, liga ipsum secundum narrationem ipsam: et non cesses soluere ipsum in die: et exerce eum cum motu: et liga ipsum in nocte.	Therefore, when it is night, bind it according to the same account, and do not cease to loosen it by day, and exercise it with movement, and bind it at night.
Fac illud diebus aliquot, donec stringatur.	Do that for a few days, until it is strengthened.
Et similiter fac cum eo, si dislocatur ad uentrem manus: et liga eum ad partem ipsam, et fac cum eo operationem tuam primam, donec sanetur.	And similarly do with it if it is dislocated to the palm of the hand: and bind it to the part itself, and do your first operation with it until it is healed.
Et similiter fac cum eo quando dislocatur ad reliquas partes.	And similarly do with it when it is dislocated to the other parts.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Spondilium dorsi.	Concerning the treatment of the dislocation of the spinal column.
Caput XXXI.	Chapter XXXI.
Quando accidit alicui Spondilium dorsi, aut colli dislocatio completa, aut remouentur Spondiles multae a locis suis: tunc non est in ea curatio, quoniam mors properat infirmo.	When it happens to someone that the spinal column, or the neck is completely dislocated, or many vertebrae are removed from their places: then there is no treatment for it, because death quickly approaches the sick person.
Et signum illius est, quod egestio infirmi egreditur absque uoluntate, neque potest tenere eam: et multotiens mollificantur ex eo quaedam membra eius, aut duo crura eius, aut duo brachia ipsius, aut unum eorum: aut remouetur Spondilis una de loco suo.	And a sign of it is that the excretion of the sick person emerges without will, nor can he hold it; and frequently some of his limbs soften, or his two legs, or his two arms, or one of them; or a vertebra is removed from its place.
Multotiens enim remouetur, quod multotiens fit remotio earum ad quatuor partes.	For often it is removed, for often their removal occurs in four directions.
Illa ergo quae remouetur ad posteriora, nominatur Gibbositas.	Therefore, that which is removed towards the back is called Gibbosity.
Curatio uero eius est, ut consyderes tunc, si Gibbositas accidit a puericia: tunc non est in ea curatio, neque ex ea est sanatio omnino.	However, its treatment is that you should consider if gibbosity occurs from childhood: then there is no treatment for it, nor is there any healing from it at all.
In illa autem quae accidit a casu, aut percussione, aut similibus illis, iam dixerunt antiqui modos curationis sermone prolixo.	However, in that which occurs from a fall, or a blow, or similar things to those, the ancients have already described methods of treatment in lengthy speech.
Cuius plurimum non redit cum proficuo.	Of which very little returns with profit.
Ego uero iam abbreuiaui ex illo, cuius parum excusat a multo eius ex propinquitate mea ad intentionem: et expositione mea qua exposui illud, et formaui instrumentum eius diuerso modo ab eo quo ostenderunt illud, et exposuerunt ipsum.	However, I have already abbreviated it from that, which is little excused from its proximity to my intention: and by my exposition of it, and I have fashioned its instrument in a different way from that in which they showed it, and explained it.
Dico ergo, quod in gibbositate quae accidit ab anteriori parte, non est ingenium, neque sanatio ex ea.	Therefore, I say that in gibbosity which occurs on the anterior part, there is no remedy, nor healing from it.
Et similiter in illa quae fit ad duo latera etiam.	And similarly in that which occurs on both sides as well.
Et non curatur ex eis, nisi illa quae accidit in dorso proprie, cum eo quod ego narro: et est, ut extendatur infirmus super faciem suam super podium aequale prope parietem: et expandatur sub eo stramentum humidum, ut non laedatur pectus eius.	And it is not cured from them, unless that which occurs on the back properly, with what I relate: and it is that the sick person should be stretched out on their face on a level platform near a wall: and moist straw should be spread out beneath them, so that their chest is not injured.
Deinde ponatur lignum rectum fixum in fouea in terra, in extremitate podii, circiter caput eius: et lignum aliud circiter pedes eius in extremitate altera podii: et minister teneat lignum, et sit non firmatum in fouea.	Then let a straight piece of wood be fixed in a hole in the ground, at the end of the platform, about the height of his head; and another piece of wood about the height of his feet at the other end of the platform; and let an attendant hold the wood, and let it not be firmly fixed in the hole.
Et minister alter teneat alterum.	And another attendant hold the other.
Deinde inuolue super caput infirmi, et sub titillicis eius ligamentum lene, firmum: et extende extremitatem ligamenti ad lignum quod est apud caput eius: et liga ipsum in eo.	Then wrap a soft, firm bandage around the head of the sick person, and under his armpits; and extend the end of the bandage to the piece of wood at his head; and tie it to it.
Deinde stringe ligamentum aliud supra anchas eius, et supra genua ipsius, et apud cauillas eius.	Then tighten another bandage above his armpits, and above his knees, and at his heels.
Deinde aggrega ligamenta omnia, et liga ea in ligno altero quod est apud pedes eius.	Then gather all the bandages together, and tie them to the other piece of wood which is at his feet.
Deinde extendat omnis minister ad partem ligni ligamentum, et non remoueantur duo ligna ex locis suis in quibus sunt fixa: uerumtamen non sint firmata, sicut diximus.	Then let each attendant stretch the bandage towards the piece of wood, and let the two pieces of wood not be moved from their fixed positions; however, they should not be firmly secured, as we have said.
Et medicus ponat palmas suas super Spondilem cum fortitudine, donec redeat: aut ponat super eam tabulam.	And let the physician place his palms on the vertebra with strength, until it returns to its place; or let him place a board upon it.
Deinde annectat super tabulam pedes suos, donec redeat.	Then he attaches his feet to the board until it returns to its place.
Si autem non redit per hanc curationem, tunc accipe tabulam cuius longitudo sit circiter tria brachia.	If, however, it does not return through this treatment, then take a board whose length is approximately three arms.
Et caua in pariete de quo diximus quod est prope infirmum, locum in quem ingrediatur extremitas tabulae.	And make a hollow in the wall of which we said is near the sick person, a place for the end of the board to enter.
Deinde pone medium tabulae super Spondilem.	Then place the middle of the board on the vertebra.
Et ponat pedes suos medicus super extremitatem alteram.	And let the physician place his feet on the other end.
Et stringat bene, donec coartetur Spondilis, et redeat ad locum suum.	And let him pull tightly, until the vertebra is constricted, and returns to its place.
Deinde si uis, operare cum torno quod inuoluitur cum manu tua: et est, ut figas in terram apud caput infirmi in postremo podii duo ligna, quorum longitudo sit brachii unius: et apud caput eius in postremo podii duo ligna.	Then if you wish, operate with the turning tool held in your hand: and it is, that you shall fix two pieces of wood, each the length of one arm, in the ground at the head of the sick person on the back of the stool, and two pieces of wood at the head of it on the back of the stool.
Et sit longitudo quae est inter omne lignum palmus unus: et iam factum est in omni loco foramen, in quo currit tornum: et firmetur lignum omne in terra multum, ne moueatur omnino.	And let the distance between each piece of wood be one palm: and now let a hole be made in every place, through which the turning tool passes: and let each piece of wood be firmly fixed in the ground, so that it does not move at all.
Et intromittatur lignum rotundum: et est tornum in quo reuoluitur ligamentum in duobus foraminibus duorum lignorum.	And let a round piece of wood be inserted; and the turning tool is to be rotated in the two holes of the two pieces of wood.
Et in extremitate eius est foramen, in quo firmatur lignum, cuius longitudo est palmus cum eo quod reuoluitur: et in duobus lignis aliis est similiter illius.	And at its extremity is a hole, in which a piece of wood, the length of the one being turned, is fixed; and in the other two pieces of wood is similarly one.
Deinde stringe ligamenta quae strinxisti in pectore infirmi torno quod est apud caput eius: et ligamenta quae strinxisti in cruribus eius in torno quod est apud pedes eius.	Then tighten the bandages that you have tied around the chest of the sick person with the turning tool that is at his head, and the bandages that you have tied around his legs with the turning tool that is at his feet.
Deinde stet apud omne tornum minister, qui torqueat manum suam cum licinio, cum quo reuoluitur tornum: et medicus aequet Spondilem, secundum quod diximus.	Then let a servant stand by each turning tool, who will turn his hand with the cord with which the turning tool is turned: and let the physician adjust the Spondyle, as we have said.
Haec est forma torni, quae sequitur.	This is the form of the turning tool, which follows.
Deinde postquam redit Spondilis, et aequatur locus, tunc oportet, ut ponas emplastrum exiccatiuum cum albumine oui.	Then, after the Spondyle has returned and the place is adjusted, it is necessary to apply a drying plaster with egg white.
Deinde stuppam.	Then, lint.
Postea pone supra emplastrum astellam ex tabula, cuius latitudo sit trium digitorum, aut circiter eos.	Then place a sliver from a board, whose width is three fingers, or approximately that, over the plaster.
Et longitudo eius quantitas quae capiat locum Gibbositatis, et super partem Spondilis sanae.	And its length is the amount that covers the gibbosity, and the healthy portion of the Spondyle.
Deinde ligetur cum ligamento quod diximus.	Then it shall be bound with the ligature that we have described.
Et utatur infirmus nutrimento subtili, donec sanetur.	And let the sick person use delicate nourishment until they are healed.
Quod si remaneat quiddam eminentiae in loco in fine sanationis: tunc oportet, ut administrentur medicinae quae mollificant, et leniunt, cum administratione tabulae quam narrauimus tempore longo.	If something of prominence remains in the location at the end of the healing process, then it is necessary that medicines that soften and soothe be administered, together with the application of the board which we have described for a long time.
Et iam administratur in illo lamina plumbi.	And now a lead plate is administered there.
Et quandoque accidit eminentia in postremo Spondilium dorsi: et putatur per eam dislocatio, et est illud os quod iam eminet.	And sometimes a prominence occurs in the final part of the spinal column, and it is thought that a dislocation is through it, and that is the bone which now protrudes.
Quare non oportet, ut praesumptio fiat ei cum hac medicina: fortasse enim accidere faciet mortem.	Therefore, it is not appropriate to presume to use this medicine with him; for it might perhaps cause death.
¶ De curatione Anchae dislocatae.	Concerning the treatment of a dislocated Ancha.
Caput XXXII.	Chapter XXXII.
Scias, quod iuncturae Anchae, et iuncturae humeri, non accidit, nisi dislocatio tantum: neque accidit eis quod accidit reliquis iuncturis ex remotione parua, et concauitate.	Know that dislocations of the shoulder joint and the elbow joint only occur as a dislocation, and that they do not experience what happens to the other joints in terms of a small displacement and a concavity.
Et iunctura quidem Anchae dislocatur secundum quatuor partes.	And indeed, the elbow joint is dislocated according to four parts.
Quod est, quia dislocatur ad anteriora, et ad posteriora.	That is, because it is dislocated forward and backward.
Et plurimum quidem dislocatur ad interiora: et parum dislocatur ad anteriora, et ad posteriora.	And it is most often dislocated inward; and it is little dislocated forward and backward.
Et curatio dislocationis eius ad interiora, est: quia quando tu coniungis crus infirmi sanum cum infirmo, est longius: et est genu eius eminens plus quam sani, et non potest infirmus duplicare pedem suum apud inguen: et est locus qui sequitur inguen apostematus apostemate calido, propterea, quod caput coxae iam peruenit illic.	And the treatment for its dislocation inward is this: because when you join the leg of the healthy one with the injured one, it is longer; and the injured one's knee is more prominent than the healthy one's, and the injured one cannot bend their foot at the groin; and there is a place following the groin that is suppurated with a hot abscess, because the head of the thigh has arrived there.
Et signum eius cui accidit dislocatio ad exteriora est, quod sunt accidentia eius contraria istis accidentibus.	And the sign of him who has suffered dislocation outward is that its occurrences are contrary to these occurrences.
Et signum eius cui accidit dislocatio ad anteriora, est, quia expandit crus sanum secundum complementum: uerumtamen non duplicat ipsum absque dolore qui est in genu: et si conatur ad ambulandum, non potest super illud ad anteriora: et retinetur urina eius, et apostematur inguen eius, et apud ambulationem est calcatio eius super calcaneum.	And the sign of him who has suffered dislocation forward is that he extends the healthy leg to its full extent; however, he does not bend it without pain in the knee; and if he attempts to walk, he cannot move it forward; and his urine is retained, and his groin is suppurated, and in walking, his heel is striking the ground.
Et signum eius cui accidit dislocatio ad posteriora est, ut non expandat genu, neque possit duplicare ipsum antequam duplicet inguen: et est crus eius etiam breuius altero: et inguen est mollificatum, et est caput coxae apud locum ilii.	And the sign of him who has suffered dislocation backward is that he does not extend his knee, nor can he bend it before bending the groin; and his leg is also shorter than the other; and the groin is softened, and the head of the thigh is at the place of the ilium.
Reductio uero huius dislocationis specierum est, ut consyderes tunc, si dislocatio est uetusta, quae iam antiquatur cum habente ipsam.	The reduction, however, of this kind of dislocation is, that you must consider then, if the dislocation is old, which has become established in the person with it.
Deinde si tu administres reductionem eius, et remanet secundum dispositionem suam: tunc non est in ea curatio omnino.	Then if you administer its reduction, and it remains according to its position: then there is no cure in it at all.
Non ergo oportet, ut praesumptio fiat ei penitus.	Therefore, it is not appropriate that a presumption be made about it entirely.
In illo autem cuius dislocatio est recens, et est ex una specierum quatuor dislocationis: tunc propera ad hoc, ut uoluas iuncturam, et extendas ipsam ad interiora et ad exteriora, et moueas eam dextra et sinistra: fortasse enim redit, et non indiget alia cura.	However, in the one whose dislocation is recent, and is of one of the four kinds of dislocation: then hasten to this, that you wish to join the joint, and extend it inward and outward, and move it right and left: for perhaps it returns, and does not need any other treatment.
Si autem non redit hoc modo, tunc oportet, ut praepares ministrum fortem, et extendat crus eius ab inferiori parte: aut cum manibus suis, aut cum ligamento, quod ligetur super crus eius supra genu: et minister alius extendat manum eius desuper, ita ut intromittat manus suas sub titillicis eius.	If however it does not return in this way, then it is necessary that you prepare a strong assistant, and he extend his leg from the lower part: either with his hands, or with a bandage, that is tied above his leg above the knee: and another assistant extend his hand from above, so that he interposes his hands under his kneecaps.
Deinde stringat cum ligamento leni super radicem coxae, et teneat extremitatem ligamenti alterius.	Then he should tie it with a gentle bandage above the root of the thigh, and hold the other end of the bandage.
Et sit extensio eius aut ab anteriori parte inguinis ad partem furculae, aut a posteriori ad partem dorsi.	And its extension should be either from the anterior part of the groin to the part of the crotch, or from the posterior to the part of the back.
Et sit extensio eorum omnium uice una, donec eleuetur infirmus cum corpore suo a terra, et remaneat pendens.	And let the extension of all of them be simultaneous, until the infirm person is raised from the ground with his body, and remains suspended.
Et haec enim species extensionis est species communis specierum quatuor.	And this species of extension is a common species of the four species.
Si ergo redit dislocatio cum eo quod diximus, est bonum: et si non, tunc necesse est omni speciei illud quod dicam de curatione propria.	If therefore the dislocation returns with what we have said, it is good; and if not, then it is necessary for every species the cure proper to it.
In reductione quidem eius propria quando dislocatio est ad interiora, oportet, ut resupinetur infirmus super latus suum sanum.	In the reduction indeed of it proper when the dislocation is to the interior, it is necessary that the infirm person be laid on his healthy side.
Deinde ponat ligamentum super radicem coxae, in eo quod est inter caput coxae, et locum qui est sub inguine.	Then he shall place a bandage upon the root of the thigh, in that which is between the head of the thigh and the place that is below the groin.
Deinde extende ligamentum ad sursum a parte inguinis ad altiorem partem corporis, ad partem furculae.	Then extend the bandage upward from the groin to the higher part of the body, to the part of the crotch.
Deinde accipiat minister alius fortis brachia eius, et minuat locum grossum coxae infirmae, et extendat ad exteriora extensione uehementi.	Then let another strong servant take his arms, and diminish the large place of the sick person's thigh, and extend it outward with a forceful extension.
Iam enim redit ad locum suum.	For now it returns to its place.
Et haec species est facilioris reliquis speciebus curationis, qua reducitur hoc membrum.	And this method is easier than the other methods of treating this limb.
Si autem excusatur super te, et non obedit tibi ad introitum cum hac specie curationis omnino: tunc oportet, ut ligentur duo pedes infirmi simul cum ligamento forti, leni, super duos calcaneos, et super duo genua: et sit longitudo cuiusque a compare suo quantitatis quatuor digitorum: et sit crus infirmum extensum plus altero quantitate duorum digitorum.	However, if the limb is resisting and does not obey your treatment method: then it is necessary to bind the two feet of the sick person together with a strong, soft bandage, over the two heels and over the two knees; and the length of each should be the same as its counterpart in quantity, four fingers; and the sick leg should be extended by two fingers more than the other.
Deinde suspendatur infirmus super caput ligni, quod sit in domo: et sit longitudo eius a terra quantitas duorum brachiorum.	Then let the sick person be suspended from a beam in the house, and its length from the ground should be the equivalent of two arms.
Deinde praecipe iuueni forti, ut muniat caput coxae: et suspendatur cum infirmo inuenis alius: et impellat iuuenis alius, muniens coxam cum fortitudine, nam iunctura redit ad locum suum cum uelocitate.	Then command a strong young man to secure the hip; and let another young man be suspended with the sick person; and let another young man, securing the hip with strength, apply force, for the joint will return to its place swiftly.
In reditione autem eius propria, quando est dislocatio ad exteriora, oportet, ut iaceat infirmus super podium, secundum quod narrauimus in habente gibbositatem.	However, in the case of an outward dislocation, the patient should lie on a raised surface, as we described in the treatment for curvature of the spine.
Et stringatur ligamentum super crus eius, infirmum proprie, et super pectus eius.	And a bandage should be tied around his affected leg and over his chest.
Deinde ponantur duo ligna, unum apud pedes eius, et alterum apud caput ipsius.	Then let two pieces of wood be placed, one at his feet and the other at his head.
Deinde ponatur lignum additum in medio podii, fixum bene: super quod inuoluti sint panni humidi, ut non laedat infirmum: et sit lignum inter coxas eius, ut non attrahatur ad inferiora apud extensionem.	Then a further piece of wood should be placed in the middle of the raised surface, securely fixed, upon which damp cloths should be wrapped, so that the patient is not harmed; and let the wood be between his hips, so that he is not pulled downwards during extension.
Deinde extendat omnis minister ad partem suam, et medicus aequet reductionem manu sua.	Then each attendant should pull in his direction, and the physician should adjust the reduction with his hand.
Si ergo obedit ad reuersionem, erit bonum.	If therefore it yields to repositioning, it will be good.
Et si non, pone super ipsam tabulam, et preme ipsam, sicut diximus in gibbositate, aequaliter.	And if not, place it upon the board itself, and press it, as we have said in the case of a hump, evenly.
Verumtamen oportet, ut iaceat infirmus super latus suum sanum.	However, it is necessary that the patient lie on his healthy side.
Et quando dislocatio est ad anteriora, tunc oportet, ut extendatur crus infirmi uelociter: et est secundum hanc eandem narrationem super podium: et ponat medicus palmam manus suae dextrae super inguen infirmum.	And when the dislocation is to the front, then it is necessary that the patient's leg be pulled quickly: and it is according to this same description upon a raised platform: and the physician shall place the palm of his right hand upon the patient's groin.
Deinde coartet ipsum cum manu altera, et cum illa coartatione pone ipsum extensum ad inferiora ad partem genu.	Then he shall constrict it with the other hand, and with that constriction put it extended downward towards the knee.
Et si dislocatio est ad posteriora: tunc non oportet, ut extendatur infirmus ad inferiora, et sit eleuatus super terram: imo oportet, ut sit positus super rem duram, sicut oportet, ut fit etiam si dislocatur ancha eius ad exteriora, secundum illud quod diximus de accubitu eius super duas anchas: et est super faciem eius, et ligamenta extensa: secundum quod diximus nuper.	And if the dislocation is to the rear, then it is not necessary that the patient be stretched downwards, and be raised from the ground: rather, it is necessary that he be placed upon a hard surface, as is fitting, just as it is done even if his hip is dislocated outwards, according to what we said concerning his lying on his two hips: and it is on his face, and the ligaments stretched out, according to what we recently said.
Et oportet, ut administretur compressio cum tabula etiam super locum ad quem egreditur iunctura, cum completur reductio secundum quod oportet.	And it is necessary that compression be administered with a board also upon the place to which the joint emerges, when the reduction is completed as is fitting.
Et signum reditionis eius non occultatur tibi: et est, ut extendas duo crura infirmi: et quando uides ea aequalia, et infirmus stringit crus suum, et expandit ipsum absque excusatione: tunc scias, quia iam redit membrum, secundum quod oportet: tunc coniunge duas coxas, et pone emplastrum, et stringe cum imemati, id est, rota: ita, ut non moueatur ancha ad aliquam partium: et adhaereat infirmus quieti tribus diebus, aut quatuor.	And the sign of its return is not hidden from you: and it is, that you extend the two legs of the patient: and when you see them equal, and the patient straightens his leg, and stretches it out without excuse: then know that the limb has now returned as it should: then join the two hips, and place a plaster, and bind with a bandage, that is, a roller: so that the hip does not move to any part: and let the patient adhere to rest for three or four days.
Deinde solue ligamentum, et emplastrum, et compara crus cum altero: tunc si uides ea aequalia in statu, tunc scias, quod dislocatio iam firmata est: absolue ergo infirmum ad ambulandum.	Then loosen the bandage and plaster, and compare the leg with the other: then if you see them equal in condition, then know that the dislocation is now firm: therefore dismiss the patient to walk.
Et si uides aliquid mollificationis: tunc redi, et emplastra illud, et stringe illud secundum stricturam tuam primam: et dimitte illud etiam tribus diebus.	And if you see any softening, then return and plaster it, and bind it according to your first binding: and let it also be left for three days.
Deinde solue illud et fac ipsum tardare in ambulatione super utrumque aliquot diebus, donec confortetur bene.	Then loosen it and make him slow in walking on both legs for several days, until it strengthens well.
¶ De dislocationis Genu.	Concerning the dislocation of the knee.
Caput XXXIII.	Chapter XXXIII.
Genu dislocatur secundum tres modos.	The knee is dislocated in three ways.
Dislocatur ad exteriora, ad interiora, et ad inferiora, scilicet ad posteriora.	It is dislocated outwards, inwards, and downwards, that is to say, backwards.
Et non dislocatur ad anteriora.	And it is not dislocated forwards.
Et signum dislocationis eius, est, ut praecipias infirmo, ut applicet crus suum ad coxam suam.	And the sign of its dislocation is that you should instruct the sick person to apply his leg to his hip.
Si autem non adhaeret cum coxa: tunc scias, quod Genu est dislocatum.	If however it does not adhere to the hip: then know that the knee is dislocated.
Et restauratio omnium modorum dislocationis eius est, ut facias sedere infirmum rectum, ita ut iam extendat crus suum si potest super illud, et adhaeret dorsum tuum ad faciem eius: et pone pedem eius inter pedes tuos.	And the restoration of all the ways of its dislocation is that you make the sick person sit upright, so that he may extend his leg if he can upon it, and adhere your back to his face: and place his foot between your feet.
Deinde adhaerere fac Genu eius cum palmis tuis, et recta eas inter digitos tuos super Genu eius.	Then cause his knee to adhere with your palms, and straighten them between your fingers above his knee.
Deinde applica cum palma tua duo latera Genu eius cum fortitudine.	Then apply with your palm the two sides of his knee with strength.
Et minister alius extendat pedem eius, donec redeat Genu ad locum suum.	And another attendant extend his foot, until the knee returns to its place.
Et signum reditionis est, ut adhaereat crus cum coxa in lenitate, non laboriose.	And a sign of its return is that the leg will adhere to the thigh with ease, not with effort.
Deinde emplastra ipsum, et adhaerere fac crus cum coxa.	Then apply plasters to it, and cause the leg to adhere to the thigh.
Deinde liga ea simul cum uitta tribus diebus, aut quatuor.	Then bind them together with a bandage for three or four days.
Deinde solue ea.	Then unbind them.
Et non utatur infirmus ambulatione aliquot diebus, donec sanetur.	And let the invalid not use walking for several days, until he is healed.
Si autem recusatur tibi reductio eius, tunc administra extensionem fortem cum ligamentis, quorum praecessit narratio in curatione anchae, donec redeat.	If, however, its reduction is refused to you, then administer a strong extension with bandages, whose description preceded in the treatment of the hip, until it returns.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Calcanei.	Concerning the treatment of a dislocated heel.
Caput XXXIIII.	Chapter Thirty-Four.
Calcaneus quandoque remouetur remotione parua, et quandoque dislocatur secundum complementum.	The heel sometimes is removed by a slight displacement, and sometimes is dislocated completely.
Et dislocatio eius fit, aut ad interiora, aut ad exteriora.	And its dislocation occurs either inward or outward.
Et signum dislocationis eius est, quod uides Calcaneum inflatum, procedentem ad partem ad quam dislocatur.	And the sign of its dislocation is that you see the heel swollen, protruding towards the side to which it is dislocated.
Curatio autem remotionis eius, est facilis reditionis: et est, ut extendatur cum facilitate cum manibus, et aequetur, donec redeat.	The treatment for its removal is easy repositioning: it is to be gently extended with the hands, and straightened, until it returns.
In curatione autem eius quando dislocatur secundum complementum, oportet, ut facias sedere infirmum rectum: et teneat ipsum minister fortis ualde a posteriori parte dorsi eius, in medio ipsius.	However, in treating it when it is completely dislocated, it is necessary to have the sick person sit upright, and a strong assistant hold him firmly at the middle of his back, from behind.
Deinde tene tu cum manu tua dextra pedem eius a superiori parte eius, et cum manu tua sinistra ab inferiori parte pedis eius loco cauillae.	Then grasp his foot with your right hand from above it, and with your left hand from below his foot, at the ankle joint.
Deinde trahe pedem ad tecum manu tua dextra.	Then pull the foot towards you with your right hand.
Deinde cum sinistra duabus uicibus.	Then with the left hand, twice.
Deinde extende cum sinistra, et impelle pectus pedis cum dextra uersus crus absque labore.	Then extend with the left, and push the foot's front with the right towards the leg without effort.
Fac illud bis, sicut narrauimus.	Do that twice, as we have described.
Deinde impelle pectus pedis ad crus in uice tertia, et tu trahis cauillam.	Then push the foot's front to the leg a third time, and you pull the heel.
Si ergo redit in uice una, aut in duabus secundum hunc modum, et uides pedem aequatum, est bonum: et si non, tunc itera operationem super ipsum: quoniam ipse redit.	If therefore it returns in one or two times according to this method, and you see the foot aligned, it is good; and if not, then repeat the operation on it, because it returns.
Si autem prohibetur tibi reductio eius cum eo quod narrauimus: tunc fac iacere infirmum super dorsum suum super terram, et fige paxillum in terra firmatum ualde, ut cadat inter coxas eius: et tu iam inuoluisti super ipsum pannum, ut non laedat infirmum.	If however its reduction is forbidden to you with what we have described, then make the sick person lie on their back on the ground, and fix a firmly planted peg in the earth, so that it falls between his thighs; and you have now wrapped a cloth around him, so that it does not harm the sick person.
Deinde accipiat minister coxam eius: postea extendat minister alter pedem, aut cum manibus suis, aut cum ligamento quod liget super collum pedis.	Then let the attendant take his thigh; afterwards let another attendant extend the foot, either with their hands or with a bandage that ties around the ankle.
Deinde extendat omnis minister contra extensionem comparis sui: et paxillus sit stans inter duas coxas infirmi retinens eum, ut non attrahatur corpus eius ad inferiora apud extensionem.	Then let all the attendants pull against each other's pull; and let the peg stand between the sick person's two thighs, holding him, so that his body is not pulled downwards during the extension.
Deinde aequet medicus dislocationem manibus suis, et minister alter teneat crus sanum ad inferiora.	Then the physician should align the dislocation with his hands, and another attendant should hold the healthy leg downwards.
Nam dislocatio redit cum uelocitate.	For the dislocation returns with speed.
Quando ergo redit dislocatio, et declaratur tibi sanitas reditionis eius: tunc pone emplastrum et stuppam, et stringe ipsam cum ligamentis firmiter, et liga pedem cum ligamento ad crus.	Therefore, when the dislocation returns, and its return is declared to you as health, then apply a plaster and lint, and bind it tightly with bandages, and bind the foot to the leg with a bandage.
Et oportet, ut caueas uel timeas de neruis, qui sunt supra calcaneum posterius, ut non sit ligamentum super eos uehemens, et laedat eos.	And it is necessary that you beware or fear the nerves that are above the posterior calcaneum, so that the bandage is not forceful upon them and harms them.
Deinde dimitte ipsum duobus diebus, aut tribus.	Then leave it for two or three days.
Quod si mollificatur ligamentum, stringe ipsum: deinde solue ipsum in die tertio, aut quarto: et prohibe infirmum ab ambulatione quadraginta diebus.	If the bandage softens, tighten it; then loosen it on the third or fourth day; and prohibit the infirm person from walking for forty days.
Si uero conatur ambulare ante illud spacium, non fit securitas quin dissoluatur super ipsum dislocatio, et corrumpatur, et non recipiat post illud curationem.	If however, he attempts to walk before that space of time, there is no security that the dislocation will not dissolve upon him and be corrupted, and that it will not receive cure after that.
Quod si accidat ei apostema calidum: tunc oportet, ut administres in sedatione eius illud, in quo praecessit narratio nostra in alio loco ex curatione, et embrocationem, donec remoueatur.	If a hot abscess occurs to him, then it is necessary that you administer to its sedation that which our previous narration has mentioned in another place concerning treatment, and an embrocation, until it is removed.
¶ De dislocatione Digitorum pedis, et cura.	Concerning the dislocation of the toes of the foot, and its cure.
Caput XXXV.	Chapter XXXV.
Oportet, ut aequetur quod dislocatur ex eis cum extensione pauca absque labore: et illud quidem non est difficile, imo est facile.	It is necessary that that which is dislocated from them be equalized with a little extension without labor; and indeed that is not difficult, but rather easy.
Si autem dislocatio est in quibusdam nodis dorsi pedis: tunc oportet, ut faciat sedere infirmus pedem suum super locum aequalem terrae, aut super tabulam: et est stans sicut ambulans.	If however the dislocation is in some nodes of the back of the foot, then it is necessary that the infirm person sit his foot on a level place of earth, or on a board; and it is standing as if walking.
Deinde tu sta, et pone pedem tuum super illud quod eminet ex illis iuncturis.	Then you stand, and place your foot upon that which protrudes from those joints.
Deinde calca illud cum pede tuo cum uirtute, donec redeat, et uideas ipsum iam aequatum, et non appareat in loco eminentia.	Then press it with your foot with force, until it returns and you see it already equalized, and no protrusion appears in the place.
Deinde pone sub uentre pedis eius tabulam quae capiat pedem totum, cui sint duo capita.	Then place under the sole of his foot a board that encompasses the whole foot, having two ends.
Deinde stringe ipsum strictura decenti tribus diebus.	Then bind it with a proper bandage for three days.
Deinde solue ipsum, et fac quiescere eum ab ambulatione diebus multis, donec stringatur et securetur a reductione.	Then loosen it, and make him rest from walking for many days, until it is tightened and secure from reduction.
¶ De speciebus dislocationis cum uulnere uel fractura.	Concerning the types of dislocations with wound or fracture.
Caput XXXVI.	Chapter XXXVI.
Quando accidit aliquid ex illo, et conaris curationem eius, et ipsius restaurationem, multotiens succedit mors: et propter illud non oportet, ut praesumat super curationem eius, quod est huiusmodi, nisi qui est prudens in arte longi usus, misericors, pius, tardus, non audax, neque praesumptuosus: et ut utatur in incaeptionce medicinis quae sedant apostemata calida tantum: et dimittat infirmum diuino iudicio.	When something of this kind happens, and you attempt its cure and restoration, often death ensues.  Therefore, one should not presume to undertake such a cure unless one is wise in the long practice of the art, merciful, pious, slow, not bold, nor presumptuous; and one should use in the beginning only medicines that calm the hot inflammations, and leave the sick to divine judgment.
Nisi uideas, aut speras salutem a perditione cum lenitate aegritudinis, et in quo apparet quiddam spei.	Unless you see, or hope for, salvation from destruction with the gentleness of the illness, and in which something of hope appears.
Conare ergo reductionem eius statim in principio rei, antequam accidat apostema calidum.	Therefore, attempt its reduction immediately at the beginning of the matter, before a hot inflammation occurs.
Si ergo redit membrum, secundum quod uolumus, tunc administra regimen quod sedat apostema: et cura uulnus cum eo quod conuenit ei ex unguentis desiccatiuis.	If, therefore, the limb returns as we desire, then administer a regimen that calms the inflammation and treat the wound with whatever desiccant ointments are appropriate.
Quod si dislocatio est cum fractura, et accidunt in osse satagiae separatae, tunc conare ablationem earum, et fac in illo quod diximus in aegritudinibus simplicibus ex eo quod praecessit in locis earum.	If the dislocation is with a fracture, and separate protrusions occur in the bone, then attempt their removal, and do in this what we said about simple illnesses, from what preceded concerning their locations.
Et caue secundum tuam uirtutem, et custodi teipsum ab introitu in uiam timoris: secundum quod praecessit praedicatio mea tibi.	And beware according to your ability, and guard yourself from entering the path of fear, according to what my instruction has preceded for you.
Nam illud est melius tibi apud Creatorem tuum, et magis permanens ad gloriam tuam, et magis saluum tuo corpori apud illos in tuo tempore.	For that is better for you before your Creator, and more enduring for your glory, and more healthful for your body among those in your time.
