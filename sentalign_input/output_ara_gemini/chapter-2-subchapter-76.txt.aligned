If you have treated the dead fetus with the treatment I mentioned in the division, and it did not come out, and you are forced to work by hand, then you should look. If the woman is of sound strength and has none of the symptoms that are feared to cause her harm, then the woman should lie down on a bed on her back, with her head tilted downwards and her legs raised, and a servant should hold her from both sides, or she should be tied to the bed so that her body is not pulled when the fetus is extended.	When you have dealt with a dead foetus by those methods mentioned in their chapter, and it does not come out, and you are compelled to operate, you should examine to see if the woman be in a healthy state and not having any disease on account of which you might entertain a fear for her life. The woman should lie on her back on a couch, her head tilted back and her legs raised. An assistant on either side should hold her down firmly or she should be bound down to the couch, lest the body be drawn out of position in extracting the foetus.	0.87297285
Then moisten the opening of her womb with moist oils, along with the saliva of marshmallow, fenugreek, and flaxseed. Then the midwife should anoint her hand with these oils and salivas, then insert it gently into the womb, then search for a place to insert the hooks into the fetus.	Then the opening should be anointed with moistening oils and with mucilage of marsh mallow and fenugreek and with linseed. Then the midwife should anoint her hand with these oils and mucilages and gently introduce it into the vagina and with it locate a place in the foetus to fix hooks in.	0.8893129
And the appropriate places for that, look, if the fetus is coming down head first, then insert the hooks into its eyes, or in the back of its head, or in its mouth, or in its jaw, or under its chin, or its collarbone, or in the places near the ribs, or under the cartilage.	The suitable places for that: consider, and if the foetus present the vertex then she should fix the hooks in its eyes or in the neck or in the mouth or palate or beneath the chin, or the collarbone, or about the ribs, or beneath the false ribs.	0.85075974
But if it is coming down feet first, then in the pubis and middle ribs.	But if it present the feet let the hooks be fixed in the pubic region or middle ribs.	0.7177307
If a hand comes out before anything else and cannot be pushed back because of its compression, then you should wrap a cloth around it and then pull it until, when it all comes out, you cut it either at the wrist joint or at the elbow, and so you should do with the other hand and with the legs.	If the hand should come out before any other part and it is impossible to reduce it on account of the pressure, then a tape should be wound round it and she should pull on it until it is all out; then it should be cut off at either the carpal or the elbow joint. In the same manner should the other hand be dealt with, and the feet.	0.8918502
If the head of the fetus is large and there is pressure on it during exit, or if there is fluid accumulated in its head, then you should insert a pointed scalpel between your fingers and incise the head so that the fluid comes out, or perforate it with the instrument called the perforator, whose image comes with the images of all the instruments in the chapter after this. And so you do if the fetus is naturally large-headed, then you should incise the skull or crush it with the perforator as we said, then remove the bones with forceps.	If the foetal head be large and it is tightly squeezed in exit, or if there be a collection of fluid in the head, you should introduce between your fingers a spike-shaped scalpel and split the head to let the water out; or you should smash it with the instrument called cephalotribe which will be illustrated, together with figures of the other instruments, in the chapter following. In the same manner you act if the foetus have a naturally large head: either you should cut the skull open or smash it with the cephalotribe as we said; then you should draw out the bones with forceps.	0.8786489
If the head comes out and is compressed at the collarbone, then incise it until the moisture in the chest pours out, for then the chest will contract. If the chest does not contract and it is not possible to exit, then cut it in pieces as much as you can.	If the head comes out and the foetus is held up at the collar bones, an incision should be made to let out the humidity in the thorax, for the thorax will then shrink. But if the thorax does not shrink and is not disposed to emerge then you should cut off pieces in any manner possible.	0.8376535
If the lower abdomen is swollen or has a swelling, then you should puncture it so that the moisture drains from it.	If the lower belly be swollen or dropsical then you should make an opening to draw out all the fluid.	0.82147855
If the fetus is on its feet, then pulling it is easy and aligning it to the opening of the womb is simple.	If the foetus present the feet then the extraction will be easy and it will be a simple matter to guide it to the maternal opening.	0.804785
If it is compressed at the abdomen or chest, then you should pull it with a cloth that you have wrapped around your hand and incise the abdomen or chest until what is in them drains.	If it be stuck about the abdomen or thorax then pull on it with a cloth wound around your hand and cut an opening in the abdomen or thorax to allow the contents to flow out.	0.83251405
If all the other limbs have been extracted and the head has receded and is stuck, then the midwife should insert her left hand. If the opening of the womb is open, then she should insert her hand into the cervix and search for the head and pull it with her fingers to the opening of the womb, then insert a hook or two hooks into it and pull it with them.	If all the limbs are removed but the head is turned backwards and is jammed, the midwife should introduce her left hand and, if the mouth of the womb is open, should put the hand into the cervix of the womb and investigate the head and, with her fingers, draw it down toward the opening and fix a hook or two in it, and extract it with these.	0.8983419
If the opening of the womb has closed due to a hot swelling that has occurred, then it should not be forced, but rather the pouring of moist, fatty things should be used, and bandages should be applied, and she should sit in water that softens and moistens.	If it should be that the mouth of the womb is closed on account of an abscess, then one must not be rough with it but should use in this case instillations of moistening greasy substances; plasters also should be applied; and the woman should sit in a bath of softening and moistening waters.	0.7668487
But if the fetus is on its side, then if it can be aligned, use what we mentioned for the live fetus. If this is not possible, then cut it into pieces and remove it.	If the foetus present laterally and it is possible to reposition it, there should be applied the things mentioned for a living child. But if this be not possible then it should be cut away piecemeal and extracted.	0.8193174
And you should not leave any of the placenta inside at all.	It is necessary that not a scrap of the afterbirth be left behind in the womb.	0.616472
When you have finished your treatment, use the treatment we mentioned for hot swellings that occur in the wombs.	When you have completed your treatment then also apply those treatments we have mentioned for abscesses occurring in the uterus.	0.84365255
If bleeding occurs, then she should descend into astringent water and use the rest of the treatment.	If haemorrhage occurs, the woman should be put into styptic fluids and the usual treatment applied.	0.6900527
