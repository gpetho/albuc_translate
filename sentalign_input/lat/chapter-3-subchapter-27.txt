On the treatment of elbow dislocation.
Chapter 28.
Know that the elbow joint dislocates with difficulty and likewise returns with difficulty as well; and it indeed dislocates in all directions, especially to the front or to the back.
And its dislocation is not hidden from you, for it falls within sight and touch, however it may be dislocated.
And when you compare the dislocated elbow with the healthy one, it becomes clearly apparent to you.
For the joint is concave, and he cannot bend the arm or touch his shoulder with it.
And it is necessary to act quickly and reduce the dislocation immediately, before a hot swelling occurs.
For if a hot swelling occurs, its reduction becomes difficult, and perhaps it will not heal completely, especially when it is displaced backward.
For it is worse than all types of dislocation, and causes more severe pain; and often death follows it.
And its restoration, when it is among those that can be reduced, is done by extending his hand with both hands, with his arm stretched out, and the physician’s hands placed above and below the elbow, and he presses the joint with his thumbs together or with the base of his palm until it returns to its place.
Or if the dislocation is to the front, then it is reduced by bending the hand with his hand, until he strikes the dislocated elbow with the base of his palm.
But if the dislocation does not yield to the reduction, then apply strong, forceful traction; two assistants should extend the arm, while two others hold him in place so he does not move during the extension.
Then the arm is rotated in every direction, after a long folded cloth or wide bandage is wrapped over his hand.
And when the physician touches the joint with his hand, he should anoint it with oil, as this aids in the lubrication of the joint, making it easier.
Then he presses the joint with strong force until it returns.
And after its reduction, it is necessary to apply a plaster to it, containing astringency and drying agents with egg white, and bind it with an appropriate bandage.
And suspend the arm from the patient's neck, and leave it for several days.
Then loosen it.
If the joint is thus stabilized in its place, then release the bandage from it and leave it.
And if you see that the joint is not properly tightened, then repeat the plaster and bandage, and leave it for several days until it is secure.
Then release it.
But if heaviness occurs after the joint reduction and there is stiffness in movement, then apply moistening in the bath, gentle rubbing, and compression until it is softened, or place the fat of a ram’s buttock over the joint.
Then bind it and leave it on there for a day and a night.
Then remove it, and immerse him in the bath.
When he begins to sweat, then rub the joint with moderate friction.
Then apply the fat to it again, once, twice, and a third time with each bath entry until it is softened.
And if you wish, place fresh cow dung, heated with butter, over it and bind it.
Do this a few times.
For it will then be softened, and return to its natural state.
