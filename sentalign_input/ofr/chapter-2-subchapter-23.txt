of the waters of the eye
We have already discussed the characteristics of the waters in the division, and what is necessary for piercing; so proceed according to the method. 
You should have the patient sit between your hands, crossed, away from the sunlight, and tie up the healthy eye and squeeze it very tightly; then place the eyelid in your left hand if the eye is left, or in your right hand if the eye is right; then take in your right hand, if the eye is left, the instrument which is called "almagda", or in your left hand, if the eye is right; then place the point of the instrument next to the corona about the thickness of a hair in that white part of the eye at the part of the smaller tear duct, then push the instrument called "almagda" skillfully, and twist your hand until it pierces the white of the eye, and you feel the almagda reach the empty space; and it is necessary that the length of the almagda's path be at the depth of the measurement of the space which is from the pupil down to the end of the blackness; and that is the corona of the eye; you will see the bone in that eyelid because of the clarity of the cornea, and then place the instrument up to the place where the water is, then express it from one path after another.
If the water descends immediately, the patient sees in front of him and the instrument in his eye.
Afterwards rest a little, and if the water rises again the second time, place the cautery with the instrument, and when it is inserted and it does not rise, then withdraw the almagda gently by turning your hand little by little; and then put a little rock salt in water, and bathe the eye with it inside.
Then immediately place over the eye tow or wool soaked in rose oil and egg white, and tie it with the healthy eye.
We, and those who are of our time, apply ground cumin with egg white.
And if the almagda cannot enter the eye because of its hardness, for there are such men who have very hard eyes, you must take the instrument that is called "alberit", of which this is the form:
And then pierce the conjunctiva only, and do not go too deep, but make a subtle place, then put the almagda there, as we have said; and at the completion of the work, prepare for the patient a suitable sleeping place, where they may sleep on their back in a dark place; and let them be free from all movement, and take light food, and not move their head neither to the right nor to the left, and be bound according to their disposition until the third day; then unbind them in that same dark room, and test their sight, and make them see certain things, and then replace the bandage until the seventh day; and you must not do this at the time of the treatment or immediately after the incision, but you must delay this, because the fluid rises quickly.
If hot abscesses occur, unbind the eye before the seventh day, and treat it with that which soothes abscesses; and when it is soothed, uncover the sight and place a small pad on his face to cover it for some days, and let him remain in that dark room.
And then leave the room little by little, and return to his affairs; and know that no disciple should interfere in this case.
And one came to us who was from Iraq, who told us that in his country they made a pierced almagda, with which they sucked the fluid, but nevertheless I never saw any in our land, nor did I ever read it in the books of the ancients; and perhaps it is a new thing.
And these are the likenesses of the forms of almagda, so that those who do not know them may see them; and let them be properly made of brass:
And let their ends be of this same fineness, and the last with three sharp angles.
