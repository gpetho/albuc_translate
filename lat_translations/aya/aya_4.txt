Praefatio.	Preface.
Postquam compleui uobis o Filii, librum hunc, qui est postremus scientiae in medicina cum complemento ipsius, et consecutus sum finem in eo, ex expositionibus eius, et ipsius declarationibus, uisum est mihi, ut compleam ipsum uobis cum hoc Tractatu qui est pars operationis, id est, chirurgiae cum manu.	After I have completed to you, my son, this book, which is the last of the science of medicine with its supplement, and having finished in it from its explanations and declarations, it has seemed to me useful to complete it to you with this Treatise, which is a part of surgery, that is, of the art of operation with the hand.
Quoniam operatio cum manu prostrata est in regione nostra, et tempore nostro priuata omnino: donec fortasse periit scientia eius, et abscissum est uestigium eius: et non remanserunt ex ea, nisi descriptiones paruae in libris antiquorum, quas mutauerunt manus: et accidit eis error et haesitatio, donec clausae sunt intentiones eius, et elongata est uis ipsius: Visum est mihi, ut uiuificem eam cum ordinatione huius Tractatus in ea secundum uiam ex positionis, et declarationis, et abbreuiationis: et ut ueniam cum formis ferramentorum Cauterii, et reliquorum instrumentorum operis: cum fit ex declarationis additione, et ex properatione eius quod est necesse.	Since operation with the hand is laid down in our region, and in our time it is entirely private: until perhaps the science of it has perished, and its trail has been lost: and there remain of it only a few small descriptions in ancient books, which hands have altered: and it happened to them that error and confusion occurred, until their intentions were closed and its meaning was extended. It seemed to me useful to set forth it with the arrangement of this Treatise in accordance with its explanation and declaration, and its abbreviation: and I wanted to add it with forms of tools, Cauteriums, and the other instruments of operation: for it is necessary to include its addition, and its proper definition.
Caussa autem propter quam non inuenitur bonus artifex eius cum manu sua in hoc nostro tempore, est: quia ars medicinae est longa, et oportet auctorem eius exercitari ante illud in scientia anatomiae, quam narrauit Galenus, donec sciat iuuamenta membrorum, et ipsorum formas, et eorum coniunctionem, et separationem, et habeat cognitionem ossium, et neruorum, et lacertorum, et numerum ipsorum, et eorum egressionem, et uenarum pulsatilium, et quietarum, et locorum exitus earum.	Since there is no good craftsman of the hand in our time, it is: because the art of medicine is long, and its author must be exercised before it in the science of anatomy, which Galen related, until he knows the joints of the limbs, and their forms, and their connection, and separation, and has knowledge of bones, and nerves, and membranes, and their number, and their growth, and pulsations, and quiet, and places of their exit.
Et propter illud dixit Hippocrates, quod nomen cum nomine est multum, et cum opere est paucum, et praecipue in arte manus.	And for this reason Hippocrates said, The name that has a name is much, and the work that has a work is little, especially in the art of the hand.
Nos uero iam diximus de illo in introitu huius libri.	But we have already spoken about it at the beginning of this book.
Quoniam qui non est sciens, quod diximus de anatomia, non euacuatur, quin iam cadat in errorem, quo interficiuntur homines: sicut ego uidi multos ex illis, qui formantur de hac scientia, et iactant se de ea absque scientia, et sine experimento.	Since he who is not learning, that we have said about anatomy, does not clarify, but falls into error, by which men are formed, who form themselves from this science, and shout about it without knowledge, and without experiment.
Quod est, quia uidi medicum stolidum secuisse apostema scrophulosum in collo mulieris, et incidit quasdam arterias in collo: quare fluxit sanguis mulieris, donec cecidit mortua inter manus eius.	That is, because I saw a doctor chop off an aposteme scrofulous sore on the neck of a woman, and he cut some of the arteries in the neck: why did the blood flow from the woman until she died between her hands.
Et uidi medicum alium, qui praesumpsit ut extraheret lapidem uiro, qui processerat in aetate, et lapis erat magnus.	And I saw another doctor who dared to extract a stone from a man's bladder, which had been causing him pain for a long time, and the stone was big.
Peruenit ergo ad eum, et extraxit ipsum cum frusto uesicae.	So he approached him and extracted it with a twist of his hand.
Quare mortuus est uir in tertio die.	Why did the man die on the third day?
Et ego quidem iam uocatus fueram ad extrahendum ipsum: et uidi ex magnitudine lapidis, et dispositione infirmi, quod moriretur.	And I had already been called to extract it; and I saw from the size of the stone and the care of the nurse that he would die.
Et uidi medicum alium, qui accipiebat stipem apud quendam Ducum terrae nostrae propter medicinam: et accidit eunucho nigro, qui erat apud ipsum, fractura in crure eius prope calcaneum: et properauit medicus cum ignorantia sua, et strinxit fracturam super uulnus cum puluinaribus, et astellis strictura forti, et non dimisit uulneri expirationem.	And I saw another doctor who took a fee from our King for medicine: and there happened to be a black eunuch near him, who had broken his thigh bone near the heel; and the doctor continued in his ignorance and bound the fracture with thin splints and strong ligatures and did not stay with the wound's exudation.
Deinde absoluit eum secundum desyderia sua.	Then he released him according to his desires.
Postea dimisit eum diebus aliquot, et praecepit ei, ne solueret ligamentum: et stetit sic donec apostematum est crus eius, et ipsius pes, et peruenit ad perditionem.	Then he let him go after a few days and commanded that the ligatures not be loosened; but he stood thus until the sore in his leg and foot began to putrefy, and came to ruin.
Vocatus sum ergo ad eum: et properaui ad soluendum ligamentum: et consecuta est tranquillitas, et euasit a doloribus suis.	So I was called to him; and I made myself convenient to loosing the ligatures; and subsequently there was peace, and he was free from his pains.
Verumtamen corruptio iam confirmata erat in membro: et non potui refraenare ipsam.	However, the corruption had already taken hold in the member; and I could not restrain it.
Pon ergo cessauit corruptio perambulare in membro, donec periit.	So the corruption ceased to walk in the member until it died.
Et uidi medicum alium, qui perforauit apostema cancerosum: et ulceratum est post dies, donec magnificata est malicia eius cum domino ipsius.	And I saw another doctor who pierced an ulcerous cancer; and it putrefied after a few days until the evil of it spread with his lord.
Quod est, quia quando est cancer purus ex humore melancholico, tunc non oportet ut perueniatur ad eum cum ferro omnino, nisi sit in membro quod toleret, ut abscindatur totum eius.	That is, because when it is a pure cancer from the melancholy humor then it should not be cut out with an iron at all unless it is in a member that tolerates it so that it may be completely excised.
Et propter illud o Filii, necesse est uobis, ut sciatis, quod operatio cum manu diuiditur in duas diuisiones: scilicet, operationem cui associatur salus: et operationem, cum qua est periculum in pluribus dispositionibus.	And for this reason, my sons, you must know that surgery is divided into two sections: namely, the operations which are associated with health; and the operations, where there is danger in many dispositions.
Et ego iam excitaui in omni loco huius libri, in quo uenit operatio, in qua est terror et timor.	And I have already excited everywhere in this book, wherever surgery has come into being, where there is fear and alarm.
Quare necesse est uobis, ut caueatis illud, et dimitatis ipsum: ut non inueniant stolidi uiam ad loquendum, et dehonestandum.	Why is it necessary for you to be afraid of that, and to turn away from it? In order not to have dull wits to speak and to dishonor.
Accipite ergo mensuram cum sollicitudine et protectione, et infirmos uestros cum facilitate et firmitudine, et utimini uia meliore perducente gratia Dei ad salutem et successionem laudabilem: et dimittite aegritudines terribiles difficilis sanationis: et tollite animas uestras ab eo quod facit uos timere, ut ingrediatur super uos haesitatio in fide uestra et commodo uestro.	Therefore receive with solicitude and protection, and bring our sick to yourself with ease and strength, so that a better way, by the grace of God, may lead them to salvation and the glorious succession: and remove from them terrible ailments with difficult cure; and remove their souls from that which makes them fear, so that hesitation may come upon you in your faith and ease in your mind.
Est enim magis remanens ad gloriam uestram, et sublimius in mundo isto, et postremo ad quantitates uestras.	For it remains more to remain for our glory, and to be exalted in the world, and at last to the numbers of you.
Galenus enim iam dixit in quibusdam suis admonitionibus.	For Galenus has already said in some of his advice.
Non medicetis aegritudinem malam: ne nominemini medici mali.	Do not cure ill health, and do not call yourself a doctor of illness.
Iam autem diuisi hunc Tractatum secundum tria Capitula. ¶	I have already divided this treatise into three chapters.
Capitulum primum.	Chapter one: Of the nature of health.
De Cauterio cum igne, et Cauterio cum medicina acuta, capitulatum, et ordinatum a capite usque ad pedes, et formis instrumentorum, et ferramentis Cauterii: et omni quod necessarium est in operatione. ¶	Of the cautery with fire and cautery with acute medicine, a kaput, and ordered from the head to the feet, and of forms of instruments and tools, and of all that is necessary in the operation.
Capitulum secundum.	Chapter two: Of the forms of wounds, and of the ways they are made
De sectione et perforatione, phlebotomia et uentosis, et uulneribus: et extractione sagittarum, et similibus illius: et totum capitulatum, ordinatum formis instrumentorum. ¶	of cutting and piercing, phlebotomy and venesection, and of wounds: and extraction of arrows, and similar things: and all the kaput, ordered in forms of instruments.
Capitulum tertium.	Chapter three: Of the order of operations. 1   De ordine operationis
De restauratione, et dislocatione, et curatione torsionis, et similibus illius: capitulatum, ordinatum a capite usque ad pedes, et formis instrumentorum.	of restoration, and dislocation, and curing of twist, and similar things: kaput, ordered from the head to the feet, and forms of instruments.
Soli Deo Gloria.	Glory to God alone.
Liber Chirurgici Albucasis.	The Surgery Book of Al-Buqaatis.
Pars I.	[1] In the name of the Father,
¶ De Iuuamento, et Nocumento Cauterii: et quibus complexionibus conueniat, et quo tempore: et si cum ferro, uel auro.	[On The Position And Contusion Of Wounds, When To Operate And When Not To, And With What Instruments And At What Time: And If With Iron Or Gold.]
Caput I.	[1] In iujiuamentis et nocument
Sed Ante Quidem Quam rememorer operationis cum eo, oportet ut dicam qualitatem Iuuamentorum eius, et Nocumentorum ipsius: et in qua complexione exhibeatur.	[But Before I Speak Of The Quality Of Operation With Him, It Is Necessary To Speak Of The Quality Of His Wounds And Of The Complexion In Which They Are To Be Displayed.]
Dico ergo, quod sermo de qualitate iuuamenti Cauterii, et nocumenti eius, est sermo prolixus, et subtilis, scientia, et secretum occultum.	[I Will Then Speak Of The Quality Of Operation Of The Surgeon, And Of The Quality Of His Wounds, For This Speech Is Long, Subtle, Knowledgeable, And Secret.]
Etiam locuta fuit in eo multitudo sapientum, et dissenserunt in eo: et mihi quidem sufficit parum ex sermonibus eorum, timens prolongationem.	[A Great Number Of Wise Men Had Spoken On It, And They Had Disagreed With Each Other; But For Me A Little Of Their Speech Is Sufficient, I Fear Prolongation.]
Dico ergo, quod Cauterium confert uniuersaliter omni complexioni, quae est cum materia, et absque materia: excaeptis duabus complexionibus, quae sunt complexio calida absque materia, et complexio sicca absque materia.	[I Will Then Speak Of The Surgeon Who Is Suitable For All Kinds Of Complexions, Whether With Or Without Substance: Excepting Two Complexions, Which Are Hot And Dry Without Substance, And Dry Without Substance.]
In complexione autem calida et sicca cum materia dissenserunt.	[But In The Hot And Dry Complexion With Substance They Disagreed.]Dico ergo, quod in iujiuamentis eius sermo diversus est
Quidam enim dixerunt, quod Cauterium iuuatiuum est in ea.	[Some Said That The Surgeon Should BeOperated In It, For The Surgeon IsOperated.]Sed alii dicuerunt: Non sit operatio in eadem, sed in aliis complexionibus, quae sunt cum materia
Et dixerunt alii contrarium illius, scilicet quod Cauterium non est conueniens in aegritudine, quae est ex caliditate et siccitate: quoniam natura ignis est caliditas: et inconueniens est, ut sanetur ex agritudine calida et sicca, cum calido et sicco.	[But Others Said: 'Operation Should Not Be Done In It, But In Other Complexions That Are With Substance,' And They Said The Contrary To Him, Namely That The Surgeon Is Not Suitable In An Illness Of Heat And Dryness: For Fire's Nature Is Heat, And It Is Suitable, So As To Heal From An Illness Of Heat And Dryness, With Heat And Dryness.
Et dixit ille qui dicit contrarium illius: quod per Cauterium fit iuuamentum in omni aegritudine calida et sicca, quae accidit in corporibus hominum: quoniam quando tu comparas corpus hominis, et humiditates eius, ad complexionem ignis, inuenis corpus hominis frigidum.	[And He Who Said The Contrary To Him: 'By The Surgeon It Is Performed Surgery On Every Illness Of Heat And Dryness That Occurs In The Bodies Of Men: For When You Compare The Body Of A Man, And His Humidities, To The Complexion Of Fire, The Body Of A Man Becomes Cold.
Et ego quidem dico per sermonem eius: quia ex perimentum iam detexit mihi illud aliquotiens.	And I too say by experience: for this very reason, that experience has already shown me that.
Verumtamen non oportet, ut ueniat super illud, nisi qui iam probatus est, et exercitatus in capitulo Cauterii exercitio ultimo, et cognouit diuersitatem complexionum hominum, et dispositionem aegritudinum in se ipsis, et caussas earum, et accidentia ipsarum, et spacium temporis earum.	Truly, it is not necessary to add anything to this, except that one who has already tested and experienced, and exercised in the exercise of the latest chapter of cautery, and knows the diversity of complexions of men, and the disposition of sicknesses within themselves, and the causes thereof, and the accidents thereof, and the space of time of them.
Ex reliquis autem complexionibus non est super uos timor: et praecipue in aegritudinibus frigidis et humidis.	But from the other complexes there is no fear for you; above all, in the diseases of cold and moist.
Iam enim conuenerunt omnes medici super eas: et non dissenserunt in iuuamento cum Cauterio in eis.	For indeed all doctors have agreed about them; and they did not differ from cautery in regard to them.
Et scitote filii, quod ex secreto curationis per Cauterium cum igne, et bonitate eius super Cauterium cum medicina comburente est: quoniam ignis est simplex, cuius actio non peruenit, nisi ad membrum quod cauterisatur: et non nocet membro alio coniuncto cum eo, nisi nocumento paruo.	And know you sons, that the action of cure by cautery with fire, and its goodness on cauterium with medicine burning together is simple: because fire is simple, whose action does not reach unless to the member that is cauterized; and it does not hurt another member joined to it with a little injury.
Medicinae uero comburentis actio peruenit ad illud quod elongatur ex membris: et fortasse facit accidere in membro aegritudinem difficilis sanationis, et fortasse interficit.	But the action of medicine burning reaches to that which is prolonged from the members; and perhaps it makes difficult the cure of a disease in the member, and perhaps it kills it.
Ignis autem propter subtilitatem suam et bonitatem substantiae suae, non facit illud, nisi superfluat.	But fire because of its subtlety and goodness of its substance does not do this, unless it is in excess.
Iam uero innotuit nobis illud per experimentum, propter longitudinem seruitutis et studii cum arte, et stationem super ueritatem rerum: et propter illud excusor a longitudine sermonis.	For indeed this has already become known to us by experience, because of the length of practice and study with art, and the standing on the veracity of things; and for this reason I excuse the length of speech.
Et si non esset, quia non licet huic libro meo, afferrem uobis secretum occultum in igne, et qualitatem operationis eius in corporibus expulsionis suae, qua expellit aegritudines sermone philosophico demonstratiuo, qui acueretur a mentibus uestris.	And if it were not, because it is not right for this book of mine to bring you the secret and hidden thing in fire, and the quality of its operation in bodies by its expulsion, which expels diseases by a philosophical demonstration, which is acquired from the minds of your own, I would not.
Et scitote filii, quod ipsi dissentiunt in tempore, in quo conuenit fieri cauterium, et ponunt melius tempus ueris.	And know you sons, that they differ in the time when cauterization is to be done, and put a better time for the doctor.
Et ego dico, quod cauterium conuenit in omni tempore: propterea, quod nocumentum accidens propter tempus submergitur in iuuamento, quod attrahitur cum cauterio.	It is necessary that I say that the caustics are to be used at all times: for if the accident happens through time, it is hidden in the ligature, which is attracted with the caustic.
Et praecipue si cauterium est propter dolores ex doloribus necessariis, fortibus, festinis, qui non tolerant tarditatem: propterea quod timetur ex eis, quod accidat malicia quae est maior, quam paruum nocumentum intrans propter tempus.	And above all if the caustic is because of the pains from the necessary pains, strong, feasts, who do not tolerate tardiness: for they are afraid of them, that the evil which is greater than a slight injury will happen to them through time.
Et non cadat in mentibus uestris o filii illud, quod non extimant, nisi uulgus et stolidi medici, scilicet quod illi aegritudini quae sanatur per cauterium, non est reditio semper: et ponunt illud consequens, et res non est sicut putant: propterea quod cauterium non est, nisi loco medicinae, quae alterat complexionem, et exiccat humiditates quae sunt caussae, quare accidunt dolores.	And do not fall into the minds of the uneducated sons of that son, who do not understand, unless the common and dull doctors say: for him is not always a return to health from the illness by the caustic; they put it down as a consequence, and it is not like what they think: because the caustic is not, unless in place of medicine, which changes the complexion, and dries up the moistures that are the cause, so that the pains happen.
Verumtamen cauterium superfluit super medicinam per uelocitatem ualetudinis suae, et uirtutem suae operationis, et uehementiam dominii sui: et possibile est, ut redeat aegritudo hora aliqua temporis secundum complexionem infirmi, et locationem aegritudinis suae, et uirtutem eius: et quod praeparatur in corpore eius ex aggregatione superfluitatum in eo: et quod peruenit ad ipsum in acquisitione sua ex cibis, et similibus illis ex caussis, nisi fit aegritudo, in qua administratur cauterium.	But the caustic is excessive over medicine because of its power and the strength of its action and its quickness: and it is possible that it should return the illness at some time according to the complexion and place of the illness, and the power of it; and that it is prepared in his body from an excess of it therein: and that it comes to itself through this acquisition from food, and similar things from causes, unless there is illness, in which the caustic is administered.
Aegritudo subtilis in membro paucarum superfluitatum, et humiditatum, sicut cauterium dentis, propter dolorem, et similia illi, possibile est enim, ut non redeat in eo ille dolor.	Illus enim dolor, qui non potest ueni pro tempore, et non potest agere causticum, quare non potest ueni, sicut illius dolor: et hae superfluitati et humiditati, sicut causticum dentis, possunt ueni pro tempore: et si hoc accidat in uero, non est necessarium cauterium.
Sed illud fit in paucis.	But this pain, which cannot come because of time, and cannot act with the caustic, so
At uero sermo uulgi iterum, quod cauterium est postremum medicinae, est sermo rectus: non ad illud quod ipsi intendunt in illo: quoniam ipsi credunt, quod non est curatio quae conferat cum medicina, neque cum alio post occasum cauterii.	But the word of the common people, that the caustic is the last medicine, is a true word: it does not refer to what they intend in this; for they believe that there is no cure that gives with medicine, nor anything after the occasion of the caustic.
Res autem est econtrario illius, et intentio, quod cauterium est postremum medicinae, non est, nisi quod quando nos administramus modos curationis in aliqua aegritudinum, et non conferunt illae medicinae: deinde administramus in fine rei cauterium, et confert: tunc inde cadit, quod cauterium est postremum mediciuae, non secundum intentionem quam intelligunt uulgus et multistolidorum medicorum.	But the art is opposite to him, and the intention, that cauterization is the last of medicine, is not, unless when we administer the methods of cure in some diseases, and they do not confer on these medicines: then we administer at the end of the thing cauterization, and confer; then from there falls, that cauterization is the last of medicine, not according to the intention which the common and many-sided doctors understand.
Antiqui autem dixerunt, quod cauterium cum auro est melius, quam cauterium cum ferro: et non dixerunt illud, nisi propter aequalitatem auri, et sublimitatem substantiae suae: et dixerunt, quod non facit pus locus cauterii.	But the ancients said that when cauterization is with gold it is better than cauterization with iron: and they did not say that, except for the equality of gold and the limitation of its substance: and they said that it does not make pus place cautery.
Verum non est illud absolute: quoniam ego iam probaui illud, et inueni, quod ipsum non facit illud in quibusdam corporibus absque aliis.	But this is not absolutely true: for I have already tested it and found that itself does not do so in certain bodies without others.
Et cauterium cum ipso est bonum, et melius quam cum ferro, sicut dixerunt.	And cauterization with itself is good, and better than iron, as they said.
Verumtamen quando tu ignis cauterium in igne ex auro, non declaratur tibi, quando ignitur secundum quantitatem quam uis, propter rubedinem auri: et quando properat ad ipsum frigus, et si addis super ipsum ignitionem, liquescit in igne, et uertitur in laminas.	But when you cauterization fire in fire from gold, it does not declare to you, when lit according to the quantity that you use, for the reddening of gold: and when it comes to itself to cool, and if you add to it ignition, it melts in fire, and turns into leaves.
Quare cadit artifex ex illo in occupationem: et propter illud fit Cauterium cum ferro apud nos uelocius et propinquius, ex rectitudine ad operationem.	Why does the craftsman fall from that in employment: and for that it is made cauterization with iron among us faster and closer, from rectitude to operation.
Et ego quidem iam ordinaui hoc Capitulum in Cauterio, secundum capitula: et ordinaui ea a capite usque ad pedes: ut alleuient quaerenti illud quod uult ex eo.	And I myself have already arranged this chapter on cauterization, according to chapters: and I arranged them from the head down to the feet: that they may all find what they want from it.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Caput in commissura coronali.	About the way of cauterizing the crown.
Caput II.	Chapter II.
Confert hic cauterizatio ad dominium humiditatis et frigiditatis super cerebrum: quae duae sunt caussae sodae, et multitudinis fluxus humorum ex capite ad partes oculorum et aurium, et multitudinis somni, et doloris dentium, et doloris gutturis: et uniuersaliter omnis aegritudinis, quae accidit ex frigiditate, sicut paralisis, et sodae, epilepsiae, et apoplexiae, et similia illis ex aegritudinibus.	Here confirm cauterization to the domain of humidity and coldness on the brain: which two are causes of salt, and multitude of flow of humors from the head to the parts of eyes and ears, and multitude of sleep, and pain of teeth, and pain of throat: and universally all sickness that comes from coldness, such as paralysis, and salt, and epilepsy, and apoplexy, and such like from these ailments.
Modus cauterizationis est, ut praecipias infirmo: ut euacuetur in primis cum medicina solutiua mundificante caput tribus noctibus, aut quatuor, secundum quod exigit uirtus infirmi, et eius aetas, et consuetudo eius.	The mode of cauterization is such that you should instruct the sick one: to let him be washed with a wet-soaking medicine three or four times a night, according to what the strength of the disease and its age and custom require.
Deinde praecipe ei, ut radi faciat caput suum cum nouacula.	Then instruct him to shave his head with a razor.
Deinde fac eum sedere inter manus tuas quadratum, ita quod iam posuit manus suas super pectus suum.	Then make him sit between your hands in a squatting position so that he has placed his hands on his chest.
Deinde pone radicem palmae tuae super radicem nasi sui inter oculos suos.	Then place the root of your hand over the root of his nose between his eyes.
Vbicumque ergo peruenerit digitus tuus medius, signa locum illum cum incausto.	Therefore when your middle finger has gone as far as it can go, mark that spot with fire.
Deinde igni Cauterium Oliuare: cuius haec est forma.	Then let the cautery be made of olive oil, which has this form.
Deinde pone ipsum super locum signatum cum incausto, descensione, qua constringatur manus tua paulatim, et tu reuolues ipsum.	Then place the person himself on the marked spot with fire, and grasp his hand slowly, and release it as you rub him.
Deinde leua manum tuam uelociter, et aspicias locum.	Then let your hand move quickly, and examine the spot.
Quod si uides iam detegi ex osse quantitatem capitis alkiel, aut quantitatem zeuherbi, tunc eleua manum tuam.	If you see a quantity of hair coming out from the bone, or a quantity of grass, then let your hand fall.
Et si non, itera manum tuam ferro ipso, aut cum alio ab ipso si infrigidatur: donec uideantur ossa, quae dixi tibi.	And if not, repeat the cautery with iron, or with another one when it is cold: until you see the bones, which I told you about.
Deinde sume aliquid ex sale, et solue illud in aqua, et imbibe in ipso cotum, et pone super locum: et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus.	Then take some salt, and dissolve it in water, and dip it in the ointment, and place it on the spot: and let him be for three days.
Deinde pone super ipsum cotum imbibitum in butyro, et dimitte illum super locum, donec destruatur eschara ignis.	Then place over the person the ointment dipped in butter, and let him be on the spot until the fire is extinguished.
Deinde cura illud cum unguento tetrapharmacon, usquequo sanetur.	Then care for that with the four-fold ointment until he is healed.
Iam dixerunt, quod quanto uulnus plus remanet apertum, emittit pus: quare est melius et magis iuuatiuum.	They have already said that when the wound remains open for a longer time, it will emit pus: why is this better and more beneficial?
Et dixerunt quidam eorum, ut cauterizetur cutis usque ad os: et teneatur Cauterium, donec aduratur quiddam spissitudinis ossis.	And some of them said, "Let the skin be cauterized all the way down to the bone": and let the cautery be held back until a certain hardness of bone is achieved.
Deinde radatur post illud quod adustum est ex osse, deinde curetur.	Then cut off after that which is burned up from the bone, then dress.
Et dicunt alii, quod oportet ut cum cauterio perueniatur ad ultimum, donec imprimat in os impressionem for tem, ita quod cadat os, quod fit sicut forma kirate: aut instrumentum quod mulieres ponunt infuso alphabeti parui: et extimant, quod exspirantur ex hoc loco uapores capitis, et dimittatur uulnus apertum tempore longo.	And others say that it is necessary to make the incision when the wound has been made round with a caustic until it impresses on the bone like the form of a nail: or an instrument which women put in with ink writing straight: and they estimate, that from this place exhalation of head vapors and a long time leaves off the joint open.
Deinde curetur, donec consolidetur.	Then dress until it has hardened.
Mihi autem non uidentur hae duae species Cauterii omnino nisi in quibusdam hominibus secundum uiam timoris.	But these two kinds of cautery are not known to me at all unless in some men from fear the second time.
Et dimittere ipsum, apud me est melius cum salute ipsius.	And let go that person, it is better with me when he is healthy.
Debilitatur enim caput ex solutione continuitatis ipsius naturalis: sicut testificati sumus in reliquis membris: et praecipue quando caput infirmi debile est natura: et species quidem Cauterii prima est magis salua et melior apud me, et ea utor: operare ergo cum ea in salute.	For the head is weakened by the continuous solution of itself: as we are testified in the other members: and especially when the head is weak from nature: and the species of cautery first is more healthy and better with me, and I use it: so let us operate when he is healthy.
¶ De modo cauterizandi capitis in dolore totius capitis.	The mode of cauterizing the head while in pain on the whole head.
Caput III.	CHAPTER III.
Quando in toto Capite accidit dolor chronicus: et prolongatur illud in infirmo, et utitur hyeris, et cochiis, et caputpurgiis, et oleis, et empleumatis.	When in the whole head there happens to be a chronic pain: and it is prolonged in an invalid, and uses honey, and broths, and head purgatives, and oils, and employments.
Et praecipue si iam cauterizatum est cauterio uno, quod narrauimus, et non confert ei aliquid ex illis: tunc considera.	And especially if already cauterized with one kind of cautery which we have described, and does not give it anything from those: then examine.
Nam si caput infirmi est fortis creationis natura, et non est debile, et inuenit frigus uehemens: tunc cauteriza cum cauterio alio sub illo parum.	For if the head is sick from nature's strength, and is not weak, and there is a cold feeling under it: then cauterize with another kind of cautery below it a little.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum super omne cornu capitis sui cauterio, do nec pertranseat cutis, et discooperiatur ex osse quantitas, quam narrauimus.	Then cauterize himself on all the corners of his head with his own cautery, and let not the skin be seen, and a quantity be discovered from the bone, which we have described.
Et cauteriza ipsum cauterio uno in occipitio capitis sui, in loco qui nominatur uas: et est locus in quo ponitur uentosa: et eleua matum tuam in hoc, et non discooperias os.	And let him cauterize himself with one kind of cautery at the back of his head, in a place which is called a vessel: and it is a place where there is wind: and wash your hair well in this, and do not discover the bone.
Infirmus enim inuenit propter illud dolorem uehementem, et diuersum a dolore reliquorum cauteriorum capitis omnium.	He is therefore weakened by that painful disorder, and different from the other pain of all the head.
Et ego dicam hoc Cauterium in loco suo: et oportet quod sit cauterium, quo cauterizantur cornua capitis, et occiput eius subtilius cauterio, quo cauterizatur medium capitis.	And I will say this Cautery in its place: and it is necessary that there be a cautery, where the horns of the head are cauterized, and the occiput of it with a finer cautery, where the middle of the head is cauterized.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in hemicrania, tam cum medicina adustiua, quam cum ferro.	The way to cauterize in a headache, both when the medicine is used, and when iron is used.
Caput IIII.	Chapter IV.
Quando accidit in parte capitis dolor et soda, aut extenditur dolor usque ad oculum, et euacuatur cum medicinis mundificantibus caput, et administratur reliqua curatio, quam dixi in diuisionibus aegritudinum, et non confert illud totum: tunc cauterizatio in eo est secundum duos modos: aut cauterizatio cum medicina acuta comburente: aut cum ferro.	When it happens in a part of the head pain and soda, or extends to pain to the eye, and is washed out with cleaning medicines, and the rest treatment is administered, which I have mentioned in divisions of diseases, and does not bring all of that: then cauterization is in it according to two ways: or cauterizing with sharp medicine burning: or with iron.
Cauterium autem cum medicina acuta comburente, est, ut accipias dentem unum allii, et excortices ipsum, et abscindas extremitates eius ex duobus lateribus.	But the cautery with sharp medicine burning, is, that you take a tooth of another, and cut it into pieces, and cut off the ends of it from two sides.
Deinde scinde locum doloris in tempore cum phlebotomo lato, donec fiat in eo locus sub cute, in quo dens capitur.	Then cut the place of pain at the time with a phlebotomy knife on both sides, until it is made in it a place under the skin, where the head is caught.
Intromitte ergo eum in ipso sub cute, donec occultetur: deinde stringe super ipsum cum puluillo constrictione decenti, et dimitte ipsum quantitate quindecim horarum deinde solue eum, et extrahe allium, et dimitteuulnus duobus diebus, aut tribus: postea pone super ipsum cotum submersum in butyro, donec locus efficiat pus: deinde cura ipsum cum unguento usquequo sanetur.	Then put it into it under the skin, until it is hidden: then tie it over it with a thread of constricting tension and let it go quantity of fifteen hours afterwards solve it out, and remove another one: then put on it a cloth dipped in butter, until the place makes pus: then cure the pus with ointment until it heals.
Et si uis fac illud cum quibusdam medicinis comburentibus, quas ego scripsi in tractatu duodecimo, de Medieinis adurentibus.	And if you want to make that with some medicines burning, which I wrote in the 12th book, about Ointments that burn.
Cauterizatio uero eius cum ferro, est secundum hunc modum.	But cauterizing really with iron, is according to this way:
Igni Cauterium, cuius forma haec est.	Fire Cautery, whose form is this:
Et nominatur Clauilis: quoniam forma capitis eius est sicut forma claui, in quo est quiddam curuitatis, et in medio eius est quaedam eminentia parua.	And it is called a Clavis: because the form of the head is like the form of a key, and there is something of a turning in the middle of it, and there is a small eminence in the middle.
Deinde pone ipsum super locum, et retine manum tuam: et tu reuolue ferrum paulatim cum uelocitate: et sit quantitas quae aduritur ex spissitudine cutis, sicut medietas eius.	Then place the knife on the spot, and hold your hand back: and turn the iron gradually with speed: and let the quantity that is burned out by the thickness of the skin be like half of it.
Et eleua manum tuam, ut non aduratur arteria, quae est inferius, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	And close your hand so that the artery below does not get burned, and do not let the blood flow out.
Deinde imbibe cotum in aqua salis, et pone super locum, et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus: deinde pone cotum cum butyro: postea cura cum unguento usquequo sanetur.	Then dip the knife in salt water and place it on the spot and leave it for three days: then dip the knife with butter: afterwards care for it with ointment until it heals.
Et si uis, cauteriza hanc hemicraniam cum extremitate cultellari secunda Cauterii.	And if a wound, cauterize this headache with an edge of a razor in the second cauterization.
Et caue ab incisione arteriae in hac hemicrania, non antiqua proprie.	And do not cut off the artery in this half, for it is new and own.
¶ De modo cauteriezandi in hemicrania antiqua.	The way to cauterize in an old half-headache.
Caput V.	Head.
Quando curas hemicraniam, cum eo quod diximus ex curatione praecedente, et quod diximus in diuisionibus aegritudinum, et non confert curatio: et uides ex aegritudine, quod non sufficit ei quod diximus ex cauterio primo cum medicina, aut cum cauterio cum igne, tunc oportet ut ignias Cauterium cultellare, donec albificetur postquam signas super locum doloris cum linea, cuius longitudo sit medietas digiti, aut quasi illud: et depone manum tuam uice una, et stringe eam donec incidas arteriam, et peruenias usque ad os.	When you are curing a half-headache, with this which we said before in the preceding cure, and which we said in the divisions of diseases, and there is no cure: and you will see from illness that it does not suffice to it which we said in the first cauterization with medicine, or with cauterization with fire, then it must be that the fires of Cauterium are turned, until it turns white after the signs on the spot of pain with a line, whose length is half a finger, or almost like that: and place your hand with a blow, and tighten it until you hit the artery, and reach all the way to the mouth.
Verumtamen necesse est tibi, ut caueas a continuatione mandibulae, quae mouetur apud masticationem, ne aduratur latus, aut neruus qui mouet ipsam, unde accidat spasmus.	However, you need to cauterize the continuation of the jaw, which moves when chewing, so that it does not get burned on one side, or the nerve that moves it, from which comes a spasm.
Et esto super custotiam, et cautelam de fluxu sanguinis arteriae, quae abscisa est.	And be on the lookout, and take care of the flow of blood of the artery that has been cut off.
In abscisione enim eius est timor, et praecipue ei qui ignorat illud quod facit, et non est studiosus, nec expertus: et dimittit operationem cum eo in primis.	For there is a fear in it, and especially to him who does not know that thing which he does, and is not learned, nor expert: and dismisses the operation with it at first.
Et ego ueniam cum rememoratione regiminis fluxus sanguinis accidentis ex arteria secundum modum suum, et in loco suo huius libri.	And I shall come to speak about the treatment of the flow of blood from a vessel according to its mode, and in the place of this book.
Quod si uides ex aegritudine, quod non sufficit ei hoc Cauterium, et uides corpus infirmi tolerans cauterium in medio capitis, sicut narrauimus, cura uulnus, donec sanetur.	That if you see from sickness that it is not sufficient for him this cautery, and you see the body tolerating the cautery in the middle of the head, as we have told, take care of the wound until it heals.
Et si uis, administra Cauterium, quod diximus in capitulo extractionis arteriae cum Cauterio habente duos cultellos.	And if you see, administer the cautery, which we have said in the chapter on the extraction of the artery with the cautery having two scissors.
Est enim cauterizatio melior hac et magis conferens.	For the cauterization is better than this and confers more benefit.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in dolore Aurium.	The mode of cauterizing in earache.
Caput VI.	Chapter VI.
Quando accidit in Aure dolor a frigore, et curatur cum solutiuis, et reliqua curatione quam diximus in diuisione, et non remouetur dolor, tunc igni Cauterium: et est illud quod nominatur Punctum, cuius forma est haec.	When it happens in the ear pain from cold, and is cured with liquid, and remaining cure as we have said in the division, and the pain does not subside, then fire cautery: and that is what is called a dot, whose form is this.
Deinde puncta cum eo post eius ignitionem in circumitu auris totius, sicut reuoluitur: aut in circumitu utriusque, si simul dolor est in utrisque.	Then the dots with this after its ignition in the circumference of the whole ear, as it is resolved: or in the circumference of each, if at the same time the pain is in both.
Et elonga te cum Cauterio a radice auris parumper, postquam signaueris loca cum encaustro: et sit cauterii quantitas decem punctorum in omni aure, et quasi illa.	And lengthen it with the cautery from the root of the ear slightly, after you have marked the places with the caustic: and let the quantity of the cautery be ten dots all over the ear, and almost that same.
Deinde cura loca, donec sanentur.	Then care for the place, until they are healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Tortura.	The mode of cauterizing in torture.
Caput VII.	Chapter VII.
Tortura quae curatur cum cauterizatione, non est nisi ex speciebus, quae accidunt ex phlegmate, secundum quod diximus in diuisionibus aegritudinum.	Torture which is cured with cautery, is not unless from the species that happen from the phlegm, according to what we have said in the divisions of sicknesses.
Et deuita cauterizationem speciei, quae accidit ex exiccatione, et spasmo nerui.	And the distance of cautery from the species that happens from drying up, and spasm of a nerve.
Quando curas hanc speciem torturae cum hyeris, et caputpurgiis, et gargarismis, et non confert curatio tua, tunc oportet ut cauterizes infirmum tribus Cauteriis: uno apud radicem auris, et secundo parum inferius a timpore suo, et tertio apud coniunctionem duorum labiorum.	When you cure this species of torture with salt, and hyssop, and gargles, and your cure does not confer benefit, then you shall cauterize the sickly person three cauteries: one near the root of the ear, and a second little below its place, and a third at the junction of the two lips.
Et pone Cauterium tuum ex contrario partis infirmae.	And place your cautery from the opposite side of the weakened part.
Quoniam mollificatio non accidit, nisi in parte quae apparet sana.	For softening does not occur unless in a part that appears healthy.
Et forma cauterizationis est, ut cauterizes ipsum Cauterio in directo extremitatis auris superioris sub cornu capitis parum: et alio in timpore: cuius longitudo sit secundum longitudinem pollicis.	And the shape of the cautery is such that it cauterizes itself in the very tip of the upper ear under the corner of the head a little: and at another time: whose length is according to the length of the thumb.
Et depone manum tuam cum cauterio, donec comburatur quantitas medietatis spissitudinis cutis.	And place your hand with the cautery, until the quantity of half the thickness of the skin is burned.
Et haec est forma Cauterii, et est species ex cultellari, cuius forma praemissa est: uerumtamen non est subtilior ea parum, sicut uides: et oportet ut sit cultellus in eo superfluae grossitudinis parum.	And this is the form of the cautery, and its species from a scalpel, whose form is given above: indeed it is not so sharp as you see: and it should be that the scalpel has a little excess thickness.
Deinde cura loca, cum eo quod praecessit: donec sanetur.	Then take care of the place, with what precedes it: until it heals.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Apoplexia antiqua.	§ On the method of cauterizing in ancient apoplexia.

QUando antiquatur Apoplexia, et curas eam cum eo quod diximus, et non confert medicatio tua, et infirmus non habet febrem, tunc cauteriza eum quatuor cauteriis super omne cornu capitis sui, et cauterio in medio capitis, sicut diximus, et cauterio in occipitio capitis, secundum quod praecessit: et modus cauterii sit secundum quod praecessit.

Ipsum namque est modus Cauterii: et fac illud secundum ordinem eundem, quem dixi illic.	This is the form of the cautery: and make it according to the order we have said there.
Si ergo sanatur per illud, bonum est.	If so healed by that, it is good.
Si non: tunc fac ei cauteria tria in posteriori parte capitis sui, quae sint descendentia a superiori parte capitis usque ad inferiorem partem oculi: et pone inter omne cauterium grossitudinem digiti.

Deinde rade caput infirmi: postea cauteriza ipsum cauterio in medio capitis, et cauterio super omne cornu capitis, et cauterio super posterius ipsius, et tribus super spondiles colli.	Then rad the head with milk: then cauterize him with a middle cautery of the head, and with a cautery over each horn of the head, and with a cautery over its posterior part, and with three cauteries over the spine of the neck.
Si autem indiges in aegritudine mollificatione corporis pluribus illis, et infirmus est tolerans, et aegritudo est fortis: tunc cauteriza ipsum quatuor cauteriis super spondiles dorsi, et ultima cum cauterio, donec comburatur ex cute plurimum eius, et eleua manum tuam.	If however you are able in health to soften the body many times, and the sick one endures it, and the sickness is strong: then cauterize him with four cauteries over the spines of the back, and the last with a cautery, until it burns out from its skin much of it, and wash your hand.

It is necessary that you make the cleaning of his brain first with hyoscyamus, and with the other cure which I have said in division: when the sick one is great, or bears medicines well.

And if the cause of melancholy is an excess of a drop to the brain causing melancholy, and his body is wet with moisture, then give him in a drink that will cleanse his brain, according to what has preceded in division: then he rubs his head, and afterwards makes a tortuous thread made of linen, like a circle.

In cauterio autem cum igne, praecipe infirmo ante illud, ut dimittat pilos suos, si est ex illis qui mundant eos, donec prolongentur et aequentur.	In the caustic, however, with fire, order the sick person before it, so that he stops his hair, if he is of those who wash themselves, until they grow long and smooth.
Si autem pungunt eum apud ortum suum: tunc constringe oculos eius cum uitta, ut non moueantur, donec nascantur.	If it hurts him near its edge: then squeeze the eyes shut with putty, so that they do not move, until they are well-healed.
Cum ergo nascuntur et aequantur, tunc pone caput infirmi in sinu tuo: deinde signa super Palpebram oculorum eius cum encaustro, signo quod sit secundum figuram folii myrti: et sit principium signi prope pilos.	As soon as they [the wounds] are born and become equable, then place the head of the nurse in your lap: afterwards, mark the eyelids of his eyes with a wax impression, the mark being according to the shape of the myrtle leaf: and let the beginning of the mark be near the hair.
Deinde pone cotum imbibitum in albumine oui: aut in mucilagine psilii super oculum.	Then put on a cloth soaked in albumen or in silken mucilage over the eye.
Deinde igni cauterium, cuius forma est haec.	Then apply fire as a cautery, whose form is this.
Deinde cauteriza super figuram, quam signasti paulatim in uicibus multis, donec comburatur superficies cutis, quae est sicut figura folii myrti, totam apparentem proprie.	Then cauterize on the shape that you have marked gradually in many places, until the skin surface is completely burned, which is like the shape of the myrtle leaf, all apparent by itself.
Et signum sanitatis operis tui est: ut si uideas Palpebram oculi iam contrahi, et pilos eleuari apud puncturam oculi.	And the mark of your work's health is: if you  [are able to] close the eyelids of his eyes now, and remove the hair near the eye's puncture.
Eleua ergo manum tuam tunc: et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus.	So then raise up your hand: and let him go for three days.

Deinde pone Cotum infusum in albugine oui, aut in mucilagine psilii super oculum eius: deinde igni Cauterium, cuius forma est haec.	Then put cotton wadded in alum, or in a slip of mulberry leaves on his eye: then apply the cautery, which has this form.
Sit concauum, sicut forma cannae pennae uulturis ab extremitate una, cum qua fit Cauterium: et si uis sit penetrans usque ad extremitatem aliam, et si uis sit sursum sic tenta.	Let him sit with his back bent as the shape of a knife edge from one end, where the cautery is made: and if the blade sits penetrating all the way to the other end, and if the blade sits standing up.
Verumtamen hoc concauum est melius ad opus tuum.	However, this bent blade is better for your work.

And hold with it your hand somewhat near the cautery from the eye, towards the side of the nose, so that your hand does not move or stir the sick person: and put the cautery in the fat of the eye, and corrode it.
Si ergo peruenis in principio Cauterii tui usque ad os, erit bene.	If then you can see through the end of your cautery to the mouth, it is good.
Et si non: tunc itera Cauterium semel, aut bis, si indiges illo: et dimitte illud tribus diebus.	Then if not: then go over the cautery once or twice if you can bear it: and dismiss it after three days.

Et funde in ipsum quantitatem drachmae ex plumbo liquefacto, et tene manum tuam cum Canna retentione bona, et non moueatur infirmus omnino, ut non currat, uel perueniat plumbum liquefactum ad oculum eius.	And pour into it a quantity of liquid lead, and hold your hand with the cannula securely held back, so that it does not move at all, lest it run or get to the eye of him who has the fistula.
Et oportet ut ponas super oculum infirmi cotum infusum in albumine oui, aut in aqua.	And you should put on top of the eye an eyedropper full of infusion in albumen or in water.
Plumbum enim comburit locum fistulae, et sanat ipsam sanatione mirabili.	For lead burns up the place of the fistula, and heals it with a marvellous healing.
Quod si sanatur fistula, cum eo quod diximus ex Cauterio, et curatione, est bonum.	That if the fistula is healed, with what I said above from the Cauldron, and the cure, is good.
Et si non, tunc necesse est administrare foramen nasi, et reducere fistulam ad cursum nasi, secundum quod ueniet in loco suo sibi proprio.	And if not, then it is necessary to administer the nasal opening, and reduce the fistula to its own natural course of the nose, according to which it will go into its own place.

And if you want, dip the cloth or bandage in cold butter and place it on the painful tooth: and place the iron red-hot on the tooth that hurts, until the fire has penetrated to the root of the tooth.
Cauterizatio autem eius cum igne est, ut intendas ad cannulam aeris, aut cannulam ferri.	But the cauterization with fire is so that you can see towards the airway or the iron tube.

When the head of the humerus is dislocated by a cause of moistening, and does not return to its place at first from its dislocation until it has become accustomed to its return, then it should be reduced by a slight movement; which we have already shown to happen, then it is necessary that you reduce the dislocation at first.
Deinde resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum, aut super latus sanum.	Then he should lie down on his back or on his healthy side.

Deinde cauteriza cum tribus cauteriis, cauterio sub cochleari pectoris quantitate digiti unius cum cauterio clauili, et duobus cauteriis inferius a duobus lateribus cauterii unius, donec ueniat figura cauteriorum triangulata.	Then cauterize with six cauterizations, one cauterization under the breastbone in the size of a finger with a cauterization on the clavicle, and two cauterizations below the sides in the size of a finger, until a triangular figure is achieved.
Et elonga inter utraque ut non coniungantur, quando facient pus.	And lengthen between each one so that they do not join together, when they are pus-like.
Et sit profunditas cauterii quantitas duarum tertiarum grossitudinis cutis.	And let the depth of the cauterization be twice the thickness of the skin.

Et sit quantitas eius quod aduritur ex spissitudine cutis, quantitas medietatis eius non additum: et sit infirmus stans super pedes suos.	And let there be a quantity of what is heated by the thickness of the skin, half as much added: and let the sick stand on his feet.
Si autem non est stans, tunc sit iacens, qui iam extendit crura sua, et eleuauit brachia sua.	But if he is not standing, then let him lie down, for he has already extended his legs and raised his arms.

Caput XXX.	Chapter 30.
Quando accidit exitura, et uis scire, si illud apostema est in carne Epatis, aut in tunica eius: tunc si est in carne Epatis, inuadit infirmum dolor, et grauitas absque acuitate: et si est in tunica Epatis, cum dolore est acuitas uehemens: et uides iam, quia fatigauit medicos eius curatio.	When an exit is found and you need to know, if that apostema (exits) is in the liver or in its covering membrane: then if it is in the liver, you will see a painful fever, and there is no sharpness of pain; and if it is in the covering membrane of the liver, there is a sharp pain: and you will see that the treatment of doctors tires them out.
Oportet ergo ut resupinet infirmus super ceruicem suam.	Therefore let the sick person lie on his back.
Deinde figura locum apostematis cum encaustro: deinde ignias cauterium quod assimilatur radio.	Then figure out the location of the exit with a torch: then light the fire of the cauldron, so that it is absorbed by radiation.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form.
Et cauteriza cum eo cauterium unum, donec comburatur cutis tota, et perueniat ad siphac, donec egrediatur sanies tota: deinde cura ipsum curatione exiturarum, donec sanetur.	And cauterize it with one fire until the skin is burned all over, and reaches the sipum (a small vessel), until it exhales its breath entirely: then take care of the cure of the exits, until it heals.
Et non oportet ut hac cauterii specie utatur, nisi cuius studium in arte medicinae prolongatur: et per cuius manus concurrunt aegritudines istae cum experimento aliquotiens: tunc enim audeat super huiusmodi operationem.	And it should not be performed with this surgery, unless the person's knowledge in the medical field is prolonged: and because through the hands of some diseases occasionally pass: then let him dare to perform such an operation.
At uero dimittere ipsam, apud me est melius.	But, I think it is better to release it.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Pleuresi.	To cauterize in pleurisy.
Caput XXXI.	Title: On the Treatment ofPleurisy.
Dixerunt antiqui, cauterium cum radicibus aristolochiae ad Pleuresim frigidam secundum hunc modum.	The ancient doctors said that they used to apply the root of aristeolochia as a cauterizer for cold pleurisy in this way.
Et est, ut recipias ex radicibus aristolochiae siccae longae, radicem unam longiorem, quae ex ea inuenitur, et sit sicut grossitudo digiti.	And you should take a long dry root of aristeolochia, and it should be as thick as the finger.
Deinde submerge eam in oleo: et accende ipsam in igne.	Then dip it in oil: and light it on fire.
Deinde cauteriza cauterio uno in eo quod est inter continuationem furculae cum collo, et duobus cauteriis paruis sub guidezi parum decliuibus ad partem, quae est sub barba.	Then apply the cautery once on that which is between the blade of the fork and the neck, and two small cauteries slightly descending on the side, which is under the beard.
Et duobus cauteriis etiam in eo, quod est inter costam quintam et sextam decliuibus ad posteriora parumper: et cauterio alio in medio pectoris, et alio supra stomachum.	And two cauteries also on that which is between the fifth and sixth ribs slightly descending towards the rear: and another cautery in the middle of the breast, and another above the stomach.
Et tribus cauteriis a posterioribus: uno in eo quod est inter duas spatulas: et duobus cauteriis a duobus lateribus pectoris, inferius cauterio quod est inter duas spatulas.	And three cauteries from behind: one in that which is between two spatulas; and two cauteries from the sides of the breast, lower cautery being in that which is between two spatulas.
Et non oportet ut comprimas manum tuam cum cauterio, imo sit in manifesto cutis odorando.	And you should not compress your hand with the cautery, but rather keep it in plain sight smelling.
Et iam dixerunt quidam antiqui, quod ex hominibus sunt qui utuntur cauterio ex ferro simili radio: et igniunt, et intus mittunt ipsum in eo quod est inter costas, donec perueniatur cum eo ad ipsum apostema, et egrediatur sanies: sicut diximus in apostemate Epatis.	And some ancient men said that they use a cautery of iron like a radium: and they light it, and put it inside that which is between the ribs until it reaches the pus, and the discharge comes out: as we have said before in the description of liver pustules.
Sed in hac perforatione cum cauterio est ex timore, quod aut moritur infirmus statim, aut accidit in loco fistula, cui non est sanatio.	But in this piercing with a cautery there is danger that either the sick person immediately dies, or a leak happens to the place, which has no cure.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Splenem Caput XXXII.	Chapter on the way to cauterize the Spleen.
Quando tu curas aegritudinem splenis, cum eo quod diximus ex curatione in diuisione aegritudinum, et non confert curatio tua, tunc cauterium in ea est secundum tres modos, qui omnes sunt recti.	When you treat the spleen illness, as we have said before in the division of illnesses, and your treatment does not bring about a cure, then cauterize it according to three ways, all of which are straight.
Quorum unus est, ut facias tria cauteria, aut quatuor lineando secundum longitudinem splenis secundum figuram cauteriorum Epatis, quorum praecessit figura.	Of which one is, that you make three cauteries, or four in a line following the length of the spleen according to the shape of the cauteries of liver, which preceded this figure.
Et sit inter omne cauterium quantitas grossitudinis digiti, aut plus parum.	And place between all the cautery quantity of the thickness of the finger, or more little or less.
Et sit modus cauterii, quem diximus in cauterio epatis aequaliter.	And place the measure of the cautery, which we have said in the hepatic cautery equally.
Et non comprimas manum tuam cum cauterio: et sit infirmus resupinus super dorsum suum.	And do not compress your hand with the cautery: and let the sick rest on his back.
Et modus alius de cauterizatione est: ut ignias cauterium habens duo uerua, quod diximus in capitulo dislocationis humeri: et eleua cutem, quae est in directo splenis, ubi peruenit cubitus infirmi sinister: et sit eleuatio tua qua eleuas cutem secundum latitudinem corporis, ut cadant cauteria secundum longitudinem corporis.	And another mode of cauterization is that which has two hands, which we have said in the chapter on shoulder dislocation: and raise up the skin, which is in direct splenis, where it approaches the bed of the sick on the left: and let your lift up your hand so that you lift up the skin according to the width of the body, so that the cauterization fall according to the length of the body.
Deinde intromitte duo uerua ignita ualde, donec cum eis penetres cutem a parte altera: deinde extrahe cauterium: fiunt ergo cauteria quatuor.	Then introduce two hot hands so that you pierce the skin from one side: then remove the cautery: so there are four cauteries.
Et si uis cauteriza cum cauterio alio habente tria uerua.	And if you want to cauterize with a cautery having three hands.
Deinde cura cauterium postquam dimittis ipsum emittere pus diebus multis: est enim magis conferens quamque reliqua quae praecesserunt ex curatione.	Then take care of the cautery after you have sent it out to emit pus for many days: for it is more effective because what has preceded from the cure remains.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Hydropisi.	The mode of cauterizing in Hydropsis.
Caput XXXIII.	Chapter 33.
Cauterium non cadit in Hydropisi, nisi ascliti proprie.	The cautery does not fall in Hydropsis, unless it is carefully made to fall.
Quando tu curas Hydropicum cum modis curationis, quos diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio, tunc oportet ut cauterizes ipsum quatuor cauteriis in circumitu umbilici, et cauterio uno super stomachum, et cauterio alio super epar, et cauterio super splenem, et cauteriis duobus post dorsum inter spondiles, et uno in directo pectoris, et alio in directo stomachi: et sit quantitas profunditatis cauterii propinqua spissitudini cutis.	When you treat Hydropsis with the modes of cure which we have said in division, and there is no effect from the cure, then you must cauterize four times around the navel, and one on the stomach, and one on the liver, and one on the spleen, and two behind the back between the vertebrae, and one in the direct line of the breast, and another in the direct line of the stomach: and let the depth of the cautery be near the thickness of the skin.
Deinde dimitte cauterium apertum, ut emittat pus tempore longo.	Then remove the open cautery so that it emits pus after a long time.
Et non euacues infirmum a curatione post cauterium cum eo: quod oportet ut aggregentur ei duae intentiones: et festinabit ad ipsum sanatio cum auxilio Dei.	And do not wet the sick with the cure after the cautery is applied to it: because two intentions should be gathered for him, and he will quickly recover with the help of God.
Forma uero cauterii cum quo cauterizatur uenter, sit clauilis: secundum quod praecessit forma eius: et illius cum quo cauterizatur dorsum, sit oliuaris secundum quod praecessit eius forma.	Indeed the shape of the incision for the abdomenal cavity, when incised, should be closed; according to which the preceeding shape of it is: and when incised from behind, the shape of the incision should be ovoidal according to which its preceeding shape was.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Pedes, et Crura.	The mode of cauterizing the feet and thighs.
Caput XXXIIII.	Chapter IIII. The head.
Quando apostemantur in Hydropico, et replentur aqua citrina: oportet ut cauterizes super dorsum Pedis in nocrati, quae est inter auricularem et anularem: et eleua manum tuam cum cauterio, et non torqueas ipsum: deinde eleua manum tuam: et non iteres ipsum omnino.	When they are put out in the hydropic diathesis, and become filled with yellow water: it is necessary that you cauterize on the back of the foot, at the knuckle joint, which is between the auricular and the annular finger; and having washed your hand with the cautery, do not turn it around: then wash your hand, and do not return to the cauterization at all.
Resudet enim aqua citrina, et sit cauterium secundum hanc formam.	For the yellow water returns, and the cautery is according to this form.
Deinde fac super duo crura duo cauteria in omni crure, et fiat cauterium cum extremitate cultellari cauterii: et fiat cauterium secundum longitudinem cruris, unum sub genu, et alterum inferius eo, circiter medium cruris: et super omnem coxam cauteria duo: et dimitte cauterium apertum absque curatione tempore longo: ut resudet ex eo aliquod aquae: deinde cura ipsum cum reliquis quae diximus.	Then do on the two thighs two cauteries in every thigh, and make the cautery with the edge of the scalpel-like cautery: and make the cautery according to the length of the thigh, one under the knee, and another lower down by that, about in the middle of the thigh: and do on the whole hip two cauteries; and do not close the cautery for a long time: so that it returns from it some water: then take care of it with the rest which we have said.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in solutione Ventris.	The mode of cauterizing in the solution of the abdomen.
Caput XXXV.	Chapter XXV. The stomach.
Quando est solutio uentris ex frigore et humiditatibus, donec debilitet uirtutes retentiuam et digestiuam, quae sunt in stomacho et intestinis: et curatur illud cum modis curationis, et non sanatur: et uides infirmum tolerantem cauterium exuberantis uirtutis, tunc cauteriza ipsum cauterio magno super stomachum suum, secundum quod praecessit in cauterizatione stomachi cum cauterio circuli, et quatuor cauteriis in circumitu umbilici subtilibus, cum cauterio clauili subtili: et cauterio super alcatin supra alhosos magno, aut duobus cauteriis.	When the solution of the abdomen weakens the retentive and digestive virtues which are in the stomach and intestines; and it is cured by the usual modes of cure, and does not recover: and you see one that bears with him a great exuberance of virtue, then cauterize him by means of a large scalpel on his stomach, according to which he was cauterized on the stomach with a circular scalpel, and four small cauteries around the navel, with a small scalpel; and a scalpel over the aloes in great numbers, or two scalpel-like cauteries.
Et si uides humiditates exuberantes, et infirmum tolerantem illud, tunc cauteriza ipsum cauterio super pectinem, et cauterio super omne ilium: et fortasse addes duo cauteria parua super stomachum prope magnum.	And if you see exuberant moistures, and this which is weak tolerates it, then cautery him with cautery over the rib cage, and cautery over all the ileum: and perhaps you added two small cauterizations next to the great stomach.
Est enim curatio proficiens, cuius iuuamentum non errat.	For healing is successful, whose sign is not in error.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Hemorroidas.	§ On the method of cauterizing hemorrhoids.
Caput XXXVI.	CHAPTER XXXVI.
Quando in ano sunt Hemorroides antiquae multae, aut una, et sunt ex humoribus grossis, frigidis, aut humiditatibus corruptis, et curantur cum eo, quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio: tunc cauteriza tribus cauteriis super inferiorem spondilem dorsi sub almeidati parumper triangulatim, et cauterio sub umbilico quasi duobus digitis.	When there are old many hemorrhoids, or one, and they are of gross humors, cold, or corrupt moistures, and cure with that which we have said in the division, and does not provide a cure: then cauterize three cauterizations over the lower vertebral bone of the back under an almond-shaped little triangle, and cauterization under the navel almost two fingers.
Et si cogitas, quod stomachus eius infrigidatus sit, et cibus eius non digeratur, et faciem eius uides apostemari, tunc cauteriza eum super stomachum cauterio magno, secundum quod praecessit: et cauterio super Epar eius, et alio super Splenem ipsius, cum cauterio clauili: et dimitte cauterium apertum tempore aliquo: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	And if you think that his stomach is cold, and his food does not digest, and you see his face paled, then cauterize him over the stomach with a large cautery, according to what preceded: and cauterize over his epiploae, and another over his splenii, with a claui-cauterium: and let go of the cauterium open at some time: and then heal him himself until he is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi althelul post abscisionem eorum.	§ On the method of cauterizing Altzelul after the amputation of them.
Caput XXXVII.	CHAPTER XXXVII.
Quando tu abscindis althelul, tunc ignias cauterium quod assimilatur radio.	When you cut off Altzelul, then set fire to a cauterizing tool that radiates heat.
Deinde intromittite ipsum ignitum in ipsum althelul abscisum: et ultima manum tuam, donec perueniat cauterium ad orificium uenae, ex qua currit sanguis: fac illud semel, aut bis.	Then introduce into it the lit cauterizing tool: and last hand your own, until the cautery reaches the opening of the anus from which blood flows: make it once, or twice.
Si ergo althelul fuerint multa, tunc cauteriza unumquodque cauterio secundum quod narrauimus.	If then Altzelul are many, then cauterize each one with a separate cautery according to what we have said.
Deinde cura ea, cum eo quod confert eis ex unguentis, donec sanentur.	Then heal them, with that which confers on them from the ointment, until they are healed.
Et si cauterizas eum cauterio magno super alcatin, est magis ultimum in iuuamento.	And if you cauterize him with a large cautery over his anus, it is more final in healing.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Fistulam in ano.	To cauterize a fistula in the anus.
Caput XXXVIII.	Chapter 38. On cauterizing a fistula in the
Quando non obedit infirmus sectioni et operi quod narrauimus in loco suo, et terretur ab illo, fortasse sanatur cum cauterio.	When the patient does not submit to the cut and operation which we have described in their place, and shudders at it, perhaps he will be cured with the help of cauterization.
Cum ergo accidit alicui Fistula, et antiquatur, currit pus ex ea, et humiditates corruptae.	When therefore a fistula happens to anyone, and it becomes old, pus runs out of it, and there is corruption and moisture.
Dignius ergo quod oportet est, ut probes eam cum tenta subtili.	It is fitting that one should test it with a gentle probe.
Deinde cognosce quantitatem profunditatis eius cum tenta.	Then recognize the depth of its extent with a probe.
Deinde ignias cauterium, quod est simile radio.	Then take a kindling of fire as it were, similar in size.
Deinde intromit te ipsum ignitum in ipsam Fistulam et quantitatem in qua intrauit clauus.	Then insert yourself with the burning brand into the fistula and measure the amount by which it enters.
Et itera super eam cauterium, donec comburantur illa omnia corpora corrupta, semel, aut bis, aut ter, secundum quantitatem necessitatis tuae.	And repeatedly pass the brand over it, until all the corrupt matter is burned up, once, or twice, or three times, according to the necessity of your case.
Et custodi te ab adustione nerui, si est illic, aut uenae magnae: aut si Fistula uadit ad corpus uesicae, aut ad corpus intestini, tunc custodi te ab istis locis omnibus.	And guard yourself from the burning of a dry branch if there is one there, or of a large piece of wood: but if the fistula opens into the body of the bladder, or of the intestine, then guard yourself from all such places.
Et non facias illud, nisi quando fistula est in loco carnoso: et cogitas, quia non est penetrans.	And do not do this unless the fistula is in a fleshy place; and consider that it does not penetrate.
Deinde cura locum usquequo sanetur.	Then tend the place until it is healed.
Si autem sigillatur locus, et abscinduntur ab eo materiae, et remanet sic tempore longo: tunc scias, quia iam sanatus est integre.	But if the place is sealed, and there are no more discharges from it for a long time, then you shall know that it has now been completely healed.
Et si non abscindunt ab eo materiae, tunc scias quia est penetrans, aut in profundo eius est os corruptum, aut quasi illud ex illis: quorum rememoratio ueniet in loco suo.	And if there are no more discharges from it, then you shall know that it is a penetrating fistula, or that the opening into its depth is corrupted, or something like that: whose memory will remain in the place itself.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Renes.	The method of cauterizing hernias.
Caput XXXIX.	Chapter 39. On cauterizing hernias.Si est
Quando accidit in Renibus dolor ex frigore, aut ex uentositate grossa, et minuitur propter illud coius infirmi, tunc oportet ut cauterizes ipsum super almethenem super ipsos renes, cauterio super omnem renem cum cauterio clauili, cuius praecessit rememoratio.	When it happens in the hernial pain from cold, or from gross wind, and is nursed because of it, then one should cauterize the same above the pubic bone over the hernias, with a cautery over each hernia, whose memory precedes.
Et fortasse cauterizamus ipsum secundo in ipso almeidatu.	And perhaps we cauterized him himself with his own almeyda.
Quare uenient tria lineata.	Why are there three striped lines.
Ergo erunt magis ultima in iuuamento.	Therefore the last will be more in the binding.
¶ De modo cauteritzandi Vesicam.	§ On the mode of cauterizing the vesica.
Caput XL.	Head 40.
Quando accidunt in Vesica debilitas, et mollificatio a frigo re et humiditatibus, donec non retineat infirmus urinam, tunc cauteriza ipsum in inferiori parte suminis super Vesicam, ubi incipiunt pili pectinis, et cauterio a dextra suminis, et alio a sinistra illius: et sit longitudo illius cauterizationis lateris secundum quantitatem nodi pollicis: et cauteriza ipsum cauterio inferiori dorsi, aut duobus cauteriis, si indiges illo: et sit secundum quod praecessit cauterium clauile.	When there is weakness in the vesica and softening from cold and moisture until it does not retain the urine, then cauterize him in the lower part of the suppis over the vesica, where the hairs begin to grow, and cauterize with one cautery from the right suppis, and another from his left: and let the length of his cautery be according to the length of his knuckle of the hand: and cauterize him with two cauteries, if you can bear it: and let sit according to what has preceded the cautery with a claw.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Matricem.	§ On the mode of cauterizing the matrix.
Caput XLI.	Head 41.
Quando accidunt in Matrice frigus et humiditates, et prohibetur per illud ab impregnatione, et corrumpuntur menstrua eius, et tardatur prouocatio eorum, et accidit ei apud aduentum eorum dolor, tunc oportet ut cauterizetur tribus cauteriis in circumitu umbilici, sicut diximus in cauterizatione uesicae, et cauterio super alcatim inferius dorso, aut duobus cauteriis: et sit cauterium clauile.	When there is cold and moisture in the matrix, and it is prevented by that from impregnation, and her menstrual periods are delayed, and occurs to her a pain at her coming into the bedchamber, then it should be that he be cauterized with three cauteries around the umbilicus, as we have said in the cauterizing of the vesica, and cautery on the alkazium behind, or two cauteries: and let sit according to what has preceded the cautery with a claw.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Ancham in dislocatione.	§ On the mode of cauterizing the anus in dislocation.
Caput XLII.	Head 42.
Quando effunduntur humiditates mucosae ad pixidem Anchae, et fiunt caussa exitus eius a loco suo: et signum illius est, quod prolongatur crus super alterum, quando comparantur adinuicem: et inuenitur locus dislocationis in eo uacuus.	When the mucous membrane of the anus flows into the faeces, and there is a cause for its exit from its place: and its sign is that it prolongs the crust over another, when they are facing one another; and the site of dislocation is found in that.
Oportet ergo ut cauterizes infirmum super pixidem Anchae ipsius cauterio simili circulo: postquam tu signas cum encaustro in circumitu pixidis, sicut reuoluitur: et ut cadat ipsa pixis in medio circuli.	Therefore it should be that he cauterize the weak one over the anus of him with a similar circle: after you have found the signs with the caustice around the anus, as it turns away: and that it falls down itself in the middle of the circle.
Et sit cauterium cuius forma praecessit in cauterizatione stomachi.	And let there be a caustic whose form precedes in the caustication of the stomach.
Quod si tibi non est praesens hoc cauterium, tunc cauteriza ipsum tribus cauteriis, cum cauterio oliuari magno: et fiat cauterio profunditas secundum quantitatem spissitudinis cutis totius.	That if you do not have this caustic present, then causticate it with three caustics, with a large olive oil caustic: and let there be made a depth of caustic according to the quantity of the thickness of the skin of all.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then take care of yourself, until you are healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Sciatica.	The way to causticate in the sciatic nerve.
Caput XLIII.	Chapter XLI.
Quando accidit dolor in pixide anchae, et sunt caussa illius frigus et humiditates: et curatur infirmus cum eo, quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio, et antiquatur illud: tunc oportet ut soluas infirmum ab humoribus grossis cum pillulis foetidis, aut cum pillulis artificialibus, et similibus.	When it happens that there is pain in the sciatic bone, and there is a cause of his coldness and moisture: and the sick person is treated with it, as we have said in the division, and there is no cure for him, and he grows old: then it is necessary that you should separate the sick person from gross humors with foetid pills, or with artificial pills, and similar things.
Deinde cauteriza eum.	Then causticate it.
Et modus cauterii in ea est secundum duos modos: aut cauterium cum medicinis adurentibus, aut cauterium cum igne.	And the mode of the caustic is according to two ways: either with caustic with burning medicines, or with fire.
Cauterium cum igne, est secundum multos modos.	The caustic with fire is according to many ways.
Quorum unus est, ut cauterizes super pixidem anchae ipsius tribus cauteriis triangulatis, secundum hanc formam.	Of which one is that, that it causticate on the sciatic bone with three triangular caustics, according to this form:
Et fac eis profunditatem bonam, uel malam.	And let them make a depth that is good, or bad.
Et sit spacium quod est inter omne cauterium quantitatis grossitudinis digiti: sitque cauterium oliuare.	And let there be space that is between every caustic according to the quantity of the thickness of a finger: and let there be olive oil caustic.
Quandoque autem fit cauterium in medio super caput anchae ipsius.	When, however, it is made on the middle of the head with his own.
Quare sunt quatuor cauteria.	Why are there four caustics?
Et si uis cauteriza cum circulo, cuius praecessit forma in cauterizatione dislocationis anchae, uno: ut sit circulus continens ancham totam.	And if you causticate with a circle, whose form precedes in the caustication of the dislocation of the whole ankle, one: that there be a circle containing the whole ankle.
Et combure spissitudinem cutis totius.	And let it burn the thickness of the skin of all.
Iste est modus cauterii in Sciatica, quando dolor est adhaerens anchae ipsi, et non extenditur usque ad coxam et crus.	This is the way to causticate in the sciatic nerve, when there is pain adhering to the ankle itself, and does not extend until the hip and leg.
Si autem extenditur usque ad coxam et crus, tunc cauteriza ipsum duobus cauteriis super coxam, super locum ad quem innuit illic infirmus, in quo est dolor, et cauterio tuo super cauillam quatuor digitis ad partem syluestrem parumper: et sit cauterium cultellare.	If, however, it extends to the hip and leg, then cauterize him with two cautery wands over the hip, over the place where he is wounded, in which there is pain, and your own cautery over the shin bone for four fingers on the opposite side: and set the cautery blade.
Et sit profunditas cauterii secundum profunditatem spissitudinis cutis.	And set the depth of the cauterization according to the depth of the skin's thickness.
Quod si infirmus innuit quod dolor extenditur usque prope digitos pedis, tunc cauteriza ipsum illic ubi innuit cum cauterio puncti, tribus, aut quatuor, aut pluribus, si indiget illo.	That if the sick person says that the pain extends up to his toes, then cauterize him there where he feels pain with a single, triple, or quadruple (or more) cautery wand, as he desires.
Et si innuit dolorem esse sub genu uersus crus, tunc cauteriza ipsum illic cauterio uno cultellari.	And if he says that there is pain under the knee towards the leg, then cauterize him there with a single cautery wand.
Et caue tibi in omni cauterizatione tua, ut non ultimes cum cauterio ad hoc ut comburas neruum, aut arteriam magnam, et attrahas per illud super infirmum nocumentum malum, aut contractionem.	And let your cauterization in everything be so that you do not burn with the cautery the nerves, or a large artery, and do not attract harm to the sick person through it, or contraction.
Et ego quidem iam uidi unum et alium, ex eis qui cauterizauerunt supra cauillam, et ultimauerunt in cauterizatione, et inflatum est crus, donec tumor consecutus est pedem, et perforatus est totus, et corruptus est totus pes: deinde accidit solutio uentris, et mors post illud.	And I have already seen one and another who cauterized on the shin bone and finished the cauterization and the leg was swollen until it reached the foot, and all of it was corroded and corrupted: then the solution of the water came, and death after that.
Quod si dolor est in duabus partibus simul, cauteriza utramque secundum hunc modum.	That if there is pain on both sides at the same time, cauterize each one according to this method.
Et sapientes quidam dixerunt in cauterizatione anchae, cuius cauterii iste est modus.	And some wise men have said in cauterization of the anchos, whose cautery is this mode.
Fac simile samio ex ferro, cuius diametrus sit medietas palmi: et sit apud orificium suum secundum grossitudinem nuclei dactyli, aut minus parumper: et intra illud samium sit samium tertium.	Make a replica of the iron rod whose diameter is half a palm: and let it be at the opening according to the thickness of the finger nail, or a little less: and let there be in it a third replica.
Et sit spacium quod est inter omne samium per quantitatem nodi pollicis: et sint samia aperta a duabus partibus: et sit altitudo eorum quasi nodus, aut duo nodi: et fac eis manubrium ex ferro decenter aptatum in samiis.	And let there be a space between each replica according to the quantity of the nail of the thumb: and let there be replicas on both sides: and let their height be almost like a knot, or two knots: and let them make handles of iron out of line with the replicas.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is his shape.
Deinde igniatur in igne, donec rubeat, et proiiciat scintillas: deinde ponatur super pixidem anchae infirmo accubitato super latus sanum.	Then it is to be burned in fire until it turns red and sparks are produced; then it is to be placed on a plaster of anointment, with the sick person lying down on the sound side.
Cauteriza ergo eum tribus cauteriis rotundis in uice una.	So he is to be cauterized with three round cauterizations in one stream.
Deinde dimitte ipsum tribus diebus.	Then let him be left for three days.
Postea emplastra cum butyro: et dimitte uulnus apertum diebus multis.	Then cover it with butter, and let the hole be left open for many days.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then care for him with ointment until he is healed.
Inquit Albucasis, hac specie cauterii o filii, parum usi sumus, propter terrorem aspectus eius: et propterea, quod paucos inuenimus qui expectent super ipsum.	Says Albucasis, with this species of cauterization on the son, we are somewhat afraid, because of the look of it: and therefore, because there are few who wait for him over the wound.
Verumtamen est ex bonis cauteriis ei qui suffert, et inuenit cum eo locum eius.	However, it is a good thing for the patient, and he remains with his place.
Cauterium autem cum medicinis adurentibus est, ut tu facias duo samia habentia perforatam armillam, in quam descendit cardo portae eius ex aere, aut ferro, longitudo parietis: quorum in altitudinem eorum sint duo nodi, aut quasi ipsi.	But the cauterium is with doctors who burn it, so that you make two loops of twine, into which falls the pin of his door from brass or iron, the length of the walls: of which there are two knots, or almost the same.
Et sit spacium quod est inter utraque quantitas grossitudinis digiti, et sint aperta inferius et superius: et sit quod contineant se adinuicem, secundum hanc formam.	And let there be space that is between each amount of the thickness of a finger, and let them be open below and above: and let it contain itself facing forward, according to this form.
Deinde depone eam super pixidem anchae, infirmo iacente super latus sanum.	Then place it on a plaster of anointment, with the sick person lying down on the sound side.
Et comprime manum tuam super pixidem anchae multum.	And compress your hand heavily over the plaster of anointment.
Deinde funde inter duos circulos ex aqua calida, quae sit calefacta cum igne parumper, et tene eam quantitate horae temporalis: et toleret infirmus mordicationem eius, et ipsius adustionem, nam ipse inuenit mordicationem sicut ignis, donec quiescat mordicatio.	Then pour between two circles of hot water, which is slightly heated with fire, and hold it for a time: and let the sick person feel the tingling, and his own burning, because he feels the tingling as if it were fire, until he is calm.
Deinde eleua manum tuam cum instrumento, et absterge aquam calidam ab ancha tota cum aqua dulci: deinde dimitte illud tribus diebus.	Then wash your hand with an instrument, and rinse it thoroughly with hot water and sweet water: then let it be left for three days.
Et pone super illud butyrum, donec remoueatur nigredo adustionis: et dimitte illud diebus aliquot, et curret ex eo pus.	And place butter on it, until the blackening of the burning is removed; and let it be left for a few days, and let pus flow out of it.
Est enim ultimum in iuuamento.	It is indeed the last resort in treatment.
Deinde cura illud cum unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then that care with the ointment, until it heals.
Quod si extendatur dolor usque ad coxam, aut crus: fac ei statuam in eo quod continet aquam, secundum quod fecisti in ancha aequaliter.	If the pain extends to the hip or leg, then make him lie in that position where he can contain water, as you did in the ankle equalize it.
Et iste est modus aquae calidae: et ego iam scripsi eam in tractatu rectificationis medicinarum.	And this is the method of warm water: and I have already written it in the book on rectifying medicines.
Sume alcali, et calcis non extinctae amborum ana partem unam: tere utraque, et pone ea in ollam nouam, cuius inferior pars sit perforata foramine uno paruo, secundum quantitatem quod ingrediatur ipsum radius: et pone sub fundo ollae ollam aliam uitreatam: et proiice super alcali et calcem ex aqua dulci, quod submergat utraque per digitum: post quam tu comprimas ea manu tua compressione bona: et dimite ollam, donec descendat aqua acuta inferiori parte ollae uitreatae.	Take alkaline and burned lime on both sides one part: wash them both, and put them in a new bowl, whose lower part is pierced with a small hole, according to the quantity that it ingests itself; and put under the bottom of the bowl another washed out: and pour over the alkaline and lime with water, which submerges both through the finger: then you compress them with your hand by good compression: and remove the bowl, until the sharp water descends on the lower part of the bowl uitreatae.
Deinde aggrega illam aquam totam, et proiice eam super aliam calcem: et cola, donec renouetur.	Then gather together all the water, and pour it over another lime: and wipe off, until it renews itself.
Ipsa enim erit tunc fortis acuitatis ualde, quae administratur in multis operationibus medicinae, et in cauterizatione reliquorum membrorum.	It will then be very strong sharp, which is administered in many operations of medicine, and in the cauterizing of the remaining members.
Quoniam efficit operationem ignis ipsius.	Since it does the work of fire itself.
Et ex medicinis sunt, cum quibus cauterizantur ancha, etiam sicut tesisie, et mel anacardi, et calx cum sapone, ita quod utraque sint permixta. ¶	And from medicines there are, with which they cauterize the ankle, also like theriaca, and honey of the acorn, and lime with soap, so that both are mixed.
Et Galenus quidem narrando retulit, cuiusdam uiri ex antiquis curationem, qua curatus est dolor anchae et uenae sciaticae: et magnificauit esse eius ualde.	And Galen himself also reported, of a man from ancient curing, which he was cured of pain in the ankle and sciatic leg: and he made it very clear.
Et dixit, quia non indiguit alia curatione, et quia sanatus est ex uice una, donec retulit, quia ipse fortasse intrauit balneum delatus, et exiuit ex eo iam sanus.	And he said, "I do not like another cure, and I was cured of the one limb, until he reported, that perhaps he entered a hot bath, and came out from it already healthy.
Et est, ut accipiatur ex seitaragi uiridi: et si non inuenitur uiride, sumatur siccum, recens: et teratur multum cum aliquanto adipe, et ponatur super ancham, ubi est dolor, aut crus, aut in coxa: et ligetur, et dimittatur quantitate trium horarum, aut per quantitatem quod sentiat infirmus sedationem adustionis.	And it is, so that it is accepted from the seer of men: and if it is not found a man, let it be taken thus, fresh: and it is fatted somewhat, and let it be placed on the ankle, where the pain is, or leg, or hip: and bind it, and leave it by quantity of three hours, or per quantity that he feels the sick person's sedativeness.
Deinde intromitte eum in balneum.	Then introduce him into the bath.
Cum ergo roridum fit corpus eius, intromitte ipsum in solium.	When his body therefore becomes hot, introduce him into the sweat-bath.
Nam dolor recedit, et sanatur.	For the pain has ceased, and he is healed.
Et scias, quia non oportet ut utatur aliquis cauterio cum istis medicinis, nisi post euacuationem corporis.	And you should know that it is not appropriate to use any ointment with these medicines unless after evacuation of the body.
Et Dioscorides qui dem dixit, quod stercus caprarum, quando cum eo cauterizatur uena sciatica, confert ei: et fit cauterium secundum hunc modum.	And Dioscurides, who said that when he was cauterized with sheep dung, his sciatica got better: and it is a cauterization according to this way.
Sumatur lana, et imbibatur oleo antiquo, et ponatur super locum profundum, qui est inter pollicem pedis, et inter focile, et est propinquior focili.	Let the wool be boiled and soaked in old oil, and let it be placed on a deep place which is between the thumb of the foot, and between the fire, and it is closer to the fire.
Deinde accipe stercus caprarum siccum, et inflamma ipsum in igne, donec fiat carbo.	Then take sheep dung as it is, and set it on fire in the fire until it becomes a coals.
Deinde pone ipsum super lanam, et dimitte ipsum, donec extinguatur.	Then place him on the wool, and leave him, until it is extinguished.
Deinde itera illud.	Then repeat that.
Non cesses ergo facere illud, usquequo perueniat sensus super mediatione usque ad ancham, et quiescat dolor.	Therefore do not cease to do that, until the sense has recovered by way of moderation up to the ankle, and the pain has ceased.
Et iste modus cauterii nominatur cauterium Vaccinum.	And this mode of cauterization is called Vaccine cauterization.
¶ De cauterizatione doloris Dorsi.	§ On the cauterization of dorsal pain.
Caput XLIIII.	Head 44.
Quandoque accidit dolor in Dorso ex caussis multis, aut a casu, aut a percussione, aut euacuatione superflua, et illis similibus, ex infusione materiei frigidae, et humidae: et cauterium quidem non cadit, nisi in hac specie sola, quae fit ex infusione materiei frigidae.	When pain occurs in the back from various causes, or from injury, or from excessive evaporation, and similar things, from the infusion of cold material, and oil: and cauterization does not fall, except in this single form alone, which is made from the infusion of cold material.
Oportet ergo post euacuationem infirmi cum pillulis foetidis, et eis similibus, ut fiant super Dorsum, ubi est dolor, tres lineae secundum latitudinem almeidati ipsius, postquam signas cum encaustro in omni linea quinque cauteria, aut plura secundum quantitatem quae uenit ex tolerantia infirmi uirtute eius: et fiat cauterizatio cum cauteriopuncti.	Therefore after the evaporation of the nurse with foetid pills, and similar things, let them be placed on the back where there is pain, three lines according to the length of the spine itself, after he has shown signs of a caustic in each line, five cauterizations, or more according to the quantity that comes from the tolerance of the nurse's virtue: and let it be made a cauterization with the cautery-pinch.
Et si uis, cauteriza tribus cauteriis, aut quatuor, cum cauterio clauili mediali, secundum hanc formam.	And if you wish, cauterize three cauterizations, or four, with the middle one closed off, according to this form.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in incaeptine Gibbositatis.	To cauterize in a caesarian section.
Caput XLV.	Head XXXV.
Multotiens accidit haec aegritudo infantibus paruis.	This disease often occurs in small infants.
Et signum incaeptionis eius in pueris est: quod accidit super eum strictura in anhelitu apud eleuationem, et motum: et inuenis in ultima spondilium Dorsi et nodorum eius, quod iam incaepit eminere super reliquos spondiles.	And the sign of this disease in small children is that it comes on suddenly during an enema and a movement: and there is inflammation at the very last vertebrae of the spine and its ligaments, which has already begun to spread over the rest of the vertebrae.
Cum ergo uides illud, et uis facere illud, tunc cauteriza ipsum cum cauterio quod sit circulus secundum hanc formam.	When you see this, and when you want to do this, then cauterize it with a cautery that is in the form of a circle.
Et capiat cauterium super omnem partem spondilis aequaliter: et si uis cauteriza in circumitu spondilis cum cauterio puncti duas lineas, aut tres: et sint puncta propinqua adinuicem.	And he should take the cautery over all parts of the spine equally: and if you want to cauterize around the spine with a pointy cautery, two lines, or three: and the points should be close together.
Deinde cura locum, donec sanetur cum eo quod diximus.	Then take care of the place, until it is healed with this that I have said.
Et caue, ne administres cauterium in gibbositate, quae fit in spasmo nerui.	And do not administer a cautery on the gibbosity, which is made in a spasm of a nerve.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Podagra, et doloribus iuncturarum.	The way to cauterize in podagra, and for the pain of joint injuries.
Caput XLVI.	Head XLV.
Quando dolores iuncturarum sunt ab humiditatibus frigidis, quae effunduntur ad cuiuslibet membra corporis, tunc quando accidunt dolores in pedibus, de consuetudine medicorum est, ut nominent illud Podagram proprie.	When the pains of joint injuries are from cold fluids that are spilled on any member of the body, then when pains occur in the feet, it is customary for doctors to call this disease by its own name - Podagra.
Cum ergo curatur Podagra frigidae caussae cum modis curationis, et non remouentur dolores, tune cauterium remouet eos.	When Podagra of cold cause is cured with methods of cure, and do not remove the pains, then remove them with a cautery.
Et est, ut cauterizes eum post euacuationem in circumitu iuncturae pedum, cauteriis multis: et sit cauterium Oliuare.	And it is, so that it is cauterized after an enema around the joint of the feet, with many cauteries: and let the cautery be Olus.
Cuius haec est forma.	Whose this form.
Et si indiges ut punctes super faciem pedis, tunc fac cum cauterio puncti.	And if you are able to endure so that you prick the face of the foot, then do it with a pointy cautery.
Quod si ascendunt dolores usque ad genua, aut reliquas iuncturas, et multotiens accidit illud, tunc cauteriza ipsum super omne genu tribus cauteriis, aut quatuor ab omni parte, cum hoc eodem cauterio Clauili.	That if the pains ascend up to the knees, or other joints, and this often happens, then cauterize it over all the knees with three cauteries, or four from all parts, with this same cautery of Clavius.
Si autem necessaria sunt tibi plura hoc cauterio, tunc cauteriza ipsum.	If, however, you need many such poultices, then cauterize him himself.
Et non submergas manum tuam cum cauterio, imo sit circiter spissitudinem cutis tantum.	And do not submerge your hand with the cautery, but keep it wet only around the skin's surface.
Si autem ascendunt dolores ad genua, et dorsum: tunc administra quod diximus ex cauterio in capitulo suo.	If, however, the pains rise up to the knees and back: then administer what we have said above from the cautery in its chapter.
Quod si dolores sunt in manibus tantum, tunc puncta in circumitu focilium, sicut reuoluuntur duae lineae.	That if the pains are only in the hands, then pierce around the joints, as two lines resolve.
Si autem remanet ex doloribus in digitis, tunc puncta eos, super omnem nodum punctum, et super pectinem manus.	If, however, any remaining pain remains in the fingers, then pierce them, over every knuckle a point, and over the palm of the hand.
Si autem ascendunt dolores post dies ad cubitos, aut ad humeros, tunc cauteriza utrosque ab omni parte.	If, however, the pains rise up after days to the elbows, or to the shoulders, then cauterize both of them from all sides.
Et non euacues infirmum ex regimine bono, ex recaeptione medicinarum.	And do not make the sick person lose strength with good regime, with taking in medicines.
Nam si bonum fiat regimen, et euacuetur phlegma, sanabitur auxilio Dei cum isto cauterio.	For if good regime makes one well, and the phlegm is expelled, he will be healed by God's help with this cautery.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Rupturis.	On the mode of cauterizing in ruptures.
Caput XLVII.	Chapter LVII.
Quando accidit Ruptura in inguinibus, et descendit intestinum, aut zirbum ad testiculum, et est illud incipiens propinquum: tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmo dimittere comestionem in die suo.	When a rupture occurs in the groin, and the intestine goes down, or touches the testicle, and it begins to spread near: then you should order the sick person to give up food on his own day.
Et utatur ex lenientibus, quo descendat stercus a uentre suo.	And so that he urinates with indulgence, so that the filth goes out from his own bowels.
Deinde sedeat inter manus tuas super dorsum suum: et praecipe ei, ut teneat anhelitum suum, donec egrediatur, uel appareat zirbum, aut intestinum.	Then make him sit between your hands on his back: and order him to hold his breath until he walks out, or shows the testicle, or the intestine.
Deinde reduc ipsum digitis tuis, et signa cum encaustro sub Ruptura super os pectinis, cum signo cuius extremitas sit similis medietati circuli ad superiora corporis.	Then reduce the person with your fingers, and mark him with the cautery below a rupture on the edge of the pelvis, with a sign whose end is similar to half a circle towards the top of the body.
Deinde igni cauterium, cuius haec est forma, donec ueniat album, et proiiciat seintillas.	Then light the cautery fire, which has this shape, until it becomes white, and drops sparks.
Deinde reduc intestinum, aut zirbum ad concauitatem suam.	Then reduce the intestine, or the testicle to its concavity.
Deinde ponat minister manum suam super locum, ut non exeat intestinum: et tu iam aperuisti inter crura infirmi, et posuisti sub eo puluinar, et seruiens alius super crura eius, et alius super pectus eius qui tenet manus.	Then let the attendant place his hand over the site so that it does not leave the gut: and you have already opened between the ribs of the patient, and placed beneath him a towel, and one servant standing over his ribs, and another over his chest which holds the hands.
Deinde depone cauterium super ipsum signum, manu tua cum cauterio stante recta.	Then place the cautery on the spot, with your hand holding the cautery steady.
Et tene ipsum, donec cum eo consequaris os: aut itera cum eo uice alia, si non consecutus fueris cum eo in prima usque ad os.	And hold him, until you are satisfied that he has come together with him to the mouth: or else repeat with him another blow, if you do not succeed with him in the first place up to the mouth.
Et prudenter obserua ab exitu intestini in hora cauterizationis tuae, ne comburas ipsum, et eueniat per illud super infirmum aut mors, aut malicia magna.	And carefully observe that the exit of the gut does not take place at the time of your cauterization, so that you do not burn him and he goes through it to a bad end or great disease.
Et scias, quod quando tu non consequeris cum cauterio os, non confert operatio tua.	And know that when you do not succeed with the cautery in closing the mouth, your operation is of no avail.
Et oportet ut sit cauterium infantium subtile, secundum mensuram eorum.	And it is necessary that the cautery be fine for infants, according to their measure.
Deinde cura cum reliquis unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then take care with the rest of the ointment, until it heals over.
Et sit infirmus iacens super dorsum suum quadraginta diebus, donec sigilletur uulnus.	And let the sick man lie on his back for forty days, until the wound is closed up.
Et oportet, ut ponas nutrimentum eius longitudine temporis curationis eius, quod leniat uentrem eius: ut non exeat intestinum apud conamen et egestionem.	And let him take food of a length of time corresponding to the duration of his cure, which softens his stomach: so that he does not lose the gut by straining and vomit.
Deinde quando uult surgere post quadraginta dies, tunc administra ligamentum decenter factum, et teneat ipsum quadraginta diebus aliis.	And when he is ready to rise after forty days, then administer a loose ligature, and let him hold it for another forty days.
Et minoretur a labore, et repletione cibi et potus, et uocibus uehementibus.	Let him rest from labor, and from filling himself with food and drink, and from loud speeches.
Nam quando utitur hoc regimine, ita sanatur sanatione integra.	For when he uses this regimen, he heals with an intact cure.
Et ego dicam curationem Rupturarum cum incisione in capitulo suo.	And I will speak of the cure of ruptures with an incision in its chapter.
Quando autem Rupturae accidunt in reliquo uentre, et sunt incipientes, et uis ut non addantur, tunc cauteriza Rupturam eius cauterio rotundo secundum quantitatem eius: et sit illud quod aduritur ex tunc sicut tertia eius.	But when ruptures occur in the remaining belly, and are beginning to form, and do not want to join together, then cauterize his rupture with round cautery according to its quantity: and let it be as if it had been burned from that time on like the third one.
Deinde cura ipsum, cum eo quod diximus: et non addetur.	Then the care for himself, as we have said: and let him not be drawn away.
Et iam dixerunt quidam primi: ut cauterizetur Ruptura cum cauterio triangulato, secundum hanc formam.	And some had first said: that it might be cauterized with the triangle-shaped cauldron, according to this form.
Postquam signatur cum encaustro, et ponitur linea quae est per latitudinem in latere superiori Rupturae, et linea altera ad inferius.	Afterwards sign it with pitch, and put a line which is along the width in the posterior upper part of the wound, and another line downwardly.
Et depone manum tuam in medio cum cauterio clauili.	And place your hand in the middle with the cauldron of the claw.
Sed cauterium primum est facilius et melius.	But the first cautery is easier and better.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in doloribus propter casum, aut percussionem.	In the method of cauterizing in pains due to a fall, or to a blow.
Caput XLVIII.	Chaps 58.
Quando accidit in quibusdam membris a casu, aut percussione dolor: et perseuerat ille dolor tempore longo, et non confert in eo curatio cum medicinis: tunc oportet ut cauterizetur cum cauterio Puncti.	When it has happened in some member by a fall, or a blow: and that pain persiste for a long time, and does not respond to treatment with medicines: then it should be cauterized with the cauldron of the point.
Et sit cauterium omnis membri cauterium secundum magnitudinem eius, et ipsius paruitatem, et debilitatem eius, et ipsius uirtutem, et locationem torsionis, et doloris ex eo.	And let there be a cauldron for each member according to its size, and its strength, and its weakness, and its virtue, and its position of twist, and its pain from it.
Si ergo sanatur ex cauterio primo, est bene.	But if he is healed by the first cautery, it is good.
Si non: tunc itera super ipsum cauterium.	If not: then repeat over himself the cautery.
Quoniam de consuetudine horum dolorum est, ut permutentur ex membro ad illud quod appropinquat ei.	For from the custom of these pains is that they change from one member to that which approaches it.
Quare oportet ut consequaris eos cum cauterio, donec sanetur infirmus.	Why it should be necessary that they should be removed by the cauldron, until the sick is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Lepra.	In the method of cauterizing in lepers.
Caput XLIX.	Chaps 59.
Leprosi autem quandoque iuuantur cauterio iuuamento maximo.	But lepers, and when they live by the cauldron with a strong motion.
Et praecipue species Leprae, quae fit propter putrefactionem phlegmatis et melancholiae: cum ergo uis cauterizare ipsam considera.	And especially the species of lepra, which is due to putrefaction of phlegmas and melancholy: so that when you are cauterizing it, consider well the wound.
Si ergo Lepra est ineipiciens, et curasti eam cum eo, quod diximus in diuisione, et non descendit, neque stat: et times super infirmum, quod comprehendat corruptio super totam complexionem eius: tunc cauteriza eum super caput quinque cauteriis: uno in medio capitis noto, et secundo inferius eo uersus frontem apud finem capillorum, et duobus super duo cornua, et uno posterius super nucea ceruicis.	But if lepra is incipient and you have treated it with the cauldron that we have said in division, and it has not descended, nor has remained still: and you have waited for the sick person, so that corruption encompasses all his body: then cauterize him over his head with five cauldrons: one in the middle of the hairline, and a second below it facing forward at the end of the hair, and two above two horns, and one behind the ear.
Et ultima manum tuam cum cauterio parumper, donec imprimat in os impressionem paruam, et dislocentur ex eo cortices: ut alleuietur expiratio uaporum grossorum ex eo, et cauteriza cauterio etiam super ipsum splenem, secundum quod praecessit.	And last with your hand a little while, until the impression impresses the lung with a sore one, and the membranes are dislocated from it; so that the breathing of the vaporous gas is eased out of it, and cauterization also to the splen with regard to what preceded.
Sin autem Lepra iam sparsa est super infirmum, et apparet manifeste: tunc oportet ut cauterizes cum istis cauteriis, quae diximus in capite, et cauterio super extremitatem nasi, et duobus cauteriis super duas maxillas, et duobus cauteriis super spondiles colli, et sex super spondiles dorsi, et uno magno super alhahosos apud gran caudae et uno supra ipsum, in ipso almeidati: et duobus super anchas: scilicet super omnem ancham uno, et duobus super genua: uno super omne genu, et duobus super humeros, et duobus super cubitos, et duobus super teneritudines pectoris sui: et cauteriza ipsum super omnem iuncturam, ex iuncturis digitorum manuum suarum, et pedum suorum: et cauteriza super omnem calcaneum pedum suorum, et focilia manuum suarum.	But if the leprosy is already spread over the sick one and appears clearly: then it is necessary that you cauterize with these cauterizations which we have said in the beginning of the book, and a cauterization on the tip of the nose, and two cauterizations on the two cheeks, and two cauterizations on the two sides of the neck, and six on the back bones, and one large one on the muscles near the tail-end and one above it, in which he is bound up: and two on the shoulders: namely, one on every shoulder, and two on the elbows, and two on the two humerus, and two on the two breasts, and one cauterization on the whole chest, from the joints of the fingers of his hands and feet: and a cauterization on each heel of his feet, and on the knuckles of his hands.
Et caue tibi a neruis qui sunt super postremum calcanei, ut non comburas eos.	And let there be a nerve to you that are over the last heel, so that you do not burn them.
Et quandoque cauterizatur cauterio super os pectinis, et alio super os stomachi, et alio super epar.	And when one is cauterized with a caesarian section on the jawbone, and with another on the stomach, and with another on the liver.
Et scias, quod quanto plus addis cauterium, est magis iuuamentum, et magis conferens.	And know that the more you add cauterization, it is a greater remedy, and gives more relief.
Et scias, quod infirmus non inuenit in cauterio dolorem, sicut inueniunt ipsum sani: propterea, quod corpus eius iam stupefactum est.	And know that the sick one does not find any pain in the cauterization, as he finds it when he is healthy: for his body has already been stunned.
Et oportet ut sint cauteria ex magnitudine, et paruitate secundum membra et iuncturas: secundum quod praecessit ex speciebus ferramentorum.	And let the cauterizations be of a size, and of a shape according to the limbs and joints: according to what preceded from the appearance of tools.
Deinde cura cauterium ex farina herbi cum melle, et reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then take care for the cauterizations with wheat flour of herbs with honey, and with the other cure, until it is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Stupore.	To cauterize when stupor occurs.
Caput L.	Head L.
Quando stupet aliquod membrum, et curatur cum medicinis, et oleis, et emplastris, et non sanatur, tunc cauteriza ipsum membrum stupefactum cauteriis, secundum quod meretur magnitudo membri, aut paruitas eius.	When a limb is stuporized and does not heal with medicines, oils, plasters, or bandages, then cauterize the limb with cautery, according to whether the magnitude of the limb is increased or decreased.
Et sit cauterium tuum intrans in spissitudinem cutis parumper.	And place your cautery instrument slightly into the thickness of the skin.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then care for the limb with ointment until it heals.
Et quandoque cauterizatur ad quiddam stuporis, qui accidit manui, et pedi, in spondilibus dorsi apud exitum neruorum, qui mouent illud membrum: et remouetur stupor.	And sometimes cauterization occurs at some stupor that happens to the hand or foot in the spine of the back near the exit of nerves that move that limb: and the stupor is removed.
Verum non praesumat super illud, nisi qui est sapiens in anatomia membrorum, et egressione neruorum mouentium corpus.	But it does not presume on that, unless one is wise in anatomy of members, and the exit of nerves that move the body.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Albaras.	The method for cauterizing in Albucasis.
Caput LI.	Head L.
Quando antiquatur Albaras, et non confert in eo aliquid ex ingeniis medicinae: tunc cauteriza super ipsam cauterio profundo parumper, secundum quantitatem spissitudinis cutis, donec remoueatur albedo, et mutetur color eius.	When Albucasis is burned and does not show any of the tricks of medicine in it: then cauterize over it with a deep cautery instrument slightly, according to the thickness of the skin, until the hue changes and the color of it alters.
Deinde cura ipsum cum farina herbi, et lentis cum oleo rosa, et foliis arnoglossae, et sanguine columbae, et sanguine hyrundinis: de unoquoque sit pars una: misceantur haec omnia, et liniantur super pannum, et adhaereant loco, donec sanetur.	Then care for the limb with herb flour, and rose oil with lentil seeds, and leaves of mullein, and pigeon's blood, and hen's blood: make one part of each: all these things are mixed together, and spread on a cloth, and adhere to the place until it heals.

Quando Cancer est incipiens, et uis ipsum sistere: tunc cauteriza ipsum cum cauterio circuli in circuitu eius, sicuti reuoluitur.	When Cancer is beginning, and the blood should be stopped in it: then cauterize the limb with a circular cautery instrument, as it turns around itself.
Sapientes autem dixerunt, ut cauterizetur cauterio ultimo in medio.	But the wise have said, "Let the last cautery instrument be used in the middle.
Mihi autem non uidetur illud: quoniam timeo quod ulceretur: et ego iam uidi illud aliquotiens.	But I do not know that: because I fear it will ulcerate: and I have seen it sometimes.
Et rectius est, ut cauterizetur in circumitu eius cum circulo, sicut diximus: aut cauteriis multis.	And it is better that the cautery should be used around it with a circle, as we have said: or with many cauteries.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Adubelati.	To cauterize in abdomens.
Caput LIII.	Chapter LIII.
Quando aliquis habet Adubelati, et tardatur in maturatione, aut propter superfluitatem facientem eam, aut propter aetatem infirmi, quando est decrepitus pauci sanguinis, aut propter tempus, et uis festinare in maturatione Adubelati, tunc cauteriza in circumitu eius cum cauteriis paruis multis punctando.	When anyone has an abdomina and it is delayed in maturation or because it is causing unnecessary suffering or because of old age and there is little blood there, or for time and the quickness of the abdomina's maturation, then cauterize around it with small cautery points while puncturing.
Deinde dimitte eam.	Then let go of it.
Nam ipsa festinabit cum maturatione.	For she will quickly mature.
Si autem uis perforationem eius cum cauterio, tunc igni cauterium, cuius haec est forma.	But if you want to pierce her with a needle and apply cautery, then this is its form:
Et depone ipsum in medio Adubelati, donec penetret cutem: et sit cauterium ab eo quod sequitur infirmus, ut alleuietur cursus puris.	And lay the needle down in the middle of the abdomina until it penetrates the skin: and place the cautery from it so that it follows a slow course, so that it eases the flow of blood.
Deinde cura ipsum donec sanetur.	Then take care of the wound until it heals.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in malo corrodente.	The method for cauterizing a corrupted malady.
Caput LIIII.	Chapter LIII.
Corrodens non est nisi corruptio in membro ambulans, et corrodit ipsum: sicut ignis comedit ligna sicca.	A corrupted member does not burn except in a walking part, and it corrupts itself: just as fire eats dry wood.
Si ergo uides corrodentem in loco qui toleret cauterium cum igne, tunc igni cauteria multa, clauilia parua et magna, secundum quod conueniet illi loco in quo est corrodens.	But if you see a corrupted place that accepts the cautery with fire, then large cautery points, small claws and great ones, according to what suits it in the place where the corruption is.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum ab omni parte donec eradices corruptionem totam, et non remaneat ex ea aliquid penitus.	Then cauterize the member from all parts until you have eradicated the whole corruption, and leave nothing of it within.
Deinde dimitte ipsum tribus diebus, et pone super loca cauterizata sulphur tritum cum oleo, donec eradicentur escharae omnes, et omnis corruptio.	Then let go of the member for three days, and place sulfur, crushed with oil, over the cauterized places so that all the scabs are removed, and all corruption is eradicated.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguentis generantibus carnem.	Then take care of the wound with an ointment-generating flesh.
Si ergo uides, quod post tres dies caro nascitur natiuitate sana, in qua non est corruptio, est bonum.	But if you see that after three days a healthy birth takes place in which there is no corruption, it is good.
Et si non: tunc itera cauterium super illud quod remansit ex locis corruptis.	And if not: then repeatedly cauterize the one that remained from the corrupted places.
Et corrodens medicatur quandoque cum medicina acuta.	And the corrupted member is sometimes treated with acute medicine.
Ipsa namque surgit loco cauterii.	It rises up by itself in the place of cauterization.
Verumtamen cauterium cum igne est uelocioris iuuamenti: et ego quidem iam dixi cauterizationem eius cum medicina acuta in diuisione: accipe ergo eam illic quando ea indiges.	Indeed, when the wound is burned with fire, and I have already said that the application of acute medicine to the division is a form of cauterization, so take it there when it is no longer hot.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Clauis, et Verucis.	The way to cauterize a wound in a claw and a wart.
Caput LV.	Chapter 50.
Multotiens accidit in inferioribus partibus pedum haec aegritudo: et est res grossa, filtrata, quae laedit pedem.	This disease often occurs in the lower parts of the feet, and is a stubborn, filthy trouble that afflicts the foot.
Et cauterium quidem in eis est secundum duos modos: cauterium cum igne, et cauterium cum aqua calida.	And there are two methods of applying the cautery: with fire, and with warm water.
Quantum autem cum igne est, ut ignias cauterium concauum simile pennae uulturis: quod fiat ex ferro, secundum quantitatem quod contineat clauum ab omni parte: et sit subtilium marginum.	How much, then, is it like the fire of the plucking-knife, which is a kind of cautery: let it be made of iron, according to the quantity that contains the claw from all sides: and let the edge be sharp.
Deinde depone ipsum ignitum super clauum.	Then place the burned thing on the claw.
Deinde reuolue manum cum cauterio in circumitu claui, donec perueniat cauterium ad profunditatem claui: et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus, donec incipiat emittere pus.	Then turn the hand with the cautery around the claw, until the cautery reaches the depth of the claw: and leave it for three days, until pus begins to drain.
Deinde emplastra ipsum cum maluis syluestribus, contritis cum sale: et dimitte emplastrum super ipsum in nocte.	Then bind the thing with coarse strips of silk, crushed up with salt: and leave the plaster on the wound at night.
Ipse enim eradicabitur ex radicibus suis.	For it will be eradicated from its roots.
Deinde cura locum unguento generatiuo carnis, donec sanetur.	Then care for the place with a soft ointment of meat, until it heals over.
Quod si sunt non conuersi, et multotiens accidunt in superficie corporis, praecipue in manibus et pedibus: tunc administres in eis cauterium cum aqua calida: et est, ut accipias cannulam ex aere, aut ferro, aut ex penna uulturis: et depone eam super clauum, aut althelul.	If they are not turned inside out, and often occur on the surface of the body, especially in the hands and feet: then apply to them warm water; and there is, as you may get a tube made of brass, iron, or a feather: and place it on the claw, or a nail.
Deinde proiice in cannulam ex aqua calida quantitatem paucam: retine manum tuam, et tu reuolue eam cum compressione manus tuae parumper, ut imprimatur margo cannulae in radice claui, et inueniat aqua calida uiam ad profundum, ad radicem claui: et expectet infirmus parumper super mordicationem aquae calidae hora una.	Then throw into the tube a little warm water: hold your hand on it, and turn it around with your hand a little, so that the edge of the tube is pressed into the root of the claw, and there is some warm water coming to the surface: and let it rest for a while on the prickling of the warm water.
Deinde dimitte ipsum, nam clauus eradicatur cum radicibus suis.	Then let go of him, for the nail is removed with its roots.
Ita fac cum eis uno post unum, donec uenias super omnes qui ex eis sunt in corpore.	So do one at a time after another until you have done all that are in the body.
Deinde cura eos postquam eradicantur, cum eo quod generat carnem ex unguentis.	Then take care of them after they have been cut off, with that which generates flesh from the ointment.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Tremore.	The method for cauterizing while trembling.
Caput LVI.	Chapter LVI.
Quando accidit alicui Tremor ex frigore in neruo, aut ex febre quartana, aut alio: tunc oportet ut cauterizes ipsum quatuor cauteriis, aut quinque super spondiles dorsi, et inter omnem spondilem cauterio, et in pectore eius cauterio, et super stomachum eius cauterio.	When it happens to anyone that there is a tremor due to cold in a nerve, or from a quartan fever, or from any other cause: then it is necessary to cauterize the person with four cauterizations, or five on the spine at the back, and between every spinal bone one cauterization, and one within the belly, and one above the stomach.
Tremor enim quiescit cum cauterio oliuari, et festinat sanitas aegritudinis frigidae.	For the tremor is calmed by the oil-cauterization, and the health of the disease of cold is accelerated.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Albathir.	The method for cauterizing with albescent (white) unguent.
Caput LVII.	Chapter LVII.
Quandoque expelluntur in corpore Albathir foedae, id est, pustulae, quae fiunt a materiis grossis corruptis.	When white (corrosive) pus is expelled from the body, that is to say, pustules which are formed from corrupted moist (materials).
Oportet ergo in primis cum apparent, ut cauterizentur super omne caput pustulae cauterio subtili cum ligno myrti, cuius extremitas accensa est cum igne.	Then it is necessary to cauterize first when they appear, with a fine cauldron of myrrh set on fire, whose tip is heated with fire.
Aut cum radice aristolochiae longae.	Or with the root of aristochaos, which is long.
Aut cum cauterio lenticulari.	Or with a lenticular cauldron.
Et quandoque cauterizantur ademenul, in principio expulsionis suae secundum hunc modum: et non augentur: et disrumpitur superfluitas faciens eos, et sanatur ex eis.	And when they are cauterized with the cauldron, in the beginning of their expulsion according to this mode: and do not increase: and are broken up by an excess of the matter, and are cured from it.
Verumtamen oportet ut fiat illud post euacuationem cum phlebotomia.	However, it is necessary for that to be done after the evacuation with blood-letting.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in fluxu sanguins ex arteria in uulnere.	The method for cauterizing in a pulse of blood from an artery in the ulna.
Caput LVIII.	Chapter LVIII.De modo est hoc, ut caput vult
Multotiens accidit fluxus sanguinis ex arteria, quae incisa est apud uulnus, quod accidit extrinsecus, aut apud incisionem apostematis, aut cauterium membri, et similia eis: et fit difficile abscindere eum.	This is the way: so that the head will allow blood to flow when an artery is cut at the ulna, which has happened from the outside, or when there is a pustule at the site of incision, or when cauterizing a limb, and similar things: and it becomes difficult to stop the bleeding.
Cum ergo accidit alicui illud, tunc propera cum manu tua ad orificium arteriae, et pone super ipsum digitum tuum indicem: et stringe eum multum, donec obsessus sit sanguis sub digito tuo, et non egrediatur ex eo aliquid.	When then it happens to someone else, then hold the edge of the artery with your hand and place the index finger over it: and tighten it very much, until the blood is stopped under your finger, and does not come out of it anything.
Deinde pone in ignem cauteria oliuaria parua, et magna numero plura: et suffla super ea, donec fiant ignita ualde.	Then put small olive oil torches on fire, and many in number: and blow over them until they burn well.
Deinde accipe ex eis unum, aut paruum, aut magnum, secundum uulnus et locum, in quo disrupta est arteria, et depone cauterium super ipsam uenam, post quam tu remoues digitum tuum festinanter: et tene cauterium, donec abscindatur sanguis.	Then take from them one, or small, or big, according to the thickness of the forearm and the place where the artery is broken, and place the torch on it: then remove your finger quickly: and hold the torch, until the blood is cut off.
Quod si expellatur cum eleuas digitum ab orificio arteriae, et extinguis cauterium, tunc accipe cauterium aliud festinanter, ex cauteriis quae in igne sunt praeparata.	That if it is expelled when you take your finger away from the opening of the artery, and put out the torch, then take another torch quickly from the ones that are prepared on fire.
Non ergo cesses facere illud cum uno post aliud, donec abscindatur sanguis.	So do not stop doing this with one after another, until the blood is cut off.
Et caue, ne comburas neruum qui est illic, et accidat super infirmum malicia alia.	And beware, so that you do not burn the fire that is there, and happen to bring upon yourself other evil with it.
Et scias, quod quando ex arteria fluit sanguis, tunc non est possibile abscindere ipsum: praecipue quaudo arteria est magna, nisi cum uno quatuor modorum.	And you should know that when blood flows from an artery, then it is not possible to stop it: especially if the artery is large, unless with four fingers.
Aut cum cauterio, sicut diximus.	Or when with a torch, as we have said.
Aut cum extractione, quando non est extracta.	Or when extracting, when it has not been extracted.
Nam quando extrahitur, contrahuntur extremitates eius, et abscinditur sanguis.	For when it is extracted, its ends turn towards the outside, and the blood is cut off.
Aut ligetur cum filo ligatione forti.	Or it is bound with a strong knot of thread.
Aut ponantur super ipsum medicinae de proprietate, quarum est abscindere sanguinem, et stringatur cum puluinari constrictione decenti.	Or are placed on top of the wound by means of its nature, so that the blood is stopped and held with a decreasing constriction.
Qui autem administrat abscisionem eius cum ligamento, et strictura cum panno, aut positione rerum comburentium, et similium, non confert ei penitus, nisi raro.	But who gives it the cutting and the constricting with thread, and the placing of burning things over it, or similar things, does not give him a complete cut, unless rarely.
Si autem accidat alicui illud, et non sit ei praesens medicus, neque medicina: tunc incipiat cum positione digiti indicis super orificium uenae ipsius, sicut narrauimus, et constrictione eius ualde, donec obsessus sit sanguis a superiori parte uulneris, et super arteriam.	But if it happens to someone else and there is no present doctor or medicine: then let the index finger begin to be placed over the opening of the wound as we have narrated, and the constricting of it very much, until the blood from the upper part of the wound is stopped, and placed on the artery.
Et digitus non remoueatur, desuper ipsum cum aqua frigida uehementis frigoris semper, donec congeletur sanguis, et ingrossetur, et abscindatur.	And the finger should not be moved away, above it with cold water constantly flowing, until the blood is congealed, and thickens, and is cut off.
Et interim consideret in eo, quid indiget ex cauterio, aut ex medicina.	And in the meantime, he should consider what needs to be done with the dressing or the medicine.

Liber Chirurgici Albucasis Pars II.	The Book of Surgery of Albucasius Part II.
¶ De Incisione, Perforatione, et Phlebotomia in uulneribus, et his similibus.	On incisions, punctures, and bleeding in wounds and similar cases.
Iam Diximus in Capitulo Primo, omnem aegritudinem in qua conueniens est cum igne cauterium et medicina comburente, et occasiones eius, ipsius caussas, et instrumenta eius, et formas cauteriorum.	We have already spoken in the first chapter about all sicknesses that are suitable for burning with fire and medicine, their causes, their instruments, their forms of cauterization.
Et posui illic capitula a uertice usque ad pedem.	And I placed those chapters from the beginning to the end.
Et ego procedam in hoc capitulo illa eadem uia: ut alleuietur super quaerentem quaesitum eius.	And I will proceed in this chapter in the same way: so that it may alleviate the questioner's query.
Et antequam incipiam illud, oportet ut addiscatis o filii, quod in hoc capitulo est ex terrore illud quod est in capitulo primo de cauterizatione.	And before I begin that, you should learn from your son, that the fear is in the first chapter about cauterization.
Et propter illud oportet, ut sit cautela in eo uehementior, quoniam in operatione quae est in hoc capitulo, multotiens cadit euacuatio cum sanguine, cum quo stat uita apud apertionem uenae, aut incisionem super apostema, aut apertionem exiturae, aut curationem uulneris, aut extractionem sagittae, aut incisionem super lapidem, et illis similia: ex quibus omnibus associatur tremor, et timor, et cadit in pluribus eorum mors.	And for that, you should be cautious about it, because in the operation which is in this chapter, often there is a spillage of blood, with which life is lost at the opening of the vein, or an incision on a bruise, or an opening of an exit, or the curing of a wound, or the extraction of an arrow, or an incision on a stone, and those similar: from all of which fear is associated, and terror, and death falls.
Et ego moneo uos, ne cadat super uos illud in quo est haesitatio, nam quandoque cadunt ad uos in hac arte modi hominum cum modis infirmitatum.	And I warn you, do not fall into that, for when it falls on you, there is a hesitation, for sometimes people who are fallen in this art with the modes of sickness fall.
Ex eis enim est qui irascitur cum aegritudine sua, et est leuis apud eum mors: propter uehementiam eius quod inuenit ex infirmitate sua et longitudine eius maliciei.	For from them is one who grows angry with his illness, and he is lenient when death comes to him: because of the severity which he finds from his disease and the length of his suffering.
Et cum aegritudine est ex timore quod significat mortem.	And when sickness is born out of fear, which signifies death.
Et ex eis est, qui dat tibicensum suum, et ditat te cum eo, sperans sanitatem, et aegritudo eius est perniciosa.	And from these he gives you his own hand, and tells you to use it, hoping for health, but his sickness is harmful.
Non ergo oportet ut consentiatis ei qui uenit ad uos ex eis, cuius modus est talis.	So then it is not necessary that you agree to him who comes to you from these, whose way is such.
Et sit cautela uestra uehementior, quam cupiditas et uestra rapacitas.	And be your caution much greater than your greed and your avarice.
Et non praesumatis super aliquid ex illo, nisi post scientiam certam, quae uerificat apud uos illud ad quod peruenit successio laudabilis.	And do not presume about anything from him unless after certain knowledge that confirms with you what he achieves in succession that is worthy of praise.
Et utimini in curatione omnium infirmorum uestrorum, prognosticatione et indicatione de eo ad quod conuenienter sit salus.	And so that you may cure all your sick patients, by prediction and indication of that to which healing is appropriate.
In illo namque est uobis adiutorium super acquisitionem famae et gloriae, et memoriae et laudis.	For in him there is for you an aid in acquiring fame and glory, and memory and praise.
Inspiret uobis Deus o filii, intellectum suum, et non auferat uobis directionem et inspirationem: quoniam illud est in manu eius.	May God inspire you, O sons, with his wisdom, and may he not take away from you guidance and inspiration: for it is in his power.
Et ego quidem ordinaui hoc Capitulum distinguendo per capitula, secundum quod praecessit in capitulo Cauterii, a ceruice usque ad pedes: ut alleuietur uobis quaesitum quod uultis ex eo, et quo indigetis.	And I too have arranged this chapter by distinguishing it into chapters, according to what preceded in the Chapter of Cautery from the crown down to the toes: that you may find what you want from him, and what you need.
¶ De curatione Aquae quae aggregatur in capitibus puerorum.	Of the Cure of Water which is added to the heads of boys.
Caput I.	Chapter I.
Scias, quod haec infirmitas multotiens accidit pueris apud partum: aut quando stringit obstetrix caput pueri absque leuitate.	You should know that this illness often happens to boys at puberty: or when the midwife presses the boy's head without lightness.
Et quandeque accidit etiam ex caussa occulta quae non scitur.	And whenever it also happens for an obscure reason which is not known.
Et ego quidem non uidi hanc aegritudinem in aliis quam in pueris: et ad omnem quem ex eis uidi properauit mors: propter illud ergo uisum est mihi dimittere operationem in ea.	And I too did not see this illness in anyone but boys, and I would have liked to see all of them die because of it, so that I would leave the work of healing it.
Et ego quidem uidi ex eis puerum, cuius caput impletum erat aqua, et caput magnificabatur in omni die, donec non poterat sedere super seipsum, propter magnitudinem capitis sui: et humiditas augmentata fuit, donec mortuus est.	And I too saw a boy of those whose head was filled with water, and the head became magnificent every day until he could not sit on himself because of its size, and the moisture increased until he died.
Et haec quidem humiditas, aut aggregatur inter cutem et os: aut aggregatur sub osse super sifac.	And this moisture, or集 between the skin and bone: or集 under the bone above the socket.
Et operatio in illo, si est humiditas inter cutem et os, et apostema est paruum, tunc oportet ut findas in medio capitis fissura una in latitudine: et sit longitudo fissurae quasi duo nodi, donec currat humiditas.	And the operation in that, if there is moisture between the skin and bone, and the pus is small, then you should find a crack in the middle of the head in width: and the length of the crack is almost two knots, until the moisture runs.
Et haec est forma spatumilis.	And this is the form of the needle.
Si ergo humiditas est magis augmentata, et apostema est maius, tunc pone eas duas fissuras, secundum formam hanc.	If then the moisture is increased and the pus is larger, then place them two cracks, according to this form.
Et si humiditas est sub osse, et signum eius est, quod uides commissuras capitis apertas ab omni parte: et aqua deprimitur quando comprimis eam manu tua ad interiora, et non occultatur tibi illud: tunc oportet ut findas in medio capitis tribus fissuris, secundum hunc modum.	And if the moisture is under the bone, and the sign of it is that you see the scalp open from all sides: and when you compress it with your hand towards the inside, and it does not hide from you: then you should find in the middle of the head three cracks, according to this way.
Et post incisionem extrahe humiditatem totam.	And after the incision, remove all the moisture.
Deinde stringe fissuras cum pannis et puluillis.	Then tighten the cracks with rags and dust.
Deinde embroca illud desuper cum uino et oleo usque ad diem quintum.	Then put the wound under a pot with wine and oil until the fifth day.
Deinde solue ligamentum, et cura uulnus cum tentis, et unguentis.	Then loosen the ligaments, and care for the wound with bandages and ointments.
Et non dimittas stringere caput cum aequalitate.	And do not stop tightening the head with equality.
Et ciba infirmum omni cibo sicco paucae humiditatis, usquequo confortetur membrum, et sanetur.	And feed the sick with dry food and little moisture until they recover their strength and heal.
Et modus alius incisionis est, ut consideres ubi apparet magnitudo apostematis, et collectio aquae.	Another way of cutting is so that you take into account where the pus appears in size, and the collection of water.
Quoniam quandoque est in occipitio plus, aut in sincipite, aut in dextra, aut in sinistra.	Because when it is more in the back, or in the front, or on the right, or on the left.
Ascende ergo cum incisione ubi apparet tibi apostema et impletio aquae: et scinde illud secundum quod tibi possibile est.	So go up with the incision where it appears to you pus and filling: and cut it according to what is possible for you.
Et obserua, ne incidas arteriam, et accidat fluxus sanguinis, et moriatur infirmus ex illo fluxu cum euacuatione humiditatis.	And observe, so that you do not hit an artery, and there is a flow of blood, and the sick person dies from that flow with the evaporation of moisture.
¶ De incisione Arteriarum quae sunt post aures.	Of the Incision of Arteries that are behind the ears.
Caput II.	Head II.
Quando accidunt alicui catarri ad oculos, aut ad pectus, et antiquatur illud, et non confert curatio medicinarum: tunc magis ultima curatio est in illo, incisio harum duarum arteriarum.	When an ulcer occurs on the eye or chest and it is old and does not respond to medical treatment: then the last resort is to cut open these two arteries.
Oportet ergo quando uis incidere eas, ut radat infirmus caput suum.	It is necessary therefore when you incise them, so that the sick man may shake off his head.
Deinde frica locum cum panno aspero, ut appareant arteriae.	Then fear the place with a rough cloth, so that the arteries appear.
Deinde stringat infirmus collum suum, cum quolibet panno suo.	Then the sick man should tie his neck with any of his cloths.
Deinde considera, ubi pulset uena.	Then consider where the pulse beats.
Et loca utriusque sunt loca quae sunt post aures depressa: et raro occultatur, nisi in quibusdam hominibus.	And the places of each are those which are behind the depressed ears: and rarely is it concealed, unless in certain men.
Deinde signa cum encaustro super utraque: et incide utramque cum spatumili utrimque acuro, incisione perueniente ad os: et fiat illud per latitudinem capitis.	Then marks with caustic on each: and cut each with a needle sharply, the incision extending to the nose: and let it go round the head by its width.
Et si uis, intromitte spatumile sub arteria, et incide eam ad superiora cum incisione.	And if the eye, introduce the needle under the artery, and cut it towards the top with an incision.
Et sit longitudo incisionis quasi duo digiti iuncti.	And let the length of the incision be as two fingers joined together.
Nam quando inciditur uena, egreditur sanguis egressione pulsatili, qui salit ad interiora saltu frequenti.	For when the vein is incised, blood flows out with a pulsating movement, which ascends to the inside at regular intervals.
Si autem arteria non apparet sensui, tunc oportet ut mensures ab aure quantitatem spacii trium digitorum.	But if the artery does not appear by touch, then it is necessary that you measure from the ear the quantity of space of two fingers' breadth.
Deinde signa cum encaustro, et finde usque ad os.	Then marks with caustic, and bring to a stop at the nose.
Et illud quod oportet emittere ex sanguine, est VI uncia et fortasse emittis ex eo plus, aut minus.	And what needs to be released from blood is 6 minims, and perhaps you release more or less of it.
Totum illud secundum quantitatem quae apparet tibi ex uirute infirmi et repletione arteriae eius.	All this depends on the quantity which appears to you from the vein as it fills, and on the fullness of the artery.
Deinde considera ad uulnus.	Then consider towards the ear.
Tunc si remanet ad os ex sifac aliquid, tunc incide illud, ut non accidat apostema calidum: tunc stringe uulnus cum liciniis ex panno lini.	Then if there remains at the nose any soft stuff, then cut it so that it does not happen a boil which is hot: then tie the ear with a linen thong.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then care for yourself with ointment, until you are healed.
¶ De extractione arteriarum, quae sunt in timporibus.	Regarding the extraction of arteries, which are in the temples.
Caput III.	Chapter III.
Quando accidit homini hemicranea antiqua, aut catarri acuti propter humiditates acrimoniales, et caliditate in lacertis timporum, aut soda antiqua, uehemens, et similia illis: et medicatur cum modis curationis medicinae, et non confert illud: tunc experti sumus in his aegritudinibus extractionem arteriarum ex timporibus, aut cauterizationem earum, sicut narrauimus.	When a man has an old headache, or acute catarrh because of acrid humidities and heat in the lacertae of the temple, or old soda, bitter, and like things: and is treated with the methods of medicine, and does not admit this: then we are skilled in these diseases in extracting the arteries from the temples, or cauterizing them, as we have related.
Et modus operationis in extractione earum, est, ut radat infirmus pilos qui sunt in timporibus, et intendat ad arteriam apparentem in timpore.	And the method of operation in extracting them is this: that the sick person's hair which is in the temples be shaved, and be directed towards the appearing artery in the temple.
Ipsa namque ostenditur tibi ex pulsu suo, et raro occultatur nisi in paucis hominibus, aut uehementia frigoris.	And it itself shows you from its pulse, and seldom hides itself unless in a few men, or bitter cold.
Quod si occultatur tibi, tunc stringat infirmus caput suum cum quolibet panno suo: deinde frica locum cum panno aspero.	That if it is hidden from you, then the sick person should tie his head with any of his clothes: and then he should cover the place with a rough cloth.
Aut uapora locum cum aqua calida, donec appareat tibi apparitione manifesta.	Or with hot water, until it appears to you by a clear sign.
Deinde accipe spatumile, quod paulo ante formaui.	Then take a needle, which is slightly made in the shape of a point.
Deinde excoria cum eo cutem cum facilitate, donec peruenias ad arteriam.	Then scrape with it the skin easily, until you reach the artery.
Deinde proiice in eam uncinum, et extrahe eam ad superiora, donec extrahas eam ex cute, et facias eam euadere ex tunicis quae sunt sub ea ab omni parte.	Then put into it a hook, and extract it upwards, until you have taken it out of the skin, and make it ooze from the tunics which are under it on all sides.
Si autem arteria est subtilis: tunc inuolue eam cum extremitate uncini.	If, however, the artery is fine: then turn it with the end of the hook.
Deinde incide ex ea partem secundum quantitatem qua elongentur extremitates eius, et contrahantur, et non accidat fluxus sanguinis.	Then cut off a portion from it on the second side according to how long its ends are extended and turn them towards each other, so that blood does not flow out.
Nam si non inciditur, et si non abscinditur, non ascendit sanguis penitus.	For if it is not cut, and if it is not separated, the blood will not rise inwardly.
Deinde euacua ex sanguine ana VI unci, usque ad .III.	Then let the blood flow from it by six ounces up to three.
Quod si arteria est magna: tunc oportet ut liges eam in duobus locis ex filo duplo, forti, ex serico: aut ex chordis alhohod, ut non properet ad ipsam putrefactio ante consolidationem uulneris, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	That if the artery is large: then it should be tied to it in two places with double thread, strong and smooth: or with the tendon of a horse, so that it does not come under putrefaction before the healing of the wound, and blood flows out.
Deinde incide superfluitatem, quae est inter duo ligamenta.	Then cut off the superfluous flesh, which is between two ligaments.
Fac illud in illa hora, aut post horam aliam.	Do that at that hour, or after another hour.
Et si uis, cauteriza eam cauterio usque ad os, cum cauterio cultellari: donec incidantur extremitates eius, et stabit loco eiusdem operis.	And if you wish, cauterize it with the cauldron up to the nose, with a sharp knife: until the extremities are cut off and it remains in its place of work.
Et est melius opus, nisi si infirmus habet febrem, autest calefactae complexionis.	And that is better work, unless he has a fever or a hot skin.
Quoniam cauterium est ex eis, quae iuuant ad finiendas humiditates.	For the cauldron is from those who remain to end the moisture.
Ergo est melius iuuamentum.	Therefore it is better to bandage.
Et oportet post extractionem arteriarum, ut impleatur locus cotto antiquo: et ponantur super ipsum puluilli decenter facti.	And after extracting the arteries, so that the place may be filled with old cooking: and put on top of it a little bit of wool made up.
Et post solutionem curetur cum medicinis siccis, quae faciunt nasci carnem, et cum liciniis, donec sanetur.	And after the solution is cured with dry medicines, which make the flesh grow, and with liniments, until it heals.
Quod si interim dum operaris accidit fluxus sanguinis ex arteria, tunc propera ad abscindendum eum cum cauterio, aut ut impleas locum cum zegi: et stringe manum tuam, donec abscindatur sanguis.	That if while you are operating blood flows out from an artery, then hurry to cut it off with a cauldron, or as if you fill the place with bandages: and tighten your hand, until the blood is cut off.
Quod si nihil ex illis est tibi praesens, tunc pone super locum digitum tuum, donec congeletur sanguis.	That if there is nothing present for you, then put your finger on the place, until the blood freezes.
Et embroca locum cum aqua uehementis frigoris, donec quiescat acuitas, et stringatur secundum quod oportet.	And dip the place with water of cold heat, until the sting stops and is tightened according to what needs to be done.
Et ex eo quod est leuius et facilius extractione arteriae, est, ut cauterizes uenam cum hoc cauterio habente duos cultellos: sitque acuitas duorum cultellorum similis almagdatem.	And from that which is lighter and easier to extract the artery, it is, as if the cauldron holds two knives: and the sharpness of the two knives is like an almond.
Verumtamen sunt multo minoris acuitatis, quam duo cultelli.	However, they are much less sharp than the two knives.
Quoniam si sunt acutae, sicut duo cultelli, properat utrisque frigus: et non incidunt carnem cum uelocitate.	For if they are sharp, as the two knives, it is appropriate that both have coldness: and do not cut into the flesh with speed.
Cum ergo in eis est aliquantulum grossitudinis, tenetur in eis calor ignis, et abscinditur caro uelociter: cum hoc ergo opus est melius omni opere, et leuius, et facilius.	But when there is a little bit of roughness in them, it holds the heat of fire and cuts the flesh quickly: so that this work is better for all work, lighter, and easier.
Et sit spacium quod est inter duos cultellos quantitas grossitudinis digiti, postquam tu signas duo loca cum encaustro: et depone utrosque ignitos ualde, donec perueniant ad os, et incidant uenam in duobus locis: ut elongetur quod est inter extremitates eius.	And make space between the two knives according to the thickness of a finger after you have marked the two places with wax: and place the both fires far away until they come to the mouth, and fall a little on both places so that it will be extended what is between its ends.
Nam non consolidantur cum hoc cauterio penitus.	For with this wax not do they consolidate in depth.
Et haec est forma cauterii.	And this is the form of the cautery.
¶ De cura cursus lachrymarum acutarum assiduarum ab oculis.	Of the cure, course of tears, acuteness, from the eyes.
Caput IIII.	Chapter IV.
Quando sunt lachrymae assiduae, et est cursus earum ex uenis, quae sunt super craneum capitis exterius: et non confert in eis aliquid curationis medicinae cum medicinis, et uides faciem infirmi iam rubere, et sentit in fronte sua deambulationem, sicut est deambulatio formicarum: et oculi eius sunt extenuati, humidi, ita quod iam corrosi sunt pili eorum cum corrosione: et calefactae sunt palpebrae eius ex acuitate lachrymarum: tunc antiqui indiguerunt in curatione earum hac operatione, et denominauerunt eam curationem, cum Ense.	When there are persistent tears and there is a course of tears from the ears that are on the outside of the head: and there is no benefit to them with the medicines of doctors, and his eyes begin to turn red, and he feels a trembling in his forehead, as if it were the trembling of ants: and his eyelids are warmed by the acuteness of the tears: then the ancient people found benefits in this operation for their cure, and they called it the cure with Ense.
Et est, ut praecipias infirmo radere pilos qui sunt in fronte sua.	And is, that you shave off the hair that is on his forehead.
Deinde incide in fronte tres fissuras aequedistantes secundum longitudinem frontis: et sit longitudo fissurae quasi duo digiti, et fissura una sit aequedistans longitudini nasi in medio frontis, et secunda secundum longitudinem parumper a motu lacertorum, et tertia a parte altera: et caue ab incisione arteriarum quae sunt in duobus lateribus: et elonga manum tuam a continuatione duarum mandibularum, et sit spacium omnis incisionis quantitas trium digitorum coniunctorum: et sit tibi frustum spongiae praeparatum, aut panni siccati multi, cum quibus exsicces sanguinem.	Then cut in the forehead three incisions that are equidistant according to the length of the forehead: and make the length of the incision almost like two fingers, and let the incision that is in the middle of the forehead be equidistant according to the length of the nose, and the second according to the length of a lizard's movement, and the third from the other one by half its length: and be careful not to cut the arteries that are on both sides. And extend your hand from the continuation of the two jawbones, and make space between each incision according to the thickness of three joined fingers: and have you a prepared sponge or many dry cloths with which you squeeze out the blood.
Deinde intromitte spatumile duarum acutarum extremitatum, cuius mox sequens est forma.	Then introduce the spit end of two acute ends, whose following form is:
Ab incisione quae est a parte timporis, usque ad incisionem secundam: et excoria cum eo totam cutem, quae est inter duas incisiones, cum sifac, quod est super os.	From the incision that is on the side of the time, to the incision that is the second one: and scrub all the skin between the two incisions with the chisel, which is above the bone.
Deinde fac illud etiam ab incisione media usque ad incisionem secundam.	Then also cut this from the middle to the second incision.
Deinde extrahe hoc spatumile, et intromitte in incisionem primam iterum instrumentum aliud, quod nominatur cultellare acutum, ab una parte lene, non acutum ab altera parte.	Then also remove this scythe-shaped piece, and introduce into the first incision again a different tool called a sharp chisel from one side, not acute from the other side.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its shape.
Et pone latus eius acutum uersus carnem annexam cum cute, et latus eius lene uersus os: et impelle ipsum, donec perueniat ad fissuram mediam: et abscinde cum eo omnia uasa, quae descendunt a capite ad oculos: praeter quod continuetur incisio usque ad illud quod apparet de cute.	And place its acute side against the flesh attached with skin, and its blunt side against the bone: and push it, until it reaches the middle crevice: and cut off with it all the waste that descends from the head to the eyes: except that which continues the incision until it appears from the skin.
Deinde fac illud in fissura media usque ad fissuram aliam.	Then also make this in the middle crease until another crease.
Et postquam currit ex sanguine quantitas aequalis, exprime loca ex frustis sanguinis coagulati.	And when an equal quantity of blood has run out, express the places from the clotted blood.
Deinde pone in omnem fissuram licinium ex cotto ueteri, et pone super eos puluillos imbibitos in uino, et oleo, aut aceto.	Then also put into every crease a piece of leather from old cloth, and put on them wicks soaked with wine, or oil, or vinegar.
Et uide ut non accidat apostema calidum.	And tie so that it does not happen a blister hot.
Et in die tertia solue ligamentum, et administra infusionem multam cum aqua tepida.	And on the third day loosen the ligaments, and administer a strong infusion with warm water.
Deinde cura illud ex unguento basilicon, et reliquis quibus curantur uulnera: usquequo sanetur.	Then also care for this with basilicon ointment, and with the others which are used for wounds: until it is healed.
¶ De cura lachrymarum acutarum et catarrorum ad oculos ex interioribus capitis.	§ On the treatment of acute lágrimas and cataracts to the eyes from inside the head.
Caput V.	Head.
Quando accidunt alicui catarri acuti, acres, assidui: et uides oculos eius extenuatos, paruos, et iam debilitatus est aspectus eorum: et palpebrae ulceratae, et cadunt pili ex eis, et in profundo capitis est dolor acutus, laedens, et sternutatio consequens: tunc sume ex istis accidentibus, quod illae materiae, et catarri non ueniunt, nisi ex uenis multis.	When there occur to someone a sharp, bitter, and persistent Cataract, and the eyes seem weak, pale, and already declining in aspect: and the eyelids are ulcerated, and hairs fall out of them, and there is a sharp pain in the depth of the head, and consequent sneezing: then remove these accidents, that those materials, and the Cataract do not come, unless they are removed with many tools.
Et melior curatio in eis est haec.	And the best treatment for them is this.
Et est, ut praecipias infirmo radere frontem suam.	And it is, as you order to the sick person to shave his forehead.
Deinde incide in eam fissuram unam in medio frontis, aut alterius parumper per latitudinem, et incipe cum fissura a timpore sinistro ad timpus dextrum: et sit incisio usque ad os: et elonga manum tuam a lacertis timporum, qui mouentur apud masticationem: donec quando detegitur os: et exsiccabis totum sanguinem cum spongia.	Then also make in it one crease in the middle of the forehead, or somewhat less in width, and begin with the crease from the left time to the right time: and continue the incision until you reach the bone: and extend your hand from the jawbones that move during mastication: until it is stopped when it reaches the bone: and you will dry out all the blood with a sponge.
Tunc separa inter duo labia fissurae cum cotto ueteri, aut cum liciniis ex lino.	Then separate between the two lips of the wound with a hot cloth, or with silk from linen.
Deinde stringe desuper cum puluillis: et imbibe puluillos cum uino et oleo, ut non accidat apostema calidum.	Then tighten from above with thread: and immerse the thread in wine and oil so that a hot swelling does not occur.
Et quando soluis illud, et uides quod apostema calidum iam imminuitur: tunc oportet ut frices os, donec incipiat in eo nasci caro.	And when you loosen it, and you will see that a hot swelling has already begun to emerge: then it is necessary for the surgeon to open the mouth, until the flesh begins to grow there.
Deinde cura ipsum cum regimine exiccatiuo quod facit nasci carnem: sicut si accipias ex farina tritici partes duas, et ex colophonia quatuor partes: et praepares ex eis emplastrum, et administretur ad natiuitatem carnis in istis uulneribus.	Then take care of the patient with dry healing that makes flesh grow: as if you took two parts of wheat flour and four parts of colophony: and prepare a plaster, and administer it to the birth of flesh in these wounds.
¶ De cura eius quod cadit in Aurem.	Regarding the care that falls on gold.
Caput VI.	Chapter VI.
Omne Quod in Aurem cadit, est una quatuor specierum: aut lapis mineralis, aut simile lapidi, sicut ferrum, et uitrum: aut est ex planta, sicut est cicer, et fabae: aut est res fluxibilis, sicut aqua, et acetum, et eis similia: aut aliquod animal.	All that falls on gold is of four kinds: either mineral stone, or similar stones, such as iron and silver; or it is from a plant, such as beans and peas; or it is a fluid substance, such as water and vinegar, and similar things; or some creature.
Quando ergo cadit in aurem lapis, aut genus lapidis ex eis quae non adduntur, neque crescunt in aure, expone Aurem soli: si ergo uides lapidem, tunc distilla in Aurem aliquid ex oleo uiolato, aut sisamino.	When, then, it falls on gold, or any kind of stone that does not add to the gold and does not grow in it, expose the gold to the sun alone: but if you see a stone, then distill in gold some of the oil that has been cooked, or sesamum.
Deinde administra extractionem eius, et fac sternutare cum condisi, et opila nares apud aduentum sternutationis, postquam tu ponis in circumitu auris frusta ex pannis, aut lana, et extendis aurem ad superiora.	Then administer the extraction and make it snort with condiments, and polverize the nose at the approach of sneezing, after you have placed around the ears twigs of linen or wool, and raise the auricle towards the top.
Multotiens enim egreditur cum hac cura.	Because this treatment is often repeated.
Si autem non egreditur, tunc administra extractionem eius cum Gesti, id est, Pizigarolis subtilibus: cuius forma est haec.	If, however, it does not go out, then administer the extraction with gestures, that is, with subtle pizgaroli: whose form is this.
Si ergo egreditur cum gesti, est bonum.	If, then, it goes out with a gesture, it is good.
Et si non, tunc administra extractionem eius cum uncino caeco subtili paucae duplicationis.	And if not, then administer the extraction with a black hook that is subtle and made of little pieces.
Si ergo non egreditur per illud, tunc fac cannulam ex aere, et intromitte extremitatem cannulae in foramen auris multum, et opila quod est in circumitu cannulae cum caera mollificata cum oleo, ut non sit uento uia nisi cannulae: deinde extrahe cum uento tuo attractione forti.	If then he does not come out by that way, then make a tube of brass, and insert the extremity of the tube into the opening of the ear much, and the dust that is in the circumference of the tube with the soft metal with oil, so that there is no route except for the tube: then remove it with your吸引力 forte.
Multotiens enim egreditur cum eo quod narrauimus.	For many times he went out with him whom we have described.
Si autem non egreditur hoc modo: tunc accipe ex helkalimbat, aut ex uisco, id est, gluten praeparato, cum quo capiuntur aues, rem modicam: et pone ipsum in extremitate radii postquam tu inuoluis super eam cotum decenter positum: deinde intromitte ipsum in foramen auris cum facilitate, postquam tu exiccas aurem ab humiditate.	But if he does not go out in this way, then take from the calaminum, or from the water, that is to say, the prepared gluten, with which they bind the birds, with which put the metal when it is hot, and set him at the end of the radius after you have dried the ear of the humidity: then insert him into the opening of the ear with ease, after you have dried the ear from the humidity.
Si ergo non egreditur cum omnibus quae narrauimus, tunc propera ad scindendum, antequam accidat apostema calidum, aut spasmus.	If then he does not go out with all that we have described, then approach to cut off, before the hot apoplexy happens, or the spasm.
Et modus fissurae est, ut phlebotomes infirmum in primis in cephalica: et extrahe ei ex sanguine secundum mensuram uirtutis eius.	And the mode of the incision is so, that the phlebotome cuts off the sick one first of all in the head: and then remove from it the blood according to the measure of its power.
Deinde fac sedere infirmum inter manus tuas, et conuerte aurem eius ad superiora, et finde fissuram paruam in radice auris apud adipem eius in loco depresso ipsi: et sit fissura lunaris figurae, donec peruenias ad lapidem: deinde aufer eum cum eo, quod est tibi possibile ex instrumentis.	Then make the sick one sit between your hands, and turn his ear upwards, and find a small hole at the base of his ear in his fat in a depressed place: and let the hole be lunar-shaped, until you have reached the rock: then remove it with that one, which is possible for you from the instruments.
Deinde sue fissuram ab hora tua cum uelocitate, et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	Then suer the hole from your time with speed, and tend to it, until it is healed.
Quod si res cadens in aurem est ex uno granorum, quae crescunt, et inflantur: tunc administra extractionem eius.	That if what falls into the ear is from one grain, which grows, and swells up: then administer the extraction of it.
Si autem non obedit tibi ad exitum, tunc accipe spatumile tenue, subtile, secundum hanc formam.	But if it does not obey you to come out, then take a thin, delicate stick, according to this form.
Et administra cum eo abscisionem illius speciei ex granis, quae cadunt in aurem, et non facias illud, quando tu cogitas, quod illud granum iam humectatum est per uaporem auris, donec ponis ipsum frusta multa: deinde extrahe ea cum uncinis, aut cum gesti subtili, aut cum suctione, sicut diximus, nam extractio eius alleuiatur.	And administer with that one the cutting off of its kind from a grain, which falls into the ear, and do not make it, when you think, that it is already moistened by the humidity of the ear, until you have put many whips on it: then remove them with a hook, or with a subtle gesture, or with suction, as we have said, for the extraction of it is eased.
In aqua autem quae ingreditur in aurem, oportet ut utatur infirmus sternutatione cum condisi in primis: et iam impleuit aurem suam cum aliquanto cotto ueteri: et est iacens super illam aurem, in qua est aqua.	But the water that is put into the ear should be used by the sick man with a stirrup first of all; and he has already filled his ear with some cooked salt; and he lies on the ear where the water is.
Si ergo egreditur per illud, est bonum.	So if he goes out through that, it is good.
Et si non: tunc accipe lapides multos, secundum longitudinem digiti, tenues, lenes, et calefac eos cum igne parumper, et intromittat infirmus ex eis unum in foramen auris suae: et saliat super pedem suum unum ex illa parte, et percutiat cum lapide alio super lapidem qui est in aure.	But if not: then take many small stones, according to the length of a finger, soft, dull, and heat them slightly with fire; and let the sick man put one into the hole of his ear: and he should salt his foot on that side, and hit it with another stone on the stone that is in the ear.
Non ergo cesset facere illud cum lapide et lapide, donec egrediatur tota aqua.	So let them not cease to do this with stones and stones until he has gone out all water.
Et iam egreditur aqua ita, ut accipias ex parpyro, aut ex iunco unum, et intromittas extremitatem eius unam in aurem: et accendas extremitatem alteram cum igne, donec comburatur plurimum eius.	And he has already gone out water so that you take from the fire or from one branch and put its end into his ear; and you light that end with fire until it is well burned.
Deinde itera iuncum alium, et fac illud multotiens, donec egrediatur tota aqua: et extrahe ipsam cum cannula secundum quod praemissum est in lapide.	Then take another branch and do this many times until he has gone out all water; and pull it out with a tube according to what was said before in the stone.
In extractione autem animalis intrantis in eam, si est parui corporis, ut pulex, et ei simile, cura ipsum sicut dixi in diuisione.	But when extracting what has entered into it, if it is a small body, like a flea, and like it, take care of it as I said in the division.
Sed si est corporis magni, quod appareat sensui: tunc administra extractionem eius cum gesti, et uncinis: et res eius est facilior omnibus, quae tenentur in aure.	But if it seems to be a large body, then administer its extraction with gestures and hooks; and the work of it is easier for all those who hold it in the ear.
In extractione autem uermis generati in aure, quando curas eum cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et in tractatu distilationum, et non confert curatio tua: tunc oportet ut aspicias aurem in sole.	But when extracting the black dog that is in the ear, if your care seems to be the same as what we said in the division and in the book of distillation, and does not seem to be helpful; then you should examine the ear in the sun.
Si ergo apparet illic aliquid ex uermibus, tunc extrahe illud cum gesti, aut cum uncinis subtilibus.	But if there appears anything of that sort out there, then extract it with gestures or with subtle hooks.
Si autem non apparet illic aliquid, tunc accipe cannulam, cuius haec est forma, stricta inferius, ampla superius: et intromitte extremitatem subtilem in aurem secundum quantitatem quod tolerat eam infirmus: deinde suge cum ea suctione forti.	But if nothing appears out there, then take the tube which has this form: narrow below, wide above; and put its thin end into the ear according to the tolerance of the sick man: and then suck it up with a strong suction.
Fac illud multotiens, donec egrediantur omnes uermes.	So that many times, until all the worms come out.
Si autem non obediunt tibi ad exitum, tunc opila circumitum cannulae cum caera, sicut dixi in lapide.	But if they don't obey you to go out, then dip the cane around them with chalk, as I said on the stone.
Quod si non egrediuntur cum eo quod diximus: tunc administra distillationes quas iam experti sunt antiqui in interfectione uermium: et inuenies illud in tractatu distillationum.	That if they don't go out with it that we said: then administer the distillation which the ancient have already experienced in the infection of worms: and you will find that in the treatise on distillation.
Et sit effusio tua qua effundis olea et medicinas in aurem cum hoc instrumento, cuius forma depicta est hic.	And may your flow be as it is when you pour oil and medicine into the ear with this instrument, whose form is depicted here.
Sicut uides fac ipsum ex argento, aut aere, inferius strictum, in quo sit foramen paruum, amplum superius.	As you see, do make the hole of silver or brass, narrow below, and wide above.
Sit ergo ut impellens quod est in concauitate cannulae, sit ex aere decenter factum.	So that it is driven as it is in the squeeze of the cane, let it be made of brass, made askew.
Et si uis, accipe radium, et inuolue in extremitate eius cottum inuolutione decenti: deinde proiice oleum, aut succum, aut quod uis ex istis medicinis in cannulam: et ipsa sit in aure: deinde intromitte radium cum cotto desuper, et exprime ipsum manu tua compressione temperata, donec impellatur oleum in concauitate auditus, et sentiat ipsum infirmus interius: et illud quod infunditur in aurem, sit iam calefactum cum igne parumper: et caue ne sit res quae distillatur in eam frigida ualde: medicinae enim non tolerant illud.	And if you want to take the liquid, and pour it into the ear with the cane, let it be made of brass, made askew. And if you want to heat it slightly, let it be heated with fire, and let there not be anything that is distilled into it, for medicines do not tolerate that.
¶ De cura opilationis accidentis Auri.	On the treatment of the disease of gold.
Caput VII.	Head VII.
Quandoque egrediuntur quidam infantes ex uentribus matrum suarum non perforati.	When some children come out of their mothers' wombs unpierced.
Et iam accidit etiam quibusdam hominibus opilatio in meatu Auris a uulnere, aut carne nata in ea.	And it also happens to some people that there is an opilation in the ear of gold from a wound, or flesh grown in it.
Et haec opilatio quandoque fit in profundo foraminis Auris, quam non consequitur uisus: et quandoque accidit ad exteriora foraminis parum, et consequitur eam uisus.	And this opilation sometimes happens in a deep hole of gold, which is not caused by heat: and when it happens to the external holes a little, it is caused by heat.
Illa ergo quae accidit in profundo Auris, et quam non comprehendit aspectus, est in pluribus dispositionibus difficilis sanationis.	That which happens in a deep hole of gold, and which is not comprehended by appearance, is difficult to heal in many dispositions.
Et in illa quam consequitur uisus, oportet ut ponas Aurem infirmi in sole, et aspicias in ea: tunc si uides opilationem apparentem, aperi eam cum spatumili subtili, cuius forma est haec quae sequitur, sit extremitas eius in qua sit quaedam latitudo parua, cuius quaedam pars sit acuta: et reliquum spatumile sit duarum laterum lenium: ut non laedat aurem.	And in that which is caused by heat, you should put gold into the sun, and look in it: then if you see an opilation appearing, open it with a sharp tweezers, whose form is as follows, let the end of it be in a small curvature, some of its part being acute: and let the other tweezers side be soft: so that it does not hurt the ear.
Si ergo opilatio est a carne nata in meatu auris: tunc tene eam cum uncino subtili, et incide eam cum facilitate uehementi, donec auferatur tota caro.	If then an inflammation has arisen from the flesh in the meatus auris: then hold it with a fine hook and cut it easily with a sharp instrument until the whole is cut away.
Quod si opilatio est in profundo auris: tunc accipe radium subtilem, lenem, et calefac ipsum cum igne parumper: deinde mitte ipsum in meatum auris.	That if an inflammation is in the deep part of the ear: then take a thin ray, soft and heat it slightly: then put it into the meatus auris.
Si ergo senseris opilationem cum eo, quod inuenit infirmus cum grauitate auditus, conare apertionem eius cum facilitate: et caue, ne uulneres neruos auris.	If then you feel an inflammation with it, that which occurs when there is loss of hearing due to weight: be careful in removing it easily; and being careful, do not injure the nerves of the ear.
Deinde pone in aurem licinium secundum quantitatem amplitudinis foraminis, quod inuoluisti in unguento aegyptio: fac illud aliquot diebus, donec sis securus de consolidatione uulneris.	Then put into the ear a liquid of the quantity of width of the pore that you have opened with Egyptian ointment: let it be for several days until you are cured of the injury.
Aut accipe licinium, et infunde ipsum in aqua rosata, et pulueriza super ipsum zegi tritum, et utere ipso.	Or take liquid and pour it into rose water, and pulverize it on it, and use it.
Quod si uides aurem iam apostemari: tunc oportet ut extrahas licinium, et permittas ipsum cum licinio alio, quod inuolues in caeroto quod sit factum cum oleo rosato, donec sedetur apostema calidum: deinde cura ipsum usquequo sanetur.	That if you see the ear already infected: then it is necessary that you take out the liquid, and let it be with other liquid, which you have put in greenwort that is made with rose water, until it cools down the infection; then care for the ear until it is cured.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis: tunc submerge spongiam, aut pannos in aqua frigida, et pone super eam aurem: et utere reliqua curatione, quae abscindit fluxum sanguinis praedicta in tractatu distillationum.	If then there is a flow of blood: then dip a sponge, or cloth in cold water and put it on the ear; and use what remains of the cure, which stops the predicted flow of blood in the treatment of distillation.
¶ De cura Altheli palpebrarum.	Of the cure of the palpebrae of Albithis.
Caput VIII.	Chapter VIII.
Isti Althelil qui accidunt in Palpebris oculi, quandoque sunt humidi, et sunt sicci.	These are the things that occur in the eyelids of the eye when they are moist and dry.
Oportet ergo ut teneas eos cum tenaliis: aut cum uncino, et incidas eos cum spatumili a radicibus suis.	Then you should hold them with tongs: or with a hook, and cut them off at the roots.
Deinde pone super loca zegi tritum.	Then put on the places greenwort.
Si autem ex eis fluat sanguis, tunc cauteriza eos cum cauterio lenticulari subtili.	If then there flows blood from them, then you should burn them with a small lens.
Et cauterizare eos, est melius post incisionem.	And burning them is better after cutting.
Multotiens enim redeunt quando remanet ex radicibus suis aliquid.	Often they return when a little remains of the roots.
Et quando cauterizantur cum igne, comburuntur illae radices, et non redeunt.	And when they are cauterized with fire, those roots are burned up, and do not return.
¶ De cura Grandinum palpebrarum oculi.	On the treatment of the eyelids of the eye.
Caput IX.	Chapter IX.
Multotiens accidit in palpebris aliquid quod assimilatur Crandini in fortitudine sua, et sua duricie, et propter illud nominatur Grando: et est aggregatio humiditatis grossae in palpebra superiore, et palpebra inferiore.	Often it happens in the eyelids that something is absorbed by Crandinus in his strength and dureness, and on account of this he is called Grandinus; and it is an aggregation of a thick moisture in the upper lid, and in the lower lid.
Operatio ergo in eis est, ut consideres tunc, si est Grando procedens in eo, quod apparet de palpebra, et mouentur ad omnem partem, et res eius est facilis.	Operation therefore on them is, that you consider then, if it is Grandinus proceeding from the eye, which appears on the lid, and moves to all parts, and the thing is easy.
Finde ergo super eam fissura per latitudinem.	Find therefore over it a slit from side to side.
Deinde excoria eam ab omni parte cum facilitate, donec euadat.	Then scrape her thoroughly from all parts with ease, until it bleeds.
Deinde suspende eam cum uncino, et abscinde ipsam.	Then suspend her by a hook, and cut her off.
Si autem non praeparatur tibi abscisio eius, nisi postquam tu penetras palpebram cum incisione parumper, tunc nocet infirmo illud in aliquo.	But if you are not prepared to cut it off, unless you penetrate the eyelid with an incision just a little, then it will hurt the injured part in some way.
Quod si fissura est magna: tunc aggrega ipsam cum sutura: et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	That if the slit is wide: then aggregate her together with sutures: and take care of her, until she heals.
Et si est parua, non superueniet tibi malum ex ea.	And if it is small, do not cause harm to her from it.
Vnguentum enim restaurat ipsam, et incarnat eam.	The unguents restore the same, and inflame her.
Et si grando est decliuis ad interiora auris uersus superficiem intrinsecam, tunc inuersa palpebram, et suspende grandinem cum uncino: praeter quod indigeas incisione, et preme eam ab omni parte.	And if Grandinus is a fall into the inner parts opposite to the surface inwardly, then turn round the eyelid, and suspend Grandinus by a hook: except that you should make an incision, and press her from all sides.
Quod si elongatur palpebra per incisionem, non nocet illud in aliquo.	That if the eyelid is elongated by an incision, then it does not hurt the injured part in any way.
Deinde ablue oculum post incisionem grandinis, cum aqua salsa: et cura locum cum eo quod incarnat, donec sanetur infirmus.	Then wash out the eye after Grandini's incision with salt water; and take care of the place where it is inflamed, until the injured part heals.
¶ De cura Axirnath palpebrarum.	On the treatment of the eyelids of the eye.
Caput X.	Chapter X.
Axirnath est adeps qui generatur in tunicis palpebrae superioris: et plurimum quidem accidit illud pueris: et ipsum grauat oculos eorum, et accidunt eis catarri in matutinis, et non possunt intueri lumen solis, propterea, quod lachrymae properant ad eos, et propter illud uides eos discumbere super facies suas semper, et super eas dormiunt, et sunt palpebrae eorum sub superciliis humidae, quas iam cooperuit inflatio: et eminentia quidem Axirnath apparens est oculo, et quando tu premis locum cum digitis tuis, sentis Axirnath inter eos.	Axirnath is a dew that forms in the eyelids of the upper eye: and indeed this often happens to boys: and it grates their eyes, and they get cataracts in the morning, and cannot see the light of the sun, because tears flow towards them, and for this reason they always lie on their faces, and sleep on top of them, and their eyelids are wet under their brows, which have already been inflated by swelling: and the prominence of Axirnath is indeed apparent to the eye, and when you press the place with your fingers, you feel Axirnath between them.
Et modus operationis eius est, ut ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo.	And the mode of its operation is that he should put his sick head in your lap.
Deinde accipe pannum lini, et praepara in eo licinia, et fac ex illo licinio circulum secundum quantitatem quod continet Axirnath ab omni parte.	Then take a linen cloth and prepare it with folds, and make it into a circle according to the quantity that contains Axirnath from all sides.
Deinde pone eum super eam, et preme cum digitis tuis ab omni parte, ut aggregetur Axirnath in medio circuli.	Then place it on top of it, and press it with your fingers from all sides so that Axirnath gathers in the middle of the circle.
Deinde finde in medio illius humiditatis cum spatumili incidente fissuras per latitudinem, et non sit fissura maior illa quae fit in phlebotomia in profundo.	Then find in the middle of its humidity with a sharp instrument that has a sliver of skin attached to it, and there is no larger wound than that which is made in phlebotomy in the deep.
Aut oportet ut findas cutem totam, donec peruenias ad Axirnath in pluribus enim dispositionibus procedit Axirnath ex fissura secundum formam frusti pinguedinis albae.	Or you should find all the skin, until you reach Axirnath, because Axirnath often proceeds from a wound in many places: for indeed Axirnath arises from white skin.
Extrahe ergo eam cum panno, quem infiltrasti inter digitos tuos ad exteriora: et tu reuoluis manum tuam ad dextram et sinistram, donec dispergatur: et caue, ne addas in fissura, ut non peruenias cum spatumili ad oculum, et laedas eum.	Then remove it with the cloth that you have soaked between your fingers towards the outside: and you should open your hand to the right and left until it disperses: and carefully, do not add it to the wound, so that you do not hit the eye with the knife, and let it go.
Si autem non appareat tibi Axirnath in principio fissurae, tu addas in fissura parum cum facilitate, donec procedat Axirnath.	But if Axirnath does not appear to you at first from the wound, you should add a little to the wound with ease until Axirnath begins to come out.
Deinde extrahe eam, sicut diximus.	Then remove it, as we have said.
Deinde submerge pannos in aceto et aqua, et pone eos super locum, et stringe eum cum puluillis.	Then immerse the cloth in vinegar and water, and place it on the spot, and tighten it with dust.
Et ex hominibus sunt qui terunt salem, et ponunt ipsum in concauitate fissurae, ut liquefiat quod remansit ex illa humiditate.	And there are people who wrap themselves with salt, and they put it on the wound of a裂口，to make what is left of that humidity melt.
Deinde cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	Then take care of herself, until she heals.
Si autem accidat in loco apostema calidum, tune cura ipsum cum emplastris sedatiuis, donec sanetur.	But if it happens on the spot of an abcess a hot place, then take care of himself with cooled plasters, until she heals.
¶ De modis Ataxmir oculi, id est, cum palpebra mollificatur oculi, unde fit ut rugetur sicut non debet.	The way of the Ataxmir eyes, that is, when the eyelid becomes soft to the eye, so that it grows like it should not be.
Caput XI.	Chapter XI.
Quando nascuntur in palpebris oculi pili additi praeter cursum sub pilis naturalibus, et antiquantur: tunc ipsi nocent oculo, et faciunt accidere modos aegritudinum, sicut lachrymas assiduas, et mollificationem palpebrarum, et albuginem, donec fit illud caussa destructionis oculi.	When they grow in the eyelids of hair added beyond the course under the natural hairs, and increase: then they hurt the eye, and cause diseases, such as constant tears, and softening of the eyelids, and alba
Et Ataxmir quidem oculi curatur secundum quatuor modos.	And the Ataxmir eyes are cared for according to four ways.
Aut per cauterium cum igne.	Or by cauterization with fire.
Aut cum medicina acuta, secundum quod praemissum est in capitulo cauterii.	Or with sharp medicine, according to which is stated in the chapter of cauterization.
Aut curatur Ataxmir per incisionem et suturam.	Or the Ataxmir are cared for by incision and suturing.
Aut per cannas, secundum quod ego dicam.	Or with needles, according to which I say:
Oportet ut ponas caput infirmi in sinu tuo.	It should be placed on the head of the nurse in your lap.
Deinde conuerte palpebram oculi manu tua sinistra.	Then turn towards the eyelid of the eye with your left hand.
Si ergo conuertitur, bonum est.	But if it is turned, that is good.
Et si non: intromitte acum in eam, in qua sit filum ab inferiori parte palpebrae, et fac penetrare acum cum filo desuper, et sit illud prope pilos ipsos, id est, prope marginem palpebrae, in quo nascuntur pili: et trahe filum ad superiora cum palpebra, et conuerte eam cum radio.	And if not: push it into where there is a hair from the lower part of the eyelid, and let it pierce with the thread up, and let it be close to the natural hairs, that is, close to the edge of the eyelid, where the hairs grow: and pull the thread upwards with the eyelid, and turn it around.
Deinde finde in interiori parte palpebrae sub pilis additis cum spatumili incidente a lachrymali maiore usque ad lachrymale minus.	Then find on the inner side of the eyelid under the added hairs with a sharp instrument incident from the larger tear to the smaller tear.
Deinde extrahe filum, et pone sub palpebra puluillum paruum ex cotto, aut panno: deinde signa super palpebram cum encaustro, quod sit sicut figura folii myrti.	Then pull out the thread, and put under the eyelid a small piece of bread or cloth: then seal with enxert on the eyelid, which is like the figure of a leaf of myrrh.
Verumtamen oportet, ut fit figura secundum quantitatem et eleuationem palpebrae: quoniam iam diuersificatur illud in hominibus.	It is indeed necessary that the figure be made according to the quantity and elevation of the eyelid: for this has already been diverse among men.
Ex eis enim est, qui indiget ut incidatur ex palpebra quantitas magna, secundum quantitatem quae mollificatur a palpebra.	From these it is indeed necessary that the figure be made according to the quantity and elevation of the eyelid: for this has already been diverse among men.
Deinde cum spatumili finde super duas lineas quas signasti, et incipe a lachrymali maiore usque ad lachrymale minus, et sit fissura una prope pilos naturales, sicut est grossitudo radii.	Then when you find the edge of the eyelid with a spatulum on two lines that you have marked, and begin from the larger tear to the smaller, and place one slit next to the natural hair, as is the thickness of the radius.
Deinde intromitte uncinum in uno duorum angulorum cutis.	Then insert the hook into one of two angles of the skin.
Deinde excoria ipsam totam.	Then scrape it all out.
Deinde aggrega cum sutura duo labia, cum acu et filo lana subtili: et absterge sanguinem, et fac adhaerere quod superfluit ex filis super duo supercilia, cum quibusdam rebus inuiscantibus, si uis facere illud: et si non, non cures.	Then gather together with sutures the two lips, with an awl and a fine thread: and wipe away the blood, and let what is superfluous adhere to the two eyebrows, with some things that are invisible, if you want to do this: and if not, then it does not matter.
Deinde dimitte suturam et fila usque ad tres dies, aut quatuor: postea cura illud.	Then let go of the suture and thread up to three or four days: then take care of that.
Et si uis, dimitte uulnus absque sutura, et cura ipsum cum eo, quod exsiccat et constringit.	And if you want, let go of the hook without a suture, and take care of it with it, that it dries up and tightens.
Nam palpebra eleuatur apud sigillationem uulneris et aggregationem eius: sed futura est melior.	For the eyelid is lifted at the seal of the wound and its aggregation: but the future one is better.
Hunc modum curandi Ataxmir docuerunt antiqui.	In this way, Ataxmir taught to heal.
Verumtamen in eo est sollicitudo super infirmum, et est ex bona operatione, et non est in eo timor.	But in that is a concern about the sick, and it is from a good operation, and there is no fear in it.
Et modus alius est in Ataxmir etiam: et est, ut signes super palpebram figuram, quae sit sicut figura folii myrti, sicut narrauimus.	And another way of Ataxmir too: and it is, that the figure on the eyelid is like the shape of a bay leaf, as we have reported.
Deinde eleua palpebram cum tribus uncinis separatis, aut aggregatis, secundum formam hanc quae sequitur, deinde incide quod superfluit cum forficibus paruis, secundum hanc formam, cum aequalitate incisionis.	Then lift the eyelid with three separate or aggregated hooks, according to this shape that follows, then cut off what is superfluous with little scissors, according to this form, with an equal incision.
Si autem non est tibi possibile tenere uncinum, et non aequatur illud: tunc accipe acum in qua sit filum, et intromitte ipsum in medio figurae: et intromitte filum aliud prope lachrymale maius, et filum secundum prope lachrymale minus: et aggrega inter digitos tuos fila cum aequalitate.	But if it is not possible for you to hold the hook, and it does not fit that way: then take the thread in which is the hook, and insert it into the middle of the figure: and insert another thread next to the larger tear, and a third next to the smaller tear: and gather the threads between your fingers with an equality.
Deinde eleua manum tuam eleuatione aequali: et eleua cutem super quam est signatum cotum, sicut narrauimus.	Then anoint your hand with a equal amount of ointment: and anoint the skin over what is marked by the bandage, as we have said.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris cum sutura: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then gather together two lips of the wound with a stitch: and care for it, until it heals.
Si uero accidat apostema apud incisionem tuam, aut fissuram tuam: seda illud apostema cum caeroto, et his similibus, ex unguentis sedantibus.	If however an abscess happens to be at your incision, or a hole: but that abscess with caustic, and such like, should be seated from the ointment.
Et quandoque accidit palpebrae etiam, ut conuertantur pili eius.	And when ever the eyelids also turn in, so as to turn his hairs.
Oportet ergo ut utaris in ea quod diximus in incisione: sed sutura utrisque magis est artificialis.	Therefore you should use that which we have said for an incision: but the stitch is more artificial.
¶ De cura Ataxmir cum cannis.	For the care of Ataxmir with needles.
ET Est, ut conuertas palpebram, et scindas fissuram quae est deintus, secundum quod narraui.	And is, when you turn the eyelid, and cut the hole which is within, according to what we have said.
Deinde arte fac duas cannas, aut duo ligna subtilia: quarum longitudo sit secundum longitudinem palpebrae, et latitudo earum sit minor latitudine spatumilis: et tu iam incidisti in extremitatibus utriusque ab utrisque partibus ubi tenes fila.	Then artfully make two needles, or two thin sticks: the length of which should be according to the length of the eyelid, and their width less than the width of a toothpick: and you have already stitched at the ends of both sides where you hold the thread.
Deinde aggrega utramque cum subtilitate super illud quod superfluit ex palpebra oculi, et stringe duas cannas ab utrisque partibus strictura forti, et dimitte eam diebus aliquot.	Then gather each one with a thread over what is in excess from the eye-lid, and strongly tighten two needles from both sides, and let it go for some days.
Cutis enim stricta morietur, et denigrabitur, et putrefiet, donec cadet per se.	For the skin is stiff, it will die, and it will rot away, until it falls away by itself.
Si ergo tardatur, tunc incide eam cum forficibus.	If however it should be delayed, then cut it with razors.
Deinde cura eam, donec sanetur.	Then care for it, until it heals.
Cum ergo consolidatur, eleuatur palpebra: et non pungunt pili.	When however it is hardened, the eyelid is to be anointed, and the hairs are not pricked.
Et haec est forma duarum cannarum, quas facies secundum hanc figuram, et quantitatem in longitudinem et latitudinem.	And this is the form of two needles which you should make according to this figure, and the quantity in length and width.
¶ De eleuatione pilorum pungentium in oculo cum acu.	For anointing the stinging hairs in the eye with an acorn.
Caput XII.	Chapter XII.
Operatio in illo est, ut accipias acum subtilem, et intromittas in eam filum ex serico subtile, lene.	The operation in that case is, that you should take a thin acorn, and insert it into a thread of silk, and string it up.
Deinde aggreges extremitates eius, et nodes utramque nodo subtili ualde: et sit longitudo filorum palmus unus.	Then join the extremities together with sutures, and tie each knot with a fine thread: and let the length of the threads be one palm.
Deinde compone in Alinxotati filum aliud subtile sub eo in breui, et noda extremitates eius si uis.	Then make another thread from linen thread, shorter than that, and tie the ends together with a knot.
Deinde ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo, et sit prope solem ut declaretur operatio: quoniam est operatio subtilis, uel minuta.	Then let the sick person lie close to your chest, near the sun, that the operation may be declared: for the operation is subtle or minute.
Deinde intromitte acum cum alinxotati in radicem palpebrae, et fac eam penetrare in palpebram festinanter, donec extrahas eam desuper pilum naturalem.	Then insert the awl from the linen thread into the root of the eyelid, and let it pierce through the eyelid swiftly, until it comes out on top of the natural pimple.
Deinde trahe pilum usque supra alinxotati: et intromitte in alinxotati illum pilum: si est unus, aut duo, aut tres, non plures.	Then draw the awl all the way up to the linen thread: and insert the awl into the linen thread: if it is one, or two, or three, not more.
Deinde trahe manum tuam cum eo, donec egrediatur pilus cum alinxotati in palpebra cum pilo naturali.	Then draw your hand away with it, until the pimple comes out with the linen thread along with the natural pimple in the eyelid.
Si autem trahatur alinxotati, et non egrediatur pilus cum ea: trahes alinxotati ad inferiora, cum filo quod tu composuisti in ea, donec egrediatur alinxotati ex foramine superiori, et uideas eam uisione oculi: tunc enim trahes alinxotati, et filum: et extrahe utraque, et claude oculum: et dimitte ipsum clausum duobus diebus, aut tribus, donec adhaereat pilus loco suo, et nascatur super ipsum caro.	If however the linen thread is pulled out, and does not come out with it: take the linen thread from below, with the thread that you have composed in it, until you can pull out the linen thread from the upper opening, and cut off the eye-lid with it: then pull out both, and close the eye, and let him stay closed for two or three days, until the pimple has come to head, and a pimple has grown up on its place, and covered it.
Quod si pilus est breuis, tunc aut associa ei pilum longum ex pilis naturalibus, et eleuatur cum eo: aut dimitte ipsum, donec elongetur post spacium, et tunc eleua ipsum.	If the thread is short, then either attach a long thread from the natural pimple, and let it come out with it: or let him go, until he grows longer by space, and then let him out.
¶ De cura Alxatrati quae accidit in palpebra superiori.	The treatment of Al-Akhrawi that occurs in the upper eyelid.
Caput XIII.	Chapter XIII: On the Treatment
Quando accidit oculo haec Alxatrati, nominatur Leporina.	When this happens to the eye, it is called Leporina.
Et haec Alxatrati est aut naturalis, aut accidentalis.	And this Al-Akhrawi treatment is either natural or accidental.
Accidentalis ergo fit ex consolidatione uulneris, aut sectionis, aut cauterii, et similium illis.	So this Al-Akhrawi treatment is either from the union of a pimple with a skin fragment, or from a cut, or from cauterization, and similar to these.
Et modus operationis in ea est, ut tu findas illam consolidationem, et ut separes labia eius, et ponas in eo quod est inter ea licinium ex lino, et liges eam, donec sanetur.	And the mode of operation in her is, that you may find her consolidation, and that you separate her lips, and put in it what is between them licinio from linen, and bind her, until she be healed.
Et non oportet, ut utaris in curatione eius rebus quae exiccant et constringunt: nam si tu facis illud, redit Alxatrati deterior quam fuit: imo utere in ea rebus quae mollificant, sicut foenumgraecum: et embroca cum aqua, in qua cocta sit althea, semen lini: et unguento dyaquilon, quod liquefactum sit cum aliquo ex oleis: et inuolue cum eo licinium, et cura cum eo.	And it is not fitting that you should use in her things which dry and constrict, for if you do this, she will return worse than before; but rather use in her things which soften, such as fennel seed: and steep it with water in which althaea has been boiled, linen seed: and unguent with dyaquilon, which is liquid when mixed with some of the oils: and apply licinium to it, and cure with it.
Et thesaurus curationis tuae est, ut coneris omni ingenio, ut non consolidetur, secundum formam quae fuit in primis.	And the treasure of your cure is, that you may seek all contrivance, that she not consolidate, according to the form which she had in the beginning.
Et haec quidem operatio quam diximus, non est nisi quaedam rectificatio Alxatrati, ut non redeat forma loci secundum quod fuit omnino.	And this operation which we have described is nothing else than a certain correction of Albacasis, that she not return to her form, according to which she was entirely.
¶ De cura Alxatrati quae fit in palpebra inferiori, et est rugatio uel contractio sursum ad dextrum et sinistrum.	Regarding the cure of Albacasii which is done in the lower eyelid, and is a rubbing or contraction upward toward the right and left.
Caput XIIII.	Chapter XXII.
Haec Alxatrati quae fit inferius, est quae uere nominatur Alxatrati.	This of Albacasii which is done below is what is truly called Albacasis.
Et est naturalis, et est accidentalis.	And it is natural, and is accidental.
Et accidentalis fit ex uulnere, aut fissura, aut cauterio, et illis similibus.	And the accidental one is done from a wound, or a crease, or a scar, and such like.
Et uia operationis in ea est, ut accipias acum, in qua sit filum duplum, et tingas eam in carnem, et facias eam penetrare a lachrymali sinistro usque ad lachrymale dextrum, donec perueniat filum in duabus extremitatibus carnis.	And the mode of operation in her is, that you take an acorn, in which there are two threads, and touch it to the flesh, and cause it to penetrate from the left tear to the right, until the two ends of the thread come to the flesh.
Deinde extende carnem ad superiora cum acu, et incide eam cum spatumili lato.	Then extend the flesh upward with a nail, and strike it with an awl on the side.
Si ergo redit figura palpebrae secundum quod oportet, est bonum.	If then the form of the eyelid returns according to what is necessary, it is good.
Et si non, accipe radium, et pone ipsum in fissuram, et conuerte cum eo palpebram: et finde duas fissuras in latere interiore palpebrae, et sint extremitates duarum fissurarum ex duobus angulis incisionis, donec concurrant et fiat ex eis angulus: donec quando aggregantur fiat figura earum haec figura, et est litera lauda graeca.	And if not, take a ray, and put it in the crease, and turn it with it: and find two creases on the inner side of the eyelid, and are the ends of the two creases from two angles of incision, until they meet and form one angle: until when they are gathered together, may that figure be made, and is a Greek letter.
Deinde aufer illam carnem per quantitatem, quod est latus eius acutum inferius, ab eo quod sequitur palpebram.	Then remove that flesh by quantity, which is his acute lower side, from him who follows the eyelid.
Deinde aggrega partes separatas: sue eam cum filo lanae.	Then collect the separate parts and sew them together with a woolen thread.
Deinde cura eas cum eo quod diximus, de medicinis mollificantibus, et liciniis, donec sanentur.	Then take care of them with that which I have said, concerning soothing medicines and bandages, until they are healed.
Et si Alxatrati accidat ex fissura, et sutura, aut cauterio: tunc oportet ut findas fissura plana sub pilis palpebrarum, etiam secundum quod praecessit.	And if an axillary wound occurs in a fissure, and needs to be sutured or cauterized: then you should find a flat fissure under the eyelids, also depending on what preceded it.
Deinde separa inter duo labia cum licinio, secundum quod diximus.	Then separate the two lips with a lint, as we have said.
Et summa sermonis de cura Alxatrati, quando est desuper, aut inferius, est, ut currat in ea operatio, secundum quod praeparatur ex forma Alxatrati.	And the main words about the care of axillary wounds, whether they are upper or lower, so that the operation proceeds according to the preparation of Albucasis' form.
Ipsa namque est multarum diuersitatum in forma: et artifex prudens praeparat ingenium cum quocunque modo est possibile ei, donec redire faciat figuram ad formam naturalem, aut prope eam, et ipsemet infirmus, secundum quod conuenit ei ex operatione et instrumentis in plurimis dispositionibus.	For it itself is very different in form: and the skilled craftsman prepares his art with whatever means are possible to him, until he restores the figure to the natural shape, or close to it, and himself also becomes ill, as is fitting for him from the operation and instruments in many dispositions.
¶ De adhaerentia palpebrae oculi cum coniunctiua, aut cornea.	Regarding the adhesion of the eyelid to the conjunctiva, or the cornea.
Caput XV.	Chapter XV
Quandoque accidit haec consolidatio multis hominibus, ita ut consolidetur palpebra superior cum albedine oculi, et prohibeat ipsum ab operationibus suis naturalibus.	And when this consolidation has happened to many people, so that the upper eyelid is consolidated with the white of the eye, and prevents itself from its own natural operations.
Oportet ergo quod intromittas extremitatem radii sub palpebra, et eleues eam sursum: aut extendas eam cum uncino: deinde incide adhaerentiam cum spatumili subtili, quod non sit cum acuitate incisionis spatumilium, imo sit obtusum parumper: ut non inquietetur infirmus apud operationem, et remoueatur spatumile, et laedat oculum cum acuitate sua: et sit incisio tua quasi tu excories illam adhaerentiam cum facilitate, donec quando redit palpebra secundum formam suam naturalem, et sanetur adhaerentia tota.	Then you should insert the tip of a ring under the eyelid and lift it up: or you should extend it with a hook: then cut the adhesion with a sharp knife, which is not acute in cutting the skin of a hook, but rather slightly obtuse: so that the sick person does not disturb at the operation, and removes the hook, and hurts his eye with its sharpness: and make your incision as if you were removing it, until when he returns the eyelid to its own natural form, and heals the adhesion entirely.
Funde tunc in oculum aquam salsam, cum aqua ablue ipsum: aut distilla in ipsum ex sief facto, ex ziniar dissoluto cum aqua.	Then pour into his eye warm salt water, washing it with water: or distil into his eye from a distilled wine made from a dissolved zinc, with water.
Deinde separa inter palpebram et oculum cum licinio lini: et pone super oculum lanam infusam cum albugine oui: et post diem tertium utere sief, et cum solidatiuis, donec sanetur.	Then separate the eyelids from the eye with a blade of iron: and place on the eye wool dipped in alum; and after three days use seif, and with solidatives, until it heals.
¶ De incisione ungulae et eminentiae carnis lachrymarum.	On cutting the nail and the eminence of the flesh of the lacrimal gland.
Caput XVI.	Chapter XVI. On the incision of the nail and the emin
Scias, quod ungula est secundum duos modos.	Know that the nail is made in two ways.
Aut est neruosa: et est similis sifac duro, subtili.	Or it is nervous: and it is similar to soft, tough sikfah, delicate.
Aut est non neruosa, similis humiditati congelatae albae: quae quando tangit cam ferrum, aut conaris capere eam cum uncino, abscinditur, et non figitur in ea uncinus.	Or it is not nervous, similar to frozen moisture of snow: which when it touches iron, or is held by a hook, comes off, and does not stick to it.
Et utraeque species non incipiunt, nisi a lachrymali maiore, usquequo uadit paulatim, donec cooperit uisum, et prohibet lumen, et motum oculi.	And the two kinds do not begin to form until from the greater lacrimal gland, gradually, until they have acquired moisture, and prevent light, and eye movement.
Et modus operandi in incisione eius est: ut ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo.	And the method of working on its incision is: so that he may place his head in your lap.
Deinde aperi oculos eius, et eleua palpebram manu tua.	Then open his eyes, and separate his eyelids with your hand.
Deinde collige ungulam cum uncino paucae duplationis, et extende eam ad superiora.	Then take the nail with a small hook, and extend it upwards.
Deinde accipe acum, et intromitte in eam pilum ex pilis equi, et bouis, aut uaccae: et sit filum forte, et duplica extremitatem acus parumper, et fige eam in medio ungulae: et penetra eam cum acu, et liga cum filo ungulam, et extende eam ad superiora: et excoria cum pilo latus ungulae quod sequitur pupillam, ac si tu serres eam cum pilo usque ad postreimnum eius.	Then take a pin and insert it into the nail from among the nails of a horse, or a hook: and make the thread strong, and double its end slightly, and fix it in the middle of the nail: and pierce it with an awl, and tie the nail thread onto it, and extend it upwards: and scrape off with a hair the side of the nail that follows the pupil, as if you were closing it up with hair until the very edge of its rear end.
Deinde incide residuum in radice lachrymalis cum spatumili subtili, aut cum forficibus paruis: et dimitte carnem lachrymalis naturalem, ut non accidat ex incisione eius cursus lachrymarum assiduus.	Then make a small incision in the root of the lacrimal gland with a sharp scalpel, or with small forceps: and remove the natural tissue of the lacrimal gland, so that no constant flow of tears occurs from its incision.
Et quandoque extenditur ungula cum uncino solo: aut cum filo, sicut diximus.	And when the nail is extended with a hook alone: or with thread, as we have said.
Deinde excoriatur cum spatumili leni, cuius haec est forma.	Then scrape with a soft sponge, this is its shape.
Et caue, ne tangat spatumile tunicam corneam, et accidat in ea ruptura, et perforetur pupilla.	And let not the sponge touch the horny tunic, and let not an injury occur to it, and let not the pupil be punctured.
Deinde post incisionem, proice in oculum aliquid salis contriti, aut ex sief facto ex ziniar, et dimitte ipsum usque ad diem alium.	Then after the incision, pour into the eye some ground salt, or from a piece of zinc made from zinc, and leave it alone until another day.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod oportet, usquequo sanetur.	Then care for the eye with what is necessary, until it heals.
Quod si ungula est non neruosa, et non potes intromittere in eam acum, neque figitur in ea uncinus, tunc multotiens curatur haec species ungulae cum medicinis, et sanatur sicut narraui in diuisione.	If the nail is not nerveous, and you cannot insert an acumen into it, nor does it hurt when you push on it, then often this nail-species with medicines is cured, and heals as if told in division.
Quod si uis incidere eam, tunc aperi oculum infirmi, et accipe spatumile subtile, lene, debilis acuitatis, secundum hanc formam.	If you want to cut it open, then open the eye with care, and take a soft sponge, mild of touch, this shape is in accordance with.
Et rade ungulam desuper rasione cum subtilitate.	And shave the nail from the top with care.
Quod si uides quod ipsa rarificatur et confringitur, et imprimit in eam rasio, tunc distilla ex hora tua in oculum ex sief facto ex ziniar, aut ex sief rubeo, aut sale trito: et opila oculum usque ad diem alium.	If you see that it is getting thinner and wrinkling, and the shave impresses into it, then distil from your own hour in the eye from ground zinc, or from red zince, or from salt finely-ground: and rub the eye until another day.
Deinde itera super ipsam operationem, donec remoueatur totum eius.	Then repeat the operation on it again, until you remove all of it.
Nisi contrarium sit tibi in oculo apostema calidum: tunc enim dimitte ipsam, et cura apostema, donec sanetur.	Unless otherwise it is good for you in your eye a hot aposteme: then, however, let go of it, and care for the aposteme until it heals.
Deinde itera operationem super ipsam cum rasione, donec sanetur.	Then repeat the operation on the same again with the shave, until it heals.
Eminentia autem carnis lachrymalis, si nocet in oculo nocumento magno, suspendatur cum uncino, et incide ex ea partem eius: et non ultimes incisionem, ut non accidat cursus lachrymarum.	Except if the flesh is not painful to the eye, it should be suspended with a hook, and cut off from that part of it: and do not make the last incision, so that the course of the tears does not run.
Deinde stilla in lachrymale sief rubeum, aut factum ex ziniari, donec sanetur.	Then pour into the tear canal ground red zince, or made from zinc, until it heals.
¶ De incisione Alguardenic, et carne nata in oculo.	From the incision of Albucasis, and the flesh that has grown up in the eye.
Caput XVII.	Chapter XVII.
Nascitur quandoque in quibusdam oculis hominum caro rubea composita, uel superposita, donec cooperit pupillam, aut appropinquat, aut stringit super palpebras, et fortasse conuertit palpebras ad exteriora: et assimilatur rosae balaustinae.	The flesh becomes red in some men's eyes, mixed or laid on, until it covers the pupil, or approaches it, or tightens it over the eyelids, and perhaps turns the eyelids outward: and the rosace expands.
Et operatio in ea etiam est, ut ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo.	And the operation is also that he should put his injured head in your lap.
Deinde aperi oculos eius, et collige illam carnem totam cum uncinis conuenientibus ad illud: et tene illud cum forcipe uno, aut gesti.	Then open his eyes, and pull out all the flesh with suitable hooks: and hold it with one forceps or another.
Deinde incide carnem in primis, donec finiatur totum eius cum incisorio.	Then cut the flesh first, until you have finished all of it with a knife.
Et caue ab oculo, ut non laedas ipsum apud operationem: et sit incisio tua qua ipsam incidis, aut cum spatumili, quod narrauimus in incisione ungulae: aut cum forficibus paruis, cum quibus colligitur asebel, secundum quod ueniet forma eius post hoc capitulum.	And be careful from the eye, so that you do not hurt him during the operation: and let your incision be such that it reaches all of him with a knife, or with a chisel, which we described in cutting the nail: or with small forceps, by which the flesh is held fast, seconding how his shape will come after this skull.
Cum ergo completur incisio tua, et remouetur tota alguardenici, tunc imple oculum ex sale contrito: aut distilla in eum puluerem rubeum, et similia illi ex medicinis corrosiuis: et pone super oculum deforis cottum cum albugine oui: ut securetur ab apostemate calido.	When your incision is complete, and all the aloes has been removed, then fill his eye with a crushed salt: or distil into it red powder, and similar substances from the medicines that burn: and put on top of the eye a cotton pad with alum: so that it is protected from burning heat.
Quod si remanet ex alguardenici aliquid, et dominatur tibi sanguis calidus, et times apostema calidum: tunc dimitte oculum, et cura ipsum cum eo quod sedat apostema.	That if some of the aloes remains, and warm blood remains with you, and be careful about a hot aposteme: then let go of the eye, and take care of him while he sits with an aposteme.
Deinde itera super ipsum cum operatione, donec sanetur.	Then repeat the operation on him again, until he is healed.
Et similiter fac cum carne addita quae accidit in oculo ex hac specie.	And also do the same with the flesh added which has happened in the eye from this kind.
Verumtamen oportet, ut alienes curationem omnis oculi debilis ex uia naturali, aut ex uia accidentali, operando cum ferro: et non intromittas manum tuam in aliqua harum operationum, donec uideas, quod illud membrum est tolerans illam operationem.	However, it is necessary that you keep away from all weak eyes the cure from natural or accidental ways, working with iron: and do not put your own hand into any of these operations, until you have finished, for that member is able to endure such an operation.
¶ De collectione Sebel ex oculo.	On the Collection of Sebum from the Eye.
Caput XVIII.	Head XVIII.
Sebel sunt uenae rubeae quae texuntur super oculum, et prohibent uisui operationem suam: et debilitant oculum cum longitudine dierum.	There are red swellings that cover the eye and prevent it from being operated on; and they weaken the eye with the passage of time.
Necesse est ergo tibi in primis, ut consideres, si oculus in quo est Sebel, est fortis, et non est in eo aegritudo aliqua, praeter Sebel: tunc collige Sebel eius.	For this reason, first of all, you must consider whether the eye on which Sebel lies is strong and has no other disease except Sebel: then remove Sebel from it.
Et est, ut praecipias infirmo, ut ponat caput suum in sinu tuo.	And is it not as you command the sick to put their head in your lap?
Deinde suspende illas uenas cum uncino uno, aut duobus secundum prudentiam tuam: et sit uncinus subtilis duplationis, secundum hanc formam, aut sint duo uncini gradat in corpore uno, secundum hanc formam.	Then hang up these swells with one or two hooks according to your discretion: and may the hook be thin, according to this shape, or may there be two hooks placed at a distance in the body, according to this shape.
Deinde collige cum forficibus subtilibus illas uenas cum subtilitate, et absterge sanguinem hora post horam, donec uideas illas uenas remoueri ex oculo, et resoluuntur: et caue ne laedas oculum cum extremitatibus spatumilis.	Then take these swells with thin forceps with care, and wipe away the blood hour by hour until you remove those swells from the eye, and they heal up: and be careful not to leave the eye with any sharp edges.
Et sit operatio tua in meridie coram sole, et sis firmus in operatione tua ualde: ut non incidas nisi illas uenas.	And let your operation take place in the middle of the day and be firm in your operation: so that you do not fall on those swells.
Et cum tu expleueris, tunc distilla in oculum sief uiride, aut rubeum: ut sua acuitate corrodat quod remansit ex sebel.	And when you have drained it, then sprinkle the eye with green or red pepper so that its original sharpness may eat away what remains of Sebel.
Si autem non est tibi possibile colligere illud totum in illa hora, tunc emplastra oculum cum eo, quod sedat dolorem oculi: et dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot, donec sedetur dolor eius: et securetur ab apostemate calido: deinde itera super ipsum secundum modum eundem, donec sanetur.	But if you cannot collect all of it in that hour, then plug the eye with something that soothes the pain of the eye: and leave it for a few days until the pain subsides: and keep it away from heat: then repeat over the same spot according to this method, until it heals.
Et haec est forma forficis.	And this is the shape of the forceps.
¶ De reductione Arissati ad nasum.	(For reducing arsis to the nose.)
Caput XIX.	Chapter XIX.
Nominant medici Arissati Fistulam, quam curas cum cauterio, aut cum medicina acuta comburente, secundum quod praecessit eius narratio.	The doctors say that Arsis should be operated on with a sharp instrument or a strong medicine: according to what went before in his narrative.
Et si non sanatur, tunc non est ingenium in ea: nisi ut findas super apostema apud natiuitatem eius, et extrahas totam humiditatem quae est in eo et pus, donec detegatur os.	And if it does not heal, then it is no skill in it: unless you find on the swelling that appears at birth and squeeze out all the moisture that is in it until the hole is discovered.
Cum ergo detegitur os, et uides in eo corruptionem, aut nigredinem, tunc rade ipsum cum instrumento, cuius forma est haec.	As soon as the bone is detected, and you see corrosion or blackening in it, then cut it off with this instrument, whose shape is like this.
Et nominatur Asperi capitis.	And it is called the chisel of the head.
Fiat ex ferro indo, et sit caput eius rotundum sicut azir, quod sit punctatum punctatione limae, aut punctatione aliskilferi punctatione subtili: et pone ipsum super locum corruptum ossis.	Let it be made of iron and be round like a chisel, that is to say, marked with the file, or with a sharp point from a sharp instrument, fine and subtle: and place the bone on the corrupt site.
Deinde reuolue ipsum inter digitos tuos, et tu preme manum tuam parumper, donec scias quod illa corruptio iam rasa est: et fac illud aliquotiens.	Then turn the bone between your fingers and press your hand lightly, until you know that that corruption is now worn away: and do it several times.
Deinde restaura locum cum medicinis exiccatiuis stipticis.	Then restore the site with dry Styptic.
Si ergo consolidatur locus, et nascitur in eo caro, et abscinditur cursus saniei: et remanet quadraginta diebus, et non renouatur, et non apostematur, et non accidit in eo accidens: tunc scias quia iam sanatus est.	If then the site is healed and a bone grows up in it, and the wound heals over: and remains for forty days, and does not break out again, or happen to it any accident: then you shall know that it is now healed.
Et si non, tunc non est in eo ingenium, nisi reducere fistulam ad foramen nasi, secundum hanc formam.	And if not, then there is no skill, unless the tube is reduced to the cavity of the nose, according to this form.
Et est, ut detegas ab osse secundo cum ferro, aut cum medicina acuta: et cum detectum est os, tunc accipe terebrum secundum hanc formam, sit extremitas ferrea, triangulata: et lignum eius sit pyramis extenuata usque ad extremitatem, sicut uides.	And is, that you should discover a second bone by means of iron, or with sharp medicine: and when the bone has been detected, then take a chisel, second, whose end is metal and triangular: and make its wood like a pyramid extended to the end, as you see it.
Deinde pone illud super os ipsum: et sit illud prope lachrymale: et elonga manum tuam ab oculo parum.	Then place it on the bone itself: and let it be near the tear: and extend your hand from the eye a little way.
Deinde reuolue manum tuam cum terebro, donec penetret os, et sentiat illud infirmus: per hoc quod inuenit uentum exire ex eo, quando tenet manum suam super nasum suum.	Then turn your hand with the chisel, until it penetrates the bone, and feels weak: by this you shall know that heat is issuing from it, when it holds your hand on its nose.
Ergo tunc restaura locum cum medicinis stipticis exiccantibus, sicut docui te.	Thus then restore the site with dry Styptic as I taught you.
Cum ergo nascitur caro, et induratur locus: tunc materia quae effundebatur ad exteriora, redit ad nasum: est ergo leuius illud super infirmum.	When then a bone grows up and the site hardens: then the matter that flowed out to the outside returns to the nose: so it is lighter over the weak one.
¶ De reductione eminentiae Oculi.	On the Emphasis of Eye Reduction
Caput XX.	Chapter XX.
Quando eminet Oculus cum totalitate sua, et non accidit in uisu nocumentum, neque diminutio: tunc oportet ut soluas infirmum: deinde phlebotomes eum: postea ponas uentosas in ceruice absque scarificatione, sed cum suctione.	When the eye emerges whole, and does not cause harm to the sight or diminution thereof: then it is fitting that you should resolve the disease by bleeding: afterwards, you should apply poultices on the eyelid without scarring, but with suction.
Deinde pone super Oculum linimentum quod fit ex acacia, et aloe, et olibano, et sarcocolla.	Then place on the eye a liniment made of acacia, aloe, incense, and sheepswool.
Deinde stringe Oculum desuper super emplastrum cum puluillis multis.	Then tighten the eye above with a cloth with a lot of powder.
Et modus puluillorum est: ut accipias pannos lenes, multos, et duplicetur omnis pannus ex eis super quatuor: fac ex eis multos: deinde pone eos unum super alium, secundum quantitatem qua indiget Oculus: deinde stringe super ipsos cum panno duro strictura forti.	And the mode of the powder is this: that you take soft cloths, many and twice as much of each cloth; make them into many: then place them one on top of the other, according to the quantity needed for the eye: then tighten them together with a tight cloth.
Et itera uentosas cum suctione sine scarificatione.	And repeat the poultices with suction without scarring.
Deinde aufer uentosas, et dimitte oculum strictum die et nocte.	Then remove the poultices and leave the eye tightened during the day and night.
Si autem ligamentum iterum mollificatur, tunc oportet ut stringatur multum: deinde aufer ligamentum post diem et noctem, sicut diximus.	But if the ligature again softens, then it is fitting that it should be tightened a lot: then remove the ligature after day and night, as we have said.
Si ergo uides oculum iam redisse uuae tunicae, est bonum: et si non, tunc itera emplastrum, et puluillos, et stricturam, et uentosas, donec sanetur.	If therefore the eye is already red and you have used new ointments, it is good: and if not, then repeat the poultices, and the tightening, and the poultices, until the eye is healed.
¶ De incisionie Vuae tunicae.	On the Incision of the King's Ointment
Caput XXI.	Chapter XXI.
Quando accidit disruptio in tunica Vuea, deinde eminet et procedit extra palpebras sicut granum Vuae, et foedatur forma hominis propter illud, et uis incidere illud: tunc operatio in eo est, secundum quod narro: et est, ut intromittas acum in radice Vuae ab inferiori ad superiorem partem.	When the disruption has occurred in the King's ointment, then let it emerge and proceed outside the eyelids like a grain of wheat, and form the shape of a human being for it, so that the eye may strike it: then the operation is in it according to what the narrows: and is, so that you introduce water in the root of the King from below to above.
Deinde intromitte acum aliam in qua sit filum duplum a parte lachrymalis, et fac eam penetrare: et dimitte acum primam secundum dispositionem suam.	Then introduce another acum where there is a double filament on the lacrimal side, and let it penetrate: then remove the first according to its disposition.
Deinde incide locum fili dupli, et liga cum eo partem Vuae in circumitu acus: et stringe eam multum.	Then cut a place for a son of two, and bind it with him on the side of the King in the orbit of the needle: and tighten it much.
Deinde extrahe acum, et pone super oculum lanam infusam in albugine oui: et dimitte eum, donec cadat filum cum Vua.	Then extract the acumen, and place it over the eye with wool immersed in albae [a kind of poultice]: and let it go until it falls with the thread with the King's side.
Deinde cura oculum cum eo, quod confortat ipsum, donec sanetur uulnus.	Then care for the eye with him, which comforts itself, until the wound heals.
Et quandoque stringitur Vua ab omni parte cum circulo ex panno, donec addat oculus eminentiam magnam.	And whenever the King is tightened from all sides with a circle of cloth, until he adds to the eye a great eminence.
Deinde perforetur cum spatumili subtili, quod perueniat ad profundum oculi, et currat humiditas albuginea, et descendat oculus, et ingrediatur statim: deinde stringe eum, donec sanetur.	Then pierce with a fine needle that it reaches to the depth of the eye, and curries away albae [a kind of poultice], and falls down the eye, and goes in at once: then tighten it up until it heals.
¶ De curatione Alcomnati.	¶ Of the cure of Al-Baqī' s case.
Caput XXII.	Head XXII.
Haec Aegritudo quae nominatur Alcomnati, non, est nisi sanies, quae aggregatur in oculo, similis aquae descendenti, et non est ipsa.	This disorder called Al-Baqī' s, is not but a mucus gathered in the eye, similar to water that has dropped down, and it is not that itself.
Et modus operandi in ea est, ut facias sedere infirmum super sedem praeparatum, uel directum.	And the mode of operation in this case is, so that you make the sick person sit on a prepared chair, or straight.
Deinde accipe caput eius manibus tuis a partibus duabus, et moue ipsum, donec uideas saniem peruenire ad inferiora oculis tuis.	Then take his head in your hands from the two parts, and move it, until you feel the mucus coming to the lower part of your eyes.
Deinde figatur, et non descendat, et absoluatur lumen: et uideat infirmus res sicut uidebat: et si non descendit inferius, scias quia est aqua.	Then cover it up, and let it not fall down, and let the light be complete: and let the sick person see things as he used to: and if it did not fall down below, you shall know that it is water.
Si autem non praeparatur descensus saniei cum eo quod diximus, tunc fac sedere infirmum inter manus tuas.	If, however, the descent of the mucus with him which we have said does not prepare, then make the sick person sit between your hands.
Deinde accipe spatumile subtile, et finde cum eo supra panniculum corneum parumper apud continuationem coniunctiuae cum tunica cornea in corona, donec egrediatur sanies.	Then take a fine needle and find it with him on top of the horny layer just at the junction with the corneal veil in the crown, until the mucus comes out.
Cum ergo egreditur, tunc distilla in oculum aquam calidam in qua miscuisti mel: aut aquam in qua iam bullisti foenumgraecum et mel: deinde curetur cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	When, however, it has come out, then distill into the eye a hot water in which you have already mixed haygrass and honey: or water in which you have already bulled haygrass and honey: and then care for the rest of the cure, until it heals.
¶ De cura aquae, quae descendit in oculo, uel cataracta.	Regarding the treatment of water that has entered the eye, or a waterfall.
Caput XXIII.	Chapter XXII.
Iam Diximus species aquae in diuisione, et quae conuenit ad perforandum sermone declarante et exponente, tunc accipe illud idem secundum sanitatem.	We have already discussed the different types of water and what is suitable for incisions, each according to its nature, explaining and demonstrating it. Then take the same one according to health.
Tunc ergo oportet ut facias sedere infirmum inter manus tuas quadratum, oppositum lumini, prope solem: et liga oculum eius sanum, et stringe eum ualde: deinde palpebram oculi eius manu tua dextra, si oculus in quo est aqua, est oculus sinister: aut manu tua sinistra, si oculus est dexter.	Then let the sick person sit between your hands, facing towards the light, near the sun: and bind his healthy eye, and tighten it tightly: then with your right hand, if the water has entered the left eye, close the left eye with your palm: or with your left hand, if the water has entered the right eye.
Deinde accipe manu tua dextra almagda, si oculus est sinister: aut manu tua sinistra, si oculus est dexter.	Then take alum with your right hand, if the eye is on the left: or with your left hand, if the eye is on the right.
Deinde pone extremitatem almagda prope coronam per grossitudinem radii in ipsa albedine oculi apparente lachrymalis minoris: deinde impelle almagda cum uirtute: et tu reuoluis cum eo manum tuam, donec penetret in albuginem oculi: et sentias, quod almagda iam peruenit ad rem uacuam.	Then place the end of the alum, by its thickness, towards the crown of the eye, in the same direction as the tear film, and push it in with force: and you will feel that the alum has entered the eye's white part; and sense, that the alum has reached the lacrimal canal.
Et oportet, ut sit mensura itineris almagda ad profundum, mensura spacii quod est a pupilla usque ad finem nigredinis: et est corona oculi.	And it is necessary that the length of the alum's journey to the eye's depth be a measure of the space between the pupil and the end of the blackness; and this is the crown of the eye.
Uidebis enim ea in ipsa pupilla uisione oculi, propter claritatem tunicae corneae.	You will see it in the same pupil of the eye' vision, because of the clarity of the cornea.
Deinde pone almagda usque ad locum in quo est aqua.	Then place the alum until it reaches the spot where the water is.
Deinde preme ipsum inferius uice una post aliam.	Then push with your thumb from below, once on either side.
Si ergo descendit aqua statim, tunc infirmus uidet illud super quod aperit uisum suum statim, et almagda in oculo suo.	If the water has entered immediately, then the sick person will see it immediately, and the alum will be in his eye.
Deinde quiescas paululum.	Then rest for a little while.
Si ergo descendat aqua, tunc depone eam secundo, praeter quod egrediatur almagda.	If the water has entered, then place it again, except that it comes out of the alum.
Quando ergo figitur, et non ascendit: tunc extrahe almagda cum facilitate: et tu reuoluis manum tuam paulatim.	When it is set and does not come up: then remove the alum with ease: and you will feel your hand moving slowly.
Deinde dissolue in aqua aliquid ex sale claro gemmae: et ablue cum eo oculum deintus.	Then dissolve a little in water from the clear salt gem; and wash with it the eye inside out.
Deinde pone extra oculum totum stuppam, aut lanam infusam oleo rosato, et albugine oui: et liga cum eo oculum sanum.	Then put outside all of the eyeball, or a cloth soaked in rose oil and alba, and bind with it the healthy eye:
Nos autem, et illi qui sunt nostri temporis, ponimus super eum ciminum tritum cum albumine oui.	We and also those who are our time, put on him crushed cumin mixed with alba;
Quod si non obedit tibi almagda ad introitum in oculum propter duriciem suam, quoniam ex hominibus est, cuius oculus est durus ualde: tunc oportet ut accipias spatumile, quod nominatur Alberid, cuius haec est forma.	That if he does not obey you the almagda to the entrance in the eye because of his hardness, since he is a man, whose eye is very hard: then it shall be necessary that you take the spatumile, which is called Alberid, whose this is the form.
Pefora ergo cum eo ipsam coniunctiuam tantum, et non ultimes manum tuam in foramine: et non est nisi ut facias uiam ad almagda locum subtilem.	Open then with it the same connection only, and not the last hand of your; and is there is not a place but you make the place for the almagda soft.
Deinde intromitte almagda, secundum quod diximus.	Then introduce the almagda, according to which we have said.
Et apud complementum operis tui, praeparetur infirmo dormitorium decenter factum, in quo dormiat super dorsum suum in domo tenebrosa: et prohibeatur ab omnibus motibus, et a tussi: et pone cibum eius illud quo lenitur natura eius: et non moueat caput suum dextra, neque sinistra omnino.	And near the complement of your work, let be prepared sick bed poorly made, in which he sleeps on his back in a dark house; and forbid him from all movement, and from coughing: and put food for him that which nature heals: and do not move his head to the right, nor at all to the left.
Et sit ligamentum secundum dispositionem suam usque ad diem tertium.	And let him sit the ligature according to his will until the third day.
Deinde solue illud in illa domo tenebrosa, et experire uisum eius: et fac eum uidere res.	Then dissolve that in that dark house, and examine his vision: and let him see things.
Deinde reduc ligamentum usque ad diem septimum.	Then reduce the ligature until the seventh day.
Et non oportet ut faciat illud in hora curationis, aut post incisionem statim: imo oportet, ut alienes illud: propterea quod aqua ascendit uelociter per aspectum uehementem.	And is not necessary that he does it in the hour of cure, or immediately after the incision: but let him keep away from it, because water rises quickly through the veiny aspect.
Si autem accidit apostema calidum: tunc oportet ut soluas oculum ante septimum: et rectifica illud cum eo quod sedat apostema, donec sedatur: tunc absolue ipsius uisum, et pone super faciem eius orale quo regatur uisus eius sub eo diebus aliquot, ipso existente in illa domo tenebrosa.	But if it happens that the apostema is hot: then let you open the eye before the seventh day: and straighten it with him that sits down the apostema, until he sits down: then let you check his vision, and let put over the face of his oral where regulates his vision under this its days, while he exists in that dark house.
Deinde egrediatur a domo gradatim, et conuersetur in casis suis.	Then he shall leave the house step by step, and turn to his own bed.
Et scias, quod in zaltea non excusatur discipulus a uisione aliquotiens: tunc enim audeat super operationem.	And you know that a student is not absolved from a few doshas of sleep: then he should dare to do the operation.
Et iam quidem peruenit ad nos quidam ex illis qui sunt de Alayrach, qui dixit, quod factum fuit in Alayrach magdan perforatum, quo sugitur aqua.	And indeed some of them have reached us from Al-Ayn who said that it was done in Al-Ayn to make a hole with a needle so that water is sucked up.
Verum ergo non uidi aliquem in terra uostra, qui fecerit illud: neque legi illud in aliquo ex libris antiquorum: et est possibile, ut sit illud nouum.	But in truth I have not seen anyone on earth do that, and I have not found it written in any of the old books, and it is possible that it should be new.
Et istae sunt formae specierum ex magda, ut stet super ea qui ea ignorat.	And these are the forms of the instruments so that they stand on them who do not know them.
Fiant ex aere proprie: et sint extremitates eorum cum hac eadem subtilitate triangulatae, et extremitas acuta.	Let them be made of pure brass; and let their ends be with this same subtle triangular shape, and the sharp end.
Formae magda.	Magda's shapes.
¶ De cura Carnis natae in naso.	Regarding the cure for the birth of a nose.
Caput XXIIII.	Chapter XXIV.
Quandoque nascuntur in naso Carnes diuersae additae, ex quibus est aliquid quod assimilatur scorpioni multorum pedum: et ex ea est caro cancerosa, lapidea, fusci coloris: et ex ea est quae est caro lenis, non fusci coloris.	When and because different kinds of meat are added to it, some of which is absorbed by the many-legged scorpion, and from that comes a scaly, light-colored flesh; and from that comes a soft, non-bright-colored meat.
In ea ergo quae ex istis carnibus est lenis, non fraudulenta, neque cancerosa, oportet ut facias sedere infirmum inter manus tuas oppositum soli, et aperi nares eius, et proiice uncinum in illas carnes: deinde trahe eas ad exteriora, et incide quod comprehendisti ex eis cum spatumili subtili acuto a parte una, donec scias quod caro tota iam ablata est.	In the meat from which there is a soft, not deceitful, and no cancerous part, you should make a seat for the sick between your hands opposite the sun, and open his nostrils, and throw in them a sharp needle from one side: then take them to the outside, and cut off what you have grasped with a sharp, acute scissor from one side, until you know that all the meat has been removed.
Quod si remaneret aliquid ex ea cuius abscisio non est possibilis: tunc rade illud cum uno instrumentorum subtilium cum facilitate, donec non remaneat ex eo aliquid.	What if anything remained of which it is not possible to cut off: then shave it with one sharp instrument so easily until nothing remains of it.
Si autem sanguis tibi dominatur, aut accidat apostema calidum: tunc oppone ei per id quod oportet: aut est ex apostematibus malignis, tunc propera cauterizando eum, donec abscindatur sanguis, et auferantur omnes carnes.	But if your blood is in charge of you, or an accident happens to become hot: then oppose it by what is necessary: or is it from the malicious apostemas, then approach it with cauterizing, until the blood is separated, and all flesh is removed.
Deinde proiiciatur in nasum post incisionem acetum, et aqua, aut uinum.	Then let it be applied to the nose after a sharp incision, and water or wine.
Si autem aperitur nasus, et procedat ex eo humiditas usque ad palatum, tunc scias quia iam sanus est.	But if the nose is opened, and moistness proceeds therefrom as far as the palate, then you shall know that it is already well.
Si uero non penetrat humiditas, secundum quod oportet, tunc scias quod intra ipsum est caro nata in superioribus ossibus naris, ad quae non peruenit cum incisione instrumentum.	But if the moisture does not penetrate, as it should, then you shall know that there is bone born within the upper nasal bones, to which the knife does not reach with the incision.
Tunc ergo oportet, ut intromittas filum lini cui sit quaedam grossitudo, et noda in eo nodos multos: et pone inter omnem nodum quantitatem digiti, aut minus: et ingeniet infirmus, ut mittat extremitatem unam fili in nasum cum radio, aut cum quo possibile est ei postquam fecerit ipsum simile azer: et trahat odoratum suum, donec perueniat usque ad caassum, et egrediatur super guttur suum.	Then it is necessary that you introduce a twig of a certain thickness, and there are many knots in it; and place a quantity of the finger, or less, between each knot; and let go the injured person, so that he sends one end of the thread into the nose with a nail, or with whatever is possible for him to do after he has done himself similar injury: and let him pull his sense of smell, until it reaches the throat, and go out over his throat.
Et multotiens quidem faciunt simile huic Attomi pueri in scholis: et est res facilis ei, qui uult.	And often this same boy does such a thing in school; and it is an easy thing for him who wants to do it.
Deinde pone duas extremitates fili, extremitatem unam quae egreditur super nasum, et alteram quae remansit in naso.	Then place the two ends of the thread, the end that goes out over the nose, and the other that remains in the nose.
Deinde ac ministra serraturam carnis cum nodis qui sunt in filo.	Then let the knotted thread lie tight against the tissue with the knots in the thread.
Fac illud donec scias quod carnes iam sunt cum nodis fili.	Let it be so that you know that the tissue is already with the knots of the thread.
Deinde extrahe filum: et pone in nasum post abstersionem sanguinis licinium quod imbibisti in unguento aegyptio: fac illud tribus diebus, aut plus, donec unguentum corrodat totum quod remansit ex carnibus.	Then pull out the thread: and place in the nose after the removal of blood a liquid that you have soaked in Egyptian ointment; do it for three days, or more, until the ointment has corroded all that is left of the flesh.
Deinde pone in fine rei in nasum cannulam de plumbo, diebus aliquot, donec sanetur.	Then place in the end of the thing in the nose a plumb-pipe, for several days, until it is healed.
Si autem indiget curatione quae exiccet, utere illa.	But if it needs healing that dries up, then use that.
Ad caputpurgium faciendum, cum quo distillantur olea, et aliae medicinae in nasum, fac illud ex argento, aut aere: quod sit simile lampadi paruae, apertum sicut conchula: et meatus eius similiter.	For the making of a nasal douche, with which to pour out oil, and other medicine into the nose, let it be made of silver or brass: that it may be like a small lamp, opened as an oyster shell: and its outlet in a similar way.
Et si uis fac cannulam clausam, sicut canna.	And if you wish to make a closed tube, like a cane.
Et conchula instrumenti ad caputpurgium faciendum, sit plena, detecta: cui sit manubrium in postremo eius, cum quo teneas ipsam, quando calefacis in ea oleum, aut quod uis ex succis, et rebus fluxibilibus.	And if you wish to make a closed tube for lavage, it should be full and sealed: its handle at the end, which you hold, while you heat oil in it or that which you wish to extract and liquids.
Et haec est forma instrumenti.	And this is the shape of the instrument.
¶ De cura Thelul nasi.	On the care of the nose.
Caput XXV.	Head XXXV.
Multotiens nascitur in extremitate nasi Thelul, et magnificatur, et augmentatur cum diebus, donec foedus fit aspectus eius.	The ulcer often grows at the tip of the nose and becomes larger with time until it makes a crater-like indentation in the skin.
Et propter illud oportet, ut in cidas illud in principio apparitionis eius, et eradices totum eius.	And for this, when it first appears, you should cut off all of it.
Deinde pone super locum, aut cauterium, aut medicinam comburentem quae stat loco eius.	Then place over the spot, or poultice, or burning medicine that remains in the spot.
Si ergo tardatur incisio eius, donec magnificetur, tunc considera, si est lapideum, durum, fusci coloris, pauci sensus: tunc non tangas ipsum cum ferro: quoniam apostema est cancerosum.	But if the cutting of it is delayed until it has become larger, then examine it, if it is hard, dull in color, and dull in smell: then do not touch it with fire: for an ulcer is a cancerous thing.
Multotiens enim uidi, qui incidit hmoni apostema, et accidit ex eo malicia magna super illum qui ipsum habebat.	For many times the eye that has been wounded by an arrow and has had an ulcer, and from it have come great malicious things upon the one who had it.
Et si apostema est lenis tactus, non fusci coloris, et uides quod incisio possibilis est in toto eius, tunc euacua infirmum, et incide ipsum sine timore, absque pauore: et cura locum cum eo quod exiccat et constringit, donec sanetur.	And if the ulcer is a gentle touch, not dull in color, and you see that the cutting of it is possible throughout its whole length, then wash it with water, and cut off the one, without fear, and without dread: and take care of the place along with it, until it heals.
¶ De sutura nasi, et labii, et auris.	On the suture of the nose, and the lips, and the ears.
Caput XXVI.	Head XXVI.
Scias Quia quando accidit solutio continuitatis in una harum cartilaginum, parum confert in ea operatio, nisi in quibusdam hominibus.	You should know That when there occurs a separation of the cartilage of one of these joints, then the operation is little done unless in some men.
Oportet ergo quando accidit alicui aliquid ex illo, ut consideres, si est uulnus recens cum sanguine suo: et tunc aggrega duolabia uulneris cum sutura: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then you should know when it happens to someone, that you should consider, if it is a fresh wound with its own blood: and then add pain to the wound with sutures: and take care of the wound itself, until it heals.
Et si solutionis continuitatis labia iam separata sunt, et facta est unaquaeque pars sana: tunc oportet ut excories omnem partem a cute sua apparente, donec sanguinetur.	And if the continuity of the wound has been separated and some healthy parts have been made: then it is necessary to cut off all the part from its own skin, until it bleeds.
Deinde aggrega duo labia cum sutura, et stringe ea, et pulueriza super ipsum sanguinem draconis, et olibanum trita: et pone supra pulueres frustum emplastri diafinicon, et alicuius alterius ex emplastris consolidatiuis: et dimitte ipsum ligatum duobus diebus, aut tribus.	Then the two lips are joined together with sutures and are tightly tied, and dust is sprinkled on the wound with dragon's blood and ground olive oil: and put over the powders a fragment of plaster of Paris, and some other from the consolidated plasters: and leave it tied for two days, or three.
Deinde solue ipsum, et permuta medicinam: et dimitte ipsum, donec abscindantur fila per se.	Then çöz solve it, and change the medicine: and leave it until the threads separate themselves by themselves.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then care for the wound with ointment, until it heals.
Modus autem suturae est, ut aggreges solutionem continuitatis, aut cum acubus, sicut narrauimus in sutura uentris: aut aggrega solutionem cum filo, sicut feci te scire.	The method of the sutures is, that you gather the solution of continuity, or with the threads, as we told you in the wound of the eye: or you gather the solution with a thread, as I have told you.
¶ De extractione nodorum labiorum.	The extraction of knots from the lips.
Caput XXVII.	The Twenty-Seventh Chapter.
Multis Quidem hominibus accidunt plaerumque in interioribus labiorum suorum apostemata dura similia granis herbi: et quaedam eorum minora, et maiora.	Many people have hard lumps in the inner part of their lips, like little seeds of herbs, and some smaller ones and larger ones.
Ergo oportet ut conuertas labium, et findas super omnem nodum eius, et suspendas ipsum cum uncino, et incidas ipsum ab omni parte.	Therefore it is necessary that you turn over the lips, and find out every knot, and hang them up by a hook, and hit them with a hammer from all sides.
Deinde impleas locum post incisionem zegi trito, donec abscindatur sanguis.	Then fill the place after the incision has been dried three times, until the blood is separated.
Deinde colluatur cum aceto, et curetur locus cum eo, in quo est stipticitas, usquequo sanentur uulnera.	Then it is to be cleaned with vinegar, and the place with it is to be cured until the sores heal.
¶ De incisione carnis natae super gingiuam.	The Incision of flesh that has grown on the gums.
Caput XXVIII.	The Twenty-Eighth Chapter.
Multotiens nascitur super gingiuam caro addiat, quam antiqui nominant abuluss.	Many times a flesh grows on the gums, which the ancient ones call "abuluss".
Oportet ergo ut suspendas eam cum uncino: aut teneas eam cum forcipibus, et incidas eam apud radicem suam, et dimittas saniem currere, aut sanguinem.	Therefore it is necessary that you hang them up by a hook: or hold them with pincers, and hit them at the root, and let the blood run, or let it bleed.And if the incision is on the outside of the gum, you shall put cotton in the wound, and bind it up; and if it is on the inside, you shall put wool thereon, and bind it up: and if it is on the back part of the teeth, you shall put wool in the wound, and
Deinde pone super locum zegi tritum, aut alios pulueres stipticos, exiccatiuos.	Then put on the site three times, or other powder stipulative, drying.
Quod si redit illa caro post curationem, nam multotiens redit, tunc incide eam secundo, et cauteriza ipsam: ipsa namque non redit post cauterium.	That if that flesh returns after cure, for many times it returns, then cut again, and cauterize it: for that does not return after cautery.
¶ De rasione Dentium cum ferro.	¶ Of the reasons of teeth with iron.
Caput XXIX.	Head XXIX.
Quandoque aggregantur in superficiebus Dentium ab interiori et extetiori parte, et inter gingiuas cortices asperi, turpes, et quandoque denigrantur, et citrini fiunt, et uirides, donec peruenit ex illo corruptio ad gingiuam, et foedi fiunt dentes per illud.	When and are gathered in the surfaces of teeth from the interior and exterior part, and between the gums hard skin, sharp, and sometimes denigrantur, and become yellow, and virides, until it comes from that corruption to the gum, and the teeth are foedi per illud.
Oportet ergo ut facias sedere infirmum inter manus tuas, et caput eius in sinu tuo, et rade molam et dentem, in quo apparent tibi cortices, et res similis arenae: donec non remaneat ex eis aliquid, et similiter fac de nigredine, et uiriditate, et citrinitate, et aliis donec mundentur.	Therefore you should make the sick sit between your hands, and his head in your bosom, and saw off the molars and teeth on which appear to you the gums, and such like sand: until there remains nothing of it, and likewise do about the blackness, and viridity, and yellowing, and other things until they are cleansed.
Si ergo auferatur quod in eis est a principio rasionis, bonum est: et si non, tunc itera super eos rasionem die alio, secundo, et tertio, donec ad ultimum perueniat studium in eo quod uis.	But if it is taken away that which is in them from the beginning of the reason, it is good: and if not, then cut again on them a reason another day, second, and third, until the last comes to study in that what you want.
Et scias, quod dens indiget rasoriis diuersarum formarum, multarum figurarum: secundum quod praeparatur operationi tuae: proptera, quod rasorium quo raditur dens ab inferiori parte, est aliud a rasorio quo raditur inter dentes, secundum formas alias.	And you should know that the teeth resist the razors of different shapes and figures: second, that is prepared for your operation: moreover, that the razor with which he saws the teeth from the lower part, is another than the razor with which he saws between the teeth, according to other forms.
Et istae formae rasoriorum sint apud te praeparatae, quas uides.	And these shapes of razors are among you prepared, which you see.
¶ De extractione doloris Dentium.	¶ Of the extraction of pain from teeth.
Caput XXX.	Head XXX.
Oportet ut cures Dentem a dolore suo cum omni ingenio, et tardes in eradicatione eius.	It is necessary that you take care of the tooth with its pain with all your skill, and are tarder in the eradication of it.
Non est enim quod uicem eius suppleat quando eradicatur: quoniam est substantia sublimis: donec quando non est excusatio de eradicatione eius, tunc oportet quando cogitur infirmus eradicare ipsum, ut firmetur, et certificetur apud te dens dolens.	For it is not that the tooth should be suppliant when eradicated: for it is a sublimis substance: until, when there is no excuse for the eradication of it, then it is necessary that when it is sought to eradicate the diseased tooth, so that it hardens, and certifies with you teeth aching.
Multotiens enim decipit infirmum dolor, et putat quia est in dente saha et eradicat ipsum: deinde non recedit dolor, donec eradicetur dens infirmus.	For often pain deceives the sick, and he thinks that the tooth is infected and removes it; then the pain does not leave him until the infected tooth is removed.
Nos enim iam uidimus illud ex operatione phlebotomatorum.	For we have already seen this from the operation of bleeding.
Cum ergo certificatur apud te dens dolens ipsemet, tunc oportet ut scarifices in circumitu dentis cum spatumili, in quo sit quiddam uirtutis, donec soluatur gingiua ab omni parte: deinde moue ipsum digitis tuis, aut cum forcipibus subtilibus in primis paulatim, donec concutias ipsum.	When therefore the tooth is pained by itself, then it is necessary that you make incisions around the tooth with the chisel, in which there is some virtue, until it is healed from all sides: then you remove it with your fingers, or with delicate tweezers at first slowly, until you cut it.
Deinde loca tunc in eo forcipes magnos locatione bona, et caput infirmi inter genua tua: quod iam bene tenuisti, ita quod non moueatur: deinde trahe dentem secundum rectitudinem, ut non frangas ipsum.	Then when you have made a good location with the chisel, and the place is between your knees: which you keep firmly, so that it does not ache; then pull out the tooth after its straight line, so as not to break it.
Si ergo non egreditur, tunc accipe aliquod illorum instrumentorum, et intromitte ipsum sub eo ab omni parte cum facilitate, et conare motionem eius, sicut fecisti in primis.	If then it does not come out, then take some of their instruments, and push it under it from all sides with ease, and try to move it, as you did at first.
Si autem dens est perforatus, aut corrosus: tunc oportet ut impleas illud foramen panno: et stringas ipsum cum extremitate radii subtilis, ut non frangatur in hora constrictionis tuae super ipsum cum forcipibus.	If the tooth is broken or corroded then you must fill it with cloth: and you grasp it with a small rod so that it does not break at the time of your tightening on it with tweezers.
Et oportet, ut exquisite agas cum scarificatione in circumitu gingiuae ab omni parte multum.	And it is necessary that you should carefully make incisions around the gums from all sides.
Et custodi fortitudinem tuam, ut non frangas ipsum, et remaneat pars eius, et redeat super infirmum ex ea malicia quae sit maior dolore eius primo.	And keep your strength, so that you do not break it, and let some part of it remain, and return to the pain from which it was first that is greater in its malice.
Et caue, ne facias illud quod ignorantes faciunt phlebotomatores in festinatione sua, et audacia ipsorum super eradicationem eius, praeter quod administrent illud quod narrauimus.	And beware, do not do what phlebotomators do in their haste and the boldness of their soul in eradicating it, except that they administer to it what we have described.
Multotiens enim faciunt euenire super homines infirmitates magnas, quarum difficiliores sunt ut frangantur, et remaneant radices eius omnes, aut quaedam earum: aut ut extrahant ipsum cum quibusdam ossibus mandibulae: sicut testificati sumus multotiens illud.	For often they bring about great diseases in men, which are more difficult to break, and leave all the roots of it, or some of them: or take it out with some of the bones of the jaw: as we have often witnessed this.
Deinde colluatur post eradicationem eius cum uino, aut cum aceto et sale.	Then, let it be rinsed with wine, or with vinegar and salt, after the removal.
Quod si accidat fluxus sanguinis ex locis (multotiens enim accidit) tunc tere aliquid ex zegi, et imple cum eo locum: et si non, cauteriza ipsum si non confert tibi zegi.	That if it should happen a flow of blood from the places (for often it happens) then dry up some of the wound, and fill with it the place: and if not, cauterize it, if it does not suit you the wound.
Formae forcipum subtilium quibus mouetur dens in primis, sint longarum extremitatum, breuis manubrii, grossi, ut non duplicentur quando cum eis premitur super dentem: sint sicut uides grossorum manubriorum, donec quando stringis cum eis, non dent seipsas, neque duplicentur: breuium extremitatum, et sint ex ferro indo, aut ex faled decenter facti, directarum extremitatum: et in eorum extremitatibus sint dentes, quorum quidam ingrediantur in quosdam, et stringant constrictione decenti, forti.	Form of the forceps is thin which moves the teeth in the first place, have long extremities, short handle, thick, so do not double when pressed on top of the tooth: they are like you see thick handles, until when you press with them, do not bite themselves, and do not double: short extremities, and they are made of iron bar, or from a bent piece of iron, direct extremities: and in their extremities are teeth, some of which enter into some, and by constriction squeeze tightly, firmly.
Et quandoque fiunt extremitates sicut forma oris auis quae nominatur ciconia, et sunt fortis constrictionis.	And when the extremities become like the form of the ear's opening which is called ciconia, and are strong constriction.
¶ De eradicatione Dentium, et extractione ossium mandibularum fractorum.	On the removal of teeth and the breaking of the mandible bones.
Caput XXXI.	Chapter XXXI.
Quando remanet apud eradicationem Dentis qui frangitur aliquid, tunc oportet ut ponas super locum cotum cum butyro die uno, aut duobus diebus, donec mollificetur locus: deinde intromitte ad ipsum algasti, aut forcipes: quorum extremitates assimilantur ori auis quae nominatur ciconia.	When there remains after the removal of a tooth that is broken something, then it should be placed on the place with butter for one or two days, until it becomes soft the place: and then introduce to it the algast or forceps: the extremities of which are similar to the ear' opening which is called ciconia.
Forma autem haec est forcipum.	The form of this is of the forceps.
Sint extremitates eorum factae sicut lima deintus: aut sicut aliskilfegi.	Are extremities made like a lemon inside: or like a horsehair plait.
Si ergo non obedit tibi ad exitum cum istis forcipibus, tunc oportet, ut caues super radicem, et detegas carnem totam, et intromittas instrumentum quod nominatur Palanca parua, cuius forma est haec.	But if it does not obey you to the exit with these forceps, then it should be that you tie on the root, and remove all the flesh, and introduce the instrument which is called a small punch, whose form is this.
Sit breuis extremitatis, grossae parumper: et non sit imbibitum, ut non frangatur.	Is sit brevius extremitatis, grossae parimiter: et non sit imbibitum, ut ne frangatur.
Si ergo egreditur radix per illud, est bonum: et si non, iuuare oportet cum istis instrumentis aliis quorum formae sunt istae.	If then the root comes out through that, it is good: and if not, you should be guided with these other instruments whose forms are these.
Forma primi triangulatae extremitatis, in qua est quaedam grossitudo.	Form a triangular shape at the end, where there is some bulkiness.
Forma triangulatae extremitatis subtilis.	Form a triangular shape at the end, where there is some thinness.
Etiam iuuatur cum hoc instrumento habente duos ramos, cuius haec est forma.	Also held with this instrument having two branches, whose this form is.
Et cum aliis instrumentis et ferramentis quae praecesserunt in rasione dentium.	And with other instruments and tools which have preceded in the order of teeth.
Etiam sit iuuamentum cum hoc instrumento quod assimilatur uncino magno, huius formae, triangulatae extremitatis tortae, in qua est quiddam grossitudinis, ut non frangatur: et sit non imbibitum.	Also sit with this instrument which is similar to a large hook, this shape, the twisted triangular end, where there is some bulkiness so that it does not break: and be not浸 浸 wet.
Et scias, quod instrumenta dentium sunt multa: et similiter reliqua instrumenta non computantur, et artifex prudens, subtilis in arte sua inuenit per se ipsum instrumentum, secundum quod significant ei operatio et aegritudines ipsae.	And know, that there are many instruments for teeth: and likewise the other instruments do not matter, and the skilled artisan finds out by himself the instrument, according to which is significant its operation and ailments itself.
Quoniam ex agritudinibus sunt ad quas non dixerunt antiqui instrumentum, propter diuersitatem specierum earum.	For from ailments are to those for which the ancient instrument did not say, because of the diversity of their kinds.
Si autem frangatur os ex mandibula, aut ex aliis ossibus oris, aut putrefit: tunc perscrutare super ipsum in loco suo cum eo quod conuenit ei ex instrumentis et forcipibus quae dixi in extractione radicum, et iuuare cum gesti, cuius forma est haec.	If then breaks the jaw from a tooth, or from other bones of the mouth, or is rotten: then examine above it in its place with that which belongs to it from instruments and hooks which I have said in extracting roots, and move by motion, whose form is this.
Sit in eo quiddam grossitudinis paulatim, ut stringatur, uel teneatur cum eo os, et non fugiat et uadat, donec egrediatur os: et restaura locum cum medicinis conuenientibus ad illud.	Sit in it something of bulkiness gradually, so that it is tightened, or held with it the jaw, and does not flee and push, until it walks out the jaw: and restore the place with medicines fitting to it.
Si autem in osse est putredo parua, tunc rade ipsum a putredine sua, et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	If then there is little putrefaction in the bone, then shave it from its putrefaction, and care for it, until it heals.
De serratura Dentium eminentium super alios.	Of locking Dentum eminentium over others.
Caput XXXII.	Chapter 32.
Quando Dentes eminent non secundum cursum suum naturalem, foeda fit per illud forma: et praecipue quando accidit illud in mulieribus, et puellis, scilicet uenalibus.	When teeth prominent not according to its natural course, it becomes rotten by that form: and especially when it happens that in women, and girls, namely teens.
Oportet ergo ut consideres.	It is necessary so that you consider.
Nam si dens est natus post dentem alium, et non locatur, uel est possibilis eius serratura, neque limatura ipsius: tunc eradica ipsum: et si est annexus cum dente alio, tunc incide ipsum cum isto instrumento, cuius haec est forma.	For if a tooth is born after another tooth, and does not fit, or its locking is possible, or its grinding: then shave it: and if it is joined with another tooth, then cut it with this instrument, whose this form is.
Est simile rostro paruo, et fit ex ferro indo, acutae extremitatis ualde.	The face was like a little mask and it was made of iron and its extremities were acute.
Et sit incisio tua qua ipsum incidis in diebus multis, et propter duriciem dentis, et ut non commoueatur alius ex dentibus.	And let your wound be healed, so that you may not suffer any more, and because of the toughness of the tooth, and so that it does not dislodge another tooth.
Si autem est eminens expositus limaturae suae: tunc lima ipsum cum lima ex indo, cuius forma est haec.	But if he is exposed to the sun: then rub him with a piece of iron, whose shape is this.
Sit totum ex indo, et manubrium eius minutorum punctorum ualdae, sicut lima cum qua fiunt acus: cum quo limetur dens paulatim in diebus multis cum facilitate, ut non commoueatur dens, et cadat: deinde leni ipsum, in fine rade ipsum cum quibusdam rasoriis.	Let it be all of iron, and the handle of his minutely sharp awl like a needle, as if an aiguille: so that it may be sharpened little by little over many days with ease, so that it does not move the teeth, and falls out: then make smooth the end of it, with some chisels.
Quod si est dens, ex quo frangatur pars, et laedit linguam: tunc oportet ut limes eum etiam, donec auferatur asperitas illius fractionis, et aequetur: et applanetur, et non laedat linguam, neque corrumpat sermonem.	If it is a tooth that breaks off part of it and hurts the tongue: then let it be sharpened as well, until its sharpness is gone, and made smooth: and let it be flattened, so that it does not hurt the tongue, or spoil the speech.
¶ De retatione Dentium cum filis auri.	On the Retentation of Teeth with Golden Filings.
Caput XXXIII.	Chapter 33.
Quando accidit Dentibus anterioribus concussio et commotio a percussione, aut casu: et non potest infirmus stringere super illud quod comedit ut non cadat: et curasti eos cum medicinis stipticis, et non ualuit curatio: tunc ingenium in eis est, ut stringantur cum filo auri: quoniam argentum fit uiride, et putrefit post dies: sed aurum nunquam mutatur.	When it is an injury and a shaking of the front teeth from a blow, or a fall: and the sick person cannot clamp them together on top of that, so as not to fall out: and he has tried different remedies with bitter medicines, and there was no benefit in it: then let them have filings of gold, so that they may be clamped with a wire of gold: for gold becomes yellow, but never changes.
Et sit filum medium in subtilitate et grossicie secundum quantitatem quod capiat inter Dentes.	And let there be a medium filo between the subtility and thickness according to the quantity that he takes between the teeth.
Et forma quidem retationis est, ut accipias filum, et intromittas duplum eius inter duos dentes sanos: deinde texeas cum duabus extremitatibus fili inter dentes motos, siue unus sit, aut plures, donec peruenias cum tela usque ad dentem sanum alterius partis.	And the form of the retentation is so that you take a filo and insert it between two healthy teeth: then bind it with two extremities of filo between the teeth, or one, or more, until you reach the edge of the tooth on the other side.
Deinde itera texturam usque ad partem a qua incaepisti: et stringe manum tuam cum subtilitate et sapientia, donec non remoueatur prorsus: et sit constrictio tua qua stringis filum, apud radices dentium, ut non euadat.	Then repeat the texture right up to the part from which you started: and grip your hand with care and prudence, until it does not move at all: and let your grasp be tight where you grip the filo, near the roots of the teeth, so that it does not slip.
Deinde incide extremitates fili superfluentes cum forficibus: et aggrega utrumque, et conuerte eas cum gesti: et occulta ipsas inter dentem sanum et dentem motum, ut non laedat linguam: deinde dimittatur ita strictum dum remanet.	Then cut off the extremities with scissors: and join them together, and bind them tight: and hide them between the sound tooth and the moving tooth, so that they do not hurt the tongue; then loosen it so that it is stiff when it remains.
Si autem soluitur, aut inciditur, stringe eos cum filo alio, et stabit cum eo taliter tempore toto.	If however it has come loose or has been cut, bind them together with another thread, and let it stand with it in this way for a whole time.
Et haec est forma Dentium, et figura retationis duorum dentium sanorum, et duorum dentium motorum, sicut uides.	And this is the form of the teeth, and the appearance of the retention of two sound teeth and two moving teeth, as you see them.
Et quandoque fit, ut redeat dens unus, aut duo post casum urriusque in locis suis, et retentur sicut narrauimus, et remaneant: et non facit illud nisi artifex, prudens, et expertus.	And sometimes one tooth goes back, or two after the loss and falling into their places, and holds fast as we have described, and remains: and does this only if the craftsman is prudent and skilled.
Et quandoque aptatur aliquod ex ossibus uaccinis: et fit ex eo sicut forma dentis, et ponitur in loco, ex quo munitur dens et stringitur, sicut diximus: et remanet, et seruitur cum eo tempore longo.	And sometimes a bone is broken: and it is made into the form of a tooth, and is put into its place, from which the tooth holds fast and is tied on, as we have said: and remains, and is bound to it for a long time.
¶ De incisione ligamenti quod accidit sub lingua, et prohibet loquelam.	About the cutting of the ligament which happens under the tongue, and prevents from speaking.
Caput XXXIIII.	Chapter IIII.
Quandoque ligamentum hoc quod accidit sub lingua, est aut naturale, cum quo nascitur homo, aut accidentale, a uulnere quod iam consolidatum est.	Sometimes the ligament which happens under the tongue is either natural with which man is born, or accidental, from an arrow which has already healed over.
Et operatio in eo est, ut aperias os infirmi in capite eius in sinu tuo, et eleua linguam eius: deinde incide illud ligamentum neruosum per latitudinem, donec soluatur lingua a retentione sua.	And the operation is so that it opens the mouth in its head in your throat, and lifts up the tongue: then cut that nerve-ligament through its width, until the tongue is free from its hold.
Quod si in eo fuerit quiddam duriciei et nodationis, et fuerit illud ex consolidatione uulneris: tunc proiice in illud uncinum, et finde illud per latitudinem, donec incidas ligamentum, et soluatur nodatio.	If there is anything of hardness and swelling in it, and if that comes from the healing over of an arrow-wound: then let it fall into a hook, and end it through its width, until you cut the ligament, and free the swelling.
Et caue, ne sit fissura in profundo carnis, et incidas arteriam illic, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	And be careful, so that there is not a break in the deep flesh, and do not cut the artery there, and let the flow of blood happen.
Deinde colluatur in uestigio incisionis cum aqua rosata, aut cum aceto, aut aqua frigida.	Then let it be washed into the incision with rose-water, or with vinegar, or with cold water.
Deinde pone sub lingua licinium ex lino, quod teneat infirmus in omni nocte: ut non consolidetur secundo.	Then place under the tongue a wooden splint from linen, which the sick one should hold all night long: so that it does not set hard on the second day.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis, tunc pone super locum zegi tritum.	But if blood flow occurs, then place three layers of cloth over the wound site.
Si uero uincit te sanguis, tunc cauteriza locum cum cauterio lentiginoso, quod conuenit ad illud: deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	But if you are wounded by blood, then cauterize the site with cauterizing resin that suits it: then take care of yourself with the rest of the cure, until it heals.
¶ De extractione Ranulae quae fit sub lingua.	The extraction of a wound under the tongue
Caput XXXV.	Chapter 25.
Quandoque accidit sub lingua apostema quod assimilatur Ranae paruae, prohibens linguam ab operatione sua naturali: et fortasse magnificatur adeo, donec implet os.	When a small blister under the tongue occurs that absorbs the wound, preventing the tongue from its natural function: and perhaps it magnifies so much, until the bone is filled.
Et operatio in eo est, ut aperias os infirmi coram sole: et considera apostema.	And the operation on it is such that you open the mouth before the sun: and consider the blister.
Si ergo uides ipsum fusci coloris, aut nigri, durum, cui non inuenit infirmus sensum: tunc non tangas ipsum, quoniam est cancer.	But if you see that the wound is dark-colored, black, hard, and the sick person does not have a feeling: then do not touch the wound, for it is cancer.
Et si est decliue ad albedinem, in quo est humiditas, tunc proiice in ipsum uncinum, et incide ipsum cum spatumili subtili, et libera ipsum ab omni parte.	And if it declines to whiteness, where there is moisture, then throw into it a hook and cut the wound with a sharp scythe and free it from all parts.
Quod si uincit te sanguis in hora tuae operationis, tunc pone super ipsum zegi tritum, donec abscindatur sanguis: deinde redi ad operationem tuam, donec extrahas ipsum cum complemento eius.	If you are wounded by blood during your operation, then place three layers of cloth on the wound, until the blood stops flowing: and then return to your operation, until you remove the wound with its complement.
Deinde colluatur cum aceto et sale: et cura ipsum reliqua curatione conueniente ad illud, donec sanetur.	Then rinse it with vinegar and salt: and take care of the wound with the rest of the cure that suits it, until it heals.
¶ De curatione apostematis duarum Amigdalarum.	The treatment for blisters between the two eyelids.
Caput XXXVI.	Chapter 26.
Quandoque accidunt inter guttur godad, id est, glandulae, quae similantur algodad, quae accidunt deforis: et nominantur duae Amigdalae: quas quando curas cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et non sanantur, tunc considera.	When the following occur between the two eyelids, that is, glands, which resemble azalea, and which are called the two eyelids: when you do not heal them with the cure we mentioned in the division, then consider them carefully.
Si ergo est apostema durum, fusci coloris, pauci sensus: tunc non tangas ipsum cum ferro.	But if the blister is hard, dark-colored, and has a little feeling: then do not touch it with iron.
Et si est rubei coloris, et radix eius est grossa: tunc non tangas ipsum etiam cum ferro, timens fluxum sanguinis, imo dimitte ipsum, donec maturetur.	If it is red in color and its root is thick: then do not touch it even with iron, fearing the flow of blood, then let it go, until it dries up.
Et tunc aut perforabis ipsum: aut rumpetur per se.	And then either you pierce it or it ruptures itself.
Et si est albi coloris, rotundum, et est radix eius subtilis: tunc oportet ipsum incidi.	And if it is white in color and round, and its root is thin: then the wound should be cleansed.
Et operatio in ipso est, ut consideres ante operationem suam, si quieuit apostema eius calidum quiete completum, aut imminuitur quadam diminutione: tunc ergo fac sedere infirmum coram sole, et caput eius sit in sinu tuo: et aperi os eius, et accipiat seruiens inter manus suas, et premat linguam eius inferius cum instrumento, cuius haec est forma.	And the operation on it is, so that you consider before performing the operation on it, if it has a warm, complete scab, or is about to be somewhat diminished: then therefore make it sit in your lap, and have its head in your bosom: and open its mouth, and take hold of it with your hands between them, and rub its tongue lower with the instrument, which has this shape.
Fiat ex argento, aut aere, quod sit subtile sicut cultellus.	Let it be made of silver, or of brass, that it is sharp like a knife.
Cum ergo premis cum eo linguam, et ostenditur tibi apostema, et cadit super ipsum uisus tuus: tunc accipe uncinum, et fige ipsum in amigdalam, et extrahe eam ad exteriora quantum potes, praeter quod trahas cum ea aliquid ex tunicis.	When you rub it with the instrument and a scab shows itself to you, and it falls on its own: then take hold of it with a hook, and pull it out toward the outside as much as you can, except that you draw it out with it some skin.
Deinde incide eam cum instrumento, cuius haec est forma quae sequitur.	Then cut it with the instrument, which has this shape following.
Assimilatur forficibus: uerumtamen extremitates eius sint curuatae, ita quod orificium cuiusque earum est in directo alterius acute: unde cura ut sit ex ferro indo, aut alfuled imbibitum.	It is sewed up with thread: however, its ends are curled so that the opening of each of them is on the other's acute point: so that it is from iron sewn, or a cloth soaked in.
Si autem non est praesens hoc instrumentum, tunc incide ipsum cum spatumili, cuius haec est forma.	If this instrument is not present, then cut it with a chisel, which has this shape.
Sit acutum a parte una, non acutum a parte altera.	It should be sharp on one part, and not sharp on the other.
Et postquam incidis amigdalam unam, incide alteram secundum hanc eandem speciem incisionis.	And when you have cut one of the eyelids according to this shape of incision, cut the other second by following this same shape of incision.
Deinde post incisionem gargarizet infirmus cum aqua frigida, aut cum aceto et aqua.	Then after the incision, gargle the sick person with cold water, or with vinegar and water.
Si autem accidat ei fluxus sanguinis, gargarizet cum aqua in qua bulliti sunt cortices granatorum: aut folia myrti, et similia illis ex stipticis, donec abscindatur fluxus sanguinis: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	But if it should happen that there is a flow of blood for it, gargle with water in which leaves of myrtle or similar things from the stypetical have been boiled: until the flow of blood stops: then take care of the wound, until it heals over.
Et quandoque nascuntur in gutture apostemata alia, praeter amigdalas duas.	And sometimes phlegmonous abscesses arise in the throat, besides two amygdaloid ones.
Incide ergo ea secundum quod dixi in incisione duarum amigdalarum aequaliter.	So cut them as I said in cutting of the two amygdales equally.
Et ego quidem iam medicatus fui mulierem ex apostemate, quod natum erat inter guttur eius, quod trahebat ad fuscedinem, pauci sensus, quod iam fere clauserat guttur: et mulier respirabat a meatu stricto, et iam prohibuerat ei comestionem, et potum aquae: et iam peruenerat ad mortem, si remansisset uno die, aut duobus diebus.	And indeed I have already been cured of a woman with an abscess that had arisen between her throat, which she drew to a hoarse voice, little sense, which had almost closed her throat: and the woman breathed from my mouth, and had already prohibited her from eating, drinking water: and had already come close to death, if she had remained one day or two days.
Et apostema tantum ascenderat, quod emiserat duos ramos, donec exierant super duo foramina nasi.	And the abscess rose only so much that it had thrown out two branches, until they had come out of two nostrils.
Properaui ergo festinanter, et fixi in unum eorum uncinum.	So I hurried up and fixed one of them with a hook.
Deinde traxi ipsum, et tracta ex eo est portio magna.	Then I pulled it out, and there came out a big piece of it.
Deinde abscidi eam, ubi comprehendi ex foramine nasi.	Then I cut off where I had caught it from the nostril's opening.
Deinde feci illud ei quod processit ex foramine nasi altero.	Then I made her go out through the other nostril's opening.
Deinde aperui os eius, et pressi linguam eius: et postea fixi uncinum in ipsum apostema: deinde abscidi ex eo partem eius, et non cucurrit ex eo nisi sanguis paucus: absolutum est ergo guttur mulieris, et incepit statim bibere aquam, deinde accepit ex cibo.	Then I opened her mouth, and pressed her tongue: then I fixed the hook in the abscess; then I cut off part of it, and there did not flow out any more but a little blood: so I closed up her throat completely, and she began immediately to drink water, then also took food.
Non ergo cessaui incidere ex illo apostemate multotiens tempore longo: et apostema succedebat loco eius quod incidebam, donec prolongatum est nimis et cum ea illud.	So I did not often cut the abscess again over a long period of time: and an abscess succeeded to that which I had cut, until it was too late and then very painful.
Ingeniaui ergo, et cauterizaui apostema inter guttur.	I therefore took care, and cauterized the abscess between her throat.
Stetit ergo ab additione: deinde ambulaui a parte, et non sciui quid fecit Deus cum ea post me.	Then it stood still: then I walked away from her part, and did not know what God would do with her after me.
¶ De incisione apostematis uuulae.	On the Incision of a Phlegmonous Abscess.
Caput XXXVII.	The head of Chapter LVII.
Quando descendit catarrus ad uuulam, et apostematur, et est long: tunc ipsa nominatur perpendicularis: et si est in inferiori parte grossa, rotunda, tunc ipsa nominatur uua.	When a catarrh comes down to the palate, and an abscess rises and is long, then it is called the vertical one: and if it is in the lower part thick, round, then it is called the uvular one.
Quando curatur cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio: et uides quod apostema calidum quieuit ab ea, et est subtilis: tunc oportet ut incidas eam.	When you are healing with it as we said in the division, and there is no cure: and you see that the apothermia has become cold from it, and it is subtle: then you should strike it.
Et quae ex ea est aggregata rotunda, et non est ei longitudo, et est sanguinea, aut fusci coloris, aut nigri, et non est ei sensus: tunc oportet ut deuites incisionem eius.	And what comes out of it is rounded and there is no length in it, and it is bloody or black in color or not in its essence: then you should strike it too.
In ea enim est timor super infirmum.	For fear is in the wound.
Oportet ergo quando uides eam secundum modum quem dixi ex albedine, et longitudine sua, ut facias sedere infirmum coram sole: et premas linguam eius cum instrumento, cuius praecessit narratio: deinde fige uncinum in uuam, et trahe eam inferius: et incide eam cum uno duorum instrumentorum quae dixi in incisione duarum amigdalarum.	So when you see it according to the way I said from its whiteness and length, let the sick sit in front of the sun; and press his tongue with an instrument that preceded the description: then fix a hook on his cheek, and pull him down: and strike it with one or two instruments which I said for cutting two nostrils.
Et oportet ut non incidas ex ea, nisi illud quod additur super naturalem terminum sine additione.	And you should not strike from it unless it is added to the natural limit without adding.
Nam si tu incidis ex ea plus, laedes uocem et sermonem.	For if you strike from it more, you will hurt speech and language.
Deinde post incisionem utere eo quod narrauimus in incisione duarum amigdalarum: et cura eam, donec sanetur.	Then after the incision use what we have said about the incision of two nostrils: and care for it until it heals.
Si autem terretur infirmus ab incisione: tunc oportet ut utaris ingenio in cauterizatione eius absque timore et pauore.	But if the sick is disturbed from the incision: then you should use skill in cauterizing it without fear and anxiety.
Et modus cauterii in ea non est, nisi cum aqua acuta: et est, ut ponas caput infirmi in sinu tuo.	And the mode of cauterization in it is not, except with sharp water: and it is, as you put the head of the nurse in your lap.
Deinde preme linguam eius cum instrumento quod diximus.	Then press his tongue with the instrument which we said.
Deinde accipe ex aqua quam dixi tibi in capitulo cauterizandi, et confice cum ea calcem non extinctam, et pone eam non spissam, neque subtilem, et imple ex ea concauitatem huius instrumenti, cuius haec est forma.	Then take from water what I said to you in the chapter of cauterizing, and bind it with this dry calamus, and fill it with the juice of this instrument, whose this is shape:
Sit extremitati eius in qua ponitur medicina concauitas, sicut concauitas cochlearis radii.	Let its end be where the medicine is bound, like the bound cochlea of the radius.
Et pone instrumentum cum medicina super uuulam ipsam: et infirmus sit iacens super latus suum, ut currat saliua ex ore eius ex intrinseca medicina, ut non descendat ex ea ad guttur ipsius aliquid, et laedat ipsum.	And place the instrument with the medicine on its plate: and let the sick lie on his side so that saliva flows from his mouth out of the inner medicine, so that it does not go down to his throat anything, and hurts him.
Deinde tene manum tuam cum medicina.	Then take your hand with the medicine.
Et tu ex primas eam super uuulam quantitate medietatis horae, donec uideas eam iam denigratam, et sedatam mordicationem medicinae.	And then apply a little of the medicine to the wound, an hour's worth, until it has been reduced and calmed by the medicated salve.
Et si uis ut accipias cotum, et inuoluas ipsum super extremitatem radii, et infundas cotum cum medicina, et intromittas radium cum coto in cannulam desuper, donec adhaereat cotum super uuulam.	And if you wish to receive blood, and to stretch it out on the edge of the wound, and to dip the cloth into the medicine, and to insert the rod with the cloth into the canal above, until the cloth sticks to the wound.
Fac illud multotiens, donec consequaris quod uis de cauterizatione uuae.	Do this many times, until you get the result that you desire regarding cauterization.
Deinde dimitte eam: ipsa namque arescit et cadit post tres dies, aut quatuor.	Then release it: for it will dry up and fall off after three or four days.
Quod si indiges ut iteres medicinam, itera ipsam: et post cauterizationem absterge in circumitu uuae cum coto imbibito in butyro, et mundifica cum eo quod est in circumitu eius ex medicina: et colluatur cum aqua frigida.	That if you wish to use the medicine again, repeat it: and after cauterization wash off the surrounding area with a wet cloth dipped in butter, and clean up what is on it from the medicine: and rinse it with cold water.
Et curetur extrinsecus cum embrocis, et deintus cum gargarismis, donec sanetur.	And treat externally with embrocations, and internally with gargles, until you are healed.
Haec ergo species curationis est salubrior incisione et longinquior a timore.	This therefore is the more beneficial species of cure, and less effective in preventing fear.
Et quandoque curatur uuula etiam cum eo quod est subtilius quam cauterium et incisio: curatur enim cum suffumigatione, secundum hunc modum.	And when a wound is cured with this, which is softer than cautery and incision: for it is cured with smoking, in the following way.
Sume calamentum, et hyssopum, et origanum, et rutam, et sseah, et chamomillam, et abrotanum, et similia eis ex herbis: et aggrega ea omnia, aut quaedam eorum in olla, et submergantur cum aceto, et bulliant: et olla sit lutata cum luto decenter: et sit in medio ollae foramen, super quod componatur instrumentum concauum secundum hunc modum.	Summon herbs, and hyssop, and oregano, and rue, and sage, and chamomile, and abrotan, and similar things; and add them all together, or some of them in an oven, and boil them in vinegar, and let it bubble: and let the bottom be covered with a fine ash: and let there be a hole in the middle of the cauldron, above which put an instrument for piercing, in this way.
Fiat ex argento, aut aere: et intromittatur extremitas, in qua est granatum, in os infirmi, donec ascendat uapor ad uuulam super cannulam, donec obscuretur uuula multum.	Let it be made of silver or brass: and introduce the end into the tube, in which there is a small hole, until the vapor rises up to the wound on the rod, until the wound is heavily obscured.
Deinde itera super ipsam multotiens, donec arescat.	Then repeat this many times over the same area, until it has healed.
Et caue, ne facias hanc curationem in principio aduentus apostematis.	And for this reason, do not perform this cure at the beginning when the patient arrives with a suppurative wound.
Plaerumque enim addit in apostemate: et non oportet ut facias illud nisi apud declinationem apostematis eius calidi.	But because it adds to the suppuration: and you should not do this cure unless at the height of its suppuration.
Si autem non est praesens tibi hoc instrumentum, tunc accipe cannam, et compone in extremitate eius corticem oui: ut non comburatur os infirmi: quoniam cortex oui prohibet uaporem comburere os: et haec est ex bona curatione cum salute.	If you do not have this instrument with you, then take a cane and put it at the end of the wound so that the skin does not burn the mouth; for the skin prevents the vapor from burning the mouth: and this is good cure with health.
¶ De extractione spinarum, et ossium de gula.	On extracting spines, and bones from the throat.
Caput XXXVIII.	Chapter XXXVIII.
Multotiens adhaeret in gutture os, aut spina piscis, aut aliud.	Often a tooth, or a spine of a fish, or something else would adhere in the throat.
Oportet ergo ut extrahas quod ex eis est apparens super quod cadit uisus, postquam premis linguam cum instrumento apud solem, et declaratur tibi quod est in gutture.	Therefore you should extract what is visible on top of the jaw when it falls after you press the tongue with an instrument on the sun; and tell me that it is in the throat.
Et quod non apparet tibi et occultatur in gutture, oportet ut facias uomere infirmum antequam digeratur cibus in stomacho.	And if what is hidden in the throat does not appear to you; you should make a weak sick person eat before it is digested in the belly.
Fortasse enim egredietur res annexa per uomitum.	Perhaps then what is attached will come out through the vomit.
Aut deglutiat infirmus frustum napi, aut radicem lactucae, aut deglutiat buccellam panis sicci: aut accipiat frustum spongiae marinae siccae lenis: et liga ipsum in filo, deinde deglutiat ipsum.	Or the sick person swallows a piece of nettle, or radish, or dry bread; or takes a piece of dry sponge from the sea, and ties it with a string, and then swallows it;
Cum ergo peruenit ad locum ubi sunt spinae, aut os, et extrahitur, tunc egreditur.	So when he arrives at the place where there are spines, or teeth, and they are extracted, then he will come out.
Si ergo non egreditur cum eo quod diximus: tunc utere instrumento ex plumbo secundum hanc formam.	If therefore he does not come out with it that I have said: then use the instrument of lead in this form.
Sit grossius quam Radius parumper, et in extremitate eius sit curuitas, quam intromittat in guttur suum cum facilitate: et ipse habeat caput suum eleuatum sursum.	Let it be thicker than a radish no more, and in the end let it be narrower, which he can put into his throat easily: and let him hold his head up.
Et caueat a tactu suae epiglotis, ut non accidat ei tussis, et impellat cum eo os, aut spinam, aut intromittat ipsum medicus manu sua.	And let him keep away from the tip of his epiglottis so that it does not make a cough; and push out with it, if he has a tooth or a spine, or stick it in with his own hand.
Verum quod infirmus intromittat, hoc est melius: propter scientiam suam de loco rei annexae: et impellat inferius, aut trahat manum suam cum instrumento sursum, totum illud secundum quantitatem quae praeparatur ei, donec egrediatur.	For a sick person to enter is better; for his knowledge of the site of the wound, and he pushes down or pulls up his hand with the instrument upwards, all this according to the quantity that has been prepared for him, until he comes out.
¶ De extractione Sanguisugae.	Regarding the extraction of blood: When one should withdraw the blood from a patient, first check the direction of the blood flow
Caput XXXIX.	Chapter 39: The Wound
Quando medicatur sanguisuga cum eo quod dixi in diuisione ex curatione cum medicinis, et non confert, tunc considera in gutture infirmi coram sole, siue apud solem postquam premis linguam eius cum instrumento quod narraui tibi.	When you treat with the leech together with what I said in the division of treatment with medicines and it doesn't work, then consider in the mouth facing the sun, or next to the sun after you press his tongue with the instrument that I told you.
Si ergo cadit uisus tuus super sanguisugam, extrahe eam cum uncino paruo, aut cum gesti subtilibus decenter.	If then your yawn falls on the leech, remove it with a small hook, or with delicate movements to one side.
Quod si non est possibile cum eis: tunc accipe cannulam concauam, et intromitte eam in guttur infirmi usque prope guttur: deinde intromitte in concauitatem cannulae ferrum ignitum cum igne.	That if it is not possible with them: then take a narrow tube, and insert it into the mouth all the way to near the throat; and then insert into the tube an ignited iron with fire.
Fac illud multotiens: et abstineat infirmus ab aqua tota die.	Do this many times: and let the patient abstain from drinking water all day.
Deinde accipiat uitreatam plenam aqua frigida, et aperiat os eius in ea: et colluat os suum cum ea, et non deglutiat ex ea aliquid: et moueat aquam una hora post aliam cum manu sua.	Then let him take a full drink of cold water and open his mouth to it; and let him put his mouth on it and not swallow anything from it: and let him move his hand with water.
Sanguisuga enim ilico cum sentit aquam cadit.	For the leech immediately falls when he feels the water.
Si autem non egreditur cum eo quod narrauimus, tunc suffumiga infirmum cum cimicibus, aut cum asa cum instrumento quod narraui in suffumigatione uuulae.	If it does not come out with what I told you, then smoke the patient with camphor, or with a wormwood bug, or with an instrument that I told you in smoke-making.
Fac illud multotiens, quoniam ipsa cadet.	Do this many times, because it will fall on its own.
Et modus operationis in suffumigatione est, ut accipias ollam, in qua sint prunae uiuae cum igne: et olla sit cooperta cum coopertorio, in cuius medio sit foramen: et componatur in illo foramine extremitas instrumenti.	And the method of operation in smoke-making is that you take a pot, in which there are wormwood flies with fire; and cover the pot with a lid, and have a hole in it; and place the end of the instrument in that hole.
Deinde proiice suffumigationem, et ponat infirmus os suum in extremitate cannulae, et claudat os suum, ut non egrediatur suffumigatio, donec scias quod suffumigatio iam peruenit ad sanguisugam.	Then throw the smoke, and let the patient put his mouth at the end of the tube, and let him close his mouth so that the smoke does not come out until you know that the smoke has reached the leech.
Nam sanguisuga statim cadet.	The wound should be cleaned immediately.
Quod si non cadit, tunc itera suffumigationem multotiens.	If it does not fall, then many times apply suffumigation.
Et toleret infirmus sitim, et comedat salsa, et allia, et non bibat aquam.	And the sick person should lie down, eat broth, and other foods, and not drink water.
Necesse est ergo ut egrediatur cum hoc regimine.	Therefore, he must go out with this regimen.
Et haec est forma instrumenti cum quo extrahitur sanguisuga ex gutture, quando cadit super ipsam uisus.	And this is the form of the instrument with which, when it falls on top of it, blood is removed from the throat when it drops.
Est simile forcipibus, sicut uides: nisi quia est ei haee curuitas quae intromittitur ad guttur.	It is similar to forceps, as you see: but because of its curvature which enters into the throat.
Et extremitas eius similis ori auis quae nominatur ciconia, in quo est asperitas limae: quando comprehendit aliquid, non dimittit ipsum omnino.	And the end is similar to an ear, which is called a cicona, in which there is a roughness of the edge of the blade; and when it grasps something, it does not let go at all.
¶ De apertione Apostematum, et eorum sectione, et cura in genere.	Regarding the opening of Abscesses, their section, and care in general.
Caput XL.	Chapter 40.
Apostematum species sunt multae, multorum modorum, secundum quod uenit rememoratio eorum, scilicet unius, et unius in hoc libro: et sunt diuersae in perforatione eorum, et sectione ipsorum ex duobus modis.	There are many kinds of abscesses, many types, according to which comes the memory of them, that is, one and the same in this book: and they differ in their perforation and the section of them into two modes.
Quorum unus est ex specie apostematis in seipso, et eo quod comprehendit ex humiditatibus.	One kind of abscess is that which is called a sebaceous abscess, and because it comprises humidities.
Et modus secundus est propter loca, in quibus accidit ex corpore.	And the second mode is due to places, in which it comes from the body.
Quoniam apostema accidens in capite, est aliud ab apostemate accidente in ano: et apostema accidens in loco carnoso, est aliud ab apostemate accidente in iuncturis: et unicuique eorum est iudicium suum ex operatione.	Since the abscess occurs in the head, it is different from the accident of an abscess in the anus: and the abscess which occurs in fleshy places is different from the accident of an abscess in joints; and each of them has its own judgment according to operation.
Et ex apostematibus sunt quae non oportet ut perforentur, nisi post maturationem saniei in eis, et complementum eius: et ex eis sunt, quae oportet ut perforentur, dum sunt cruda, et non maturantur secundum complementum.	And of the abscesses are those that do not need to be pierced unless they have been成熟d and their 完成: and of them are those that need to be pierced while they are crude and have not been成熟d according to their completion.
Sicut apostemata quae sunt propinqua iuncturis.	Such as abscesses which are near joints.
Quoniam apostema quando accidit prope iuncturam, et prolongatur esse eius, donec putrefit quod est in circumitu eius fortasse corrumpuntur ligamenta, aut nerui illius iuncturae: quare est caussa propior contractionis illius membri.	Since the abscess, when it occurs near a joint and is prolonged, continues to putrefy what is in its circumference which may have become corrupted because of the ligaments, or the nerves of that joint: therefore this is the cause of the closer contraction of that limb.
Aut est apostema apud membrum principale: quoniam si tu tardas perforationem eius, donec maturetur, nocebit uel illi, uel per illud membro principali.	There is a blister on the main limb: for if you delay its piercing until it has come to maturity, it will hurt him or that main limb.
Aut est prope anum, perfora ergo ipsum immaturum: et non oportet, ut perfores, apostema crudum, non completae digestionis, nisi quod est prope anum, ut non putrefiat profundum, et longetur ad interiora ani, et fiat fistula, aut fiat in termino eius quod non sanatur.	Or it is near the hip: so pierce it then that it is not yet mature: and do not, as you pierce, a raw blister, which has not been digested completely, unless it is near the hip, so that it does not rot deeply, and lingers towards the inner sides, and becomes a fistula, or comes to be on the edge of it, so that it does not heal.
Oportet ut scias horam perforationis apostematis, quod maturatum est secundum complementum: et est apud sedationem doloris, recessionem febris, et diminutionem rubedinis, et pulsationis, et acuitatem capitis apostematis: et reliqua signa.	It is necessary that you know the time for piercing the blister, which has come to maturity in accordance with the complement: and it is at the sedating of pain, the recession of fever, and the decrease of rubor, and pulsation, and acuteness of head for the blister: and the other signs.
Et oportet, ut facias eandem perforationem in inferiori loco apostematis, et uehementioris eminentiae: et sit perforatio uadens in longitudine corporis, si apostemata sunt in partibus manuum et pedum, et locis lacertorum, et chordarum, et neruorum, et arteriarum, et ad ultimum in omnibus locis aequalibus, quibus non est reflexio.	And it is necessary that you make the same piercing in a lower place of the blister, and more prominent: and let the piercing be made running along the length of the body, if the blisters are in the parts of the hands and feet, and in the places of the spine, and of the strings, and of the nerves, and of the arteries, and to the last in all places equal, in which there is no reflection.
In illis autem quae reflectuntur, uade cum perforatione secundum illud membrum.	In those, however, that reflect, pierce with a view to that limb.
Quando uero apostema est in locis carnosis: tunc melius est ut dimittas perforationem eius, donec confirmetur eius digestio, sicut diximus secundum complementum.	When, however, the blister is in fleshy places: then it is better that you should leave off piercing it until its digestion has been confirmed, as we have said, in accordance with the complement.
Quoniam si tu perforas ipsum ante illud, prolongatur cursus uirus ex eo, et est multae sordis et sordiciei, et fortasse indurantur labia eius, et profunditas eius.	For if you pierce it before that, the course of the virus will be prolonged from it, and there will be much putrefaction and corruption, and perhaps it will harden its lips, and its depth will be increased.
Et quaedam apostemata perforantur secundum latitudinem corporis apud necessitatem: aut secundum illud quo indiget membrum.	And some blisters are pierced in accordance with the length of the body when there is necessity: or in accordance with that in which the limb feels pain.
Et oportet, ut administres in apostematibus paruis perforationem paruam, et in apostematibus magnis perforationem amplam: aut sectiones multas per similitudinem magnitudinis apostematis.	And it is necessary that you administer a small piercing to small blisters, and a wide piercing to large blisters: or sections in accordance with the similarity of the size of the blisters.
Et sunt ex apostematibus, in quibus oportet ut concauetur cutis: et incidatur quando iam facta est sicut pannus, et facta est in termino, quod iam mortua est: sicut illud quod accidit in multis, ut dubelet, et bubonibus.	And these are the pustules in which the skin should be closed: and let it be incised when it has been made, like a cloth, and made at the border, since it is already dead: like that which happened to many, such as blisters, and boils.
Et ex eis sunt quae secantur sectione habente tres angulos.	And these are those that are sutured with three angles.
Et ex eis est, ex quo inciditur sicut figura folii myrti.	And of these is one which incises like the figure of a fig-leaf.
Sicut apostema inguinum.	As an pustule of the groin.
Et ex eis sunt in quibus administratur sectio rotunda, et sectio lunaris: et similes eis ex sectionibus.	And of these are those in which a round section is applied, and a lunar section: and similar to them are the sections.
Illud uero cui non est caput, sicut sunt apostemata lenia superficialia, oportet ut perfores ipsum perforatione superficiali, uel plana tantum.	That indeed to which there is no head, such as are the soft pustules on the surface, it is necessary that you should pierce it with a superficial puncture, or merely flat.
Et oportet, quando apostema est grossum, et iam collegit saniem multam, et perforas ipsum, ut non properes et extrahas pus totum in illa hora: imo extrahe ex ipso partem eius.	And it is necessary, when the pustule is thick, and has already collected a lot of puss, and pierce it, so that it does not ooze all the pus out at once: but extract a part of it.
Deinde opila apostema usque ad diem alium.	Then cover the pustule with a poultice until the next day.
Deinde extrahe quiddam ex pus iterum.	Then extract some more pus again.
Fac illud multotiens secundum gradationem, donec egrediatur: praecipue si infirmus est debilis uirtutis, aut mulier praegnans, aut puer paruus, aur senex decrepitus: spiritus enim animalis ab animali multotiens resoluitur cum egressione saniei: et fortasse moritur infirmus, et tu non percipis.	Do this many times according to the degree, until it comes out: especially if the person is feeble of spirit, or a woman expectant, or a young boy, or an old man decrepitous: for the animal spirit often resolves from the animal with the egress of pus: and perhaps the infirm one dies, and you do not perceive it.
Caue ergo hoc capitulum cautela magna.	Therefore take great care in this chapter.
Et post perforationem tuam, qua ista perforas apostemata, oportet ut abstergas uulnus: et considera.	And after your puncture, when you have pierced these pustules, it is necessary that you should wash with water: and consider.
Si ergo est uulnus apostematis paruum, aut est sectio plana, tunc administra licinia ex lino, aut coto antiquo.	But if the puncture of the pustule is small, or it is a flat section, then apply a poultice of straw, or an old cloth.
Et si est apostema magnum, et fissurae perforationis multae sunt, oportet tunc ut intromittas in omnem fissuram licinium, donec perueniant adinuicem.	But if the pustule is large, and there are many punctures, then it is necessary that you should introduce a poultice into all the punctures, until they are completely closed over.
Et si in apostemate abscidisti partem cutis, aut in circumitu concauasti eam: tunc oportet ut impleas eam coto ueteri, aut sicut quando texitur pannus, aut raditur lanugine lini absque humiditate: et stringe ipsum usque ad tertium diem.	And if you have cut off a part of the skin in an apotome, or have circumcised it: then you should fill it with old cloth, or as when the fabric is wrinkled, or rubbed with haircloth without moisture: and bind him firmly until the third day.
Deinde proiice ipsum, et cura illud cum eo quod oportet ex unguento, donec sanetur.	Then let him throw it off, and care for that with him what is necessary from unguentary, until he is healed.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis in hora tuae operationis, tunc administra aquam frigidam, et acetum, postquam imbibitur in eis pannus: et ponis ipsum super locum fluxus sanguinis multotiens.	But if there should happen to be a flow of blood during your operation, then administer cold water and vinegar, after which he shall dip the cloth into it: and let him lie on the spot of the bleeding many times.
Si autem perseuerat fluxus sanguinis, tunc oportet ut administres regimen, et curationem, et pulueres, quae narraui in locis multis huius nostri libri, et ex diuisione.	But if the flow of blood persiste, then you should administer regime, care and powders, which I relate in various places in this our book, and from division.
Si autem est in tempore hyemis, et locus apostematis est multorum neruorum: tunc oportet ut infundas puluillos cum uino, et oleo calidis: et ponas eos super loca.	But if it is in the time of winter, and the place of apotome is full of nerves: then you should fill them with wine and hot oil: and let them lie on the places.
Et si fuerit in aestate, et loca sunt carnosa: tunc oportet ut ponas puluillos imbibitos in aqua, et oleo, aut eum uino et oleo, et totum illud frigidum.	And if it should be in the summer, and the places are fleshy: then you should let him lie on the fabrics imbibed with water and oil, or with wine and oil, and all that is cold.
Donec quando erit dies tertius, sicut diximus, tunc oportet ut soluas apostema, et abstergas ipsum, et administres in curatione eius quod ei conuenit, donec sanetur.	Until the third day, as we have said, then you should let fall the apotome, and cleanse him, and administer to his care what is fitting, until he is healed.
Hoc est ergo quod necessarium est ex cognitione curationis apostematum uniuersaliter.	This is therefore what is necessary from the knowledge of the cure of apotomes universally.
Secundum semitam uero distinctionis, iam dixi de omni apostemate, qualiter est uia ad curationem eius capitulatim singulariter.	But according to the halfway point of the distinction, I have already said about every apotome, how it is a way to the cure of its specific detail.
¶ De sectione apostematum quae accidunt in cute capitis.	De the section of apotomes which occur on the skin of the head.
Caput XLI.	Head 31.
Accidunt in cute capitis apostemata parua, et sunt ex speciebus Nodorum, quos continent tunicae, quae sunt eis sacci: quasi ipsa sint hausolati gallinae.	Apotomes which occur on the skin of the head are small, and they have a certain resemblance to knots, which are contained in tunicles, which are sacs for them: almost as if they were little hens.
Et ipsorum species sunt multae.	There are many types among them.
Ex eis sunt pingues: et ex eis sunt quae continent humiditatem similem limo: et ex eis quae continent humiditatem similem frisatis et pultibus: et eis similibus, et ex eis sunt, quae sunt lapidea dura.	From among them there are some who are scarce; and from among them there are those that retain moisture like mud; and from among them there are those that retain moisture like lime and clays; and those similar to them, and also among them are the hard stones.
Et in sectione omnium, et ipsorum extractione non est timor, dum apud ipsorum sectionem non facit contrarietatem arteria.	And in all of them, and their extraction is not afraid, as long as it does not cause contradiction in the arteries at their section.
Et operatio in sectione eorum est, ut experiaris ea cum instrumento, cuius forma uenit post haec, quod nominatur Intromissum, donec scias quid contineat.	And the operation on their section is, as you experiment with it by an instrument, whose shape came after this, which is called Incision, until you know what it contains.
Nam si est illud quod continet humiditas, tunc seca ipsum sectione secundum longitudinem sectione superficiali: secundum hanc formam.	For if that is what contains moisture, then dry him up by sectioning along the length of the surface section: in this form.
Et incipe cum sectione ex linea b. ad lineam, g. Cum ergo euacuatur humiditas, tunc excoria kistin quae continet illam humiditatem, et non dimittas ex ea aliquid penitus.	And begin with the section from line B to line G. And so when the moisture is drained, then remove the skin that contains this moisture, and do not leave anything inside it.
Multotiens enim redit, si remanet ex ea aliquid.	For many times it will return if there remains anything of it.
Deinde submerge cotum in unguento aegyptio, si est praesens: et si non, in aqua et sale: et imple cum eo uulnus, et dimitte ipsum usque ad diem alium.	Then immerse the cup in Egyptian ointment if it is present: and if not, in water and salt: and fill it with it, and leave it until another day.
Ipsum enim corrodet quod remansit ex kisti.	For this cup will corrode whatever remains inside the skin.
Deinde itera super ipsum cotum cum aegyptio secundo, et tertio, et si indiges illo, donec confidas quia non remanserit ex kisti aliquid, tunc enim cura uulnus cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then repeat the application of the Egyptian ointment to the cup a second and third time, and if you endure it, until you are convinced that nothing remains inside the skin, then no longer worry about the ointment, for when it is dried up with the wound, it will be healed.
Quod si apostema continet nodum pinguem: tunc seca ipsum secundum hanc formam, sectione habente formam crucis: et proiice uncinos inter duolabia sectionis, et excoria ipsum ab omni parte: et conare uirtutem tuam in extractione tunicae quae continet ipsum.	That if it contains a swollen nodule: then dry him up by this form, having a cross-shaped section: and throw away the hooks between the two sections, and scrape off the skin completely: and test your skill in extracting the tunic that contains the nodule.
Si autem contrarietatem facit tibi arteria, tunc fac illud quod narrabo tibi post.	But if it causes contradiction for you in the arteries, then make what I will tell you about after.
Et similiter fac in apostemate, si est lapideum, ex sectione, et curatione eadem, secundum quod diximus.	And also do the same in the swollen joint, if it is stony, from the section, and with the same cure, as we have said.
Et sectio super apostema lapideum est facilior: quoniam est pauci sanguinis et humiditatis.	Cutting through stones is easier because there is little blood and moisture.
Et quandoque sunt quaedam horum apostematum quae sunt in capite in quibusdam hominibus, cum quibus penitus non est humiditas.	And sometimes some of these boils that are in the head of certain people who have no moisture within them.
Quod est: quia ego secui super apostema in capite mulieris uetulae, et inueni apostema sicut lapis solidus et durus, asper, albus, qui non poterat frangi: et si percuteretur cum eo aliquis proiiciendo, uulnerat ipsum.	That is because I cut through a boil on the head of a married woman, and I found the boil like a solid stone, hard, white, which could not be broken; and if anyone struck it with an instrument, he would wound himself.
In aliis uero apostematibus accidentibus in capite, praeter haec scilicet apostemata quae accidunt in capitibus puerorum, et apud radices aurium, sectio eorum omnium sit sectio superficialis.	But in other boils that occur on the head, except for those that happen on the heads of boys and at the roots of the ears, all of them are only a superficial section.
Vel pone perforationem eorum semper ab inferiori parte eorum, ut alleuietur cursus saniei ad inferiora.	Or put a hole in them from their lower part so that the blood flow runs to the lower side.
Deinde cura ea cum eo quod conuenit eis ex curatione.	Then take care of those with what is appropriate for them after treatment.
¶ De sectione Strophularum in collo.	As for the cutting through of the stapes in the neck.
Caput XLII.	Chapter IV.
Multotiens acccidunt ista apostemata in collo, et sub assellis, et inguinibus: et quandoque accidunt in reliquo corpore.	These boils often occur in the neck, and under the chin, and in the groin, and sometimes elsewhere on the body.
Et super illa quae ex eis accidunt in collo, sunt unum, et multa: et generantur ab inuicem: et omnis Strophula ex eis est intra tunicam propriam ei, sicut est in nodis et apostematibus capitis, sicut narrauimus.	And over those which occur from them in the neck, there is one kind and many kinds; they originate from a joint; and every staph occurs within its own skin, as we have said.
Et species harum Strophularum sunt multae.	And the kinds of boils are numerous.
Et ex eis enim sunt lapideae: et ex eis sunt quae continent humiditates: et ex eis sunt malignae, quae non obediunt curationi.	For some of them have leaves, and some of them contain moisture, and some of them are evil and do not submit to treatment.
In illa ergo quam ex eis uides bonae dispositionis in tactu, cuius manifestum est propinquum colori cutis, et mouetur ad omnem partem, et non est annexa cum neruis colli, neque cum guidegi, neque cum arteria, neque est profunda: oportet ut seces eam sectione superficiali a superiori parte ad inferiorem partem corporis ex linea, b. ad lineam, g. et excoria eam ab omni parte: et extende duo labia cutis cum uncino, aut cum uncinis multis, si indiges illo, sicut diximus in apostematibus capitis, et extrahe eam paulatim.	In that one which you see is of good disposition when touched, whose color is close to the color of the skin, and which moves in all directions, and which is not attached to the nerves of the neck, nor to the arteries, nor is it deep: it should be cut off with a superficial section from its upper part to its lower part of the body along the line, d. to f., and scrape it off completely: and extend two skin folds with hooks, or with many hooks if you wish, as we have said in the case of boils on the head, and then remove it slowly.
Et est super cautelam, ut non incidatur uena, aut neruus.	It is necessary to take great care so that no new wound occurs, nor a nerve damaged.
Et sit spatumile non acutum ualde: ut non addat tibi manum tuam cum incisione, aut inquietet infirmum, et incidas quod non est necesse.	And the blade should not be too sharp so as to cut deeply: lest it give you your hand with an incision, or disturb the sick, and you should fall into what is not necessary.
Si autem incidis uenam, aut arteriam, aut prohibet te ab operatione, tunc pone in uulnus zegi tritum, aut quosdam pulueres qui abscindunt sanguinem, et stringe uulnus, et dimitte ipsum, donec quiescat acuitas apostematis, et mollificetur uulnus: uel incipit et uult putrefieri.	But if you have cut a vein or an artery, or if it prevents you from operating, then place in the wound some ground pegs or some powder that stops the blood, and tighten the bandage and release it until the sharpness has subsided, and the wound is softened: otherwise it may start to rot.
Nam sanguis abscinditur tuncia Redi ergo ad operationem tuam, donec compleas.	For blood is stopped by the poultice. So return to your work, until you are finished.
Deinde inquire digito tuo indice, si remansit aliquid ex Strophulis aliis paruis: ergo incide eas, et munda eas.	Then examine with your index finger whether anything remains of the stiches; then cut them off and clean them out.
Quod si est in radice Strophulae uena magna: tunc oportet ut non incidas illam Strophulam ex radice sua: imo oportet ut liges eam cum filo duplato forti, et dimittas eam donec cadat per se absque nocumento.	If there is a large new blood vessel at the base of the stitch; then it should not be cut from its root: but it should be tied with a strong double knot and left to fall off without harm.
Deinde imple uulnus coto ueteri, quod iam submersisti in unguento aegyptio.	Then fill the wound with old cow dung, which you have already soaked in Egyptian ointment.
Deinde cura ipsum.	Then care for yourself.
Si inciditur Strophula tota, tunc oportet ut aggreges labia duo uulneris: et suas ipsum statim, postquam uides quia prorsus non remansit superfluitas.	If the entire stitch has come out, then you should bring together the two edges of the wound: and immediately close them up as soon as you see that there is no excess.
Si autem uides quod remansit superfluitas propter magnitudinem Strophulae, tunc oportet ut intendas ad incidendam radicem eius, et extrahendam eam: et administra suturam quam diximus.	But if you see that there is excess due to the size of the stitch, then you should examine whether it remains attached to its root and remove it; and administer the stitch we have described.
Et quae ex Strophulis continet humiditates, perfora illam perforatione superficiali: ut appareat tibi locus maturitatis eius: et pone perforationem ab eo quod sequitur inferius corporis, sicut diximus.	And if any of the stitches contain moisture, pierce it with a shallow puncture: so that you can see the place where it is mature: and place the puncture from there, since it follows below the body, as we have said.
Deinde administra post perforationem licinia cum unguento, et similia eis, ut corrodat quod remansit ex corruptione, donec quando uides uulnus iam mundatum esse: tunc cura ipsum cum unguento generatiuo carnis, donec sanetur.	Then administer licorice after the puncture with ointment, and similar things to corrode whatever remains of corruption, until when you see that the wound has healed: then care for yourself with a gentler ointment made from meat, until it is well.
¶ De sectione Epiglotis ab apostemate intra guttur accidente.	Regarding the section on epiglottis removed from the throat due to an accident.
Caput XLIII.	Chapter XLI.
Dixerunt antiqui hanc sectionem in Epigloti, et non uidi aliquem in terra nostra, qui eam fecerit: et haec est scriptura sermonis eorum.	The ancient doctors described this operation on the epiglottis and no one in our land has done it, and this is the writing of their words.
In habentibus autem synanchiam, oportet ut deuitetur sectio Epiglotis: cum non fiat iuuamentum per illud: propterea, quod omnes uenae et pulmo sunt infirmi.	But if there is a block, the epiglottis section should be removed: not because it provides an opening, since the larynx and lung are already paralyzed.
In illis uero qui habent apostema calidum in ore, aut gutture, aut duabus amigdalis, quando non est aegritudo in cannali, oportet uti sectione Epiglotis, ad fugiendum ex perditione quae fit ex praefocatione.	Indeed, those who have a hot swelling in the mouth, throat, or tonsils, and there is no illness in the canal, should use the epiglottis section to avoid the danger that results from obstruction.
Oportet ergo quando uolumus illud, ut secemus Epiglotim sub tribus circulis Epiglotis, aut quatuor, sectione parua per latitudinem, in eo quod est inter duos circulos per quantitatem, quod sit sectio in sifac, non in cartilagine: et iste quidem locus est conueniens sectioni, quoniam est priuatus carne, et uasa sanguinis ab eo sunt longinqua.	Therefore, when we want to use this, let us remove the epiglottis with a small circle under the width of the epiglottis, in such a way that it is between two circles according to its quantity, so that it is at the tip of the sifilings, not in the cartilage: and this place is suitable for the section because it is separated from the flesh, and the blood vessels are far away from it.
Quod si medicator est timidus, tunc oportet ut extendat cutem gutturis cum uncino.	If the doctor is timid, then he should spread the skin of the throat with a hook.
Deinde findat cutem, donec quando peruenit ad cannalem: deuitet uas sanguinis, si uidet ex eis aliquid.	Then he will find the skin, until he reaches the canal: he should free the blood vessels, if he sees any of them.
Deinde secet sifac quod narrauimus: et significatur super sectionem cannalis ex phlegmate quod egreditur ex ea, cum eo quod disrumpitur, et abscisione uocis.	Then he will cut the sifilings that we mentioned above: and indicate on the section of the canal with phlegm that comes out from it when it is broken, and with the loss of voice.
Et dimitte uulnus apertum tempore aliquo.	And remove the hook at a time when the voice has stopped.
Cum ergo remouetur hora in qua timetur praefocatio, aggrega duo labia uulneris cutis, et sue ipsam solam absque cartilagine.	But when the hour of fear passes, gather together the two lips of the wound and cut them off alone without cartilage.
Deinde administra medicinas quae faciunt nasci carnem, usquequo sanetur.	Then administer medicines that make the flesh grow again until it heals.
Inquit Albucasis.	Says Al-Buqasi.
Summa huius sermonis quem narrauimus, expositio non est, nisi quando uident, quod aliquod horum apostematum iam opilauit guttur infirmi: et sublimatus est infirmus super mortem, et uult intersecari anhelitus eius: uadunt ad secandum Epiglotim, ut respiret infirmus super locum uulneris quadam respiratione, et saluetur a morte: et propter hoc praeceperunt dimittere uulnus apertum, donec consumatur malicia aegritudinis, et est malicia eius tribus diebus, et quasi ipsa: tunc ergo praecaeperunt suere uulnus, et curare ipsum, donec sanetur.	Here is the summary of the talk that we have mentioned above, it is not exposed unless you know, that some of these accidents in the throat have already been covered with a patch: and he has been saved from death, and has breathed a sigh of relief from his illness, and has been cured by this medicine: and for this reason they have ordered to remove the hook, until the evil of the illness is consumed, and it is like its own self: then, therefore, they have ordered to wipe the hook, and to take care of himself, until he is healed.
Et illud quod uidi per me ipsum est, quod una ancilla accaepit cultellum, et misit cum in guttur suum, et incidit cum eo partem cannalis pulmonis.	And this which I saw myself, that a serving-maid took up a scalpel and sent it into her throat, and cut with it a part of the canal of the lung.
Et uocatus sum ad curationem eius, et inueni eam mugire, sicut est mugitus mortui.	And I was called to cure her, and I found her gurgling, as does the gurgling of a dead person.
Detexi ergo a uulnere, et inueni sanguinem qui egressus fuerat ex uulnere paruum.	So I took off the bandage, and I found blood flowing out from the little rib cage.
Confisus ergo sum, quod ipsa non absciderat uenam, neque guidegi: et uentus egrediebatur ex uulnere.	I was therefore convinced that she had not cut her tendon, nor any other vessel: and wind came out of her rib cage.
Properaui ergo, et sui uulnus, et curaui ipsum, donec sanum est: et non accidit ancillae aliquid, nisi raucedo in uoce: et rediit post dies ad meliorem dispositionum suarum.	Then I took off the bandage, and also checked the tendon, and cured it until it was sound: and nothing happened to the maid, except that her voice became hoarse: and after a few days she returned to her normal state of health.
Hinc ergo dico: quod in sectione Epiglotis non est timor.	Therefore I say: there is no danger in cutting the epiglottis.
¶ De sectione Herniae gutturis.	As for cutting the hernia in the throat.
Caput XLIIII.	Chapter 44.
Hoc Apostema nominatum Hernia gutturis, est apostema magnum, secundum colorem corporis: et est in mulieribus multum.	This hernia named "guttural hernia" is a large one, second only to the colour of the body: and it occurs very often in women.
Et est secundum duos modos: aut enim est naturale: aut est accidentale.	And it has two causes: either it is natural: or it is accidental.
In naturali certe non est ingenium.	Certainly there is no artifice in the natural one.
Accidentale uero est secundum duos modos: quorum unus est similis nodis pinguibus.	But the accidental one has two causes, of which one is similar to the nodules in the groin, and the other...
Et modus alter, est similis apostemati quod fit ex nodatione arteriae.	And the other mode is similar to an ulcer that is formed from the inflammation of a blood vessel.
Et in ipso est timor, et non oportet ut praesumptio fiat ad ipsum cum ferro, nisi in eo quod est paruum: et tu proba ipsum, et inuestiga ipsum cum Intromisso.	And there is danger in it, and one should not dare to make an incision into it with a knife, unless it is small: and you should test it out, and investigate it with the probe.
Si ergo inuenis ipsum simile nodo pingui, et non est suspensum cum aliqua uenarum: tunc seca ipsum, sicut secantur nodi: et extrahe ipsum cum eo quod continet ex kisti, si est in kisti: et si non, tunc perscrutare totum eius.	If then you notice a hernia similar to a large nodule, and it is not suspended with any blood vessels: then cut it off, as one cuts off nodules: and if it is contained in a sac, remove it with the sac: and if it is not in a sac, then examine it all over.
Deinde cura locum cum eo quod oportet ex curatione, donec sanetur.	Then care for the place with him as is necessary for the cure, until he is healed.
¶ De sectione super species Nodorum.	§ On Section Above the Species of Knots.
Caput XLV.	Head L.XLV.
Nodorum multae sunt species, et ego iam dixi omnes species eorum in diuisione: et oportet ut narrem hic differentiam inter Nodum, et Exituram: cum sit dubitationem faciens.	There are many kinds of knots, and I have already spoken about their different types in the division; and it is necessary that I should explain here the difference between a Knot and an Entanglement, when there is doubt.
Dico ergo, quod cum Exitura est caliditas, et febris, et dolores uehementes, donec sedatur ebullitio superfluitatis, et completur putrefactio: tunc enim quiescunt febris et calor.	I say then, that when there is a fever and heat, and painful throbbing, until the efflux of pus has subsided, and decay has completed: for then the fever and heat subside.
Cum Nodo uero non est caliditas, neque febris, neque dolores, et continet eos kistis sifachin, qui est eis saccus proprius, et est secundum colorem corporis: et est incaeptio eorum sicut cicer, et fit sicut batecha, et maior et minor.	When however there is a Knot, there is neither heat nor fever, nor pain, and they are contained within their own sacs, which is their own skin, and is of the color of the body: it is like a chickpea, and forms like a bag, and is greater or smaller.
Et sunt secundum duas species: aut pingues: aut continent humiditatem.	And they are of two species: or they are fat: or they retain moisture.
Et colores humiditatis sunt multi, secundum quod dixi in diuisione.	And the colors of moisture are many, according to what I have said in the division.
Oportet ergo, quando peruenis ad curationem Nodi, ut experiaris eum, et inquiras ipsum in primis cum instrumento quod nominatur Intromissum, secundum quod ueniet forma eius in capitulo quod est post hoc.	Therefore, when you are treating a Knot, you must try it out, and inquire into it with the instrument called Intromissum, according to which its form is in the chapter after this.
Et modus inquisitionis apostematum, et Nodorum omnium est, ut accipias hoc instrumentum, et intromittas ipsum in humidiorem locum, quem inuenis in apostemate: et tu reuolue digitos tuos cum eo paulatim, donec scias quod instrumentum iam penetrauit cutem.	And the method of questioning the aprymous, and all Knots, is that you take this instrument, and introduce it into a moist place which you have prepared for the purpose: and you spread out your fingers with it little by little, until you know that the instrument has penetrated the skin.
Deinde ultima manum tuam secundum mensuram magnitudinis apostematis.	Then bring the last hand of yours according to the measure of the apurmous.
Deinde extrahe Intromissum, et considera illud quod egrediur in uestigio eius.	Then take out the Intromissum, and consider what comes out of its tip.
Si ergo egreditur humiditas currens, quicunque color sit: tunc seca ipsum sectione superficiali, secundum quod dixi in reliquis apostematibus.	If however moistness runs out, whatever color it is: then dry up the place with a superficial section, according to what I have said in other apurmous.
Et si non egreditur humiditas in uestigio Intromissi, tunc scias quia est pinguis: seca ergo super ipsum sectione habente formam crucis, secundum formam hanc, sicut docui te: et suspende ipsum cum uncinis, et excoria cutem ab omni parte cum facilitate: et custodi kistin si potes super illud, ut extrahas ipsam sanam cum Nodo.	And if no moisture comes out in the tip of the Intromissum, then you will know that it is fat: so dry up the place with a section having the form of a cross, according to this form, as I have taught you: and hang it by a hook, and scrape the skin from all parts with ease: and guard the case, if you can, over it, that you may take out the sound one with a Knot.
Si autem disrumpitur kistis apud operationem, et non est possibile extrahere ipsam sanam, multotiens enim accidit illud, tunc extrahe ipsam frustatim, donec non remaneat ex ea aliquid.	If, however, the bladder is torn during the operation and it is not possible to extract it whole, often it happens that then, if it is extracted at all, it is done haphazardly, until nothing remains of it.
Nam si remanet ex ea aliquid parum, aut multum, redit Nodus secundum plurimum.	For if a little or a lot remains of it, the knot returns secondarily by far the most.
Quod si uincit te, et remanet ex eo parum: tunc imple uulnus apud completionem tuam, quibusdam pulueribus corrosiuis acutis: et stringe uulnus, et pone supra ipsum quod sedet apostema calidum, et cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	If it hurts you and a little remains of it: then fill the ulcer with some acuter corrosive powder: and tighten the ligature, and put it above the seat of the ulcer with a warm poultice, and take care of the rest with care until it heals.
Si ergo est Nodus magnus, tunc sue duo labia eius, et cura ipsum cum eo quod incarnat.	If then there is a large knot: then cut the two lips of it and take care of what is scarred with it.
Si autem est tibi contraria uena pulsatilis, aut non pulsatilis: tunc propera, et imple locum zegi trito, et dimitte ipsum strictum duobus diebus, aut tribus, donec putrefiat uulnus, et quiescat ebullitio sanguinis: deinde redi ad incidendum illud quod remansit ex Nodo.	If then it is a young contrarian ulcer that pulses or does not pulse: then approach, and fill the place where it lies with dried ash, and leave it tied for two days or three, until the ulcer putrefies, and the efflux of blood ceases: then return to cut what remains of the knot.
¶ De foris instrumentorum pro sectione et perforatione.	Regarding instruments from outside the body for cutting and piercing.
Caput XLVI.	Chapter LXVI.
EX Eis sunt formae Intromissorum, et sunt trium specierum.	From these are the forms of introtrous devices, and they are three in kind.
Ex eis enim est magnum, et ex eis est medium, et ex eis est paruum.	For out of these is a large one, and out of these is a medium one, and out of these is a small one.
Fiant ex ferro alfulud quadratarum extremitatum decenter, ut festinent introitum in apostemate.	Let there be made out of iron square-ended rods that project from the centre so as to direct the introduction into the aperture.
Et istae sunt formae Experientium, et no, id est, perforantia: et unum eorum nominatur beris, idest, peforans: et sunt trium specierum.	And these are forms of experiment, and not, that is to say, piercing: and one of them is called a bore, that is, a piercer: and they are three in kind.
Ex eis enim est magnum, et medium, et paruum.	For out of these is a large one, and a medium one, and a small one.
Conueniunt, ut inuestigentur per ea apostemata, et exiturae, et fistulae, et bubones ab eo quod inter ea est ex ossibus.	Let them be made to project from the openings, and from exits, and from tubes, and from abscesses out of which are bones.
Et aliis fiunt rotunda, tersa, lenia, sicut acus magnae quibus subsellia suuntur, ex citrino scilicet, aut ex aere, aut ferro, aut argento.	And others are round, thirdly smooth, as large needles out of which are sutures used for stitching, made out of amber, or out of copper, or out of iron, or silver.
Et meliora eorum sunt quae fiunt ex citrino.	And their better things are those that are made from citron.
Et fiunt Experientia etiam de plumbo nigro, quae conueniunt ut per ea experiantur fistulae, quarum concauitate sunt reflexiones, ut reflectantur cum lenitate sua cum illis reflexionibus.	And also experience is made with black lead, which is convenient so that through it they may experience the tubes, of which there are reflections to reflect with gentle reflections on them with its own reflections.
Et sunt iterum trium specierum.	And again there are three species.
Quoniam ex eis sunt longa, ex eis media, et ex eis breuia, secundum quantitatem amplitudinis fistulae et stricturae eius.	For from them are the long ones, from them the medium ones, and from them the short ones, according to the quantity of the width of the tube and its tightness.
Forma Vncinorum, et sunt multarum specierum.	The shape of the rings, and there are many species.
Quoniam ex eis sunt simplices, scilicet quibus est curuitas una: et sunt trium specierum sicut uides, Magni, Medii, et Parui.	For from them are the simple ones, that is to say those which have one depth: and there are three species as you see, Great, Medium, and Small.
Et ex eis sunt Vncini caeci: et sunt trium specierum.	And from them are Blind Rings: and there are three species.
Et ex eis sunt uncini habentes duas curuaturas, et sunt trium specierum: et ex eis sunt uncini habentes tres curuaturas, et sunt trium specierum: et omnes isti sunt necessarii in loco suo.	And from them are hooks having two depths, and there are three species: and all these are necessary in their place.
Et istae sunt formae Scalpellorum, quibus secantur et excoriantur Nodi, et apostemata: et sunt trium specierum: quoniam ex eis est magnum, medium, et paruum.	And these are the shapes of Scalpels, with which they cut and scar Nodules and Apostenes: and there are three species: for from them is the great one, the medium one, and the small one.
Eorum extremitates quibus fit sectio sunt acutae, extremitates aliae sunt non acutae: et non ponuntur taliter, nisi ut cum eis fiat iuuamentum in excoriatione Nodorum apud timorem incisionis uenae, aut nerui: et ut sanetur per ea infirmus, et inueniat tranquillitatem parumper ex adustione quam inuenit apud excoriationem apostematis.	Their ends with which they make a cut are acute, other ends are not acute: and they are not put together except so that the iuuamentum is made in scarfing Nodules at the risk of cutting the skin, or the nerve: and to heal the sick by it, and find a little tranquillity from the drying which it finds when healing by the scarification of Apostenes.
Istae sunt Magda, et sunt specierum trium.	These are called Magnas, and there are three species.
Fiunt ex aere, et sunt similia Radio, cum quo fit alcohol: et in extremitate lata est puncta Spatumilis occultata: et in ea currit ad interiora, et ad exteriora quando uis, sicut uides.	They are made of brass, and they are similar to the radio, with which it is made alcohol: and in the long end there is a little point called Spatemilis hidden: and it runs inside when you see it, and outside when you cut it as you see it.
Forma Spatumilium quae absconduntur inter digitos apud perforationem apostematum: et non percipiunt ea infirmi: et sunt trium specierum, magnum, medium, et paruum.	The shape of the Spatemil, which hides between the fingers at the perforation of the Apostenes: and they are not felt by the touch: and there are three species, great, medium, and small.
Fomae Ventosarum cum quibus abscinditur fluxus sanguinis: et sunt trium specierum, magnae, mediae, et paruae.	The forms of incisions made to stop the flow of blood: and there are three kinds, large, medium, and small.
Fiant ex aere, aut citrino, rotundae, ad longitudinem parumper, sicut uides: et sint ad subtilitatem.	Let them be made from brass or copper, round, about the same length, as you see: and let them be of fine quality.
Et oportet ut sint istae species Ventosarum apud te magnae, et paruae: ut abscindas per eas sanguinem cum uelocitate apud necessitatem, et tunc quando non est tibi praesens medicina.	And let there be these kinds of incisions with you, large and small: so that you may cut off the blood through them in haste when it is necessary, and then when there is no medicine for you.
Verumtamen non utaris eis in abscisione sanguinis in omni loco corporis, et non utaris nisi in locis carnosis: sicut lacertis cruris, et coxae, et lacertis brachiorum, et mammillarum, et uentris, et inguinum, et similibus eis, ex lacertis carnosis, humidis.	However, do not use them for cutting blood everywhere in the body, and do not use them except in fleshy places: such as those of the legs, and hips, and arms, and breasts, and feet, and groin, and like them, from those of the flesh, moist.
Et quandoque fiunt ex eis instrumenta parua alia similia corticibus fisticorum, secundum suam formam: quibus abscinditur sanguis quando fluit ex loco phlebotomiae, aut apud incisionem uenae, aut arteriae: et quandoque fiunt ex eis rotundae secundum hanc formam.	And when they are made from them small instruments like the blades of knives, according to their shape: so that blood is cut when it flows from a place of bleeding, or when a wound is cut in the vein, or artery: and sometimes they are made from them round ones according to this form.
¶ De cura Mammillarum hominum quae mammillis mulierum assimilantur.	Regarding the care of the breasts of women, which are like the breasts of men.
Caput XLVII.	Chapter LVII.
Quandoque inflantur Mammillae quorundam hominum apud complementum somni (id est, cum incipiunt pollui in somno) donec similantur mammillis mulierum: et remanent apostemosae foede.	When the breasts of some men swell up to the size of a woman's breasts while they are sleeping until they resemble women's breasts: and remain full of milk.
Qui ergo abhorret illud, oportet ut secet super mammillas sectione lunari, secundum hanc formam ex linea, b. ad lineam, g. Deinde excoria pinguedinem totam.	Whoever does not like this, should cut off the breast with a lunar section, according to this form from the line, b, to the line, g: and then scrape the skin all over.
Postea imple uulnus ex medicamine incarnatiuo.	Then fill the whole thing with a medicinal paste of burnt flesh.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris cum sutura, et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then join together two wounds of the lip with stitches, and take care of it, until it heals.
Si autem declinat mammilla ad inferiora, et mollificatur propter magnitudinem suam, sicut accidit mulieribus: tunc oportet ut findatur in duobus lateribus suis superioribus duabus sectionibus similibus figurae lunari, quarum unaquaeque continetur cum altera apud fines utriusque, donec sit linea maior continens minorem, secundum hanc formam ex linea, b. ad lineam, g. Postea excoria cutem quae est inter duo labia, et aufer pinguedinem, et administra quod diximus de sutura et pulueribus, quod est necessarium ex curatione, donec sanetur.	If, however, the breast sways downward and softens because of its size, as happens to women: then let there be found in each side of it two sections according to the lunar form, each one holding the other from either side, so that the larger line holds the smaller one together, according to this form from the line, b, to the line, g. Then scrape the skin between the two lips, and remove the milk, and administer what we have said about the stitch and the powders, which is necessary in the treatment, until it heals.
Si autem non comples incisionem eius quod oportet te incidere, propter inquietudinem infirmi, aut propter fluxum sanguinis: tunc oportet ut impleas uulnus coto submerso unguento corrosiuo, et dimitte ipsum, donec corrodat illud quod remansit ex pinguedine.	But if you do not like the incision that needs to be made on you for the purpose of incising, due to a disturbance of the sick or due to a flow of blood: then it is necessary that you fill the wound with a corrosive ointment immersed, and leave it until it corrodes what remains from pinged.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then take care of the wound, until it heals.
¶ De perforatione apostematis, quod accidit sub Titillico.	Regarding the pustules that occurred during the Typhus.
Caput XLVIII.	Chapter 58.
Ista apostemata quae accidunt sub Titillico, sunt ex speciebus Strophularum dura, quae continet kistis, et ex eis sunt quae continent humiditates.	These pustules that occur during the Typhus are of a hard species of Staphylococcus, which contains a casing, and from which there comes moisture.
Quae ergo sunt ex eis quae continent humiditates, oportet ut secentur sectione lunari, secundum hanc formam, ex linea b. ad lineam, g. cum ergo euacuatur totum quod est in apostemate ex sanie, tunc imple ipsum coto ueteri, et dimitte ipsum usque ad diem alium.	These pustules that contain moisture must be incised with a lunar section, according to this form, from line b to line g; and when all that is in the pustule is drained out of the liquid, then fill it again with an old ointment, and leave it until another day.
Deinde auferatur cotum, et curetur cum unguento conueniente ad illud, donec sanetur.	Then remove the ointment, and treat with a suitable ointment to suit the wound, until it heals.
Quod si apostema fuerit ex specie nodorum Strophularum, tunc scinde super ipsum, sicut diximus in sectione super Strophulas aequaliter.	If the pustule is of the species of nodules of Staphylococcus, then cut across it, as we have said in the section on Staphyluses that are equal.
Si autem extenditur uulnus in hoc ut emittat pus, tunc administra in eo cauterium, secundum quod diximus in eo quod praemissum est.	But if the wound extends in this way so as to emit pus, then administer a cauterization to it, according to what we have said above.
¶ De sectione apostematis quod accidit propter Arteriam et Venam.	Regarding the incision of a pustule that occurs due to an artery or vein.
Caput XLIX.	Chapter 59.
Quando disrumpitur Arteria, et consolidatur cutis quae est supra eam, tuno multotiens accidit inde apostema: et similiter accidit Venae etiam, ut accidat in ea apostema et inflatio.	When an artery is severed and the skin that is above it hardens, then often a pustule occurs there; and also occurs the same thing with veins, so that a pustule and swelling occur there.
Et signa quibus cognoscitur, quod apostema et inflatio sint propter Arteriam et Venam, sunt: quoniam, quando apostema est propter arteriam, est longum, aggregatum in profundo corporis: et quando impellis apostema digits tuis, sentis quasi sit ei stridor.	And the signs by which it is known that a pustule and swelling occur due to an artery and vein are these: because when a pustule occurs due to an artery, it is long and aggregated in the depth of the body; and when you touch the swelled fingers, you feel as if there were a whistle.
Et illud quod est propter Venam, est rotundum in manifesto corporis.	And what is for the vein, is round in the manifest body.
Et sectio super hoc apostema est error, et praecipue quod est sub ascellis, et inguinibus, et collo, et in locis multis corporis: et est magnum ualde.	And the section on this emphysema is an error, and especially that which is under the armpits, and groin, and neck, and in many places of the body: and it is great indeed.
Oportet ergo ut deuitetur eius cura cum ferro, et quod ex eis etiam est in extremitatibus, aut in capite, oportet ut deuitetur.	Therefore, so that its care be avoided with iron, and that which is from it also in the extremities, or in the head, let it be avoided.
Super illud ergo quod ex eis est ex inflatione orificii Arteriae, finde in cute sectione in longitudine.	On this then, what is from it from the inflation of the orifice of an artery, find in the skin in the section in length.
Deinde aperi sectionem cum uncinis, postea Arteriam: et libera eam ex tunicis, donec detegatur.	Then open the section with a hook, then the artery: and free it from the tunics, until it is detected.
Deinde intromitte sub ea acum, et fac eam penetrare usque ad latus aliud, et stringe Arteriam cum filo duplo in duobus locis, secundum quod docui te in extractione duarum Arteriarum quae sunt in timporibus.	Then introduce underneath it a hook, and let it penetrate as far as another side, and tighten the artery with a double thread in two places, according to what I taught you in the extraction of two arteries which are in the temples.
Deinde punge locum, qui est inter duo ligamenta cum spatumili, donec egrediatur sanguis qui est in eo totus, et soluatur apostema.	Then poke the place that is between the two ligaments with a hook, until all the blood that is in it has come out, and the emphysema has been resolved.
Deinde administra curationem quae generat pus, donec cadant ligamenta: postea cura illud cum unguentis conuenientibus ad illud, donec sanetur.	Then administer the cure which generates pus, until the ligaments fall: then care for that with ointments fitting to it, until it heals.
Quod si fuerit apostema propter sectionem Venae, tunc oportet ut teneas manu tua quod tibi possibile est ex apostemate cum cute.	If the emphysema is from the section of a vein, then you should hold your hand to it that you may extract it from the skin.
Deinde intromitte acum sub loco quem tenuisti manu tua, et fac eam penetrare: et sit in ea filum duplum, donec extrahas ipsum ex latere altero.	Then introduce a hook under the place that you held with your hand, and let it penetrate: and let it be in it a double thread, until you extract it from the other side.
Deinde liga cum ipso apostema ligamento bono: secundum quod dixi tibi in ligamento uuae, a duabus partibus cum duabus extremitatibus fili.	Then bind the emphysema with that good ligature: according to what I told you in the ligature of a thread, from two parts with two extremities of the thread.
Si autem times quod extrahatur filum, tunc intromitte acum aliam cum filo alio sub apostemate toto apud incisionem acus: preme, et stringe fila tua in quatuor locis.	If you are to extract a thread, then introduce a hook with another thread under the emphysema all around the incision of the blade: press, and tighten your threads in four places.
Deinde seca apostema in medio sui, donec quando egreditur quod in eo est: tunc incide superfluitatem cutis, et dimitte quod ligatum est ex ea.	Then dry up the abscess in the middle of it until you see what is inside; then make an incision over the skin and release what is tied up from it.
Deinde pone super ipsum puluillum quem submersisti in uino, et oleo.	Then put a little pulse on it that you immersed in wine and oil.
Deinde administra curationem, quae fit cum liciniis et unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then apply the cure, which is made with liniments and ointments, until it heals.
¶ De apostemate quod accidit ex torsione Neruorum.	This is an abscess that has occurred from a torsion of the nerves.
Caput L.	Head of Latin.
Sicut accidit apostema in Arteria et Vena, similiter accidit apostema in Neruis: quod accidit in eis percussio, aut accidit a labore superfluo, et similibus: et fit plurimum illis in locis adiutoriorum, aut calcanei, et in omni loco in quo mouentur iuncturae: et est apostema graue.	As has happened with an abscess in an artery or vein, so it has happened with an abscess in a nerve: what has happened to them is percussion, or it has happened from excessive work, and similar: and it often happens to them in the places of aid, or calcanei, and in any place where the joints move: and it is a gray abscess.
Similatur color eius reliquo corpori, et est in pluribus dispositionibus absque dolore: et quando stringitur cum uehementia, sentit in eo infirmus simile stupori.	Its color is similar to the rest of the body, and it is in many dispositions without pain: and when it is squeezed with a trembling, it feels in it a similar stupor.
Et non est apostema aggregatum in profundo corporis, imo est sub cute, et ipsum mouetur ad omnem partem, et non uadit ad anteriora, uel ante, neque retro ad posteriora.	And this abscess is not gathered in the depth of the body, but under the skin, and it moves to all parts, and does not come out in front, or before, or behind.
Quod ergo ex eis est in iuncturis, non oportet ut inuadatur cum ferro.	Therefore, what is in the joints should not be moved with iron.
Fortasse enim accidet contractio.	Perhaps, however, this contraction may happen.
In illo autem quod ex eis est in capite, aut in fronte, finde cutem cum spatumili.	In that, however, which is in the head or in the front, find skin with a hammer.
Si ergo est apostema paruum, tunc tene ipsum cum forficibus, et abscinde ipsum a radice.	If, then, it is a small abscess, then hold it with tweezers and cut it off at the root.
Et si est magnum, tunc suspende ipsum eum uncino, et excoria ipsum: deinde aufer ipsum, et aggrega uulnus cum sutura: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	And if it is a large one, then hang it on an hook and scrape it off: then take it off, and join the wound with a stitch: and care for it, until it heals.
¶ De sectione apostematis, quod accidit in uentre.	Regarding the section of abscesses, which occurs in the belly.
Caput LI.	Head of Latin.
Accidunt quibusdam hominibus multotiens in uentribus eorum, et in reliquis corporibus ipsorum, thelil, quae nominantur Fungalia, per similitudinem ipsorum cum fungis.	To some people often happen in their bellies, and in the rest of their bodies, growths, which they call mushrooms, because of the similarity of these to mushrooms.
Quorum radix est subtilis, et ipsorum caput est grossum, et conuersa sunt labia eorum.	Of these the root is subtle, and their head is coarse, and their lips are large.
Et est ex eis paruum: et est ex eis quod magnificatur ualde.	And of them there is little that is wonderful.
Et ego quidem iam uidi uirum, et in uentre eius erant duo thelil, quae erant magis quam rebus aliis similia fungis: non erat differentia inter ea, alba, minutae radicis, et inuersabantur labia eorum, et findebantur, et humiditas currebat ex eis semper.	And I myself have seen a man, and in his stomach there were two little thorns, which were more like other things than to the rest of the plant: there was no difference between them, they were white, small-rooted, and their lips were large and dry, and always moisture flowed out from them.
Incidi ergo ea, et inueni in pondere unius quasi X et VIII uncia et in altero quasi VI uncia Et operatio in incisione eorum est, ut consideres tunc, si infirmus est humidus, et color thelil est albus, humidum, subtilis radicis: tunc incide ipsum cum spatumili lato, et sint in praesentia tua cauteria in igne.	So I cut them, and I found in one of them about ten and eight grains and in the other about six. And the operation with a sharp knife on these is such that you consider then, if he is ill, moist, and the color of the thorns is white, moist, subtle-rooted: then cut him with a wide chisel, and let them be in your presence while they are heated in fire.
Multotiens enim expellitur apud sectionem eius sanguis multus: propera ergo si te uincit sanguis, tunc cauteriza ipsum.	For often much blood is discharged by them when cut. So if blood hurts you, then cauterize him.
Quod si uides infirmum pauidum et timidum ab incisione cum ferro, tunc accipe filum ex plumbo decenter factum, et stringe cum eo athelul: cuius modus est quem diximus, et dimitte ipsum duobus diebus.	That if you see him weak, fearful of being cut with an iron knife, then take a wire made from lead that is slightly bent, and tie it with a thistle: whose way this is as I have said, and let go of him for two days.
Deinde adde in strictura plumbi.	Then add to the constriction of the lead.
Non ergo cesses stringere plumbum, quotiens imprimit in thelil, donec abscindatur, et cadat per se absque labore.	So do not stop constricting the lead when it imprisons the thorns, until it is cut off and falls by itself without work.
Si autem thelil grossae fuerit radicis, tunc in incisione eius est quiddam timoris et pauoris: praecipue quod est in uentre.	But if the thorns are coarse-rooted, then there is some fear and anxiety when cut: especially because it is in the belly.
Verumtamen possibile est, ut incidas medietatem eius.	However, it is possible to cut half of it.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum, ut non redeat.	Then cauterize him, so that he does not bleed again.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur uulnus.	Then take care of the wound, until the sore heals.
Et caue ne praesumas incidere thelil quod est fusci coloris, pauci sensus, foedi aspectus: ipsum enim est apostema cancerosum: et ego ueniam cum rememoratione Cancri post hoc.	And do not assume that cutting the thorns, which is of a reddish color, has little sense, eats little, and looks tasty: for it is an ulcerous cancer: and I come with a memory of the crab after this.
¶ De cura eminentiae Vmbilici.	On the care of umbilical hernias.
Caput LII.	De cura eminentiae Vmbilici.
Fit eminentia Vmbilici ex caussis multis.	Umbilical hernia may result from various causes.
Aut ex fissuris sifac, quod super uentrem est: et exit ex eo althub, aut intestinum, secundum quod accidit in reliquis rupturis.	It may arise from a fistula running below the navel, or it may proceed from the intestine, depending on whether it occurs in other rupture sites.
Aut ex sanguine qui fluit ex Vena, aut ex Arteria, secundum quod praemissum est.	Or it may come from blood flowing from a vein, or from an artery, as mentioned above.
Aut ex uentositate coartata in eo.	Or from a constricted hernia.
Si autem est propter fissuram sifac, et exitum thirbi: tunc est color apostematis similis colori corporis: et est lene, absque dolore: et apparet diuersi situs.	If, however, it arises from a fistula running below the navel and its discharge is thin: then it resembles the color of bruises and is soft, without pain; and it may appear at various locations.
Et si est propter egressionem intestini, tunc est situs eius, cum eo quod narrauimus, uehementioris diuersitatis.	And if it arises from the exit of the intestine, then its location is with that which we have mentioned, more variable in character.
Cum ergo tu premis ipsum digitis tuis, occultatur: deinde redit, et fortasse est cum eo sonitus: et magnificatur multum apud introitum balnei, et laborem uehaementum.	When you press it with your fingers, it is hidden: then it returns, and perhaps there is a sound with it; and it grows louder towards the navel opening, and causes pain.
Si uero est propter humiditatem, est lene, tunc non occultatur quando premis ipsum manu tua, neque constringium, neque additur.	If, however, it is due to moisture, it is soft; then it does not disappear when pressed with your hand, and does not close, nor does it increase.
Quod si est propter sanguinem, tunc cum istis signis apparet apostema ad nigredinem de cliue.	If, however, it is due to blood, then with these signs a bruise appears turning black.
Si autem est propter carnem natam: tunc est apostema graue, grossum, durum, et figitur secundum quantitatem unam.	But if it is from newborn meat: then it is a grayish, thick, hard bruise, and its color varies with the quantity.
Si uero est propter uentositatem, tunc tactus eius est lenis.	If, however, it is due to wind, then your touch of it is gentle.
Et operatio in illo est, ut consideres tunc, si eminentia umbilici est propter sanguinem Arteriae, aut Venae, aut uentositatem: tunc oportet ut prohibearis a curatione eius.	And the operation on it is such that, when you examine it, if umbilical hernia is due to blood from an artery or vein, or wind, then you should refrain from treating it.
Nam in illo est timor et pauor, sicut docui te in capitulo, in quo dixi apostemata propter arteriam et uenam.	For in that is fear and dread, as I taught you in the chapter where I said that bruises arise from an artery and wind.
Quod si eminentia umbilici est propter intestinum, aut zirbum: tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmo, quatenus teneat anhelitum suum, et stet stans extensus.	If umbilical hernia is due to intestine or bile, then you should instruct the sick person to hold his breath and remain standing with his arms extended.
Deinde signa cum encaustro in circumitu umbilici totius.	Then mark with caustic around the navel all around.
Postea praecipe ei, ut resupinetur inter manus tuas super dorsum suum.	Then order him to lie down on his back between your hands.
Deinde circunda cum spatumili lato in circumitu umbilici super locum quem signasti cum encaustro.	Then with a flat blade mark around the navel on top of the spot you marked with caustic.
Postea extende medium apostematis ad superiora, cum uncino magno.	Then extend the middle finger slightly towards the top, with a large hook.
Deinde liga eum in circumitu forti cum filo, aut cum chorda de serico ligamento firmo: et sit nodus ligamenti alenxotati.	Then bind him firmly around the navel with thread or a silken cord; and let the knot be tied with the cord stretched taut.
Deinde aperi medium apostematis extensum supra ligamentum.	Then open the middle finger that was extended slightly upwards, by unlinking it from the ring finger.
Si ergo inueneris ipsum iam captum a ligamento: tunc extrahe alenxotati, et intromitte in ipsum digitum indicem, et impelle intestinum ad interiora uentris: et si inueneris zirbum, tunc accipe ipsum cum uncino, et incide superfluitatem eius.	If you then find the man already captured by the ligature: then pull out the ligature and insert the index finger inside of him, and push inwards towards his insides: and if you find a bulge, then take hold of it with a hook and cut off the excess.
Si autem contraria est tibi arteria, aut uena: tunc circunda ipsum multum.	But if the opposite artery is on the right or the veal: then mark him well.
Deinde redi ad operationem tuam.	Then return to your operation.
Et accipe duas acus, et intromitte in eis duo fila fortia: et intromitte duas acus in circumitu quem fecisti circa apostema in modum crucis, quas facis penetrare.	And take two hooks and insert two strong wires into them: and insert the two hooks you made around the lump in a cross-shaped manner so that they penetrate.
Deinde stringe apostema in quatuor locis super acus: et si uis, aufer acus, et dimitte locum, donec putrefiat caro extensa: et cadat per se: aut incide ipsam quando subtiliatur et putrefit.	Then tighten the lump at four places on the hooks: and if it is a vein, remove the hook and let the place bleed until the flesh around it rots: and let it fall away on its own: or cut it when it becomes slimy and rotten.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod oportet ex unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then take care of the man with the ointment as is necessary until he heals.
Quod si eminentia umbilici est ex carne nara in eo, aut ex humiditate: tunc oportet ut concaues apostema, sicut diximus.	If the navel's eminence is flesh within it, or from moisture: then you must cut off the lump as we have said.
Et extrahas sanguinem, aut humiditatem, quam inuenis in eo.	And extract the blood or moisture that you find inside of him.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod solidat locum.	Then take care of the man with the ointment so that the hole heals over.
¶ De cura CANCRI.	Of the treatment of cancer.
Caput LIII.	Chapter LIII.
Iam diximus in diuisione species Cancri, et qualiter est uia ad curationem eius cum medicinis: et cauendum ab eo cum curatione eius cum ferro, ut non ulceretur: et diximus Cancrum generatum in matrice, et cautelam a curatione eius.	We have already spoken about the classification of cancer and how to treat it with medicines; and how to beware of treating it with iron so that it does not ulcerate; and we have spoken about cancer born from the womb, and about the caution to be taken when treating it.
Et dixerunt antiqui, quod quandoque Cancer est in loco, ubi possibilis est eius eradicatio: sicut Cancer qui est in mammillis, aut in coxa, et eis similibus, ex membris locatis ad extrahendum totum eius: praecipue quando est incipiens paruus.	And the ancients said that when ever cancer is in a place where it can be eradicated: such as cancer which is in the breast, or in the thigh, and similar things, from the member placed to extract all of it: especially when it is starting to bud.
Quando uero antiquatur, et est magnus, non oportet ut appropinques ei.	For when it is old, and is great, it is not necessary that you approach it.
Ego enim non potui sanare ex eo aliquem: neque uidi alium ante me qui peruenerit ad illud.	For I could not heal from it anyone: nor did I see another before me who came to it.
Et operatio in eo, quando est locatus sicut diximus, est, ut praecedas, et soluas infirmum ex cholera nigra aliquotiens.	And the operation on it, when it is placed like we said, is, as the saying goes, to go first, and to resolve the disease from black cholera sometimes.
Deinde phlebotoma ipsum si inuenis cum repletione manifesta.	Then phlebotomy for itself if it is a sore with evident swelling.
Deinde praepara infirmum praeparatione, in qua locetur cum operatione.	Then prepare the sick with preparation, where it is placed with operation.
Deinde proiice in Cancrum uncinos qui conueniunt ei.	Then throw on cancer the claws which are suitable for him.
Postea concaua ipsum ab omni parte cum cute, secundum perscrutationem, donec non remaneat aliquid ex radicibus eius: et dimitte sanguinem currere, et non abscindas ipsum uelociter, imo exprime loca, et absterge sanguinem grossum totum manu tua, aut cum quo possibile est ibi ex instrumentis.	Then close up the cancer by all its side with a skin, according to the investigation, until there remains nothing of it's roots: and let the blood not run, and do not cut off it quickly, except you express places, and wash away the gross blood completely with your hand, or with whatever is possible there.
Si autem contrarietatem facit tibi fluxus sanguinis grossi ex incisione arteriae, aut uenae: tunc cauteriza uenam, donec abscindatur sanguis.	If however does not agree to you the running of the gross blood from the incision of an artery, or a vein: then cauterize a vein, until there is cut off blood.
Deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then care for the cancer with the remaining cure, until it heals.
¶ De cura Hydropisis.	§ De care for Hidropsis.
Caput LIIII.	Head LIIII.
Iam narrauimus in diuisione species Hydropisis, et qualiter fit aggregatio aquae: et signa omnis speciei, et curationem eius cum medicinis.	We have already spoken about the division of the species of Hydropsis, and how water is aggregated: and the signs of each species, and the cure of it with medicines.
Et illa quae curatur cum ferro, non est nisi species asclitis sola: et non approximatur cum ferro speciei timpanitis: neque speciei hyposarcae penitus: nam illud mortale est.	And that which is cured with iron, is not but one species of aching: and does not approach to iron of the timorous type: nor does it go deep into the hipo-sarcous: for that is deadly.
Quando tu iam medicatus es hanc speciem Hydropisis timpanitis cum medicinis, et non contulit medicatio tua: tunc considera.	When you already treated this species of Hydropsis with timorous medicines, and did not yield to your treatment: then consider.
Nam si infirmo iam consecuta est debilitas, aut est cum eo infirmitas alia praeter Hydropisim: sicut si sit cum eo tussis, aut uentris solutio, et similia illis: tunc caue ne mediceris ei cum ferro: quoniam est timor illud.	If the disease has now progressed and there is a debility, or else there is another infirmity besides hydropisis; as if there is coughing with him, or urine loss, and similar things to these: then take care not to medicate him with iron: for this is dangerous.
Si autem uides infirmum exuberantis uirtutis, neque est cum eo aegritudo praeter Hydropisim solam: et non est puer, neque senex: tunc modus operationis in eo est, ut tu eleues infirmum stantem inter manus tuas, et minister post ipsum exprimat uentrem eius manu sua impellendo aquam ad inferiorem partem pectinis.	But if you see a sick person with a vibrant vitality, and there is no disease other than hydropisis only; and he is not a boy nor an old man: then the method of operation in him is, that you should take the sick man standing between your hands, and let him discharge his wind by pushing water into his lower chest.
Deinde accipe spatumile spinosum, secundum hanc formam.	Then take a spathula with sharp spines, shaped like this.
Sit duarum partium acutarum, longum, acutae extremitatis sicut Spatumile.	Sit the two sharp ends, one long, and the acute end like a spathula.
Verumtamen in eo sit quiddam breuitatis paulatim, ut non pertranseas cum eo apud operationem usque ad intestinum, et laedas ipsum.	But in him there should be something that does not hurt him little by little, so as not to hurt him during the operation until the intestines, and let him go.
Deinde considera.	Then look at it carefully.
Nam si est generatio Hydropisis ex parte intestinorum, tunc oportet ut elongeris cum sectione ab umbilico quantitate trium digitorum, ad inferiora in directo eius supra pectinem.	For if the generation of hydropisis is from one part of the intestines, then it should be extended with a length of three fingers' width from the umbilicus to the lower side directly above the chest.
Si uero generatio Hydropisis est propter aegritudinem epatis: tunc sit sectio tua sinistra ab umbilico tribus digitis.	But if the generation of hydropisis is due to liver disease: then your section should be on the left side from the umbilicus by three fingers' width.
Et si generatio eius est propter splenem, tunc sit sectio in latere dextro: et non oportet etiam ut sit sectio in latere super quod uult iacere infirmus, ut non currant superfluitates ad illum locum debilem.	And if the generation of it is due to the spleen, then your section should be on the right side: and it should not also be that the section should be in the place where the sick one used to lie, so that excesses do not go to that weak place.
Deinde perfora cum instrumento cutem totam.	Then pierce the skin with an instrument all over.
Deinde intromitte in illam sectionem, et eleua manum tuam cum Spatumili inter cutem, et sifac, quasi tu excories ipsum: et sit quantitas quae excoriatur quantitas unguis, aut circiter ilud.	Then introduce it into the section, and squeeze with your hand with a spathula between the skin, and rub it as if you were cleaning it: and let the amount of what is rubbed be the same as the nail's amount, or around that place.
Deinde perfora sifac, donec perueniat Spatumile ad locum uacuum: et est locus aquae.	Then pierce the skin until the spathula reaches a vacant place: and this is a place of water.
Deinde extrahe ipsum, et intromitte in foramen instrumentum, cuius haec est forma.	Then remove the flesh, and insert into the hole a tool of this shape.
Et est simile cannulae: fit ex argento, aut aere, aut aurichalco, lene, tersum: cui in inferiori parte sui est foramen paruum, et in lateribus eius sunt tria foramina, duo ab una parte, et unum a parte altera: et facia est extremitas eius incisa, secundum modum incisionis calami, sicut uides: in extremitate eius superiore est armilla.	And it is similar to a cannula; it is made of silver, or gold, or brass, or wood, or lead, smooth: and its lower part has a small hole, and on its sides there are three holes, two on one side, and one on the other side: and its end is incised, according to the mode of incision of the pencil, as you see: at its upper end there is an annulus.
Nam quando instrumentum peruenit ad aquam, tunc ipsa descendit statim super instrumentum, ergo euacua ex aqua in hora quantitatem mediam.	For when the instrument reaches the water, then immediately it descends on top of the instrument, so it empties from the water at the moment a medium quantity.
Quoniam si tu euacuas ex ea plus quam oportet, in hora fortasse moritur infirmus per resolutionem spiritus sui animalis: aut accidit ei syncopis quae appropinquat morti.	For if you empty it out more than is necessary, in an hour perhaps the sick one dies by resolution of his animal soul: or it happens to him that a fit approaches death.
Verum euacua ex ea secundum quantitatem uirtutis eius, et secundum quod significant tibi dispositiones infirmi ex uirtute pulsus eius, et ex bonitate eius.	But empty it out from it according to the quantity of its strength, and according to what I tell you about the dispositions of the nurse out of its pulse, and out of its goodness.
Deinde extrahe instrumentum, et retine aquam.	Then remove the instrument, and retain the water.
Quod est, quia retinetur statim propter cutem quae retinet foramen quod est super sifac: de quo narraui, ut perfores ipsum secundum illum modum.	That is, because it retains immediately by means of the skin which holds the hole that is over the syringe: of which I told you, so that you do it according to that method.
Deinde itera instrumentum die altero, si uides infirmum tolerare illud: et extrahe etiam ex aqua quantitatem paruam.	Then repeat the instrument on the other side, if you see that the sick one can bear that: and remove also from the water a medium quantity.
Fac illud diebus aliquot sine timore, et custodi te ab errore: donec non remaneat ex aqua nisi parum.	Do it for several days without fear, and guard yourself against an error: until there remains in the water nothing but a little.
Si autem times super infirmum, et dimittis ex aqua rem multam: tunc cura ipsum cum sepultura in harena calida, et sudore multo in balneo et sole, et expectet super sitim: et cura ipsum cum medicinis exiccatiuis, donec sanetur: et cauteriza super stomachum, et epar, et splenem, post extractionem aquae: secundum quod narraui in eo quod praecessit.	But if you are able to bear on the sick one, and you let go of a great deal of water: then take care for him with a burial in hot sand, and with much sweat in a bath and in the sun, and he shall wait on hunger: and take care for him with doctors who dry out, until he is healed: and cauterize over his stomach, and his spleens, and his liver, after removal of water: according to which I told you beforehand.
¶ De cura infantium qui nascuntur locis urinae eorum non perforatis.	Of the care of infants who are born with their bladders not pierced.
Caput LV.	Chapter L. Of the care of infants who are born with
Quando egreditur aliquis infantium ex uentre matris suae, et caput mutonis eius est non perforatum, aut est foramen strictum, aut in non suo loco.	If any baby comes out of his mother's womb, and the skin of his head is not pierced, or has a narrow opening, or is not in its place:
Oportet ergo succurrere cum perforatione eius statim cum nascitur cum Spatumili subtili ualde, secundum hanc formam.	It is necessary to attend to the piercing of it immediately after its birth with a soft needle, according to this form.
Deinde pone in foramine clauum subtilem ex plumbo, et liga ipsum: et tene ipsum tribus diebus, aut quatuor.	Then put a small plug made of lead into the opening and bind it: and hold it for three days, or four.
Quando ergo uult urinam emittere, remoueatur, et mingat.	When he is about to urinate, let him move his body, and let him go.
Deinde reduc ipsum.	Then bring back the baby.
Et si tu non ponis plumbum, iam possibile est, ut urina quae incedit super locum, non permittat ipsum claudi.	And if you do not put lead on, it is possible that the urine which comes out over the place should not cause it to be closed.
Ille autem cuius foramen est strictum, medicatur cum plumbo, sicut diximus, diebus multis, donec amplificetur.	But the one of whose opening is narrow, is treated with lead, as we have said, for many days, until it widens.
Illi autem in quibus est foramen in non suo loco, laeduntur.	But those in whom the opening is not in its place are injured.
Quod est, quia ex eis qui nascitur, foramen est apud finem capitis uirgae: quare non potest mingere ad anteriora, donec eleuat uirgam manu sua ad superiora.	Which is, because from those who are born, the opening is at the end of the penis: so that he cannot urinate standing up, until he raises his penis with his hand towards the sky.
Neque est ei generatio, propterea, quod sperma non potest peruenire ad matricem secundum rectitudinem: et est aegritudo foeda ualde.	And there is no generation for him, therefore his semen cannot come to the mother according to its straightness: and it is a foul disease.
Et modus operationis in illo est, ut resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum.	And the mode of operation in that is, so that the sick one lies on his back.
Deinde extende caput uirgae eius manu tua sinistra extensione uehementi, et incide caput capitis uirgae ex loco priapi, cum acumine, aut spatumili acuto: sicut est incisio calami, aut sicut tu radis aliquid, ut medium eius ueniat simile capiti uirgae: et ut cadat foramen in medio secundum quod oportet.	Then extend the penis of the sick one with your left hand by a long, powerful movement, and cut the head of the penis from the place that is suitable, with an edge, or with a sharp needle: just as you cut the string, or like you cut some grass, so that the middle part comes out like the head of the penis, and let the opening fall in the middle, according to what should be.
Et caue tibi apud operationem tuam a fluxu sanguinis.	And have care with you during your operation from the flow of blood.
Multotiens enim accidit illud.	And it happened many times.
Oppone ergo ei cum eo quod abscindit sanguinem, et cura uulnus, donec sanetur.	So when he came back with me and cut off the blood, and healed the wound, until it was cured.
¶ De Albather quae accidunt in praeputio et capite uigae, et corruptione, nigredine, et adhaerentia.	Regarding what happens in the foreskin and head of the penis, and corruption, blackness, and adhering substance.
Caput LVI.	The head.
Multotiens accidunt istae Albather in uirga, et est eminentia carnis foedae.	And these albاثers happen in the penis, and there is an eminence of flesh that is foul-smelling.
Et ex ea alia est maligna, et alia non maligna.	And from it another is malicious, and another is not malicious.
Non malignam ergo oportet ut suspendas cum uncino subtili, et abscindas eam, donec mundes eam totam.	So do not hang the non-malicious one with a fine hook, and cut it off, until you have completely washed it.
Deinde pone super eam cotum submersum in unguento aegyptio.	Then put on top of it a basket immersed in Egyptian ointment.
Deinde cura ipsum post illud cum unguento dyafinicon, donec sanetur.	Then care for the person after that with dyacinon ointment, until he is cured.
Quod si Albather est maligna, foedi coloris, tunc oportet ut administres in ea cauterium post incisionem eius et ipsius rasionem.	If the albather is malicious and of foul color, then you should administer a cauterization after its incision and shaving it.
Si autem Albather est in praeputio captiui, non circumcisi, et est pars Albather inter praeputium, et pars eius extra: tunc oportet ut auferas Albather, quae est intus in primis, donec quando consolidatur, tunc cura ipsum exterius: quoniam quando tu curas eam simul, non securatur praeputium quin preforetur.	But if the albather is caught in the foreskin, not circumcised, and part of the albather is within the foreskin, and part outside: then you should remove the albather that is within first, until it has grown solid, then care for him from outside: because when you care for it at the same time, the foreskin does not heal securely, since it will be pierced.
Et iam accidunt etiam in testiculis, et praeputio nigredo et corruptio.	And these also happen in the testicles, and blackness and corruption in the foreskin.
Oportet ergo, ut tu concaues totum quod iam denigratum est, et quod uult corrumpi, aut iam corruptum est.	So you should gather together all that has already been degraded, and what seeks to corrupt, or has already been corrupted.
Deinde line super ipsum post illud cum melle quod iam concussum est cum farina corticum granatorum, et herbi tritorum cribellatorum.	Then put a strip of cloth over it after that with honey that has already been crushed with flour of crushed grains, and dried herb of three grains.
Deinde cura illud cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then care for that with the remaining cure, until he is cured.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis, tunc administra cauterium cum cauterio lunari, secundum hanc formam.	But if blood flow occurs, then administer a cauterization with lunar cautery, according to this form.
Cauterium enim est iuuatiuum ad duas dispositiones simul, scilicet ad fluxum sanguinis, et uulnus quando corrumpitur.	For the cautery is in two respects at the same time, namely toward the blood flow, and toward the corruption of the wound.
Quod si corroditur caput uirgae, et destruitur totum in hora: tunc oportet ut intromittas in meatum priapi cannulam ex plumbo, ut mingat infirmus super eam.	If the head of the womb is corroded and it is destroyed altogether in an hour: then you should introduce a pipette made of tin into my meatus, so that the ill person can pee on it.
In adhaerentia uero praeputii cum capite uirgae, et haec quidem adhaerentia non accidit, nisi in eo cuius praeputium est sanum, et non exigitur super ipsum circumcisio: et quandoque accidit adhaerentia propter uulnus, aut apostema: oportet ergo ut excories eam cum Spatumili obtuso, donec soluatur ligamentum, et liberetur caput uirgae ab omni parte.	But in reality the prepuce adheres to the head of the womb, and this adhesion does not occur unless the prepuce is healthy, and circumcision is not required on it; and when this adhesion occurs because of a strain or a swelling, then you should cut it off with a dull spatula until it dissolves the ligaments and frees the head of the womb from all parts.
Quod si est difficile discernere ea exquisite, tunc oportet ut excories aliquid ex capite uirgae, et ex praeputio.	If you have difficulty distinguishing this closely, then you should cut off some part from the head of the womb and from the prepuce.
Quod est, quia praeputium quando est subtile, fortasse perforatur propter subtilitatem suam uelociter.	Because the prepuce is thin, it may pierce itself quickly because of its thinness.
Deinde separa inter praeputium, et caput uirgae cum panno lini subtili, qui iam madefactus est in aqua frigida, ut non adhereant iterum.	Then separate the prepuce and wash the head of the womb with a soft linen cloth that has already been soaked in cold water so that it does not adhere again.
Deinde curetur cum uino stiptico, donec consolidetur.	Then treat it with wine or vinegar until it heals over.
¶ De mundificatione infantium, et curatione ex errore eis accidente.	On the purification of infants and on the treatment of them after birth trauma.
Caput LVII.	Chapter LVII.
Circumcisio non est solutio continuitatis, sicut reliqua uulnera: uerumtamen cum sit ex operatione nostra, uoluntate nostra, et usus eius sit in pueris proprie, est necesse ut signemus in ea operationem meliorem, et uiam leuiorem perducentem ad salutem.	Circumcision is not a cure for continence, as are other wounds; but since it is an operation carried out at our pleasure and used only in boys, we must mark this operation as superior and more beneficial to the boy, leading to health.
Dico ergo, quod antiqui non dixerunt circumcisionem in aliquo suorum librorum: quoniam non utuntur in legibus suis, et non est nisi quod acquisiuimus per experimentum.	I say, that the ancient did not write about circumcision in any of their books: because they do not use it in their laws and it is only what we have acquired by experimentation.
Quod est, quia ego inueni maiorem partem artificum, et phlebotomatorum uti mundificatione, circumcidendo cum nouacula, et cum forficibus: et utuntur alfecati, et ligaudo cum filo, et incisione cum ungula.	Because I have discovered most of the arts, including bloodletting, blistering, and cutting with blades; and they use leeches and threading, and incise with nails.
Et ego quidem iam probaui omnes istos modos, et non inueni meliorem mundificatione cum forficibus, et ligamento cum filo.	And I myself have already tested all these methods, and I did not find anything better for purification than cutting with blades and sewing with thread.
Quoniam in mundificatione cum nouacula, multotiens effugit cutis.	For when washing with water, the skin often escapes quickly.
Quoniam cutis praeputii duas habet tunicas: ergo forsitan inciditur cutis superior, et temanet tunica inferior: cogitur ergo ad incisionem ad incidendum alteram, et dolorem futurum.	For the skin of the prepuce has two layers; so perhaps the upper layer may peel away, and the lower one may stick to it; so it is necessary to make an incision in order to cut the other, and to expect pain.
Et cum mundificatione quae fit per alfecati, id est, digitalis, quo utuntur sutores, non securatur incisio extremitatis uirilis membri: quoniam fortasse ingreditur in foramen eius.	And when cleaning is done with the hand, that is to say, with the finger, by those who use sutures, the incision at the end of the male member does not secure; because perhaps it enters into a hole.
In mundificatione autem cum ungula, fortasse euadit ferrum, et corrumpit operationem tuam: et cutis quidem pueri est breuis natura, et multotiens nascuntur taliter, quod non indigent mundificatione: et iam uidi illud.	But when washing with a nail, perhaps it will rub the iron and spoil your work; and indeed the skin of a boy is naturally short, and often grows in such a way that it does not need washing: I have seen this.
Mundificationis autem cum forficibus, et ligamento cum filo, bonum experimentum detexit mihi: quoniam forfices sunt proportionalis incisionis: propterea, quod acuitas quae est superius, est sicut acuitas quae est inferius.	But with tweezers and thread for binding, I have found by experience that this is good: because the tweezers are of a proportion to the incision; so that the sharpness which is above is like the sharpness which is below.
Cum ergo premis manum tuam, proportionantur duae acuitates, et incidunt secundum operationem unam in tempore uno: et fit compressio simili figura, continens cutem uirgae ab omni parte, cum qua non cadit error omnino.	But when you press your hand with tweezers, the two sharpnesses are proportionate and act in one direction at a time; and there results a compression of a similar figure, holding the skin of the penis from all sides, so that there is no mistake at all.
Et modus operationis propriae est, ut facias extimare, puerum praecipue, si est ex eis qui intelligunt parumper, quod tu non facis, nisi quod ligas filum in uirga sua tantum: et dimittas ipsum usque ad diem alium.	And the method of operation is its own, so that you can roughly estimate, especially if he is one of those who understand a little, that you do not bind the thread in the penis unless it is in his own hand: and you leave him until another day.
Deinde fac eum gaudere et laetari omnimodo quo possibile est tibi illud, ex eo quod recipit intelligentia sua.	Then let him enjoy himself and be glad in all ways as much as possible for you; since he receives his understanding.
Deinde fac eum stare inter manus tuas praeparatae staturae, et non sit sedens: et occulta forfices in manica tua, aut sub pede tuo, ne uideat eos puer omnino, neque aliquid ex instrumentis.	Then let him stand between your hands which are prepared to hold him, and not sitting; and hide the tweezers in your sleeve, or under your foot, so that he sees them not at all, nor any of the tools.
Deinde intromitte manum tuam ad uirgam eius, et suffla in cutem, et trahe eam sursum, donec egrediatur caput uirgae.	Then insert your hand into his penis, and blow on the skin, and pull it up until the head of the penis comes out.
Deinde mundifica ipsam ex eo quod aggregatur in ea sordicie.	Then wash it with water from the dirt that is collected in it.
Deinde liga locum signatum cum filo duplo.	Then tie the spot marked with double thread.
Postea liga inferius eo parumper ligamentum secundum.	Then tie the lower part with a little more than one knot of the second ligature.
Deinde tene cum indice tuo, et pollice locum ligamenti inferioris retentione bona, et incide inter duo ligamenta.	Then hold it with your index finger and thumb at the place of the lower ligature held in good position, and cut between the two ligatures.
Deinde eleua cutem sursum uelociter, et extrahe caput uirgae.	Then wipe the cut quickly with oil, and pull out the head of the awl.
Deinde dimitte sanguinem currere paulatim (est enim melius) et pone puluerem desuper: et super puluerem pannum in quo expansus est uitellus oui decocti in aqua rosata, concussum cum oleo ros recenti bono: et dimitte eum super ipsum usque ad diem alium: et cura ipsum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then let the blood run slowly (for it is better) and put the powder from above; and on the powder spread a cloth in which the awl that has been heated in boiling water with recent good oil is wrapped: and let it rest on the wound to another day: and take care of the rest of the wound with cure, until it heals.
Forma autem forficis ad mundificationem haec est.	The shape of the awl for cleaning is this.
Sint hebetes duae extremitates, et sint incidentes: ne egrediatur in eis ramus claui: et sit longitudo duarum acuitatum, sicut longitudo duorum manubriorum aequaliter.	There are two ends of it, and they are joined together: let not a knothole come into it; and make the length of the two points equal to the length of the two arms evenly.
Error uero cadens in mundificatione est: quoniam fortasse effugit cutis intrinseca tota, aut pars eius apud incisionem.	But a fall in cleaning is an error: for perhaps it omits the whole inner skin, or a part of it at the incision.
Ergo oportet, ut extendas eam ex hora tua cum ungue tuo ante apostemationem loci: et incidas eam secundum aequalitatem.	Therefore you should spread it out from your hour with your finger before examining the place: and cut it according to equality.
Quod si non potes tenere eam cum ungue tuo, tunc extrahe eam cum uncino, et incide eam.	If you cannot hold it with your finger, then remove it with an awl, and cut it.
Si autem praeterierint ei tres dies, et remanet quod est sub uirga inflatum, apostematum: tunc dimitte illud, donec sedetur apostema calidum, et excoria illud cum facilitate, et incide illud secundum quod praeparatur tibi: et caue tibi a capite uirgae.	But if it has passed three days and what is under the swelling remains soft, examined: then let it go, until the swelling cools down, and the scar gets well, and cut it according to how you prepare it for yourself: and keep away from the head of the awl.
Non enim nocebit ei illud.	For that will not harm him.
Cura ergo illud cum eo quod consolidat uulnus ex pulueribus, quos narrauimus in tractatu de pulueribus: et si inciditur ex cute supra mensuram, et euadit ad superiora, non nocet ei illud etiam.	Take care for this when the callus is hard from powders, which we have described in the book on powders: and if it cuts through the skin above the line, and goes up to the top, that does not hurt him either.
Cura ergo illud cum eo quod diximus, donec sanetur.	So treat this case as we have said, until it is healed.
¶ De extractione Vrinae retentae in uesica.	On the extraction of a retained verrugae from a urethra.
Caput LVIII.	Head LVIII.
Urinae retentio in uesica, fit ab opilatione facta ex lapide, aut sanguine congelato, aut pus, aut carne nata, et similibus illis ex eis quae diximus ex modis curationis in diuisione.	Retentive urinary tract in the urethra, is caused by an operation performed with a stone, or frozen blood, or pus, or meat born, and similar things from those that we have said on the mode of cure in division.
Et si non soluitur Vrina, et uides retentionem eius esse propter Lapidem, qui iam est in collo uesicae: tunc oportet ut sit infirmus super genua sua curuatus.	And if the verrucae does not heal, and you see that the retention is due to a stone, which is now in the neck of the urethra; then it is necessary that he be healed lying on his knees.
Deinde componantur pedes eius super dorsum eius, et extendat uentrem suum ex superiori parte dorsi eius, et stringat infirmus anhelitum suum quantum possibile est ei.	Then put his feet together on his back, and extend his belly from the upper part of his back, and the sick one shall strangle his desire as much as possible.
Cogitur ergo cum collo uesicae ad expulsionem Lapidis ad posteriora: quare absoluitur Vrina.	Then it is considered with the neck of the urethra to the expulsion of a stone towards the back: so the verrucae is cured.
Quod si non soluitur cum eo quod diximus, et uehemens sit res super infirmum: tunc oportet ut administres extractionem eius cum instrumento, quod nominatur siringa, cuius haec est forma Sit ex argento, et sit subtile, lene, concauum sicut cannula pennae auis in subtilitate radii, longum in similitudine palmi unius et medii: cui sit cannula subtilis in capite eius.	If it is not healed with that which we have said, and the issue is pressing on the sick person; then you shall administer the extraction of it with an instrument, which is called a syringe, whose this is the form It is made of silver, and is subtle, smooth, sharp like the feather of a bird in subtlety of its radius, long in the similarity of the palm of one hand and the middle: to which sits a thin cannula in its head.
Et modus exitus Vrinae per ipsum est, ut accipias filum duplicatum, et liges in extremitate eius lanam, aut cotum, ligatura bona: et intromittas extremitatem fili in inferiori parte Siringae: et incide cum forficibus si superfluit aliquid ex lana, uerum intromitte in cannulam cum uehementia, sicut alzer.	And the mode of exit of the verrucae through it is, as you take a double thread, and ties on its end with wool, or cotton, good knot: and introduce the end of the thread into the lower part of the syringe: and cut with scissors if there is anything that comes out of wool; but really introduce in the cannula with vehemence, as it were an alzer.
Deinde inunge siringam cum oleo, aut cum butyro, et albugine oui: et fac sedere infirmum super sedem, et embroca uesicam, et ipsius uirgam cum oleis humidis, et oleo oliuae, et aqua tepida.	Then dip the syringe in oil, or in butter, and in alum; and let the sick person sit on a seat, and embrocate the urethra, and his penis with wet oils, and olive oil, and warm water.
Deinde intromitte siringam in uirgam cum facilitate, donec perueniat ad radicem uirgae.	Then introduce the syringe into the penis with ease, until it reaches the root of the penis.
Deinde dupla ipsam superius a parte umbilici.	Then double it above the navel part.
Deinde impelle siringam intra ipsam, donec perueniat ad Vesicam, et sentiat eam infirmus iam peruenisse ad rem uacuam: et non fit hoc secundum hunc ordinem, nisi quoniam meatus, in quo uadit, est in quo est tortuositas.	Then push the syringe inside itself until it reaches the bladder, and feel that it has already reached the end with a weak pressure; and do not do this according to this order unless the urethra, in which you insert it, is in the place where there is a bend.
Deinde extende filum cum lana paulatim.	Then extend the thread with wool slowly.
Vrina enim sequetur lanam.	For the thread follows the wool.
Deinde extrahe eam, et fac currere Vrinam per uiam urinae: et itera siringam, et non cesses facere illud, donec euacuetur uesica, et inueniat infirmus alleuiationem.	Then pull it out and let the urine run through the urethra channel; and again introduce the syringe, and do not cease doing this until the bladder is empty, and feel a relief.
¶ De qualitate clisterizationis uesicae cum Clepshydra.	On the quality of cleansing the bladder with a clepsydra.
Caput LIX.	Chapter LIX.
Quando accidit in uesica ulcus, aut sanguis in ea congelatur, aut coartatur in ea pus, et uis distillare in eam aquas et medicinas: tunc fiat cum instrumento quod nominatur Clepshydra, et haec est forma eius.	When a sore happens in the bladder, or blood freezes up in it, or pus is confined in it, and water distills into it and medicines: then do with the instrument which is called a clepsydra, and this is its shape.
Est enim surda, id est, clausa.	For it is closed, that is to say, shut.
Et in eo sunt tria foramina, duo ex parte una, et unum ex parte altera, sicut uides.	And in it are three openings, two on one side and one on the other side, like you see them.
Et locus concauus, in quo est illud quod impellit, sit secundum quantitatem quod opilet ipsum sine additione, donec quando trahitur cum eo aliquid, ex humiditatibus attrahatur: et quando impellitur, cum eo expellatur ad longinquum: secundum quod facit clepshydra, qua proiicitur naphta, id est, ignis graecus in praeliis martis.	And the cavity where the plunger is placed is second to the quantity that it obtains without addition, until when it is pulled out with it something is drawn out from the moistures: and when it is pushed in, it expels it far away: as does the clepsydra, which throws out naphtha, that is to say, Greek fire in battles.
Cum ergo uis proiicere humiditates in uesicam, intromitte extremitatem clepshydrae in humiditatem, et trahe cum eo quod impellit ad superiora, humiditas enim trahitur in concauitatem clepshydrae.	So when you pour water into the bladder, introduce the end of the clepsydra into the water, and pull out with it what pushes it up; for the water is drawn out into the cavity of the clepsydra.
Deinde intromitte extremitatem eius in uirgam, secundum quod narrauimus in siringa.	Then introduce the end of it into the penis, as we described in the syringe.
Deinde impelle humiditatem cum eo quod impellit illa namque humiditas peruenit ad uesicam statim, ita quod sentit eam infirmus.	Then push moisture with him because he pushes that moisture because moisture reaches dry skin immediately so that the sick one feels it.
Forma clisteris subtilis quo clisterizatur uesica.	Form a thin clot so that the wound is coated.
Fiat ex argento, aut auricalco: cuius caput altius sit simile alcama paruo, et sub eo sinus inter quem cadat ligamentum.	Let it be made of silver, or copper-alloy; whose head is higher like a collar with little, and under it a bag between which a ligament is laid.
Deinde accipe uesicam arietis, et pone in ea humiditatem, qua uis clisterizare uesicam.	Then take the wool from a sheep, and put moisture on it, which you will use to coat the wound.
Deinde liga eam inter duos sinus ligatura forti cum filo duplo: et calefac illam humiditatem parumper super ignem.	Then tie it between two bags with a strong knot and double thread: and heat it slightly with moisture over fire.
Deinde intromitte extremitatem clisteris in uirgam, postea stringe manum tuam super uesicam cum humiditate strictura decenti, donec sentiat infirmus, quod illa humiditas iam peruenit ad uesicam.	Then insert the end of the clot into the penis, and then tighten your hand over the wound with the moisture with a tight hold until the sick one feels that moisture has already reached the skin.
Si autem non est tibi praesens uesica, tunc accipe frustum pergameni, et fac ex eo circulum, et perfora ipsum ab omni rotunditate sua.	But if you do not have a present wound, then take a piece of parchment, and make it into a circle, and pierce it from all its roundness.
Deinde intromitte filum forte in illis foraminibus, sicut reuoluuntur.	Then insert a strong thread into those holes, like threads unravelling.
Deinde aggrega circulum, sicut aggregatur alsofratu: postquam tu ponis in eo illud quod uis ex humiditatibus, et oleis, et aquis.	Then gather the circle together, as you would a ribbon: once you have put in what you want from moisture, oils, and water.
Deinde liga ipsum in instrumento: et fac cum eo sicut fecisti cum uesica ex expressione cum manu tua, donec perueniat humiditas ad uesicam.	Then tie it to the instrument: and do with it as you did with the wound from expression with your hand, until moisture reaches the skin.
¶ De extractione Lapidis.	The extraction of a stone.
Caput LX.	Head LXX.
Iam diximus in diuisione species Lapidis, et curationem eius cum medicinis: et dixi differentiam inter Lapidem generatum in renibus, et uesica, et signa illius totius: et dixi Lapidem in quo cadit operatio cum manu et sectio: et est Lapis generatus in uesica proprie: et ille qui figitur in uirga: et ego sum narrans illud cum expositione manifesta et abbreuiatione.	We have already spoken at length on the classification of stones, and their treatment with medicines: and I have distinguished between a stone that is generated in the kidneys, and a wound, and the signs of both: and I have described a stone that is generated in the skin properly: and that which is figured on the branch: and I am narrating that with manifest illustration and abbreviation.
Dico ergo, quod Lapis generatus in uesica, plurimum accidit pueris.	I therefore say, that a stone generated in the skin happens mostly to boys.
Et ex signis eius est, quod urina egreditur ex uesica similis aquae in subtilitate sua: et apparet in ea harena alba, et fricat infirmus uirgam suam, et laborat cum ea, et multotiens pendet.	And from its signs it is that urine issues from the penis, similar to water in subtlety; and in it appears white sand; and it rubs the weak man's penis; and he works with it, and often hangs it.
Deinde erigitur, et egreditur cum eo anus in multis eorum.	And then it is erected, and issues from it the anus with many of them.
Et est facilis sanatio puerorum, ex eo usquequo consequuntur quatuordecim annos.	And the cure of boys is easy from him until they reach the age of twelve years.
Et est difficilis in senibus.	And it is difficult in the elderly.
In iuuenibus autem est media, in eo quod est inter illud: et eius cuius Lapis est maior, curatio facilior: et si paruus, est econuerso illius cura.	But in young men it is medium, because it is between that: and if the stone of him is larger, the cure is easier; and if it is small, it is turned away from that cure.
Cum ergo peruenimus ad curationem, oportet in primis, ut mundificemus infirmum cum clisteri, quod extrahat totum stercus quod est in intestinis suis: ipsum enim quandoque prohibet inuentionem Lapidis apud inquisitionem.	But when we come to the cure, it is necessary that we first clean up the sick man with a clister, which should bring out all the dung that is in his intestines: for he sometimes prevents the discovery of the stone during investigation.
Deinde accipiatur infirmus cum pedibus suis, et concutiatur, et moueatur ad inferiora: ut descendat Lapis ad profundum uesicae, aut saliat de loco alto aliquotiens.	Then the sick man should be taken with his feet, and shaken, and moved to the lower parts: that the stone may descend into the depths of the bladder, or sometimes come out from its high place.
Deinde fac eum sedere inter manus tuas praeparatum, et manus eius sint sub coxis ipsius, ut fiat uesica tota decliuis ad inferiora.	Then make him sit between your hands prepared, and his hands should be under his buttocks, so that the bladder should all fall into the lower parts.
Deinde perquire eum, et tange eum extrinsecus.	Then question him, and touch him from outside.
Si ergo sentis Lapidem in spacio, tunc propera statim cum sectione super ipsum.	If then you feel the stone in a space, then immediately approach it with the section over his body.
Quod si non cadat sub tactu tuo omnino, tunc oportet ut abstergas digitum indicem cum oleo manus sinistrae, si infirmus est puer: aut digitum medium si est iuuenis completus: et intromittas ipsum in anum suum, et perquire de Lapide, donec stat sub digito tuo: et conuerte eum paulatim ad collum uesicae.	If it does not fall under your hand at all, then you should wipe the index finger with the oil of your left hand, if the sick man is a boy: or the middle finger if he is a complete youth: and push him into some part of his anus, and question about the stone until it stands under your finger: and turn him slowly towards the throat of the bladder.
Deinde preme super ipsum cum digito tuo, et impelle ipsum ad exteriora aduersus locus, cuius sectionem uis: et praecipe ministro, ut premat uesicam manu sua, et praecipe alii ministro, ut extendat testiculos manu sua dextra ad superiora: et alia manu sua, ut remoueat cutem, quae est sub testiculis in parte a loco in quo est sectio.	Then press with your finger on him, and push him towards the external parts against the place that you mean: and order a minister to touch the bladder by hand, and order another minister to extend his testicles by hand from the right side to the upper part: and with another hand, he should remove the skin, which is under the testicles in the part where the section is.
Deinde intromitte Spatumile incidens, cuius forma haec est.	Then insert the Spatulum incident, whose form this is.
Et finde in eo quod est inter anum et testiculos, et non in medio, ad latus natis sinistrae: et sit sectio super ipsum lapidem, et digitus tuus sit in ano: et fiat sectio transuersa, ut sit sectio exterius ampla, et interius stricta, secundum quantitatem quod sit possibile egressio Lapidis ex ea non maior.	And find in it what is between an and the testicles, and not in the middle, on the left side of birth: and let the incision be on top of it, and your finger is in the anus: and let the incision be transverse, so that the outside incision is wide and the inside incision is tight, according to the quantity that it is possible for the stone to come out of it not larger.
Fortasse enim comprimit digitus, qui est in ano Lapidem apud sectionem, et egreditur absque difficultate.	Perhaps, because the finger which is in the anus comprimes the stone at the incision, and goes out without difficulty.
Et scias, quod ex Lapide est cui sunt anguli et margines, quare fit difficilis exitus eius propter illud.	And you know that from the stone there are angles and margins, why it is difficult to come out of him because of that.
Et ex eo est lenis, similis glandulae, et rotundus: et fit facilis egressus eius.	And from it is soft, like a gland, and round: and the exit of it is easy.
Ei ergo cui sunt anguli, et margines, adde in fissura.	So then, to those who have angles and margins, add a crack.
Quod si non egreditur ita, tunc oportet ut ingenies super ipsum: aut stringas super eum cum gesti decenter, cuius extremitas sit sicut Luna, quae stringat super Lapidem, et non euadat ab ea: aut ut intromittas sub eo instrumentum subtile, curuatae extremitatis.	That if it does not go out like this, then you must try to turn on top: or tighten it with a very awkward gesture, the end of which is like the Moon, which tightens over the stone, and does not come off from it: or as you insert under it a thin instrument, curved at one end.
Si autem non potes super cum, tunc amplifica foramen parumper.	If, however, you cannot with this, then widen the hole slightly.
Quod si uincit te aliquid ex sanguine, abscinde ipsum cum zegi.	That if something makes you bleed, cut it off with a scalpel.
Si uero lapis est plus quam unus, tunc impelle in primis magnum ad os uesicae.	If, however, the stone is more than one, then push into the first large hole at the tip.
Deinde incide super ipsum.	Then incision on top of the stone.
Postea impelle paruum post illud: et similiter fac si sunt plures duobus.	Then push in a little behind it: and do the same if there are two or more.
Quod si magnus est ualde, tunc ignorantia est ut seces super ipsum sectione magna.	That if it is very large, then ignorance is how to turn off on top of the stone with a wide incision.
Quoniam accidit infirmo una duarum rerum, aut ut moriatur, aut accidit ei distillatio urinae assidua: proptera, quia non consolidatur locus omnino.	Since it has happened to someone who has two of these things, or that he dies, or that there is frequent urine distillation: soon, because the place does not consolidate at all.
Verum administra expulsionem eius, donec egrediatur: aut ingenia in fractura eius cum forficibus, donec extrahas eum frustatim.	But administer the expulsion of it until it comes out: or devices in breaking it with forceps until you pull it out quickly.
Cum ergo compleueris operationem tuam, tunc imple uulnus thure, et aloe, et sanguine draconis: et stringe ipsum, et pone super ipsum pannum infusum oleo et uino, aut oleo rosato, et aqua frigida: ut sedetur apostema calidum.	When you have thus completed your operation, then fill the wound with thistle, and aloe, and dragon's blood: and bind it on, and place over it a cloth dipped in oil and wine, or in oil of rose, and cold water: that an ablation may be induced by heat.
Deinde resupina infirmum super collum suum, et non soluas ligamentum, usque ad diem tertium.	Then support the neck of the patient on your knees, and do not untie the bindings until the third day.
Cum ergo solueris ipsum, embroca locum cum aqua, et oleo multo.	When you have loosed him, wet the place with much oil and water.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento dyafinicon, et unguento basilicon, donec sanetur.	Then care for the patient with the ointment of daphno, and the ointment of basil, until he is healed.
Si autem accidit in uulnere apostema calidum additum, et corrosi, et illi similia: sicut si congeletur sanguis in uesica, et prohibeatur ex eo urina: et cognoscitur illud ex egressione sanguinis cum urina.	But if, in the wound, the hot ablation is added and it corrodes, and there are similar symptoms: let it be known from the exit of blood with urine, and know that it is because the blood is corroded with urine.
Intromitte ergo digitum tuum in uulnus, et extrahe illum sanguinem.	Then insert your finger into the wound and draw out the blood.
Nam si remanet, prouocat ad corruptionem uesicae, et putrefactionem eius.	For if it remains, it incites to the corruption of the urethra and the decay of its parts.
Deinde ablue uulnus cum aceto, et aqua, et sale: et oppone omni speciei cum eo quod conuenit ex curatione, usquequo sanetur.	Then wash the wound with vinegar, water, and salt: and oppose all manner of things that are proper to the cure, until he is healed.
Et oportet in horis curationis totius, ut liges duas coxas, et aggreges, caussa medicinarum quae ponuntur super locum.	And it is fitting during the whole course of the cure, that the two hips be bound, and that poultices be placed on the place, because medicines laid on the place are added.
Quod si lapis est paruus, et sit in meatu uirgae, et figitur in eo, et prohibetur urinae exitus: tunc cura ipsum cum eo quod narro antequam peruenias ad sectionem.	If the stone is loose and lies in the meatus of the urethra, and it gets stuck there, and prevents the passage of urine: then care for the patient with it as you go before you make an incision.
Multotiens enim a sectione excusaris per hanc curationem, iam enim probaui illud.	For many times have I been prevented from the section by this cure, since I have tested it.
Et est, ut accipias Perforatorium ex ferro alferico, cuius haec est forma, triangulatae extremitatis, acutum, fixum in ligno.	And is, that you take the Iron Piercer, which has this form, a triangular end, sharp, fixed in wood.
Deinde accipe filum, et liga cum eo uirgam sub lapide ut non redeat ad uesicam.	Then take a thread, and tie it with the urethra under the stone so that it does not return to the urethra.
Deinde intromitte ferrum perforans in uirgam cum facilitate, donec perueniat Perforatorium ad ipsum lapidem: et reuolue Perforatorium manu tua in ipso lapide paulatim: et coneris perforationem eius, donec facias ipsum penetrare a parte altera.	Then introduce the piercing iron into the penis with ease, until it reaches the stone: and remove the piercing iron from your hand little by little on that stone: and feel the piercings, until you make him penetrate from the other part.
Urina namque absoluitur statim.	Then urinate immediately.
Deinde preme manum tuam super illud quod remansit ex lapide ab exteriori parte uirgae.	Then press your hand on that which remains of the stone from the outside part of the penis.
Ipse enim frangitur, et egreditur cum urina, et sanatur infirmus.	For it is itself broken, and discharged with urine, and heals the sick.
Si autem non praeparatur tibi haec curatio, propter aliquid quod prohibet ab illo: tunc liga filum sub lapide, et filum aliud supra lapidem.	But if this cure is not prepared for you because of something that prevents it from him: then tie a string under the stone, and another string above the stone.
Deinde seca super lapidem in ipsa uirga inter duas ligaturas.	Then dry up on the stone in the penis between the two ties.
Deinde extrahe ipsum.	Then remove it.
Postea solue ligamentum, et mundifica sanguinem congelatum, qui fit in uulnere.	Then loosen the tie, and clean away the frozen blood, which has formed in the wound.
Et non est necessarium ligamentum fili sub lapide, nisi ut non redeat ad uesicam: et ligamentum aliud desuper, nisi ut quando soluitur filum post egressionem lapidis, redeat cutis ad locum suum, et cooperiat uulnus: et propter illud necesse est tibi illud quando ligas filum superius, ut eleues cutem ad superiora, ut redeat apud complementum tuum, et cooperiat uulnus, sicut diximus.	And it is not necessary to tie the string under the stone, unless it should return to the wound: and a string from above, unless when the string is loosed after the stone has come out, it should return the skin to its place, and cover the wound: for that reason it is necessary for you to do this when you tie the upper string, in order that the skin may be raised to the top, so as to return at your complete expense, and cover the wound, as we have said.
¶ De extractione Lapidis mulierum.	As for the extraction of the stone from women's wombs:
Caput LXI.	Chapter LXI.
Parum generatur Lapis in mulieribus.	The stone does not form much in women.
Si autem accidat alicui earum lapis, tunc difficilis est curatio, et prohibetur propter modos multos.	But if the stone should happen to form in any of them, then the cure is difficult, and prevented by many things.
Vnus eorum est: quod mulier fortasse est uirgo.	One of them is: that a woman may perhaps be a virgin.
Et secundus est, quia tu non inuenis mulierem quae detegat seipsam medico, quando est casta, aut ex habentibus maritos.	And the second is this, because you do not visit a woman who has taken to herself a physician, when she is a virgin, or among those who have husbands.
Tertius est, quia tu non inuenis mulierem bene scientem hanc artem, praecipue operationem cum manu.	The third is this: you do not visit a woman who knows the art well, especially the operation with the hand.
Et quartus est longinquitas a loco lapidis: quare indiget sectione profunda, et in illo est timor.	And the fourth is distance from the stone: why does it require deep dissection, and there is fear in that.
Quod si necessitas prouocat ad illud, tunc oportet ut accipias mulierem medicam, bene scientem: et parum inuenitur.	Which if necessity compels to that, then you should take a female doctor who is well-versed in the matter: and it is found rarely.
Si uero priuaris ea, tunc quaere medicum castum, subtilem, et praesenta mulierem obstetricem bene doctam in re mulierum, aut mulierem quae in hac arte innuit partem artis: fac ergo eam praesentem, et praecipue ei, ut faciat totum quod praecipis ei ex inquisitione super lapidem.	But if indeed you desire her, then ask a married doctor who is subtle and well-versed in the matter of women: or a woman who is skilled in part of this art: so make her present, especially to him, that he may do all that you command him out of inquiry about the stone.
In primis quod est, ut aspiciat si mulier est uirgo: tunc oportet ut intromittat digitum in anum eius, et quaerat lapidem.	First of all, that she may examine if she is a virgin: then it should be that she puts her finger in some part of her, and asks about the stone.
Si ergo inuenit ipsum, coartet eum sub digito suo, et tunc praecipe obstetrici, ut intromittat digitum suum in uuluam infirmae, et inquirat super lapidem, postquam ponit manum suam sinistram super uesicam, et comprimit eam compressione bona.	But if he finds it, then she should put her finger on it, and then command the obstetrician to put his own finger in the vagina of the weak place, and ask about the stone, after he has put his left hand on the pubic bone, and squeezes it with a good grip.
Si ergo inuenit lapidem, tunc oportet ut gradatim moueat eum ab orificio uesicae ad inferiora cum summa uirtutis suae, donec perueniat cum eo ad radicem coxae.	But if he finds the stone, then it should be that he slowly moves it from the opening of the vagina to the lower part with all his strength, until he reaches it with it up to the root of the pelvis.
Deinde secet super eum apud oppositionem medietatis uuluae apud radicem coxae, ex quacunque parte praeparatur ei, et sentit lapidem in illa parte: et digitus eius non remoueatur a lapide, coartans sub eo: et sit sectio parua in primis.	Then he should cut over it at the middle of the vagina opening at the root of the pelvis, from whichever side it is prepared and feels the stone in that part; and his finger should not move away from the stone, holding it down: and first there should be a small incision.
Deinde intromittat radium super illam sectionem.	Then he should put his hand on top of that cut.
Si ergo sentit lapidem, tunc addat in sectionem secundum quantitatem proportionatam quod lapis egreditur ab ea.	But if he feels the stone, then he should add to the incision a quantity in proportion to how much the stone moves from it.
Et scias, quod species lapidis sunt multae.	And you know that there are many kinds of stones.
Ex his enim est paruus, et magnus, lenis et asper, longus, et rotundus habens ramos.	For these are small and large, smooth and sharp, long and round, having branches.
Scias ergo species eius, ut significetur tibi per hoc super illud quod uis.	Know therefore his kind, that it may be shown to you through this that you see.
Si ergo uincit te sanguis, tunc adde in loco zegi tritum, et tene ipsum hora una, donec abscindatur sanguis.	If then the blood annoys you, then put in that place three bandages, and hold it for an hour, until the blood is cut off.
Deinde redi ad operationem tuam, donec egrediatur lapis: et fac, ut praepares tecum ex instrumentis, quae dixi in extractione lapidis in uiris, ut adiuueris per ea in operatione tua.	Then return to your work until the stone is discharged: and do as you prepare yourself with the instruments which I said for extracting the stone from the urinary bladder that you may add them to your work in your operation.
Quod si uincit te fluxus sanguinis, et scis quod expulsio sanguinis est ex arteria quae incisa est: tunc pone puluerem super locum, et stringe eum cum puluillis strictura decenti: et non mutes illud: et dimitte lapidem, et non extrahas ipsum.	If then the blood annoys you, and you know that the outflow of blood is from the artery which has been cut: then put powder on the place, and squeeze it with a tight pressure as it comes down: and do not change that: and let go of the stone, and do not take it out.
Fortasse enim morietur mulier infirma.	For perhaps the woman will die, if she is weak.
Deinde cura uulnus.	Then take care of the wound.
Cum ergo sedatur acuitas sanguinis post dies, et putrefit locus, tune redi ad operationem tuam, donec egrediatur lapis.	When then the sharpness of the blood subsides after a few days and the place becomes putrid, then return to your work until the stone is discharged.
¶ De sectione suiper Herniam aquosam.	Regarding the section on cutting above the hernia with water.
Caput LXII.	Head LII.
Ramex aquosa non est, nisi aggregatio humiditatis in sifac albo, quod est sub cute testiculi continente ouum: et nominatur sifac.	The ramet with water is not, unless there is an aggregation of moisture on the scalp or in the skin of the scrotum, which is called siphacus.
Et quandoque est in panniculo proprio sibi, quem praeparauit ei natura in parte oui, donec putetur: quod est ouum aliud, et est cutis testiculi inter sifac album, quod diximus: et non fit illud nisi raro.	And when it is in its own proper place, which nature has prepared for it in the skin: that is another thing, and it is called the scrotum of white, which I said: and this is not done rarely.
Et generatio quidem huius ramicis, est ex debilitate quae accidit testiculis: quare effunditur ad eos haec materia.	And the generation of this ramet is from the weakness that happens to the testicles: why then does this substance flow into them.
Et quandoque accidit ex percussione super testiculos.	And when it has happened from a blow on the testicles.
Et haec humiditas est habens colores multos.	This moisture is having many colors.
Aut enim est color eius decliuis ad citrinitatem, aut est sanguineus rubeus, aut faeculentus, niger, aut est aquosus albus, et est illud quod est plus.	Or indeed the color of it is veiled towards yellow, or it is blood-red, or foul-smelling, black, or it is white-colored water, and that which is more is this:
Et signa quibus scitur ubi sit aggregatio aquae, sunt ista.	And the signs by which is known where the aggregation of water is, are these.
Nam si est in sifac albo quod diximus, tunc apostema est rotundum ad longitudinem parumper sicut figura oui: et non apparet testiculus, quoniam humiditas continet eum ab omni parte.	For if it is in the scrotum or what we have said, then the swelling is round in length about like the figure of a ball: and the testicle does not appear, because humidity contains it from all sides.
Et si est humiditas in panniculo proprio sibi, tunc apostema est rotundum cum parte oui, et propter hoc extimat homo quia est ouum aliud.	And if there is humidity in the skin itself, then the swelling is round with a part, and for this reason man estimates another because it is one different.
Et si humiditas est inter cutem testiculorum et sifac album, tunc cadit sub sensu.	And if the humidity is between the skin of the testicles and the white scrotum, then it falls down.
Quando ergo uis cognitionem coloris humiditatis, tunc experire colorem humiditatis in apostemate cum Intromisso quadrato, cuius forma praecessit.	Now when you want to know the color of the humidity, then experience the color of the humidity in the swelling with the square insertion, which shape preceded.
Secundum illud ergo quod egreditur in uestigio Intromissi, iudica de illo quod est inter ipsum.	According to this, therefore, when it moves into the space of the insertion, judge about it that it is between itself.
Cum ergo uenimus ad curationem cum ferro, tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmo, ut phlebotometur si possibile est ei illud, et uides corpus eius plenum.	When we have come to the cure with the iron, then it is necessary that you order the sick person, if possible, him to bleed, and you will see his body full of blood.
Deinde resupinetur super dorsum suum super rem altam parum, et pone sub eo pannos multos.	Then he should lie on his back on a high thing, and put many blankets under him.
Deinde sede tu super sinistram eius, et praecipe ministro, ut sedeat a dextra eius, qui extendat uirgam eius ad unum duorum laterum cutis testiculorum, et ad partem mirach uentris.	Then you should sit on his left side, and order the minister to sit on his right side, who will extend his penis toward one or two sides of the skin of the testicles, and toward the side of the testicle.
Deinde accipe spatumile latum, et seca cutem testiculorum ex medio per longitudinem, usque prope pectinem: et fiat sectio secundum rectitudinem aequedistantis lineae quae diuidit cutem testiculorum, donec perueniat ad sifac album comprehendens: et excoria ipsum et obserua, uel caue ex hoc, ut seces ipsum: et sit excoriatio tua qua ipsum excorias, ex parte quae suspenditur cum ouo plus: et subtiliter scrutare cum excoriatione secundum quantitatem quod tibi possibile est.	Then take a broad spatula, and dry the skin of the testicles from the middle in length, up to the chest: and let the section be according to the equidistant line that divides the skin of the testicles, until it reaches the white scrotum encompassing: and observe the wound itself or carefully take off from it, as you will, in order not to tear it: and examine cautiously with the wound according to the quantity that you can.
Deinde perfora sifac plenum aqua perforatione ampla, et extrahe totam aquam.	Then pierce the white scrotum full of water with a wide piercing of water, and drain out all the water.
Deinde separa inter duo labia sectionis cum uncinis, et extende sifac ad superiora, et non tangas cutem testiculorum comprehendentem: et incide sifac qualitercunque est possibile tibi incidere ipsum, aut cum totalitate sua, aut frustatim, praecipue latus eius subtile.	Then separate between the two lips of the incision with a hook and extend the knife to the top, and do not touch the skin that includes the testicles: and cut the knife in whatever way you can cut it yourself, or with its whole, or in a hasty manner, especially the side of it is subtle.
Nam si tu non exquisite perscrutaris, in incisione eius non fit securitas, quin aqua redeat.	For if you do not understand carefully, there is no security in this incision, but water is returned.
Si autem procedit ouum exterius a cute sua in hora operationis tuae: tunc quando compleueris sectionem sifac, reduc ipsum.	But if it goes out from its skin during your operation: then when you have completed the incision of the knife, reduce it.
Deinde aggrega duo labia cutis testiculorum cum sutura.	Then gather together the two lips of the skin of the testicles with a stitch.
Deinde cura ipsum sicut reliqua uulnera, donec sanetur.	Then take care of the flesh as with the rest of the wounds, until it heals.
Quod si inuenis ouum corruptum ex nigredine alia, tunc oportet ut liges uasa, quae sunt suspensorium, timens fluxum sanguinis.	What if there is a corruption of the flesh with other color, then you should tie up the clothes, which are called suspenders, fearing the flow of blood.
Deinde abscinde testiculum cum suspensorio, et extrahe ouum: postea cura illud cum eo quod diximus.	Then cut off the testicle with the suspender and remove the testicle: then take care of it as we have said.
Si uero aqua est aggregata in duabus partibus, tunc scias quia sunt duae ramices: seca ergo partem aliam secundum quod fecisti in altera aequaliter.	But if water is gathered on the two sides, then you should know that there are two branches: therefore dry one half according to what you have done in the other equal way.
Et si aequatur tibi, ut sit operatio una, tunc fac: deinde absterge sanguinem.	And if it is even with you, so that the operation is one, then do it: and then wash away the blood.
Et intromitte in sectiones lanam submersam in oleo, aut in oleo rosato: et pone deforis lanam aliam quam submersisti in uino et oleo, et expande eam super duos testiculos, et mirach uentris: et pone desuper pannos duplicatos, et sunt puluilli: et liga eos desuper cum ligamento, quod est habens sex secundum hanc formam.	And put in the incisions wool immersed in oil, or oiled; and place another wool that you have dipped in wine and oil on top of the two testicles, and stretch the testicles: and put on top of it double cloths, and they are thin: and tie them from above with a knot that has six strands according to this form.
Deinde sumantur duo panni, et suantur, et impleantur la na carminata, secundum hanc similitudinem: et fiant extremitates quibus premitur ex coto, aut lana humida: et aggregentur cum strictura in lumbari bracharum: et una extremitatum accipiat super anum usque ad dorsum, et secunda accipiat ad partem pectinis: et duae extremitates super duas coxas inferius, et duae extremitates aliae super duo inguina, et aggregetur strictura tota in lumbari bracharum.	Then the two cloths are taken, and they are stretched, and filled with red wool, according to this similarity: and their ends which are pressed from a string, or wet wool: and they are added with a knot in the lumbar arms: and one end takes on top of some until the back, and the second takes on to the side of the pelvis: and the two ends take on below the two hips, and the other end takes on above the two groin, and the whole knot is tightened in the lumbar arms.
Et, quandoque artificialiter medicatur haec ramex cum cauterio loco sectionis cum ferro: et est, ut accipias cauterium cultellare subtile, et seces cum eo cutem testiculorum: et est ignitum, secundum quod narrauimus: donec quando detegitur sifac album continens aquam: tunc accipe cauterium, secundum hanc formam.	And sometimes this wire is treated artificially with a cautery in the place of section with iron: and it is so, that you take the cautery knife and separate the skin of the testicles with it; and it is lit up, as we have said: until such time as it is discovered by the सफّة [white] consisting of water: then take the cautery, according to this form.
Assimilatur literae graecae.	It assimilates Greek letters.
Deinde perfora cum eo illud sifac, et est ignitum, donec egrediatur humiditas tota.	Then pierce it with that सफّة [white], and it is lit up, until all the moisture has gone out.
Deinde extende sifac cum uncinis, et excoria cum cauterio subtili ignito, et incide ipsum secundum quod possibile est tibi, donec eradices totum eius.	Then extend that सफّة  [white] with a hook, and scrape it with a lit cautery knife, and cut off all of it as well as you can: until you have completely cut it off.
Et caue ex ouo, ne tangat ipsum ignis.	And then cover the wound, so that it does not burn itself.
Et scias, quod haec operatio est saluior, et longinquior a fluxu sanguinis, et melior quam operatio cum sectione.	And you should know that this operation is more beneficial, and longer in effect against the flow of blood, and better than an operation by section.
Si uero contrarietatem tibi facit in hora sectionis, aut in hora cauterii apostema calidum, aut fluxus sanguinis, aut aliquid aliud: tunc oportet ut cures quod contrarietatem tibi facit ex illo cum curatione quae conuenit ei, secundum quod praemissum est.	If, however, it causes you an opposite effect in the hour of section, or in the hour of cauterization, a hot apostema, a flow of blood, or something else: then you should do what will correct that effect for you with the cure that is appropriate to it, according to the premise given above.
Si autem infirmus est timidus, et non expectat super hanc operationem, propter horribilitatem suam: tunc administra perforationem secundum quod ego narro illud: et est.	If, however, he is a shy man, and does not wait for this operation, because of its terrible appearance: then administer the piercing according to what I have told you above: and that is enough.
Quando certificatur tibi apud te per illud quod diximus de significationibus, quod ramex est aquosa: tunc oportet quod facias sedere infirmum super sedem eleuatam.	When it is certified to you by me through that which we have said about the meanings of the wire, that it is wet: then you should make the sick one sit on an elevated seat.
Deinde perfora apostema in inferiori parte sui cum spatumili lato: et pone perforationem secundum longitudinem corporis, et sit apertio ampla, donec currat aqua tota.	Then pierce the apostema in the lower part of his body with a sharp knife: and place the piercings according to the length of his body, and keep the openings wide, until all the water has run out.
Deinde pone super locum cotum, et liga ipsum, et dimitte ipsum ut currat residuum aquae: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur uulnus.	Then put a cloth over the place, and tie him up, and let him go so that he can run off with any remaining water: then take care of the wound, until it is healed.
Si autem contrarietas sit egressioni aquae in hora qua perforas ipsam: et non sit illud nisi propterea, quia panniculus albus contrarietatem facit in orificio uulneris, et prohibet exitum aquae: tunc oportet ut intromittas pennam in uulnus, aut instrumentum cum quo extrahitur aqua hydropicorum, cuius forma praecessit: aut adde in operatione uulneris parumper.	If, however, there is resistance to the flow of water at the time you make the hole: and it is only for that reason, because the white membrane resists at the wound's orifice and prevents the exit of the water; then you should insert a straw into the wound, or an instrument with which the water of hydropic wounds is withdrawn, whose shape precedes it: or add a little to the operation of the wound.
Et scias, quod aqua redit, et aggregatur post sex menses, aut circiter eos.	And know that the water returns and accumulates after six months or so.
Cum ergo aggregatur, tunc pertoretur secundum eundem modum, et pertransibit infirmus dies suos.	So when it is gathered together, then it turns back in the same way, and it spends its days in illness.
¶ De cura Ramicis carnosae.	Regarding the care of the ram's-horn plant.
Caput LXIII.	Chapter LIII.
Scias, quod in sectione super hanc Ramicem, est ex timore perducente ad perniciem in pluribus dispositionibus.	You should know that in this section on the ram's-horn plant, it is said that it is prone to causing harm in multiple ways.
Quapropter uidetur mihi eius dimissio saluari ex ea.	Therefore, I turn my attention to the remedy against its harm.
Et ego sum rememorans operationem in ea, et species apostematis.	And I remember the operation in it, and the appearance of blisters.
Dico ergo, quod accidunt apostemata multa in corporibus, ex quibus componuntur testiculi: et fit illud ex caussis multis, scilicet.	I say, that many blisters occur in the bodies, from which the testes are composed: and it is due to many causes, indeed.
Aut ex superfluitate acuta, uel acri, quae effunditur ad testiculos.	Or from acute sweating or bitterness, which oozes onto the testes.
Aut ex percussione.	Or from a blow.
Et est color apostematis secundum colorem corporis, et non inuenitur ei dolor: et est apostema graue.	And the color of the blister corresponds to the color of the body, and pain is not felt; and the blister is gray.
Et fortasse est apostema lapideum, cuius color est fuscus, et non est sensus ei.	And perhaps it is a stone-like blister, whose color is dark, and there is no feeling of it.
Et quandoque fit ex nodatione arteriarum, et inflatione earum: sicut iam praecessit eius rememoratio: aut ex inflatione uenarum.	And sometimes it is due to the swelling of arteries and the inflammation of veins: as it has already been remembered; or from the inflammation of foot-nerves.
Quod ergo est ex eis ex inflatione arteriarum, cognoscitur per dispositionem apostematis, quando comprimis ipsum digitis tuis.	So whatever is due to the swelling of arteries, it is known through the appearance of blisters when you squeeze your fingers together.
Et non oportet ut tangas ipsum prorsus.	And you should not touch him completely.
Illud uero quod fit ex inflatione uenarum, non dispergitur ex eo aliquid apud compressionem cum digitis.	But that which is due to the inflammation of foot-nerves does not dissipate anything when squeezed with the fingers.
Et iam possibile est, quod super hanc speciem fiat sectio, et super reliquas carnes: et est, ut seces cutem testiculorum.	It is also possible that this section be made on this shape and on the remaining flesh, and it is as if you separate the skin of the testicles.
Deinde extende ouum ad sursum, et extrahe ipsum cum sifach albo: et libera suspensorium ex uasis, et liga uasa: et incide suspensorium postquam tu liberas ipsum ab omni parte ex partibus oui.	Then extend your hand to the top, and pull it out with the scalp or: and free the suspenders from the water, and tie the bandage: and cut the suspender after you have freed it from all parts of it, when you.
Si ergo ouum consolidatum est cum illis carnibus natis, tunc oportet ut attrahas ouum, et incidas ipsum.	So if your consolidated hand is with those born muscles, then it must be that you attract the hand and cut it off.
Et si adhaerentia est inter aliquid ex siphaket, aut in eo quod est inter uasa: tunc oportet ut liberes totam illam adhaerentiam, et incidas eam incisione rotunda.	And if the adhesion is between some of the siphaches, or in it that is between the water: then you should free all this adhesion, and cut it off with a round incision.
Si autem est natiuitas carnis in loco adhaerentiae quae est retro: tunc oportet ut incidas totum eius, et extrahas ouum, sicut diximus.	But if the birth of the flesh is in the place of the adhesion that is behind: then it must be that you cut off all this, and pull out the hand, as we have said.
Cum ergo completur operatio tua, tnnc imple uulnus in lana infusa in oleo rosato, et uino: deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	When your operation is complete, then fill the wound with wool infused with rose oil and wine: and then take care of the wound with the rest of the cure, until it heals.
¶ De cura Ramicis, quae est cum Vite.	Of the care of the vine, which is with the fig tree.
Caput LXIIII.	Chapter LXXIV.
Uitis est apostema inuolutum quadam inuolutione, simile botro, cum mollificatione testiculorum: et fit difficilis super infirmum motus et exercitium, et deambulatio.	It is a painful swelling that is somewhat swollen with softening of the testes: and it becomes difficult on the part of the sick person to move, exercise, and walk.
Et in curatione huius aegritudinis est ex timore, propter illud cuius praecessit rememoratio.	And in the cure of this disease is from fear, because of the recollection of that which preceded it.
Verum oportet, ut dicamus operationem in ea secundum quod fecerunt primi.	But it should be said, that we will speak of the operation in it according to what did those first.
Dico ergo, quod oportet ut facias sedere infirmum super sedem eleuatam.	I say then, that you should make the sick person sit on an elevated seat.
Deinde impelle suspensorium testiculorum ad inferiora.	Then push the suspenders of the testes to the lower side.
Deinde tene cutem testiculorum cum digitis tuis, cum uasis quae sunt propinqua uirgae: et teneat ea minister alius, et extendat ea extensione uehementi.	Then hold the skin of the testes with your fingers, with the water that is near the root of the penis: and let another hold it as a servant, and stretch it with a violent extension.
Deinde incide cum spatumili lato acuto sectione transuersa in directo uasorum, donec detegantur uasa.	Then cut with a sharp chisel in a transverse direction through the direct vesicles, until they are detected.
Deinde excoria ab omni parte, sicut diximus tibi in extractione Arteriarum quae sunt in timporibus.	Then scrape off from all sides, as we have told you in the extraction of the arteries which are in the temples.
Postea fige in eis acum in qua sit filum duplum, et liga ipsum in primo locorum quibus accidunt Vites: et liga ipsum iterum in ultimo eorum.	Then fix in them a sharp awl at the place where the two nerves come together, and tie it at the first of the places where the vines are located; and tie it again at the last of these.
Deinde seca ea in media sectione recta secundum longitudinem corporis, et extrahe quod aggregatur ex humiditatibus faeculentis corruptis.	Then dry them out in a straight transverse section along the length of the body, and pull out what is gathered from the腐臭的湿润物质。
Deinde cura uulnus cum curatione reliquorum uulnerum, in quibus uis generari saniem, ut cadant uasa quae nutriunt unum testiculorum.	Then heal the wound with care of the other wounds, so that they heal well, so that the vesicles which nourish one testicle drop.
Non est enim malum per illud.	It is not bad because of that.
Si autem accidat Vitis omnibus uasis, tunc oportet ut extrahantur propter hoc testiculi cum uasis: ut non priuetur ouum nutrimento, propter incisionem, et tabescat, uel arescat, et non sit iuuamentum cum eis.	But if all the vesicles are cut off because of this, then they should remove the testicles with the vesicles for this reason: so that their nourishment is not blocked by the incision and does not become dry or scarred, and does not form a lump with them.
¶ De cura Ramicis intestinalis.	Regarding the care of the intestinal ramus.
Caput LXV.	Chapter LVI.
Euentus huius Ramicis est ex sectione, quae accidit in sifach extenso super uentrem in parte inguinum ex mirach uentris.	The opening of this ramus is from a section which happens in the soft part above the gut in the groin region on one side of the body.
Quare descendunt intestina ex illa Ruptura ad unum testiculorum.	Why do the intestines come down from that rupture to one testicle?
Et haec Ruptura est aut ex sifach, aut extensione eius.	And this break-open is either from the soft part or from the length of it.
Et accidunt istae duae species ex caussis multis: aut ex percussione, aut saltu, aut clamore, aut eleuatione rei grauis, et similibus.	And these two kinds of events happen for various reasons: either from impact, or from a slip, or from a loud noise, or from carrying something heavy, and the like.
Et signum, quando est ex extensione sifach.	And the sign, when it is from the length of the soft part.
Est quod accidit paulatim in tempore longo, et non accidit subito: et est apostema aequale uersus profundum: propterea, quod sifach comprimit intestinum.	It is that which happens gradually over a long period of time, and does not happen suddenly; and it is an inflammation which is the same depth as the киш: because the soft part compresses the intestines.
Et signum eius quando est ex sectione sifach, quia facit accidere ex principio sui dolorem uehementem subito: et est apostema diuersum, apparens sub cute propinque: et illud est propter exitum intestini, et cursus eius ad exteriora sifach.	And the sign of it is when it is from the break-open of the soft part, because it causes sharp pain at the beginning; and it is an inflammation which appears different, visible under the skin near: and this is due to the exit of the intestines, and their course towards the outside of the soft part.
Et quandoque egreditur cum intestino zirbum: et nominatur haec Ramex intestinalis, et zirbia: et quandoque fit cum uentositate.	And sometimes when it goes out with the small intestine: and this is called Ramex intestinalis, and zirbia: and sometimes made with the windiness.
Et quandoque currit in intestinum stercus, et retinetur illic: et est cum eo pernicies infirmi: quoniam facit accidere dolorem prauum, et praecipue quando premitur.	And when it runs into the dung of the intestines, and is held there: and with it comes the disease of the entrails: for it causes pain in front, and especially when it is pressed.
Et in curatione specierum aegritudinis huius cum ferro est timor: quare oportet ut caueatur casus in ea.	And in the cure of this disease of the body with iron there is danger: for which reason it should be guarded against.
Et modus operationis est, ut praecipias infirmo, ut reducat intestinum manu sua ad interiora concauitatis suae, si obedit reditui.	And the method of operation is, that you instruct the sick person to bring his hand into his abdomen and move it in a circular motion: if he complies, he will return.
Deinde resupinetur super collum suum inter manus tuas: et eleua crura eius.	Then let him lie on his back between your hands: and wash his legs.
Deinde extende cutem quae sequitur cutem ad superiora, et seca cutem testiculorum totam per longitudinem.	Then extend the skin that follows the skin upward, and dry the skin of the testes completely in length.
Deinde fige in duobus labiis sectionis uncinos, secundum quod indiges ad aperiendum sectionem cum eis: et sectio sit secundum quantitatem, quod sit possibile, ut egrediatur ex ea ouum.	Then fasten in two lips of the incision, according to which it is opened by you: and the section be second to the quantity, that it is possible, that it goes out from it an egg.
Deinde excoria siphak, et quae sunt sub cute testiculorum, donec quando detegitur sifach album, durum ab omni parte: tunc intromitte digitum tuum indicem in eo quod sequitur testiculum, in eo quod est inter siphach album, quod est sub cute oui, et inter sifach secundum, et absolue cum eo adhaerentiam quae est in posteriori parte oui.	Then scrape the skin of the testicles, and what is under the skin, until it is found when it touches the white skin, hard from all parts: then put your finger into it that follows the testicle, in that which is between the white skin, that is under the skin, and between the second skin, and separate with it the adhesion that is in the back part of the skin.
Deinde moue cum manu dextra ad interiora cutem testiculorum: et cum hoc extende sifach album ad sursum, cum manu sinistra: et eleua ouum cum sifach ad partem sectionis: et praecipe ministro, ut extendat ouum ad sursum: et tu solue adhaerentiam, quae est retro solutione completa.	Then move with your right hand to the inside of the skin of the testicles: and when you do this, extend the white skin upward, with your left hand: and wash the egg with the skin to the side of the section: and order the minister, that he extends the egg upward: and you solve the adhesion that is behind the complete solution.
Et quaere digitis tuis, ut non sit aliquid illic ex intestino inuoluto in sifach albo duro.	And look with your fingers that there is nothing there from the intestine that has been washed in the white skin, hard or durable.
Si autem inuenis ex eo aliquid: tunc impelle ipsum ad uentrem inferius.	If then there is anything washed out of it: then push him towards the downward wind.
Deinde accipe acum, in qua sit filum grossum, factum licinium ex decem filis: et intromitte ipsam apud postremum sifach, id est, tunicae, quod est sub cute testiculorum quae sequitur sectionem: deinde incide extremitates quae eminent ex filo, donec sint quatuor fila.	Then take the acume, in which is a thick filament, made of ten fils; and insert it between the last siphach, that is to say, the tunic, which is under the skin of the testicles which follows the section: then incise the extremities which protrude from the filament, until they are four fils.
Deinde compone quaedam eorum super quaedam cum figura quae sit in modo crucis: et liga cum eis alsifach, de quo diximus, quia est sub cute testiculorum ligamento uehementi, donec non possit aliquod ex uasis, quae nutriunt eos mittere ad eos aliquid: ut non accidat inde apostema calidum.	Then compose some of them together with a figure which is in the form of a cross: and bind them up with alsifach, of which I have spoken, because it is under the skin of the testicles, a binding of great strength, until no one of those which nourish them can send anything to them: so that no fever may arise from it.
Et pone iterum ligamentum secundum extra ligamentum primum, longinquum ab eo minus duobus digitis.	And put again another ligature second after the first, far from it by two fingers.
Et post ista duo ligamenta dimitte ex sifach, quod est sub cute testiculorum, quantitatem magnitudinis digiti: et incide reliquum totum secundum rotunditatem, et aufer ex eo ouum.	And after these two ligatures let go from the siphach, which is under the skin of the testicles, a quantity equal to the size of a finger; and cut off the whole remaining one according to its circularity, and remove it.
Deinde seca in inferiori parte cutis testiculorum sectione, ex qua currit sanguis, et sanies: sicut narrauimus in eo quod praemissum est.	Then dry up in the lower part of the skin of the testicles the section from which runs the blood and pus: as we have said before.
Deinde administra lanam submersam in oleo, et pone in uulnus: et administra ligamentum quod narrauimus.	Then administer the wool which has been soaked in oil, and put it on the spin; and administer the ligature which I have mentioned.
Et quandoque cauterizatur sifach album quod diximus, post incisionem eius timendo de fluxu sanguinis.	And when the siphach of white albumen, which we have spoken of, is cauterized after the incision in fear of the flow of blood.
Multotiens enim accidit illud.	This happens many times.
Et dimitte ligamentum, donec cadat per se.	And let go of the ligature, until it falls by itself.
Si autem tardatur casus eius, tunc embrocetur cum aqua calida: et pone super ipsum illud quod diximus, donec cadat.	But if its fall is delayed, then let it be broached with hot water: and put over it that which I have spoken of, until it falls.
Deinde cura uulnus cum reliqua curatione uulnerum, donec curetur.	Then take care of the spin with the rest of the cure for the wound, until it is cured.
¶ De Ramice uentosa.	[The Reeds of the Spring.]
Caput LXVI.	Chapter LVI.
IN Hac Ramice non uidi aliquem qui ausus fuerit super curationem eius cum ferro.	In this reed of the spring, I did not see any who dared to heal it with iron.
Et primi quidem dixerunt, quod fit sicut narrauimus in Ramice quae est cum Vite.	And first they said that it was done as we have related in Rambus who is with the Vine.
Quod est, ut liges uasa post sectionem super ea cum facilitate inferius: deinde seca in medio, et cura postremo cum eo quod aperit ipsum, donec cadant uasa: et cura uulnus, secundum quod diximus, donec sanetur.	That is, so that the wounds remain after the section with ease below: then dry them in the middle, and care afterwards with what opens it up, until the wounds fall off: and cure the wound, as we have said, until it heals.
¶ De disruptione quae fit in inguinibus.	Regarding the dissection which takes place in the groin.
Caput LXVII.	Chapter LVII.
Quando accidit Ruptura in inguinibus, sicut diximus, et eminet locus, et non descendit ad testiculos aliquid ex intestinis: et si descendit, est illud parum, et redit in omnibus horis: uerum si prolongatur cum ea tempus, additur fissura in sifach, donec descendunt intestina in sifach.	When the rupture takes place in the groin, as we have said, and the opening appears, but nothing of the intestines descends to the testicles: and if it does descend, it is not much, and returns in all times: indeed, if it lasts a long time with it, a fissure is added to the scrotum, until the intestines descend into the scrotum.
Et accidit illud ex extensione sifach, quod est in inguinibus, sicut diximus.	And this happened because of the enlargement of the scrotum, which takes place in the groin, as we have said.
Quod est, quia extenditur sifach: deinde mollificatur, et apostematur locus, et eminet.	That is, because it extends the scrotum: then it softens, and the opening appears, and the discharge takes place.
Et cura eius est cum cauterio, sicut praecessit eius narratio.	And care for it is with a poultice, as preceded by its report.
Et quandoque curatur cum ferro, secundum hunc modum: et est, ut iaceat infirmus super dorsum suum inter manus tuas.	And when it is treated with iron, in this way: and it is so that he lies sick on his back between your hands.
Deinde seca locum Rupturae apostematum et eminentem, sectione per latitudinem, secundum quantitatem trium digitorum.	Then dry the place where the rupture has opened and the discharge has taken place, with a section from side to side, according to the quantity of three fingers.
Deinde stringe alsifak et, quae sunt sub cute, donec quando detegitur sifach album, quod est sub cute quae sequitur ipsum.	Then tighten it with a thong, and what is beneath the skin, until, when it is touched, the scrotum gives off white, which is under the skin that follows it.
Tunc accipe radium, et pone ipsum super locum eminentem ex sifach, et preme ipsum ad profundum uentris.	Then take a ray, and place it on the discharge-taking place from the scrotum, and press it into the deep of the groin.
Deinde sue duo loca eminentia super extremitatem radii ex sifach, et annecte cum sutura unum eorum cum altero: deinde extrahe extremitatem radii.	Then take two discharge-taking places from the end of the ray from the scrotum, and join them with a stitch one to another: then remove the end of the ray.
Et non incidas alsifach omnino, neque tendas ouum, neque aliud, sicut feci te scire in curatione ramicis intestinalis.	And do not at all strike the thong, nor stretch out one, nor anything else, as I told you to know in the cure of the intestinal ramus.
Deinde cura illud curatione uulnerum.	Then the cure for that wound.
Cum ergo incidis fila, mundifica illud, et restaura uulnus, donec consolidetur.	When you fall and hurt yourself, clean that wound, and mend the break, until it heals.
Sisach enim contrahitur, et non additur eminentia Rupturae.	For Sisach was struck, and no merit is added to the rupture.
Et cauterium est melius in hoc loco: quoniam est propinquius ad salutem.	And the wound should be cauterized better here: for it is nearer to health.
¶ De mollificatione cutis testiculorum.	Regarding the softening of the skin of the testicles.
Caput LXVIII.	Head 85.
Multotiens mollificatur cutis testiculorum in quibusdam hominibus, propter quod mollificantur carnes quae sunt inter ea, et foedatur aspectus eius.	The skin of the testicles is sometimes softened in certain men, because the flesh between them is softened and its appearance changes.
Ergo necesse est ei qui rogatur in curatione eius, ut faciat iacere infirmum super dorsum suum, et incidat totam cutem quae mollificata est super cutem naturalem.	Therefore it is necessary for the one who is asked about his cure to lie down on his back, and strike all of the softened skin over the natural skin.
Deinde aggreget duo labia cum sutura: et si uis, sue in primis superfluitatem cutis mollificatae tribus suturis, aut quatuor, et firma suturam.	Then he should add two lips with a stitch: and if necessary, in the first place, three stitches of the softened skin, or four, and a firm stitch.
Deinde incide inter sututuras.	Then cut between the stitches.
Deinde cura curatione reliquorum uulnerum, usquequo sanetur, et cadant fila.	Then the cure for the remaining wounds, until they are healed, and the stitches fall off.
¶ De Castratione.	Regarding castration.
Caput LXIX.	Head 89.
Scias, quod Castratio in lege nostra excommunicata est: et propter illud liceret mihi, ut non rememorarer eius in libro meo isto: et non est necessaria rememoratio eius, nisi propter duos modos.	You should know that castration is excommunicated in our law; and because of that, let it remind me here in my book: and its reminder is not necessary except for two reasons.
Quorum unus est, ut sit illud in scientia medici quando interrogatur de ea: et ut sciat curationem eius cui accidit.	One reason is so that it may be in the knowledge of a doctor when he is questioned about it: and so that he may know how to cure himself if such an accident happens to him.
Et modus alter est, quod nos multotiens indigemus castratione quorundam animalium, propter iuuamenta nostra per illud, sicut arietum, hyrcorum, et gattorum, et similium ex animalibus.	The other reason is that we have often used castration on certain animals, because of the risks involved with their reproduction, such as sheep, horses, and cats, and similar animals.
Dico ergo, quod Castratio fit secundum duos modos.	I say then that castration is done in two ways.
Aut per attritionem.	Or by friction.
Aut per fissuram, et sectionem.	Or by a slit and cut.
In illa autem quae fit per attritionem, uia operationis est: quod nos faciamus sedere animal in aqua calida, donec mollificentur testiculi eius, et leniantur, et pendeant: deinde attere eos manu tua, donec resoluantur et non appareant sub tactu.	In that one which is done by friction, the procedure is this: that we make the animal sit in warm water, until his testicles soften and become loose, and hang down: then we tear them apart with our hand, until they are healed and do not appear under the touch.
In castratione autem per fissuram et sectionem, oportet ut teneas animal, et premas cutem testiculorum eius cum manu sinistra.	In castratione autem per fissuram et sectionem, oportet ut teneas animal, et premas cutem testiculorum eius cum manu sinistra.
Deinde liga suspensorium, et seca super omne ouum sectione una, donec quando procedunt duo oua: tunc incide ea postquam excoriaueris utrumque, et non dimittas super ea ex sifaket aliquid praeter sifac subtile, quod est super uasa.	But in castration through an incision and section, you should hold the animal, and with your left hand press the skin of its testicles. Then tie the suspenders, and dry all of one section's cut, until when two balls go out: then incise it after you have scrubbed both of them, and do not leave on top of them any cloth other than a thin fabric, which is above the scrotum.
Et iste modus castrationis est melior eo qui fit per attritonem: quoniam attritio fortasse relinquit aliquid ex testiculis, quare desiderat animal coitum.	And this method of castration is better than that which is done by rubbing: for by rubbing perhaps some of the testicles are left behind, whereby the animal desires copulation.
Deinde cura uulnus, donec sanetur.	Then take care of the wound, until it heals.
¶ De cura Hermafroditae duorum modorum.	As for the care of hermaphrodite (individuals with both male and female reproductive organs) there are two ways:
Caput LXX.	Head
Hermafrodita ex uiris est secundum duos modos.	Hermaphrodite is from a man's genitals, according to two ways:
Vnus eorum est, quia apparet in eo quod sequitur spacium, aut in cute testiculorum, in eo quod est inter duos testiculos, figura quasi uulua mulieris, in qua sunt pili: et quandoque currit urina ex eo quod est in cute testiculorum.	A man is from the genitals because it appears that it follows a space, or in the skin of the testicles, in that it is between two testicles, figure like a woman's hares, and when it runs urine from it which is in the skin of the testicles.
In mulieribus autem est species una, et est uulua mulieris super pectinem sicut testiculi uiri parui omnino, eminentes ad exteriora: quorum unus est sicut priapus uiri, et duo sicut duo testiculi.	But in women there is only one kind, and it is woman' figure over the comb like a man' small testicles, sticking out to the outside: of which one is like a penis of a man, and two are like two testicles.
Et curatio trium specierum, duarum ex uiris, et speciei unius ex mulieribus, est: quia oportet ut incidas carnes additas, donec effugiat impressio earum.	And the cure of the three kinds, two from a man' genitals, and one from a woman' genitals, is this: for you must cut off the added flesh, until the impression disappears.
Deinde cura eas curatione reliquorum uulnerum.	Then take care of these in the treatment of the remaining wounds.
In specie autem secunda uirorum, ex qua egreditur urina, quae est in cute testiculorum, non est operatio, neque est eius curatio omnino.	But in the second kind of a man' genitals, from which runs urine which is in the skin of the testicles, there is no operation, nor is there any cure at all.
¶ De incisione Tentiginis, et carnis eminentis in uuluis mulierum.	As for cutting off the hair from the genitals of a woman, and sticking out flesh on men:
Caput LXXI.	Chapter LXXI.
Tentigo fortasse additur super rem naturalem, donec foedatur et turpis fit aspectus eius: et quandoque magnificatur in quibusdam mulieribus adeo, donec expanditur sicut in uiris, et peruenit usque ad coitum.	The head should be tightly bound with a bandage until it has healed and the appearance of the wound is no longer unattractive; and sometimes, so it is said, in certain women, it swells up to such an extent that it resembles a penis and can even lead to intercourse.
Oportet ergo ut teneas superfluitatem Tentiginis manu, aut cum uncino, et incidas: et non ultimes in incisione, praecipue in profundo radicis: ut non accidat fluxus sanguinis.	The excess of the tendinous tissue should be cut with a knife or pinched between the fingers and pressed down; and this should not be done at all near the root of the limb, especially in deep places, so that there may be no flow of blood.
Deinde cura ipsam curatione uulnerum, donec sanetur.	Then care for the cure of the wound until it is healed.
Caro autem orta, est caro quae nascitur in orificio matricis, donec impleat ipsum: et fortasse egreditur ad exteriora secundum similitudinem caudae: et propter illud quidam primi nominant aegritudinem caudatam.	But the flesh that is between the legs, which is born in the womb of the mother, should be allowed to fill itself up, and perhaps it will project towards the outside like a tail; for because of this some call disease with a tail.
Oportet ergo ut incidamus eam sicut incidimus Tentiginem, et curemus eam, donec sanetur.	So cut it as you would cut the tendinous tissue and care for it until it is healed.
¶ De cura Alratica, quae est uulua mulieris non perforata.	Regarding the treatment of an ulcer in a woman that has not been pierced.
Caput LXXII.	Chapter LII.
Alratica est, ut sit uulua mulieris non perforata, aut sit foramen paruum.	It is, so that it is a female's wound and not pierced, or there is a small opening in the windpipe.
Et est aut naturalis, aut accidentalis.	And it is either a natural one or an accidental one.
Accidentalis est ex aegritudine quae praecessit: et ipsa quidem fit aut ex carne nata addita, aut sifach subtili, aut spisso: et fit aut in profundo matricis, aut in lateribus eius, aut in superiore ipsius, aut inferiori eius: et prohibet a coitu et impregnatione, et partu, et fortasse prohibet menstrua.	An accidental one is from an underlying disease; and this itself may be either born of flesh that has been added, or from a splinter of bone, or from a thread; and it may be in deep places within the womb, or in its sides, or above or below it; and it prohibits intercourse, fertilization, pregnancy, and perhaps menstruation.
Et cognitio illius fit per aspectum obstetricis, si opilatio est apparens propinqua.	And knowledge of this can be obtained by the appearance of the Obstetrician, if the swelling is apparent nearby.
Si autem non est apparens, tunc quaere eam digitis tuis, aut cum radio.	But if it is not apparent, then feel for it with your fingers or a ray of light.
Si autem opilatio est ex sifach subtili, et est propinqua duobus labiis: tunc propera, et disrumpe ipsam.	If the swelling is from a small splinter and is near to two lips, then bring it close and remove it.
Et est, ut ponas super duo labia puluillos.	And let it be placed on two lips, dry.
Deinde pone indices tuos duarum manuum simul, et mulier sit super dorsum suum expansis cruribus suis.	Then put your fingers together with both hands and have the woman lie on her back with her legs spread wide.
Deinde extende duo labia cum fortitudine, donec disrumpatur sifach subtile, et aperiatur opilatio.	Then spread apart the two lips firmly until the delicate foreskin is separated and the prepuce opens.
Deinde accipe lanam, et imbibe eam in oleo, et pone ipsam super locum: et coeat mulier omni die, ut non consolidetur locus uice alia.	Then take a sheep's wool, immerse it in oil, and place it on the spot; and have the woman sit there every day so that the wound does not become inflamed due to another pressure.
Si autem sifach est grossum, spissum: tunc oportet ut seces ipsum cum spatumili lato simili folio myrti.	If, however, the foreskin is thick and coarse, then one should cut it with a smooth blade resembling a myrtle leaf.
Si autem opilatio est ex carne nata, tunc suspende eam cum uncinis, et incide eam: et sint tecum medicinae quae fluxum sedant sanguinis absque mordicatione, sicut acacia, et sanguis draconis, et thus aggregatum cum albugine oui.	If, however, the prepuce is made of flesh that has grown out, then hang it on a hook and cut it: and have with you medicines that will stop the flow of blood without causing pain, such as acacia and dragon's blood, and also quicksilver with alum.
Deinde administra cannulam ex plumbo amplam, ut non consolidetur uulnus uelociter, teneat eam diebus aliquot: et administra licinium ex lino sicco, deinde curetur reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then administer a large lead tube so that the wound does not heal quickly, keep it for several days: and administer iron from dry linseed, then treat the remainder with the usual treatment until it heals.
Et quandoque nasciur in matrice natiuitas carnium aliarum: oportet ergo ut incidantur secundum hunc modum: dum non est apostema cancerosum apostemati enim canceroso quod est in matrice, non fiat contrarietas cum ferro omnino.	And when a baby is born from the womb of another woman, it is necessary for this method to be followed: while there is no apoplexy (which apoplexy, being cancerous, arises from the womb), there must be no opposite with iron at all.
¶ De cura hemorroidarum, Athehelil, et Bothor rubeae in uuluis mulierum.	For the care of hemorrhoids, Athelil, and both red boils on the vagina of a woman.
Caput LXXIII.	Chapter LIII.
Hemorroides quidem sunt apertio orificiorum uenarum, donec currit ex eis sanguis multus assidue.	Hemorrhoids are an opening of the vaginal openings, so that a lot of blood runs out of them.
Cum ergo antiquantur hemorroides, fiunt thelil: et iam dixi in diuisione species earum, et signa ipsarum: et dicam hic quae ex eis recipiunt curationem, et quae non.	So when they begin to hurt from hemorrhoids, then they become tender; and I have already mentioned in the classification of these hemorrhoids and their signs, and I will now speak about those that receive treatment and those that do not.
Dico ergo, quod hemorroides quae sunt in orificio matricis, et non apparent sensui: tunc non est ei curatio cum ferro.	I say, then, that hemorrhoids that are in the opening of the womb, and do not become tender; then there is no cure for them with iron.
Quae autem ex eis sunt in orificio matricis super quas cadit sensus, sunt quae curantur.	Which, however, are on the birth canal above which the sense falls, are those which cure.
Oportet ergo ut intromittas mulierem in domum frigidam.	It is necessary that the woman should enter the cold house.
Deinde extende athehelil cum forficibus, aut cum panno aspero, et incide eas ex radicibus suis.	Then spread out the athamel with forceps or a rough cloth and cut them from their roots.
Deinde pulueriza super eas apud fluxum sanguinis ex uno puluerum incisiuorum absque mordificatione: sicut acacia, et sanguis draconis, et thus, et similia eis.	Then dust on them near the flow of blood from one powder-cut without mortification: such as acacia, and dragon's blood, and thorns, and similar to them.
Deinde impellat pedes eius ad parietem hora una.	Then push her feet against the wall at one hour.
Postea depone eam in aquam frigidam.	Then put her in cold water.
Quod si perseuerat fluxus sanguinis: tunc fac eam sedere in decoctione sumach, et corticum granatorum, et gallarum, et similium.	If the flow of blood persisted: then let her sit in a decoction of sumach, and bran, and gall, and similar things.
Deinde accipe farinam hordei, et confice eam cum melle et aceto, et fac emplastrum cum eo super dorsum eius.	Then take barley flour, and make it into a paste with honey and vinegar, and make a sponge with it for her back.
Si ergo abscinditur sanguis cum eo, bonum est: et si non, fac adhaerere dorso uentosas, et mammillis, absque scarificatione.	If, however, blood is shed along with it, that is good: and if not, let adhere to her back streams, and bumps, without scarification.
Deinde accipe lanam, et submerge in succo tarathit, aut succo arnoglossae, aut succo ramorum alaulat, id est, aglanter, uino pontico, et fac adhaerere loeo.	Then take wool, and immerse it in taratissium juice, or arnoglosseum juice, or ramorum aluatis juice, that is, aglanter, Pontic wine, and let adhere to her loins.
Cum ergo quiescit apostema, tunc cura locum cum unguentis, donec sanetur.	When she has recovered from the blister, then take care of the place with ointment, until it is healed.
Albarth uero rubeum est simile capitibus alhaasse, et est asperi aspectus.	Albarth is, however, like blood to the heads of hares, and has a rough appearance.
Oportet ergo ut incidas quod apparet ex eo, secundum quod dixi in thelil aequaliter: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	It is necessary that you cut what appears like blood from it, according to which I said about the limbs equally: and take care of it, until it is healed.
¶ De perforatione Exiturae quae accidit in matrice.	Of the Exitious Wound Which Occurs in the Uterus.
Caput LXXIIII.	Head LXXIIII.
Accidunt in matrice species multae apostematum, sicut cancer, et apostema lapideum, et ulcera, et adubelati, et alekilati, id est, herpes, aestiomemus, et fistulae, et hemorroides, et ragadiae, et thelil, et apostema calidum.	Occur in the uterus many blisters, such as cancer, and stone-like blisters, and ulcers, and pustules, and scabs, and frost, and fistulas, and hemorrhoids, and rags, and blisters hot from the sun.
Et ego quidem iam dixi omnes has aegritudines et species earum, et signa ipsarum, et earum curationes in diuisione: necesse est ut dicam in hoc tractatu apostema calidum quod accidit in matrice, quando est ex apostematibus quae colligunt saniem, et uis scire qualiter fit eius apertio cum ferro.	And I have indeed already said all these diseases and their species, and the signs of them, and their cures, in a division: it is necessary that I say in this tractatum an apostema which happens in the mother, when it is from those apostemas which collect the blood, and to know how it is made with iron.
Oportet ergo ut consideres.	It is necessary therefore that you should reflect on this.
Tunc si dolor apostematis in incaeptione sua est acutus cum percussione sua, et flamma, et febre: et uides ipsum rubere: si cadit super ipsum sensus, tunc non properes cum perforatione eius: et cura ipsum cum eo eo quod iuuat super maturationem, donec quando quiescat acuitas accidentium.	Then if the pain of the apostema in its beginning is acute with its percussion, and the flame, and fever: and you see it red: if it falls on it, then you do not approve with its perforation: and cure it with him as long as he endures, until it has rest from the pains.
Tunc oportet ut facias sedere mulierem super sedem quae labeat duo sedilia, et reclinetur, uel appodietur super dorsum suum, et aggreget pedes suos ad partem inferiorem uentris: et sint coxae eius expansae, et ponat brachia sua sub genibus suis, et liget utraque ligamento conueniente ad illud.	Then it is necessary that you should make the woman sit on a seat which she will be able to reach with two legs, and let her recline, or lie down on her back, and support herself on her heels, and keep her knees apart, and put her arms beneath her knees, and tie each one of them by means of a ligature.
Deinde sedeat obstetrix a latere dextro, et administra instrumentum quo aperitur orificium matricis.	Then the midwife shall sit on the right side, and administer the instrument with which to open up the opening of the womb.
Cuius forma uenit in eis quae sunt post.	Whose shape comes out in those who are after.
Et oportet quando uis administrare hoc instrumentum, ut figas cum Radio profundum matricis mulieris: ut non sit illud quod ingreditur ex instrumento plus, quam profundum matricis, et laedat infirmam.	And it is necessary that when you administer this instrument, you should make it fit with the iron in the womb of the woman: so that it does not enter into the instrument more than the depth of the womb, and does not hurt the weak.
Si autem fuerit instrumentum magis quam profundum, tunc oportet ut ponas puluillos super tecturam profundi matricis: ut prohibeatur introitus instrumenti totius in profundum matricis: et oportet ut ponat uertiginem, quae currit in instrumento, ex latere superiore: et ut teneat instrumentum, et ut reuoluat minister uertiginem, donec aperiatur profundum matricis.	But if the instrument is more than the depth, then it is necessary that you should put a pad on top of the depth of the womb: so as to prevent the entrance of the instrument into all of the depth: and it is necessary that you should put a turner which runs in the instrument from the upper side, and hold the instrument, and make it rotate until the depth has opened up.
Cum ergo apparet Exitura, et tangitur manu, et est lenis et mollis: tunc oportet ut seces ipsam apud caput suum cum spatumili lato.	Then when the opening appears, and is touched by the hand, and is soft and pliable: it is necessary that you should separate it from the head with a smooth edge.
Cum ergo euacuatur sanies, tunc oportet ut ponas in uulnus licinium submersum in oleo rosaceo: aut oleo uiridi, in quo sit quaedam stipticitas: et pone licinium, et extrahe sectionem in profundo matricis.	When then the pus is drained, then you should put a piece of lime wood soaked in rose oil: or oil of yellowwort, where there is some styptic quality; and put limewood, and draw out a piece from deep within the wound.
Et pone exterius super matricem, et super pectinem lanam mundam submersam in aqua, in qua bullitae sunt maluae.	And put outside on top of the wound, and over the woolen cloth dipped in water where there are some bad boils.
Deinde curetur post duos dies cum unguento quod conuenit ad illud, donec sanetur.	Then it is to be dressed after two days with the ointment which suits that, until it heals.
Et quandoque abluitur matrix et uulnus, ita quod clisterizatur cum aqua et melle: deinde cum aqua in qua bullita est radix lilii, aut aristolochia longa: deinde redeat ad unguentum.	And when the wound and skin are washed away so that it is sloughing off with water and honey: then with water in which there is a boil of Lily or long arnoldia: then return to the ointment.
Quod si uulnus absconditum fuerit interius in matrice, tunc oportet ut prohibearis ex curatione eius cum ferro, imo cura ipsum cum eo quod diximus in diuisione.	That if the nail is hidden within the wound, then it is necessary to refrain from curing it with iron, or rather cure it with it as we have said in division.
¶ Doctrinae Obstetricum, qualiter medicentur embriones uiui, secundum figuram non naturalem egressi.	Doctrines of obstetrics, how the fetuses are treated according to a non-natural shape emerging.
Caput Lxxu.	Chapter LXX.
Necesse est Obstetrici, ut cognoscat in primis figuram partus naturalis.	It is necessary for the obstetrician to know first of all the natural form of birth.
Ex signis ergo eius est, quod quando uides mulierem comprimi ad inferiora, et desiderat odorare aerem, et alleuiatur super eam quod super ipsam est de partu, et festinat exitus embrionis: tunc scias quod iste partus est secundum figuram naturalem, et est exitus eius super caput suum, et secundina cum eo: aut suspensa, uel pendens ex umbilico.	From these signs then, you can know that when you see a woman compressing herself towards the lower parts, and desiring to smell air, and being lightened towards her when she is on the point of giving birth, and having the exit of the fetus go over her head, and the second with it: or suspended, or hanging from the navel.
Cum ergo uides haec signa, tunc oportet ut comprimatur uenter eius, ut descendat embrio uelociter.	When then you see these signs, then it is necessary to compress her abdomen so that the fetus may come down quickly.
Nam quando descendit super caput suum, descendit secundina cum eo, et mundatur ex illis superfluitatibus mundificatione bona.	For when it has gone over her head, the second one goes with it, and is cleansed from it by good cleansing.
Qui autem est praeter hunc partum, est innaturalis, illaudabilis.	But if this birth is after that, it is not natural, but worthy of being heard.
Quoniam quandoque egreditur foetus super pedes suos, et egreditur corpus eius ante caput ipsius, et pedes eius, et manus eius una, aut pes eius unus: aut egreditur caput eius et manus eius: aut egreditur uentrinus: et fortasse conuertitur super collum suum, et similia ex figuris illaudabilibus.	For when the fetus also goes out on his feet, and his body goes out before his head, and his feet, and his hands one or two: or his head and his hand go out: or his navel goes out: and perhaps it turns over its neck, and such like figures are worthy of being heard.
Necesse est ergo Obstetrici, ut sit prudens, subtilis in istis rebus omnibus, et caueat sibi ab errore et decaeptione: et ego sum ostendens omnem figuram ex eis, et qualiter est ingenium in ea, et significetur per illud, et stetur super ipsum.	It is therefore necessary for the Obstetrician to be prudent, subtle in all these matters, and to guard himself against error and delusion: and I am showing you all the figures from them, and how the genius is expressed in each of them, and what it signifies by means of that, and stirring over itself.
Quando egreditur foetus super caput suum egressione sua naturali, et uehemens fit illud super mulierem, et difficilis fit ei partus, et uides uirtutem eius iam debilitatam: tunc fac eam sedere super sedem, aut mulieres teneant eam: et uapora uuluam eius cum foenugraeco decocto, et cum oleis humidis.	When the fetus has exited from its head by its natural exit, and it is heavy upon the woman, and difficult for her to give birth, and you see its strength already weakened: then make her sit on a chair, or let the women hold her: and pour over her with a solution of fennel seed, and with moist oils.
Deinde intromittat Obstetrix inter digitos suos Spatumile paruum, et findat cum eo secundinam, et secet eam ungue suo, donec currat quod est in ea ex humiditate: et preme uentrem mulieris, donec descendat foetus.	Then the Obstetrician shall insert between his fingers a small spatula, and find with it the second, and dry her with his nail, until he takes what is in it from the moisture: and press the womb of the woman, until the fetus comes down.
Si autem non descendit, tunc oportet ut clisterizetur mulier ex mucillagine foenugraeci, cum oleo sisamino.	If then it does not come down, then it is necessary that the woman be clenser from a fennel seed mucus with siseamin oil.
Deinde praecipe ei post clistere, ut comprimatur: et fac eam sternutare cum condisi, et tene os eius et nasum ipsius hora una.	Then order her after the clisterization to compress herself: and make her sneeze with a condiment, and hold her nose and mouth for an hour.
Foetus enim egredietur statim.	For the fetus will come out immediately.
Quod si egrediantur duae manus foetus in primis, iunc oportet ut reducas eas cum facilitate paulatim.	What if two hands of the fetus exit first, then it is necessary that you reduce them with ease gradually.
Si autem non obedit in introitu, tunc pone mulierem super sedem, et eleua pedes eius sursum: deinde concute sedem super terram: et mulier teneatur, ut non cadat apud concussionem.	If then it does not obey in the entrance, then put the woman on a chair, and lift her feet up: then set the chair on the ground: and let the woman hold on to something, so that she does not fall by the concussion.
Si ergo non egrediuntur manus, et moritur foetus: tunc incide eas, et extrahe residuum foetus: et liga manum eius cum panno, et extrahe ipsum cum aequalitate: nam ipse egredietur.	If then the hands do not exit, and the fetus dies: then cut them open, and remove the remnant of the fetus: and tie her hand with a cloth, and remove it whole: for he will come out.
¶ Exitus embrionis super pedes suo.	The exit of the embryo under its own feet.
Quando egreditur foetus super pedes suos, tunc oportet ut impellat eos sursum: deinde conuertat foetum paulatim: postea aequet ipsum.	When the fetus exits from under its feet, then it is necessary that you push them up: then turn the fetus gradually: and make it even.
Deinde accipiat unum pedum eius, et extendat eum paulatim.	Then he should take one of his feet and extend it slowly.
Cum ergo egrediuntur usque ad coxas, tunc praecipe ei, ut comprimatur, et fac eam sternutare cum condisi: egredietur enim, si Deus uoluerit.	When they have gone as far as the hips, then order him to squeeze himself and make him sneeze with a gag if necessary: for he will go out, if God wills it.
Et si non egreditur cum eo quod narrauimus, tunc reduc foetum paulatim, donec ponas eum secundum figuram naturalem.	And if he does not come out with him as we have said, then reduce the fetus slowly until you put it back into its normal shape.
Nam ipse egredietur tunc egressu facili.	For he will go out at that time of ease.
Quod si prohibeatur cum eo toto quod narrauimus: tunc accipe ex mucillagine alteae, et oleo sisamino, et gummi soluto: et percute totum in mortario percussione bona: deinde line cum eo uuluam mulieris, et inferius uentris eius.	That if he is prohibited from going out with all that we have said: then take a ball of moldy hay and olive oil and gum: and beat it all together in a mortar with a good pounding: then put the lower part of her uterus in it.
Deinde fac eam sedere in aqua tepida, donec consequatur hypocundria.	Then make him sit in warm water until he gets chills.
Cum ergo uides quod iam calefacta sunt inferiora eius, tunc fac ei sief de myrrha: et suppone ipsum.	When you see that her lower parts are now warmed, then put Myrrh on it and support him.
Quando ergo tenet sief hora una, tunc fac eam sedere super sedem.	When he has held the siff for an hour, then make him sit on a seat.
Deinde fac eam sternutare: et stringe ipsius os et nasum: et preme inferiorem partem uentris compressione facili.	Then make him sneeze: and tighten his mouth and nose: and lightly squeeze the lower part of her uterus.
Nam foeus egredietur statim.	For heat will come out immediately.
¶ Exitus foetus super genua et manus.	Exit the fetus over the knees and hands.
Quando egreditur secundum hanc formam, tunc ingeniet in intromittendo manus suas paulatim.	When he has gone out in this form, then put his hands on him slowly while going into him.
Deinde resupinetur mulier super collum suum, et pendeant pedes eius ad inferiora: et ipsa sit iacens super lectum, et complicet manus suas.	Then the woman should lie on her back and hang her feet down to the ground: and she herself should sit on a bed, and put her hands on it.
Deinde preme supra uentrem eius paulatim.	Then press upwards on her navel slowly.
Deinde extrahe quod est sub pedibus eius ex puluinaribus, donec sit praeparata in inferiori parte.	Then extract what is under her feet from the nail: until it sits prepared in the lower part.
Quod si non egreditur foetus, tunc accipe pedes eius, et moue eos motu uehementi.	That if the fetus does not go out, then take his feet and move them with a powerful motion.
Deinde preme quod est supra hypocundria paulatim, donec ascendat foetus ad superiora.	Then press what is above her uterus slowly, until the fetus goes up to the upper parts.
Deinde intromittat manus suas, et aequet foetum paulatim: et praecipe mulieri, ut comprimatur, donec egrediatur foetus.	Then introduce your hand and gradually stretch out the fetus: and order the woman to compress, until the fetus walks out.
¶ Exitus foetus latitudinaliter pendens ex manibus.	The exit of the fetus hangs downward between the hands.
Ingenietur in reductione manus eius.	Let her hand be freed from reduction.
Si autem non potest reducere eam, tunc eleua mulierem, et fac eam ambulare.	If she cannot reduce herself, then let the woman take care of herself, and let her walk.
Si uero ambulare non potest, tunc fac eam iacere super lectum: et concute crura eius concussione uehementi.	But if she cannot walk, then let her lie on the bed: and strike her legs with a strong blow.
Deinde administra linimentum quod praeparasti ex mucillaginibus.	Then apply the ointment you have prepared from mucus.
Quod si accipit eam partus, tunc fac eam sedere super sedem.	That if she should take hold of the birth, then let her sit on a chair.
Deinde stude in reductione manus, et aequa foetum secundum figuram naturalem: et fac sternutare mulierem, et praecipe ei, ut comprimat se, donec egrediatur.	Then study the hand to reduce it, and place the fetus according to its natural form: and order the woman to sneeze, and tell her to compress herself, until the fetus walks out.
¶ Exitus foetus super collum suum, expansis manibus, et est facies eius ad dorsum matris suae.	The exit of the fetus is over its neck, with spread-out hands, and its face is towards the back of its mother's body.
Oportet ut teneat Obstetrix manum foetus, deinde reuoluat eum paulatim, et aequet eum cum facilitate.	It is necessary that the midwife hold the fetus by the hand, then slowly turn it over, and gently stretch it out.
Cum ergo aequatur, tunc pone super uuluam eius quod narrauimus ex oleo et mucillaginibus.	When it is even, then place it on the pad we spoke of before, made from oil and mucus.
Deinde praecipe ei, ut moueatur paulatim.	Then order her to move slowly.
Cum ergo feceris illud, tunc fac eam sedere super sedem, et praecipe ei ut inclinetur ad latus dextrum.	When you have done that, then let her sit on a chair, and tell her to lean towards the right side.
Deinde praecipe ei, ut comprimatur: et fac eam sternutare cum condisi.	Then order her to compress herself: and make her sneeze with condiments.
¶ Exitus foetus praeparati super latus.	The exit of the fetus is prepared on the side.
Quando descendit ad orificium matricis secundum hunc modum cum secundina, tunc scinde secundinam cum ungue tuo, donec euacuetur ex humiditate.	When it descends towards the opening of the womb according to this mode with the second finger, then cut the second finger with your nail, until it is discharged from the moisture.
Si ergo suspenditur super faciem foetus, et collum eius, tunc incide eam ex umbilico: ut non retineatur, et moriatur.	But if it hangs over the face of the fetus and its neck, then cut it from the navel: so that it does not hold on and dies.
Deinde impelle foetum ad interiora, donec ponas eam secundum quod oportet: et praecipe mulieri, ut comprimat se aliquotiens: ipse enim egredietur exitu leui.	Then push the fetus towards the inside, until you put it in its place: and order the woman to compress herself a few times: for himself shall walk out on the outside.
¶ Exitus Geminorum, aut foetuum multorum.	The exit of the twins, or the fetus of many.
Scias, quod Gemini multotiens nascuntur: et quandoque nascuntur tres, et quatuor.	You know that the Gemini are often born: and sometimes three, and four.
Verumtamen illud extraneum est, et raro contingit.	However, that is strange, and seldom happens.
Quinque uero est res extra naturam, et non uiuunt penitus: et continet eos, quamuis multiplicentur, secundina una: et separantur per sifach, distinguens inter eos ligatum in umbilico cuiusque eorum.	Five, however, is a thing contrary to nature, and they do not dwell together securely: and it will hold them, though they be multiplied, by a second one; and they will separate from each other by means of a cord, distinguishing between them that which is bound in the navel of each.
Et quandoque egrediuntur sicut egreditur foetus unus exitu naturali, facili: et egrediuntur exitu illaudabili, sicut narrauimus.	And sometimes they go out like a single fetus going out of a natural exit, easily: and they go out by an agreeable exit, as we have related.
Quod si difficiles fuerint quidam eorum apud partum, et perueniunt ad illud quod diximus ex figuris innaturalibus, tunc cura eos sicut narrauimus: et sit ob stetrix subtilis, et faciat quod facit cum facilitate et tarditate, et ingenietur secundum omnem figuram cum eo quod praeparatur ei ex ingenio ducente ad salutem.	If any of them be difficult at the birth, and obtain to that which we have said out of a non-natural figure, then take care of them as we have related: and let it sit upon a soft cradle, and make what it can make with ease and delay, and shape itself after all the figure in which it is prepared by nature leading it to salvation.
¶ Rememoratio eius quod formatur in matrice ex embrionibus, et abortiuntur.	Remember that it is formed in the womb out of embryos, and are aborted.
Quandoque formatur in matrice unus, et duo, et tres, et quatuor, et quinque, et sex, et septem, et plures decem: et iam uerificatum est apud me, quod mulier abortiendo emisit septem, et alia quindecim, omnes formatos.	When one is formed in the womb, and two, and three, and four, and five, and six, and seven, and more than ten: and now it has been proved with me that a woman has emitted seven, and another fifteen, all formed.
Quod factum est mensuratione gloriosi sapientis.	That which was done by the measurement of the glorious sage.
Hoc ergo totum oportet ut sit in scientia Obstetricis.	This therefore altogether must be that it is in the knowledge of obstetrics.
Fortasse enim perueniet ad eam simile illius: opponat ergo ei cum illo quod oportet	Perhaps indeed will it come to that which is like it: oppose, then, to it with what is required:
¶ De extractione foetus mortui.	Regarding the extraction of a dead fetus.
Caput LXXVI.	Chapter LVII.
Quando curas foetum mortuum cum eo quod dixi in diuisione ex medicatione, et non egreditur, et cogeris uti operatione cum manu, tunc oportet ut consideres.	When you are concerned with the dead fetus, since I have spoken about extracting it in the division of medication, and does not go out, and you should be forced to use the operation by hand, then you should consider.
Si ergo mulier est sanae uirtutis, et non est cum aliquo ex accidentibus, ex quibus timetur super eam perditio: tunc oportet ut resupinetur mulier super lectum, super dorsum suum, et sit caput eius inclinatum inferius, et crura eius eleuata: et ministra teneat eam a duabus partibus, aut ligetur ad lectum, ut non extrahatur corpus eius apud extractionem foetus.	If, then, the woman is of sound virtue, and is not with any of the accidents out of which she is afraid of perdition: then it is necessary that she should lie down on a bed, on her back, and should have her head inclined downward, and her legs raised: and an assistant should hold her from both sides, or bind her to the bed, so that her body should not be extracted at the extraction of the fetus.
Deinde humecta os matricis ex oleis humidis cum mucillagine alteae, et foenugraeci, et seminis lini.	Then moisten the bone of the marrow with moist oils along with mucin of the althay, and fenugreek, and linseed.
Deinde inungat Obstetrix manum suam cum istis oleis et mucillaginibus: deinde intromittat eam in matricem cum facilitate.	Then the obstetrician shall moisten her own hand with these oils and mucins: then she shall insert it into the womb easily.
Deinde quaerat cum ea locum in quo figat uncinos ex foetu, et loca conuenientia ad illud.	Then she shall seek out the place where she shall fix the hook from the fetus and the places suitable for that.
Considera ergo tunc, si foetus est praeparatus ut descendat super caput suum: tunc fige uncinos in oculos eius, aut in collo eius, aut in ore eius, aut in palato ipsius, aut sub barba eius, aut in furcula ipsius, aut in locis propinquis costis, et sub hypocundriis.	Therefore consider at that time, if the fetus is ready to come down on its own head: then fix the hooks into his eyes, or his neck, or his mouth, or his palate, or under his beard, or in his chin, or in his sides, and near his ribs.
Si autem descensus est super pedes eius, tunc in pectine, et costis eius mediis.	If however the descent is towards its feet: then fix it in the pelvis, and between his ribs.
Et oportet, ut teneat uncinum cum manu dextra: et ponat curuitatem eius in eo quod est inter digitos sinistrae manus: et intromittat cum manu cum facilitate, et figat uncinum in aliquo illorum locorum quae diximus, donec perueniat ad rem uacuam.	And it is necessary that she hold the hook with her right hand: and place a knot on it where it comes between the fingers of her left hand: and insert her hand easily, and fix the hook in one of those places which we have said, until it has come to the free part.
Deinde figat in oppositione eius uncinum alium, aut tertium, si indiges: ut sit contractio aequalis, et non declinet ad partem.	Then she shall fix another hook opposite to it, or a third one, if you are strong: so that there is an equal tension, and it does not lean towards one side.
Deinde extendatur extensione aequali, et non sit extensio secundum rectitudinem tantum, imo moueatur ad omnem partem, ut alleuietur exitus eius: sicut fit cum dente apud eradicationem eius.	Then it shall be extended with an equal extension, and not only be extended in a straight line, but also move on all sides, so that the exit is eased: as happens with a tooth during its extraction.
Et oportet in eo quod est inter illud, ut mollificetur extensio.	And it is necessary in this one that is between that, so that the extension is softened.
Quod si retineatur ex eo pars, tunc oportet ut inungat Obstetrix quosdam digitos cum oleo, et intromittat eos ex parte, ut reuoluat cum eis quod retinetur.	That if a part of it is held back: then the obstetrician shall moisten some fingers with oil, and insert them from the side, so that they rotate with them which hold it back.
Si ergo egreditur pars foetus, tunc permutentur uncini ad locum alium qui sit altior: fac hoc donec egrediatur foetus totus.	If then a part of the fetus comes out: then the hooks shall be moved to another place which is higher: do this until the entire fetus has come out.
Si ergo egreditur manus ante alia, et non est possibile reducere eam, propter coartationem eius: tunc oportet, ut inuoluatur super eam pannus.	If therefore the hand is put out before another, and it is not possible to reduce it, through its coaptation: then it is necessary that a cloth be wrapped over it.
Deinde extrahe eam donec quando egreditur tota, incide eam aut in iunctura plantae, aut in cubito: et ita oportet ut facias in manu altera, et in duobus pedibus.	Then pull it out until it comes out completely, cut it or in the joint of the plant, or on the kneecap: and so you should do to the other hand, and in two feet.
Si autem caput foetus est magnum, aut accidit ei coartatio in exitu, aut est in capite eius aqua aggregata: tunc oportet ut intromittat inter digitos Spatumile spinosum, et findat cum eo caput, et extrahat aquam: aut disrumpat ipsum cum instrumento quod nominatur Almisdac: cuius forma uenit cum formis reliquorum instrumentorum in capitulo quod est post hoc.	If the head of the fetus is large, or if there has been a coaptation in the exitium, or water is collected in its head: then it is necessary that he introduce between his fingers the spikelet with thorns, and take away with him the head, and drain out the water: or dislodge it with the instrument which is called Almisdac: whose shape has come from the shapes of the other instruments in the chapter after this.
Similiter faciat si foetus est magni capitis natura, tunc oportet ut seces algengematu: aut extrahas ipsum cum misdach, sicut diximus.	Similarly do if the nature of the fetus is of a large head, then it is necessary that he separate the algengemat: or take out with the Misdach, as we have said.
Deinde attrahas ossa cum forcipibus.	Then pull out the bones with pincers.
Quod si egrediatur caput, et coartetur apud furculam: tunc findatur, donec effundatur humiditas quae est in pectore.	That if it is put out the head, and is coapted by the fork: then find out, until the moisture that is in the chest is discharged.
Si autem non complicatur, neque obedit ad exitum: tunc incide caput frustatim, secundum quod possibile est tibi.	If it does not become complicated, and does not submit to the exitium: then cut the head hastily, according to what is possible for you.
Quod si inferius uentris est apostematum, aut est in eo hydropisis: tunc oportet ut perfores ipsum, donec currat humiditas ex eo.	That if the lower leg is apostematous, or there is hydropisis in it: then it is necessary that you perforate it, until the moisture runs out of it.
Si uero foetus est super pedes suos, tunc attractio eius est facilis, et directio eius ad os matricis est leuis.	If the fetus is above his own feet, then its attraction is easy, and its direction to the mouth of the mother is light.
Si autem coartatur apud uentrem, aut pectus: tunc oportet ut extrahas ipsum cum panno quem inuoluisti super manum tuam: et findat uentrem, aut pectus, donec currat quod est in eis.	If it is coapted by the belly, or by the chest: then it is necessary that you take out with a cloth which you wrapped over your own hand: and find out the belly, or the chest, until what is in them runs out.
Si autem auferuntur reliqua membra, et redit caput: tunc intromittat Obstetrix manum sinistram.	If other limbs are taken away, and returns the head: then the midwife should introduce her left hand.
Si ergo os matricis est apertum, tunc intromittat manum in profundum matricis, et quaerat cum ea caput, et attrahat ipsum cum digitis usque ad os matricis: deinde intromittat in eo uncinum unum, aut uncinos duos, et attrahat ipsum cum eo.	If then the jaw is open, then introduce your hand into the depth of the jaw, and ask it with your fingers, and draw it towards you up to the jaw: then introduce one hook, or two hooks, and draw it with them.
Quod si os matricis coartatur, propter apostema calidum quod accidit ei: tunc non oportet ut laboretur super ipsum, imo oportet tunc administrare effusionem rerum humidarum, pinguium: et administra emplastra: et sedeat in aquis quae mollificant et humectant.	That if the jaw is locked, because of the heat that comes to it: then it is not necessary for him to work on it, but then he should administer an infusion of liquid, thick: and administer plaster: and sit in waters that soften and moisturize.
Quod si foetus est super latus suum, tunc possibile est ut aequetur: tunc administretur quod diximus in foetu uiuo.	That if the fetus is on its side, then it is possible to make it even: then he should administer what we have said about the single fetus.
Quod si non est possibile illud, tunc incidatur frustatim, et extrahatur.	That if that is not possible, then cut it short, and extract it.
Et oportet ut non dimittas aliquid ex secundina intus omnino.	And you should not leave anything at all inside the second
Cum ergo compleueris operationem tuam, tunc administra quod diximus in apostematibus calidis quae accidunt in matricibus.	When you have finished your operation, then administer what we have said about the heat that happens in the wombs of the mothers.
Quod si accidat fluxus sanguinis, tunc descendat in aquis stipticis, et administra reliquam curationem.	That if blood flows, then go down into the waters of stiffness, and administer the remaining cure.
Et ego quidem iam uidi mulierem, in cuius uentre mortuus erat foetus: deinde impregnata est super ipsum uice alia, postea mortuus est foetus alius etiam.	And I have already seen a woman, in whose womb a dead fetus was: then she became pregnant with another fluid, and then a different dead fetus also developed.
Accidit ergo ei post tempus longum apostema in umbilico suo, et inflatum est, donec apertum est: et coepit emittere pus.	Then it happened to her after a long time that she had an apostema in her navel, and it was swollen, until it opened up: and it began to emit pus.
Vocatus sum ergo ad curationem eius, et medicatus sum ei tempore longo: et non consolidatum est uulnus.	So I was called to treat her, and I treated her for a long time: and the wound did not heal.
Posui ergo super ipsum ex quibusdam emplastris fortis attractionis: et exiuit ex loco os.	I then put on top of it some strong plasters of attraction: and it came out of its place, from the mouth.
Deinde praeterierunt ei dies aliquot, et exiuit os aliud.	Then a few days passed, and another mouth came out.
Miratus sum ergo inde, cum in uentre non sit os.	So I was amazed then, when there is no mouth inside the womb.
Cogitaui ergo, quia erant ex ossibus foetus mortui.	I therefore thought that there were bones of a dead fetus.
Inquisiui ergo uulnus, et extraxi ossa multa, muliere existente in melioribus dispositionibus suis: et iam uixit taliter tempore longo, et mittit ex loco pus parum.	I therefore enquired about the wound, and drew out many bones, while the woman was in better health. And she now stayed a long time, and sent for a little pus from the place.
Et ego non firmaui hic hoc extraneum, nisi quoniam in eo est scientia, et adiutorium ad illud, quod administrat medicus artifex cum manu ex curatione.	And I did not find this strange here, except that knowledge and help is found in it for the healer, the artisan, with his hand from healing.
¶ De formis Instrumentorum necessariorum in extractione foetus.	On the forms of instruments necessary for extracting the fetus.
Caput LXXVII.	Chapter LVII. On heads.
Hic inferius est forma Strictorii, quo aequantur libri, cui aequaliter sunt duae uertigines in duabus extremitatibus duorum lignorum.	Here is the form of the strictorium, with which the books are made level; and two springs are equal at the ends of two beams.
Verumtamen haec Vertigo oportet ut sit subtilior strictorio: et ut fiat, aut ex ebano, aut ex ligno bussi.	However, this vertical should be made finer for the strigorium; and so it is made, either from ebony or from hickory wood.
Et sit latitudo omnis ligni quasi duo digiti: et margo cuiusque amborum est quasi digitus unus, et longitudo cuiusque eorum est palmus et medietas: et in medio duorum lignorum sunt duo additamenta ex genere eiusdem ligni, quae iam firmata sunt in utrisque, quorum longitudo est medietas palmi et plus parum: et latitudo utriusque est quasi duo digiti, aut plus parum.	And the width of each beam should be like two fingers; and its length should be a palm and a half, and its middle is a little less than the length of the palm; and there are two pieces of the same kind of wood in the middle of the two beams, which have already been fixed on both sides, whose length is the half of a palm and a little more; and the width of each is like two fingers or a little less.
Et ista duo additamenta intromittuntur in os matricis, ut aperiatur cum eis quando tu reuoluis duas Vertigines.	And these two pieces are inserted into the mouth of the womb, so that it opens to them when you turn the two springs.
Forma Vertiginis qua aperitur matrix.	Form of the spring which opens the womb.
Forma alia ad simile illius, subtilior, et leuior.	A different form for its similarity, finer and lighter.
Fiat ex ligno ebani, aut bussi, secundum similitudinem forcipum.	It is to be made of Ebony wood or hickory, according to the similarity of the fork.
Verumtamen in extremitate eius sint duo additamenta, sicut uides hic supra: et longitudo omnis additamenti ex eis est quasi palmus: et latitudo utriusque est, duo digiti.	However, at its end there are two pieces as you see above; and the length of each piece is like a palm; and the width of each is like two fingers.
Cum ergo uis aperire matricem cum eo, tunc fac sedere mulierem super lectum, pendentibus pedibus eius, aperto quod est inter crura eius.	But when you want to open the womb with it, then let the woman sit on a bed, her feet hanging down from between her thighs.
Deinde intromitte ista duo additamenta coniuncta in matricem: et tu es tenens extremitatem instrumenti inferius inter coxas eius.	Then insert these two pieces joined together into the womb; and you hold the lower end of the instrument between her thighs.
Deinde aperi manum tuam cum instrumento, sicut facis cum forficibus, aequaliter secundum quantitatem quam uis ex apertione oris matricis, donec faciat Obstetrix quod uult.	Then open your hand with the instrument, as you would with tweezers, equally according to the quantity that you wish to extract from the opening of the womb, until the midwife does what she wants.
Forma Vertiginis alterius quam dixerunt antiqui Forma Impellentis quo impellitur foetus.	The form of another vertigo than those ancient ones: The form which is driven forth by an impulse of the fetus.
Forma Almisdac, qua conteritur caput magnum: et assimilatur forcipi, cui sunt dentes in extremitate, sicut uides.	Form that is called "Almisac", in which the great head is compressed: and it is equal to a pair of forceps, which have teeth at their ends, as you see them.
Et quandoque fit oblungum, sicut forcipes secundum hanc formam, sicut uides, cui sunt dentes sicut dentes serrae, quo inciditur et conteritur.	And when it is made round, like this form of forceps, as you see, whose teeth are like those of a sickle, by which it is cut and compressed.
Forma Almisdac quo conteritur caput paruum.	Form that is called "Almisac", in which the little head is compressed.
Forma Vncini habentis spinam unam.	Form that has a single spike:
Forma Vncini habentis spinas duas.	Form that has two spikes:
Forma forcipis cui sunt dentes serrae, cum quo conteritur caput foetus.	Form of forceps, which have teeth like a sickle, by which the head of the fetus is compressed.
Forma Spatumilis habentis duas extremitates ad abscindendum caput.	Form that has two ends for cutting the head:
Forma duorum Spatumilium etiam latorum.	Form of two spatulums and also of tweezers.
Ista instrumenta omnia exercentur, et quanto plus multiplicantur species eorum, et praeparata sunt apud artificem, est uelocior ad operationem suam, et altior apud homines, propter quantitatem suam.	These instruments are all used, and the more they multiply in kind, and are prepared by the art of the artisan, the faster they carry out their work, and the higher among men due to their quantity.
Non ergo despicies ex eis instrumentum, quin sit apud te praeparatum.	Therefore do not despise these instruments, but have them prepared with you.
Inexcusabilis est enim necessitas eorum.	For necessity is inexcusable.
¶ De extractione Secundinae.	On the extraction of the second.
Caput LXXVIII.	Head 78.
Quando retinetur Secundina apud partum, tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmae, ut retineat anhelitum suum.	When the second is retained at birth, then you should let it go, so that it does not retain its breath.
Deinde fac eam sternutare cum condisi: et stringe manum tuam super os eius, et nares ipsius.	Then make her sneeze with a ball, and squeeze your hand on the opening of her nose, and then pull her hair.
Si ergo egreditur per hoc, bonum est.	If, therefore, she goes out through this, it is good.
Si non: tunc accipe ollam, et perfora in coopertorio foramen: et pone in ea herbas aperientes os matricis, sicut calamentum, rutam, et anetum, et camomillam, et sseham, et cassiam ligneam, et centauream: accipe omnes istas herbas, aut quasdam earum, et submerge eas cum aqua, et pone eas super ignem.	But if not: then take a stick and pierce through the lid: and put into it herbs opening up the opening of the womb, such as calamus, rosemary, fennel, chamomile, sage, cassia wood, and centaury: take all the herbs or some of them, and soak them in water with wine, and place them on fire.
Deinde pone embulam arundinis super foramen coopertorii ollae, et extremitatem aliam in os matricis: et teneat eam donec perueniat uapor ad concauitatem matricis.	Then put on a bandage around the foramen coopertorium of the hollow bone, and the other end at the mouth of the matrix: and hold it till the steam has reached the matrix's closure.
Deinde fac eam sternutare, sicut diximus.	Then make him sneeze, as we have said.
Secundina enim egredietur cum facilitate.	For the second time he will come out with ease.
Si autem remaneat post hanc curationem, et non egrediatur: tunc praecipe Obstetrici, ut submergat manum suam in oleo sisamino, aut mucillagine alteae.	But if after this cure he still remains and does not want to come out: then instruct the Obstetrician to dip his hand in oil of sesame, or in mucus of an elder plant.
Deinde intromittat in uuluam, et quaerat cum ea Secundinam.	Then insert it into the womb, and ask her if she feels a second movement.
Cum ergo inuenerit eam, tunc accipiat eam, et extendat ipsam paulatim.	When she has found it, then take it, and stretch it out little by little.
Si autem fuerit annexa in profundo matricis, tunc intromittat manum, secundum quod narrauimus, donec quando inuenerit Secundinam, et extrahat eam paulatim secundum rectitudinem, ut non cadat matrix apud attractionem uehementem: imo oportet, ut permutetur cum facilitate ad latera dextra et sinistra: deinde addatur in quantitatem attractionis.	But if it is stuck deep inside the matrix, then insert your hand, following what we have said, until you feel a second movement and slowly pull it out according to the direction, so that the matrix does not tear due to sudden pulling: it should be rotated so as to change its position from one side to the other with ease: then add oil in quantity.
Ipsa enim obedit tunc, et seruatur, et euadit ab adhaerentia.	She herself will submit then, and move about, and rid herself of the adhesions.
Quod si os matricis est coartatum, sicut nos iam narrauimus: cura eam cum sternutatione, et ex medicatione ollae cum herbis.	If the matrix' mouth is constricted, as we have already described: treat it with sneezing, and after the cure with herbs.
Si autem non egreditur cum omnibus quae narrauimus, tunc caue ne fatigeris super eam in iteratione extractionis.	But if it does not come out with all that we have described, then be careful not to tire yourself out trying to extract it.
Verum oportet, ut quod egreditur ad os matricis ex ea, liges ad coxam mulieris.	But it is necessary that you tie a ligature around the woman's waist so that the baby does not slip down inside her.
Deinde clisteriza eam cum unguento tetrapharmacon.	Then clean her with a four-fold ointment.
Ipsum enim putrefaciet eam post dies, et dissoluetur, et egredietur.	For it will rot and dissolve after some days, and come out.
Verumtamen quando putrefit, eleuatur ex ea odor malus ad stomachum et caput, et laedit illud infirmam.	But when it is rotting, a bad smell rises from it to the stomach and head, and causes sickness.
Oportet ergo ut administrentur suffumigationes conuenientes ad illud.	Therefore it should be administered appropriate vaporizations to it.
Quidam autem antiquorum iam experti sunt suffumigationem nasturtii, et ficuum siccarum.	Some have already been experienced in the sufumigation of nasturti and dried figs.
Forma instrumenti quo suffumigatur mulier apud retentionem Secundinae et menstruorum.	The form of the instrument for sufumigating a woman during the second and menstrual period.
Fiat ex uitro simile alcama, aut ex zere: et ponatur extremitas ampla super ignem: et suffumigatio sit posita super prunas: teneat eam, donec consumatur illa suffumigatio: et itera aliam.	Make it from a kind of vine or grain, and place the wider end on a fire; and let the sufumigation be placed on plums; hold it, until that sufumigation is consumed; and then take another one.
¶ De curatione Ani non perforati.	Regarding the cure of an unercted ani.
Caput LXXIX.	Chapter LVII.
Nascuntur multi puerorum, et Ani eorum sunt non perforati, quos iam opilauit sifac subtile.	Many boys are born with their ani not yet pierced, and already the subtle sirocco has dried them up.
Oportet ergo, ut obstetrix perforet illud sifac digito suo: et si non, perforet ipsum cum Spatumili acuto: et caueat lacertum, ne tangat eum.	Therefore, it should be that the midwife pierces that sirocco with her finger; and if she does not, then she should pierce it herself with a sharp Spatumili; and let her take care, lest she touch it.
Deinde pone super ipsum lanam infusam in uino et oleo.	Then put over it the wool soaked in wine and oil.
Deinde cura ipsum cum ungentis, donec sanetur.	Then care for the wound with ointment, until it heals.
Si autem times quod opiletur, tunc pone in foramine cannulam de plumbo diebus multis, et auferatur quando puer uult egerere.	But if you should happen to notice that it is getting oily, then put a lead tube in the hole for many days, and remove it when the boy wants to defecate.
Et iam accidit opilatio Ani etiam ex consolidatione uulneris, aut apostematis.	And already the ani has become oily from the constipation of a wound or pustules.
Oportet ergo ut secetur illa consolidatio, deinde curetur cum eo quod diximus ex curatione et plumbo.	Therefore, it should be that this consolidation is removed, and then cared for with what we have said regarding the cure and lead.
¶ De curatione Fistularum quae accidunt in inferiori parte.	Regarding the cure of fistulas which occur in the lower part.
Caput LXXX.	Chapter LIII.
Fistulae quae accidunt in inferiori, sunt Nodatio, et Grossitudo quae accidunt prope anum deforis: aut in spacio unius partium: et est Fistula una, aut plures.	Fistulas which occur in the lower part are either Induration or Grossness which occurs near an anal opening: or in a space of one part: and there is one fistula, or many.
Cum ergo antiquatur illa Nodatio, aperitur, et currit ex ea humiditas aquosa alba, aut pus subtile.	Therefore, when that induration is aged, it opens up, and runs out of it a watery white discharge, or a subtle pus.
Et quandoque sunt ex istis Fistulis penetrantes.	And when they are from these fistulas which penetrate.
Ergo penetrantes cognoscuntur per illud quod egreditur ex egestione, et uentositate, quando utitur infirmus egestione: et fortasse egreditur ex eis uermis.	Therefore, the penetrating ones are known by that which comes out with defecation, and windiness, when a sick person uses defecation; and perhaps it comes out from them clean.
Et sunt ex eis Fistulae quando sunt in spacio penetrantes usque ad uesicam, et usque ad meatum uirgae.	And they are from them Fistulae when they are in space penetrating up to the ischium, and up to the pubic bone.
Et sunt ex eis penetrantes usque ad iuncturam coxae, et usque ad nodum caudae.	And they are from them those who penetrate up to the hip joint, and up to the tail of the horse.
Ex eo autem quo cognoscitur Fistula penetrans usque ad anum, etiam a non penetrante, est, ut intromittas digitum tuum indicem in anum: et intromittas tentam subtilem in Fistulam ex aere, aut ferro: quando non est tortuositas.	But from this where the fistula is recognized penetrating up to the anus, and also not penetrating, that is, when you put your index finger in the anus: and you put a very small tent in the fistula of brass or iron: when there is no curvature.
Quod si in ea est tortuositas, tunc intromitte in eam tentam ex plumbo subtilem, aut pilum ex pilis equarum, donec sentias tentam, aut pilum in digito tuo.	That if there is a curvature in it, then put in it a tent of small brass, or a nail from horses' hooves, until you feel the tent, or a nail in your finger.
Quod si non sentis ipsam penitus, neque procedit ex foramine aliquid ex egestione, neque uentositas, neque uermis sicut dixi: tunc scias, quia est non penetrans: propera ergo ad curationem.	That if you do not feel it hot, and there does not come out anything from the hole of discharge, and no curvature, and not rough as I have said: then you will know that it is not penetrating: so get better.
Et quando Fistula est penetrans usque ad uesicam, aut ad meatum urinae: tunc significatio eius est exitus urinae ex ea, et prohibitio eius ab hoc ut consolidetur locus cum medicinis.	And when the fistula is penetrating up to the ischium, or up to the pubic bone: then the meaning of it is the discharge of urine from it, and its prohibition from this so that the place with medicine hardens.
Si uero est penetrans usque ad iuncturam coxae, aut ad os coxae: tunc signum eius est, quod perueniat tenta usque illuc, si non est in ea tortuositas usque ad os: et inuentio doloris in circumitu partis, et quod egreditur pus ex ea semper: et quod non ualeat in ea medicatio, neque consolidatur cum unguento.	But if it is penetrating up to the hip joint, or up to the socket of the hip: then its sign is that it reaches the tent as far as there is no curvature up to the socket: and the finding of pain around the part, and that it is always discharged pus from it: and that it does not dry in it with ointment, and hardens with medicine.
Et in istis Fistulis omnibus penetrantibus non est curatio omnino: et curatio earum est labor et uanitas ei, ex stultis medicis, super quem formatur.	And in these fistulas all those who penetrate have no cure at all: and the cure of them is work and vanity from foolish doctors, on whom a form is created.
In illa autem quae non est penetrans, et non antiqua, speratur sanatio cum serro: secundum quod ego narro tibi, et ego iam probaui: et est, ut iaceat infirmus inter manus tuas super dorsum suum: et eleua crura eius usque supra coxas ipsius, et coxae eius sint inclinatae ad uentrem ipsius.	But in that which is not penetrating, and is not old, there is hope of cure with a knife: for I tell you, and I have already proved it: and it is as if the sick person lies between your hands on his back: and you wash the back of him up to above his knees, and his knees are bent towards his belly.
Deinde intromittetentam plumbi, aut aeris, si est in Fistula tortuositas, donec scias ubi peruenit tenta.	Then let him introduce the lead or air into the fistula until he knows where the loop enters.
Si autem sentit eam infirmus circa anum, tunc oportet ut intromittas digitum tuum indicem in anum.	If however he feels it weak around a certain part, then you should put your finger as an indicator in that part.
Si ergo sentis in digito tuo tentam iam penetrasse per seipsam detectam, praeter quod sentias inter digitum tuum, et inter ipsum sifac, aut carnem: tunc ergo scias certe, quia est penetrans: non ergo labores in ea, quoniam non est eius sanatio, sicut diximus.	If then you feel a certain sensation in your finger that it has already penetrated into itself by passing through the skin, and not only between your finger and the skin, or the flesh: so then you know for sure that it is penetrating: do not therefore worry about it, because it is not a cure, as we have said.
Dixerunt tamen, quia sanatur in quibusdam hominibus caro, et ex medicatione qua ei speratur iuuamentum, est, ut ignias cauterium subtile secundum amplitudinem Fistulae, sicut praecessit, et intromittas ipsum ignitum in Fistulam, donec perueniat circa anum.	They said, However, that in some people it heals with flesh and from the treatment that they hoped for a cure, that is, to light small fires of cauterization according to the width of the fistula, as above, and let him introduce the lit fire into the fistula until he reaches a certain part.
Deinde itera illud bis, aut ter, donec scias, quia iam adustae sunt omnes illae carnes additae filtratae, quae sunt similes cannulae pennae auis.	Then repeat that a couple of times or three times until you know that all the added fillet flesh has been burned, which is similar to a feather-like canal:
Deinde cura illud cum liciniis inuolutis in butyro, donec egrediantur illae carnes, quae adustae sunt: deinde cura illud cum unguentis generantibus carnem et consolidantibus.	Then the care with liniments to rub in butter, until the flesh comes out, which has been burned: then the care with oils that generate flesh and solidify it.
Si ergo sanatur, bonum est.	If then he is healed, it is good.
Et si non, tunc non sanatur cum alia curatione unquam.	And if not, then he does not heal with any other treatment.
Et si egreditur tenta, et non peruenerit usque ad digitum tuum, qui est in ano, et est inter ipsum et tentam uelamen spissum ex carne, aut sifac: et uides Fistulam in eo quod sequitur superficiem cutis, tunc seca cutem ab initio Fistulae, et tu uadis secando cum tenta quod est in fistula, donec perueniat secatio ubi peruenit tentae extremitas, et liberatur tenta et cadit.	And if it comes out and does not reach as far as your finger which is in the anus, and is between the skin and the loop: and you see a fistula running along the surface of the skin: then dry off the skin from the beginning of the fistula, and you see drying what is in the fistula until it reaches where the end of the loop comes out, and the loop comes out and falls.
Deinde mundifica illas carnes filtratas, quae assimilantur cannulae pennae auis, ut non remaneat ex eis aliquid.	Then clean off those fillet flesh which are like feather-like canals so that nothing remains of them.
Si autem uincit te sanguis, et soluit inter te et inter operationem tuam ut seces illas carnes: tunc melius quod fit, et uelocioris iuuamenti, cauterizare eam cum igne, aut cum medicina acuta.	If however blood overcomes you and dissolves between you and the operation so that it separates those flesh: then it is better that it happens, and faster in its recovery, to cauterize it with fire, or with sharp medicine.
Quoniam cauterium cum igne aggregat habitudines bonas, adustionem illarum carnium additarum, et abscisionem sanguinis, et exiccationem humiditatum.	For the cauterization, since it gathers good habits with fire, to the burning of their flesh, and to the cutting off of blood, and drying up of moisture.
Deinde cura illud cum liciniis inuolutis in butyro, aut caulibus tritis, donec locus emittat pus, et egrediantur illae carnes adustae in pus.	Then that care with the liniments of wine in butter, or triturated caul-pieces, until the place lets out pus, and those meats dry up in the pus.
Deinde cura tunc uulnus cum unguentis consolidatiuis, generantibus carnem duram: et sunt medicinae in quibus sunt stipticitas et exiccatio.	Then care then for that wound with consolidating ointments, which make the flesh hard: and there are medicines wherein are septicitis and drying up.
Nam quando restaurantur, tunc iam sanatur: et non times iterationem.	For when they begin to heal, then they are healed already: and do not put off repetition.
Si autem Fistula iam peruenit usque ad profundum ani, et elongatur a superfluitate corporis: tunc intromitte digitum tuum in anum, et inquire cum eo.	But if the fistula has already reached as far as the hip-bone, and has elongated from the excess of the body's fluid: then introduce your hand into the canal, and ask it.
Si ergo sentis tentam, et inter te, et inter eam est uelamen ex sifac, aut carne, et est propinqua penetrationi: tunc non est operatio in illo, nisi secundum uiam fiduciae et spei.	But if you feel the attempt, and between you and it is a wound of sinew, or of flesh, and is near to penetration: then there is no operation in that, unless after a second time of trust and hope.
Quod est, quia administratur in eo unus trium modorum: aut ut cauterizes ipsam, sicut diximus: aut seces eam, donec consequaris concauitatem eius, ut sit possibile tibi intromittere licinia, et curationem ex proximo.	That is, for there are two ways of dealing with it: either as we have said, to cauterize it, or to separate it, until you obtain the desired concavity, so that you may be able to introduce liniment, and cure from near at hand.
Et non procedas multum cum sectione, ut non incidas lacertum continentem anum, et accidat super infirmum exitus egestionis absque uoluntate.	And do not proceed far with the section, lest you should fall upon a lizard that keeps a certain fastness, and chance to happen upon an unwanted exit of exhaustion.
Deinde cura illud cum eo quod diximus.	Then care for that with what we have said.
Fortasse enim sanabitur: aut elonges ipsum uelamen, et mundes ipsum postquam secas ipsum usque prope anum, sicut diximus, aut cum tenta, aut cum instrumento alio acutae extremitatis.	Perhaps it will be healed: or it may lengthen the wound, and dry up that which is before you, as we have said, or with an attempt, or with another acute instrument.
Deinde mundifica illas carnes filtratas quae sunt in sectione, usque ubi potes cum perscrutatione.	Then cleanse those meats that are filthy, which are in the section, until you can reach them with examination.
Deinde conare restaurationem uulneris totius cum sectione, et orificio superiore ubi consolidatur: et remanet Fistula aperta in interiore parte anus, et erit leuius super infirmum.	Then endeavor to repair the wound of all the body with the section, and examine where it is consolidated: and there remains an open fistula in the interior part of the anus, which will be lighter on infirmity.
Et quandoque suitur Fistula secundum hunc modum: et est, quando intromittis tentam in Fistulam: et est in latere ani circa superficiem corporis cum cute et margine ani: tunc accipe tentam perforatae extremitatis, quae est sicut acus aleskef, id est, praeparantium coria, secundum hanc formam.	And sometimes a fistula is followed in this way: and that is when you insert a probe into the fistula; and it is on one side of the anus near the surface of the body with skin and margin of the anus: then take hold of the extreme end of the pierced, which is like a needle's eye, that is, the corium, prepared in this form.
Et intromitte in eam filum inuolutum ex quinque filis, et circiter ea.	And insert into it a thread wound around five fils, and all around it.
Deinde intromitte tentam cum filo in Fistulam, donec consequatur concauitatem eius.	Then insert the probe with a thread into the fistula until you feel its convexity.
Si ergo est penetrans in margine ani interius prope, tunc extrahe filum ex illo foramine: ita ut intromittas digitum tuum in anum, et extrahas extremitatem fili, et aggreges duas extremitates simul: et stringe utramque, et dimitte illud die uno, aut duobus diebus: et quanto plus incidit filum in carne, stringe ipsum bene, donec incidantur illae carnes quae sunt inter duas extremitates fili, et cadant: deinde cura uulnus, donec consolidetur, et sanetur.	If therefore it penetrates into the margin of the anus near, then remove the thread from that hole: so that you can insert your finger in the anus, and remove the end of the thread, and gather the two ends together: and tighten them well, so that they are released one day or two days: and as much as the thread penetrates into the flesh, tighten it well until those muscles which are between the two ends of the thread fall away: then take care of the wound, until it heals and is cured.
Si autem orificium Fistulae non est penetrans: tunc fac ipsum penetrare quocunque modo praeparatur tibi, nisi sit in profundo multum.	If however the hole of the fistula does not penetrate: then make it so that it penetrates in any way you prepare it for yourself, unless it is in deep places.
Non enim inest tibi, ut facias illud propter lacertum, ut non incidas ipsum.	For indeed it is not good for you, to make it because of the snake, so that you do not fall on it.
Deinde fac cum ea sicut diximus, donec sanetur.	Then do with it as we have said, until it is cured.
Forma Spatumilis spinosi quo finditur Fistula, cuius curuitas est acuta ualde, et pars altera est non acuta, ut non incidat illud quod non est necesse, sicut uides.	The shape of the needle-shaped thing which is found in the fistula, whose curvature is acute keenly, and one side is not acute, so that it does not hurt what does not need to be done, as you see.
¶ De sutura Hemorroidarum, ex quibus currit sanguis ex incisione earum: et cura fissurarum.	From the suture of hemorrhoids, from which runs blood from the cut of them: and take care of the tears.
Caput LXXXI.	Chapt. LXXXI.
Sunt Hemorroides secundum duos modos.	There are hemorrhoids after two ways.
Aut enim sunt intra anum, similes uesicis carbonum, uel prunarum: aut quasi ipsae sint grana uuae.	For they are either within the anus, similar to coal of wood, or like grain of corn: or almost like pease-grains.
Et ex eis sunt paruae, et magnae: et sanguis currit ex eis semper, et est una, et sunt multae.	And from them are small ones and great; and blood flows out of them always, and it is one, and there are many.
Et sunt extra anum, et in extremitatibus eius.	And outside of the navel, and at the extremities of it.
Verumtamen istae quae sunt extra anum, sunt secundum plurimum paucae humiditatis, ex quibus currit aqua citrina, aut parum sanguinis cursu assiduo: et sunt secundum colorem corporis.	But these that are outside the navel, are according to the most part few humors, from which runs water yellow, or a little blood in an anxious course: and they are according to the color of the body.
Et curatio eius quae est intra anum, est, ut praecipias infirmo ut assellet: et exprimatur, donec egrediatur anus, et appareant athelil tibi.	And the cure that is within the navel, is, as you order to the sick person that he should make himself weak: and it is expressed, until it comes out from the anus, and appears to thee a little thick fluid.
Propterea ergo et suspende cum uncinis: aut tene eos cum ungue tuo.	Therefore therefore hang with a hook: or hold them with your fingernail.
Deinde incide eos apud radices suas.	Then cut them by the roots.
Si autem non retinentur in eis uncini, propter humiditatem eorum et ipsorum mollificationem: tunc cape eos cum panno aspero, aut cum coto ex diploide lanea, et extrahe eos cum digitis tuis.	But if they do not retain them in them hooks, because of their moisture and their own softeness: then take them with a rough cloth, or with a twig of linden-tree, and draw them out with your fingers.
Deinde incide eos, et pulueriza super eos post incisionem quosdam pulueres calidos, ut stent eis loco cauterii.	Then cut them and sprinkle on them after the cut some hot powders that will keep them in place as a cautery.
Aut cauteriza eos secundum quod praecessit in capitulo cauterizandi.	Or cauterize them according to what has preceded in the chapter of cauterizing.
Deinde cura eos cum reliqua curatione, donec sanentur.	Then care for them with the rest of the cure, until they are cured.
Quod si non obedit anus egressioni, tunc clisteriza infirmum clisteri in quo sit mordicatio parua, ut lauetur cum eo quod est in ano, et obediat egressioni uelociter, quando exprimit se infirmus.	That if the anus does not comply to come out, then prepare the sick person with a small clister that will be like a little mordercation to him, that it may be wet with what is in the anus, and comply to come out quickly, when it comes out the sick person.
Si autem athelil sunt extrinseci ab ano, tunc res eorum est leuis, facilis: et est ut capias eos cum ungue tuo, aut capias eos cum uncino, et incidas eos.	But if the athelial are drawn out from the anus, then their affair is light and easy: and it is as if you take them with your fingernail, or take them with a hook, and cut them off.
Deinde cura eos cum eo quod diximus, donec sanentur.	Then care for them with that which I have said, until they are cured.
Et qui abhorret incisionem cum ferro, tunc oportet ut administres suturam eorum secundum hunc modum.	And who hates cutting with a sharp iron, then it is necessary to administer a sutura to them in this manner.
Accipe filum inuolutum, et intromitte ipsum in acum.	Take the fillet and insert it into the cavity.
Deinde extrahe athelil ad superiora, et fac ipsum penetrare cum acu in radice eius ex parte altera: et inuolue duas extremitates fili, in inferiori parte acus, et sint latitudinaliter: et stringe athelil strictura forti.	Then remove the thistle from above and insert an aiguille with a point on the left side of its root; make the two ends of the fillet cross each other, at the lower part of the aiguille, and let them be parallel to each other; and tighten the thistle strongly with a strong ligature.
Deinde noda filum, et extrahe acum.	Then mark the fillet, and remove the cavity.
Fac illud cum omnibus athelil, et dimitte ex eis unum: nec suas ipsum, ut currat ex eo superfluitas sanguinis.	Make it with all the thistles, and leave one; do not take your own flesh, so that there is no excess of blood.
Deinde pone super anum pannum infusum in oleo rosato, aut caeroto, et pone ipsum super anum: et praecipe infirmo, ut quiescat.	Then put it on a cloth soaked in oil or olive oil and put it on the patient; and order the sick person to lie down.
Deinde dimitte ipsum, donec cadat.	Then remove the cloth, until he falls.
Cum ergo cadunt athelil, cura eos cum unguentis, et reliqua curatione, donec sanentur.	When the thistles fall, take care of them with ointment, and with the rest of the cure, until they are healed.
¶ De cura Fissurarum.	§ On the treatment of fissures.
Multotiens enim accidunt ex exiccatione stercoris, et constrictione naturae.	For often a dry stool and nature's contraction cause problems.
Cum ergo antiquantur, et non ualet in eis medicina: tunc oportet ut radas cum puncta Spatumilis, aut cum ungue tuo, donec fiant humidae, et auferatur ab eis cortex superior qui prohibet eas a consolidatione.	When they are old and do not respond to treatment: then you should shave them with the scalpel of Salivula, or with your own finger, until they are wet, and remove the upper crust that prevents them from being consolidated.
Deinde cura eas, donec consolidentur secundum quod oportet.	Then take care of them, until they are consolidated, for which it is necessary to apply a medicine with a string, or a ligature, so that it holds them together.
Si autem non consolidantur: tunc itera eas cum rasione uehementiori quam prima, donec sanguinentur multum, et excorientur deinde cura eas, donec sanentur.	If they do not consolidate: then shave them again with a sharper razor than before, until they bleed profusely, and then take care of them until they are healed.
¶ De curatione Almirmar inuersorum, et non inuersorum: et Athelil siccorum, et Formicae.	§ On the treatment of scurvy (scurvy) and not on the treatment of scurvy (cough): and for thistle (flea) and moth.
Caput LXXXII.	Chapter LIII.
Scias quod Almirmar non est nisi nodus rotundus secundum colorem corporis, similis capiti claui: et fit in toto corpore, praecipue in inferioribus partibus pedum, et digitis: et accidit ex eis dolor apud ambulationem.	You should know that scurvy is a round knot of the color of the body, similar to the head of an axe; and it is found throughout the whole body, especially in the lower parts of the feet and toes; and it causes pain on walking.
Oportet ergo ut secetur quod est in circumitu claui, et teneatur cum forficibus, aut cum uncino, et eradicetur ex radice sua.	It is necessary therefore that he should be cut out, what is in the situation of the claw, and be held with forceps, or with a hook, and be removed from its root.
Deinde cura illud: et si uis cauteriza illud secundum quod praecessit in capitulo suo.	Then care for that: and if you wish to cauterize that according to what precedes in his chapter.
Ex athelil autem siccis unus est eminentia parua, aspera, filtrata, rotunda supra superficiem corporis.	From the flesh there is one small eminence, rough, strained, round over the surface of the body.
Et multotiens accidunt in manibus puerorum.	And often it occurs in the hands of boys.
Et curatio eius est, ut extendas athelil, et incidas ipsum: aut stringas ipsum cum filo de serico: aut cum pilo, donec cadat.	And the cure of that is, that you should stretch out the eminence, and strike it: or stretch it with silk thread: or with hair, until it falls off.
Et si uis, cauteriza ipsum secundum quod praemissum est cum igne, aut cum medicina acuta: et iam eradicantur athelil inuersi, et non inuersi cum instrumento quod ego dicam.	And if you wish, cauterize the eminence according to what has been preceded with fire, or with acute medicine: and already the eminences immersed, and not immersed with an instrument that I call:
Formica autem est etiam eminentia parua filtrata, grossa, super superficiem corporis, uadens in profundum ualde: et quando inuenit eam frigus, sentitur in ea simile mordicationi formicae, et fit in corpore toto: et plurimum eius fit in manibus.	The ant however is also a small eminence, strained, thick, over the surface of the body, which runs into the depth far away: and when it comes to feel cold, it feels on it a kind of stinging of an ant, and becomes all over the body: and most of it is made in the hands.
Et curatio eius est, ut accipias cannulam ex penna anseris, aut penna uulturis forti: et pone illam cannulam super Formicam, donec contineat circulus cannulae ex partibus eius.	And the cure of that is, that you should take a tube from the feather of a duck, or a strong quail's feather: and put that tube over the ant, until it holds a circle of the tube from its parts.
Deinde reuolue manum tuam cum cannula, donec seces quod est in circumitu Formicae: et ponas eam in profundo carnis, et eradices Formicam ex radice eius.	Then turn your hand with the tube, until you separate what is in the situation of the ant: and put that in the depth of the flesh, and remove the ant from its root.
Et si uis, fac illud cum cannula aeris, aut ferri, secundum hanc formam.	And if you wish, do it with an air-tube, or a iron-tube, according to this form.
Sit superius cannulae ad sublimitatem trahens surdum inuolutum, ut alleuietur super digitum apprehensio eius et ipsius reuolutio.	Let the tube be placed above the limit, dragging a hard-covered finger, to avoid pain while turning the grip of it and its rotation.
Et si uis cauteriza Formicam secundum quod praemissum est in cauterizatione Athelil in capitulo de cauterio.	And if you wish, cauterize the ant according to what has been preceded in cauterizing Athelil in the chapter on cauterization.
¶ De formis Instrumentorum quae administrantur ad Clisteria in aegritudinibus Ani, et solutionis uentris, et colicae.	On the forms of instruments used for enemas to treat ailments of the rectum, and for washing away urine and colic.
Caput LXXXIII.	Chapter LXVIII. On the forms of instruments used for enemas to treat ailments
Quandoque Clistere fit ex argento, aut ex aurichalco, aut ex aere fuso, aut malleato.	When clistic enemas are made from silver, or from gold-plated brass, or from cast iron, or from hammered bronze.
Et quandoque fit ex istis Instrumentis paruum, et magnum, secundum illos in quibus administrantur.	And when they are made from these small or large instruments, depending on the nature of those in which they are administered.
Illud ergo quod administratur in curatione puerorum paruorum, sit paruum: et quorum ani sunt debiles, aut dolorosi, sic et clisteria eorum.	Therefore what is administered to the cure of young boys who are small should be small, and those whose rectums are weak or sore, their enemas should be like them.
Clistere magnum.	A large enema.
Cistere paruum.	A small enema.
Canna eius, id est, caput superius in quo ligatur uter, sit amplum secundum hunc modum: et sit ei distinctio ut ligetur uter sicut uides, et extremitas eius inferior quae intromittitur in anum, sit surda, id est, non aperta, lenis, ualde, trahens ad subtilitatem: et in uno laterum eius sint duo foramina, et in latere altero foramen unum.	The shaft of the instrument, that is to say, the upper part in which the uterine is tied, should be wide according to this manner: and let there be a distinction so that it is tied as you see, and the lower extremity which enters into the pelvis, let it be closed, that is, not open, gentle, very much, pulling towards subtility: and on one side of its shaft there are two openings, and on the other side one opening.
Et sit amplitudo foraminis secundum grossitudinem radiorum, et grossius parum, et sit uter in quo ponuntur medicinae ex uesica animalis: aut ex charta ouis, quae sit secundum formam asofrati paruae: cuius radix sit palmus unus.	And let the width of the opening be according to the thickness of the radii, and the thickness less, and let the uterine in which the medicines are placed be of a dry animal's skin: or of a piece of paper which is according to the form of an envelope, small; whose root is a palm.
Et perforetur foraminibus multis sicut reuoluitur, et sit spacium quod est inter omne foramen grossitudo digiti.	And let multiple openings be pierced as it were, and let there be space between each opening the width of a finger.
Deinde intromitte in illa foramina filum forte ex filo crudo, quod sit ex decem filis, aut circiter ea, et aggrega cum eo utrem sicut asofrati.	Then insert into those openings a strong filament from raw silk, which should be from ten threads, or about them, and bind it with the others so that it is like an envelope.
Cum ergo ponitur in eo uter, stringatur in capite clisteris inter duo distinguentia constrictione forti.	When therefore it is placed in this uterine, let it be pulled at the head of the enema between two distinguishing marks with a strong constriction.
Deinde clisteriza cum eo.	Then wash out with it.
Et haec est forma circuli utris hic depicta, et foraminum.	And this is the shape of the uterus here depicted and of the openings.
Qualitas autem clisterizandi cum eo, est: ut impleas utrem, aut uesicam ex medicina, quae sit calefacta secundum quantitatem tolerantiae infirmi: et caue ne sit calida ualde, aut frigida ualde.	The quality of the poultice to be used with it is this: that it may fill the wound, or dry up the pus from the medicine which has been heated according to the tolerance of the nurse; and let it not be too hot or too cold.
Deinde resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum, et eleuet crura sua ad superiora: et pone sub eo inthaan, id est, corium super quod iacent homines, aut linteamen.	Then the sick person shall lie on his back, and raise his legs to the upper side; and put something under him, that is, leather over which men lie, or a blanket.
Deinde inunge extremitatem Clisteris cum oleo, aut cum albugine oui, aut cum mucillagine foenugraeci, aut similium.	Then he shall smear the extremity with oil, or with alum, or with mukilage of fenugreek, or similar substances.
Deinde intromitte ipsum in anum cum facilitate.	Then insert him into the wound with ease.
Deinde accipiat minister utrem cum duabus manibus suis simul, et exprimat ipsum cum uehementia, donec euacuet totum quod est in Clisteri in intestinum.	Then let the assistant take both of his hands and squeeze it with force until all that is in the poultice has been discharged into the wound.
Deinde extrahe Clistere, et eleuet infirmus crura sua ad parietem.	Then remove the poultice, and raise the legs of the sick person towards the wall.
Quod si medicina cogit eum ad exitum, tunc teneat quantum potest.	If the medicine considers him to have exited, then hold on as long as you can.
Et si dormit cum ea nocte tota, est magis ultimum in iuuamento.	And if he sleeps all night with it on, it is more effective in healing.
Si autem clisterizas eum in aegritudinibus solutionis uentris, et festinat exitus eius: tunc itera clistere, donec sanetur.	But if you apply the poultice to a wound of the lower limbs and the discharge is rapid: then change the poultice again until the wound is healed.
Quod si in ano sunt hemorroides, aut apostemata laedentia, tunc sit clistere subtile ualde, lene, ex clisteribus quibus clisterizantur pueri.	If there are hemorrhoids or itching warts, then put a very mild poultice, soft as it were, from the poultices with which you poultice the boys.
Et haec sit forma clisteris subtilis super quod sit stricta cutis.	And this should be the form of a mild poultice, on top of which is a tight skin.
¶ De curatione Vulnerum capitis sine fractura ossis.	A chapter on the treatment of wounds on the head without fracture of the bone.
Caput LXXXIIII.	Chapter LIII.
Iam dixi in diuisione de curatione uulnerum quod conueniebat libro, et ego dicam hic curationem eorum cum manu, et cum medicinis secundum complementum.	I have already spoken in the division of the treatment of wounds which concerned the book, and I now speak here of their treatment with the hand, and with medicines according to the second principle.
Dico ergo, quod uulnera diuersificantur secundum illud quo fiunt uulnera, et secundum locum super quem cadit uulnus.	I say, therefore, that wounds differ according to the site from which they originate, and according to the place on which they fall.
Res ergo quibus fiunt uulnera multotiens, sunt sicut iactus lapidis: aut incisio ensis, aut cultelli: aut percussio cum lancea, aut ligno, aut sagitta: et similibus illis ex rebus multis.	Therefore, the wounds that are often made are like a stone's impact: or a cut with a sword, or a knife; or a blow with a spear, or a piece of wood, or an arrow; and many similar things.
Vulnera autem quae fiunt secundum loca corporis sunt, sicut uulnus quod cadit super caput, aut collum, aut pectus, aut uentrem, aut epar: et similia ex eis membris.	But wounds that are made according to the places of the body are like a limb that falls on the head, or the neck, or the chest, or the abdomen, or the bowels; and many similar things from among the limbs.
Et ego sum narrans curationes quorundam uulnerum, ut ponam eam ratiocinationem et regulam super reliqua uulnera.	And I am telling about some cures of wounds, so that I may put forth reason and rule concerning the remaining wounds.
Et ego incipiam a uulneribus capitis simplicibus: quoniam rememoratio compositorum ueniet in principio capituli tertii.	And I will begin with simple wounds of the head: since the memory of the composers will come at the beginning of Chapter Three.
Dico ergo.	I say:
Quando accidit in capite uulnus simplex, et non est fractura ossis: considera tunc, si est ex iactu lapidis, aut ei similibus, et iam fregit cutem tantum: et est uulnus magnum, et times super infirmum euentum apostematis calidi: tunc propera, et phlebotoma cephalicam statim: et non tardes illud: et extrahe ei ex sanguine secundum quantitatem uirtutis eius: si non fuerit prohibens aliquid a phlebotomia, praecipue si fuerit sanguis qui egreditur ex uulnere paucus.	I say: When there has happened in the head a simple wound, and there is no fracture of the bone: then, if it is from an impact of a stone, or something similar, and it has already broken the skin only a little: and it is a great wound, and you fear for the outcome of the inflammation that will come: then approach, and immediately perform cephalic phlebotomy: and do not delay that: and extract therefrom according to the quantity of its virtue: if it should not forbid phlebotomy, especially if it should be blood that comes out from the wound in little quantities.
Et sit phlebotomia ex contrario partis uulneratae.	And let phlebotomy take place on the opposite side of the wounded part.
Et caueat infirmus sibi a repletione, et uino, et cibis grossis.	And let the sick person abstain from drinking, and wine, and coarse food.
Si autem minutionem prohibet aliquid, tunc minoretur ex cibo, et non appropinquet carnibus, neque uinis.	But if some restraint prevents him, then he should decrease from food, and do not approach meat, nor wine.
Et pone super uulnus si accidit ei apostema calidum, cotum infusum in oleo rosato solo, aut cum uino in quo est stipticitas.	And place on the wound if it should happen that there is a warm aposteme, a liquid infusion in oil of rosewater alone, or with wine in which there is a styptic.
Si autem securus fueris ab apostemate calido, tunc pone super uulnus, si est recens cum sanguine suo, et non mutauit ipsum aer, puluerem quem ego narrabo post paululum: et si iam mutauit ipsum aer, tunc pone super ipsum quaedam unguenta, donec sanetur.	But if you are safe from a warm aposteme, then place on the wound if it is still young with its own blood, and has not changed the air, the powder that I will tell you about later: and if it has already changed the air, then place on it some balm, until it is healed.
Si autem uulnus est magnum, aut est ex incisione ensis, et similium: et non aggregantur labia eius per puluillos, tunc aggrega ipsa cum sutura, secundum quod ego narrabo in uulneribus uentris de sutura eorum.	If the fracture is large, or if there has been an incision, and they are similar: and their lips are not gathered together by pullies, then gather them together with stitches, as I shall relate concerning the wounds of the hand regarding the stitches.
Si autem uulnus iam detectum est ab osse, et pendet, et non est retentio eius, nisi in suspensorio paruo: tunc incide ipsum.	If the fracture has already been detected and is hanging from the bone, and there is no retention of it except by a small suspender: then incise him.
Deinde cura uulnus cum medicinis, et restaura in eo carnem duram loco cutis, et praecipe infirmo, ut alatur cibis in quibus est grossitudo, sicut sunt capita, et triticum coctum, donec sit ut puls: et eis similia.	Then the care of the fracture with medicines, and restore in it hard flesh at the place of skin, and order the sick person to eat food in which there is thickness, such as are heads, and cooked wheat, until it is like a pulse: and let them eat it.
Quod si inuenis in cute putrefactionem, et non adhaeret ossi: tunc incide putrefactum totum, et proiice ipsum: deinde cura illud.	That if an injury is in the skin and does not adhere to the bone: then incise the whole putrefied thing and throw it away: and then take care of that.
Si autem in his uulneribus est arteria, aut uena ex qua fluit sanguis: et non abscinditur per medicinas, tunc inquire super arteriam.	If there is an artery in these wounds, or a new one from which blood flows: and it does not stop by medicine, then inquire about the artery.
Si ergo inuenis eam non sectam, tunc seca eam cum Spatumili, aut liga eam.	But if you do not cut the injury, then dry it with Spatem or bind it.
Quod si necessitas prouocat quando non confert illud quod diximus, tunc cauteriza eam, donec abscindatur sanguis.	That if necessity compels you when you do not confer what I have said, then cauterize it, until the blood stops flowing.
Si autem uulnera ista sunt parua, simplicia, tunc res eorum est facilis, leuis: ita ut puluerizes super ea hunc puluerem: quoniam consolidat ea antequam mutet ea aer.	But if these wounds are small and simple, then the matter of them is easy and light: so that you put dust on them, this dust: for they are consolidated before they change them with air.
¶ Modus Pulueris incarnatiui.	The method of powder for incised wound.
Recipe olibani partem unam, et sanguinis draconis partes duas, et calcis non extinctae partes tres: teratur totum multum, et cribelletur: et impleatur ex eo uulnus, et constringatur constrictione bona, donec adhaereat super ipsum bene, et coaguletur cum sanguine.	Take a part of olive oil, and two parts of dragon's blood, and three parts of non-extinguished lime: mix them all together well, and filter them: and fill it with the wound, and constrict it with good constriction, until it adheres well to the flesh, and is coagulated with blood.
Deinde stringe ipsum desuper cum puluillis, et dimitte ipsum, neque soluas ipsum dum permanet, ita quod non apostemetur.	Then bind him from above with powder, and leave him, and do not remove him until it is stable, so that it does not come loose.
Nam non eradicatur ab eo medicina, donec sanatur.	But until he has recovered his health, let not medicine be eradicated from him.
Et quandoque facit illud calx sola, quando non sunt tibi in praesenti olibanum, et sanguis draconis etiam facit eandem operationem in multis ex uulneribus magnis, quando conuenit ut ponatur super ea et stringantur, et sunt uulnera recentia cum sanguine suo, quae non alterauit aer.	And when that calx has been made alone by itself, when you do not have olive oil with you at the moment, and even dragon's blood makes the same operation on many large wounds, when it is placed upon it and pressed down on it, and there are recent wounds with their own blood, which he did not change
Quod si iam alterauit ea aer quadam alteratione, praecipue quando est in tempore aestatis, tunc non est in positione huius pulueris intentio: cura ergo ipsum cum eo quod diximus, ita ut ponas super ea quaedam unguenta digestiua: aut ponas super ea pultes ex farina hordei, factas cum aqua et melle, donec emittant pus.	which I changed it somewhat by air especially when it is in the time of summer, then it is not in the position of this powder's intention: so take care of him with that which we have said, so that you put on it some digestible ointment: or put on it a poultice made from barley flour, made with water and honey, until it discharges pus.
Deinde cura ea reliqua curatione, donec sanentur.	Then take care of the rest with the cure, until they are healed.
Si uero accidat cum uulnere fractura in osse, et est parua, tunc extrahe illud cum Gesti: et ego iam dicam curationem fracturarum capitis in eo quod futurum est.	If it is broken with a fracture in the bone and it is small, then remove it with Gesti: and I have already said the cure for fractures of the head in that which will happen.
¶ De uulneribus Colli.	For the wounds of the neck.
Caput LXXXV.	Chapter LXXV: On the wounds of the neck
SI Autem uulnus accidat in Collo, tunc non est inter ipsum differentia in medicatione, et inter uulnus capitis quando est simplex.	If a wound has occurred in the neck, then there is no difference between it and the cure, and there is no difference between the wound of the head when it is simple.
Si autem iam incisus est neruus Colli, aut arteria: tunc si est neruus, non est in eo ingenium, nisi ut deuitetur curatio eius cum eo quod facit stipticitatem uehementem, sicut ziniar, et zegi, et eis similia.	But if a cut has already occurred in the nerve of the neck, or an artery: then if it is a nerve, there is no skill in it, unless it is cured with a bitter stinging as with the zinnia and with healing poultices and with similar things.
Quoniam nocent neruis, et contrahunt eos.	For they are harmful to nerves, and turn them back.
Et non ponas super uulnus aliquid frigidum omnino: quoniam substantia neruorum est frigida, et continuatio eius est cum cerebro, quod est sublimius membrorum: et sit illud quo curatur ex medicinis lene, sicut calx lota cum aqua dulci aliquotiens infusa cum oleo, aut cum oleo rosato, et tuthia, quando abluitur etiam cum aqua dulci: et reliqui lapides minerales, secundum hunc modum, et unguenta humida.	And do not put on any cold thing at all on a wound: for the substance of nerves is cold, and its continuance is with the brain, which is higher than the members: and let that be put on which cures with linden-wax, sometimes diluted with sweet water and oil, or with rose-oil, and theriac, when it is washed also with sweet water: and other mineral stones, according to this way, and moist ointments.
Si autem uulnus est magnum, tunc administra suturam: aut coarta labia eius cum puluillis.	If the fracture is large, then administer suturing; or, cover his lips with powder.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then take care of him, until he recovers.
Si uero uulneri est profunditas, aut accidit in eo sinus in inferiori parte eius, in quo iam aggregatur pus, tunc perfora ipsum in magis depresso loco in eo.	If, however, the wound is deep, or an abscess has already formed in the lower part of it, where there is already pus, then pierce it at a slightly depressed point.
Quod si iam incisa est in uulnere arteria, et consecutus est sanguinem eius fluxus: tunc separa, uel seca eam, et liga ipsam: aut cauteriza eam, si prouocat necessitas ad illud.	What if the artery in the forearm has already been cut and blood is flowing from it? Then separate, dry up, and bind it; or, if necessity requires, caustic it.
Si autem iam incidit spondiles gutturis, aut totum, et saluatae sunt alhaudegi: tunc aggrega labia cutis cum sutura super cannam gutturis, et non tangas guttur, imo aequa ipsum, et reduc ipsum super figuram naturalem.	If, however, he has been bitten by a snake and the wound is only on one side, and it seems that he will recover: then sew his lips together with thread over the wound, and do not touch the wound, but reduce it to its natural shape.
Deinde stringe ipsum strictura decenti, et dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot.	Then bind him tightly with a bandage, and let him go for several days.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguentis in quibus est stipticitas et exiccatio, donec sanetur.	Then take care of him with ointments, until he recovers.
Si autem uulnus iam fecit impressionem in osse, tunc perquire ipsum: tunc si in ipso sunt fragmenta ossis, extrahe ea omnia, aut quae potes ex eis: et quod non praeparatur, dimitte illud, donec putrescat uulnus, et separetur et alleuietur egressio eius.	If the fracture has already made an impression on the bone, then examine it; if there are any bone fragments, remove them all, or as many as you can: and if it is not prepared, leave it, until the bone rottens, and separates and comes out from the sides.
Quod si uulnus fuerit recens, tunc pulueriza super ipsum puluerem quem narraui.	What if the fracture is recent? Then powder it with powder which you have scattered over it.
Si autem uidetur in uulnere os, et fit Fistula: tunc cura ipsam cum eo cuius rememoratio uenit in capitulo suo.	If the limb is twisted and a fistula has formed: then take care of it with that which comes to mind in his own chapter.
¶ De uulnere in Spatulis.	The Arm in Spades.
Caput LXXXVI.	Chapter LXVIII. On the Arm.
SI Est percussio lanceae, aut cultelli: et uides eius profunditatem, tunc considera.	If the impact is from a spear or a knife, and you can see the depth of the wound, then examine it carefully.
Si ergo ex uulnere egreditur uentositas, quando anhelat ex eo infirmus, tunc scias, quia uulnus est mortale.	If, however, from the forearm there comes a vapour of evil scent, when he feels unwell after it, then you know that the fracture is deadly.
Quod si non fuerit ei profunditas, et est recens cum sanguine suo: tunc non ponas in eo a prima hora puluerem, neque stringas ipsum, ut non retineatur sanguis in profunditate eius, et reuertatur ad cor, et interficiat infirmum: sed pone in ipso unguentum attractiuum, et solue ipsum in die bis.	What if it is not deep and the blood is recent? Then do not put powder on it immediately, and do not bind him so as not to retain the blood in depth, and let it run into his heart, causing evil: but put on it an attractive ointment, and let it go for two days.
Si uero unguentum non est tibi praesens, tunc pone in orificio uulneris cotum uetustum, ut sugat illud quod egreditur de eo ex humiditatibus: et fac ut dormiat infirmus super uulnus, ut currat quod aggregatur in eo.	If you do not have ointment with you now, then put in the wound a raw cloth moistened with oil, so that it sucks out what comes from it by means of moisture: and make the sick person sleep on the wound, so that he runs what is gathered in him.
Si uero iam praeterierint uulneri tres dies, aut plures, et non accidit infirmo spasmus, neque tremor cordis malus, neque strictura in anhelitu, et uides reliquas dispositiones eius bonas: tunc scias, quia uulnus est saluum.	If then the wound has already been cured three days or more and no spasm has occurred in the sick person, nor has there been any bad tremor of the heart, nor has there remained a constriction in the breath, and the other symptoms have all improved: then you will know that the wound is healed.
Cura ergo ipsum et cum liciniis, et reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then take care of yourself and with ease, and continue with the treatment until it is healed.
Si uero excusatur sanatio eius, et iam aperitur semper, tunc scias, quia iam factum est Fistula.	If then the healing is completed and it has already opened forever, then you will know that it has already become a fistula.
Cura ergo ipsam ex capitulo suo.	Then take care of yourself from its own head.
Et si uulnus est ex incisione ensis, aut cultelli, et est simplex in superficie pectoris, aut dorsi: tunc cura ipsum cum eo quod praecessit ex sutura, si est magnum: aut cum puluere, si est paruum.	And if the wound is from a cut with a knife, and it is simple on the surface of the breast, or of the back: then take care of it with what preceded from the stitch, if it is large: or with dust, if it is small.
Si autem iam fecit impressionem in osse, et incidit ex eo frusta: tunc inquire uulnus, et propera ad extrahendum illa frusta, si sunt separata.	But if it has already made an impression on the bone, and has come from it by a twig: then inquire about the wound, and approach from outside to remove those twigs, if they are separated.
Si uero non sunt separata, tunc dimitte ea, donec putrefiat uulnus, alleuiatur enim extractio eorum.	But if they are not separated, then leave them, until the wound rots, for the extraction of those is advantageous.
Reliquorum autem uulnerum accidentium in reliquis membris iudicium in curatione, est iudicium eius quod diximus.	But as for the other wounds in the other members, the judgment in the treatment is the same as I have said.
¶ De uulneribus Ventris, et exitu intestini, et exitura eorum.	Regarding wounds of the belly and of the entrails, and their issuing forth.
Caput LXXXVII.	Chapter LXXVII
Disruptio quae accidit uentri, est magna, et media, et parua.	The rupture that has happened in the belly is great, medium, and small.
Ex magna igitur quandoque egreditur intestinum, aut numerus intestinorum.	From a great one, then, when it issues forth, or from the number of entrails.
Quare fit intromissio eorum, et eorum sutura uehementior et difficilior.	Why do they enter in, and their stitching is more painful and more difficult.
Et disruptio parua etiam fit difficilis ex modo alio.	And a small disruption also does difficult from another mode.
Sequitur ergo, ut sit reductio eorum difficilior, si non properas in intromissione sua ad locum suum statim: quoniam inflatur, aperitur, et ingrossatur: quare fit difficilis introitus eius.	So then, as it follows that the reduction of them is more difficult if you don't immediately come into contact with its place: for it swells, opens, and thickens: so why is the entrance to it difficult?
Propter hoc ergo fit melior disruptionum disruptio media: quoniam cum ea non fit difficilis reductio intestini, sicut fit dissicilis in his duabus speciebus.	For this reason, then, a small disruption is better than a large one: for when the reduction of the intestine does not difficult, as it is difficult in these two kinds.
Scias, quod sutura uenris est secundum quatuor modos.	You should know that the suturing takes place according to four ways.
Duae suturae communes conueniunt in sutura uentris, et in sutura reliquorum uulnerum corporis: et duae suturae aliae proprie communicant reliquis uulneribus.	Two common sutures meet in the suture of the eye, and in the suture of the remaining parts of the body: and two other sutures communicate with the rest of the body in a proper way.
Verumtamen sunt magis propriae cum sutura uentris: et ego narro tibi unamquamque cum expositione, et declaratione.	However, they are more private when it comes to the suture of the eye: and I will tell you both with exposure, and explanation.
Dico ergo, quia quando uulnus est paruum, et egreditur ex eo aliquid ex intestino, et fit difficile reducere ipsum: tunc illud est propter unum duorum modorum.	I say then, that when the bone is small, and it comes out of it a little of the intestine, and it is difficult to reduce it: then it is because of one of two ways.
Aut propter paruitatem disruptionis, sicut diximus: Aut quoniam in intestino est inflatio propter frigus aeris.	Or because of the size of the disruption, as we have said: Or because there is a swelling in the intestine because of cold air.
Quando ergo illud est ita, tunc oportet ut calefacias ipsum, ita ut submergas spongiam, aut pannum humidum in aqua tepida sola.	So then, when that is so, you should warm the bone, so that you dip a sponge, or a wet cloth into warm water alone.
Aut decoquas in aqua squinantum, et cyperum, et spicam, et embroces cum ea intestinum, donec resoluatur inflatio.	Or simmer in water with squink, and celery, and spice, and simmer it with the intestine, until the swelling goes down.
Quandoque facit illud uinum in quo est stipticitas: et est melius quam aqua sola in resolutione inflationis.	When then does that wine make which has stitches: and it is better than water alone in solving swelling.
Cum ergo uides inflationem iam resolui, tunc humecta intestinum cum aqua in qua decocta est altea, aut malua.	When you see that the swelling has already gone away, then moisten the intestines with water in which there is a high temperature, or bitter.
Nam per illud alleuiatur introitus eius cum re parua.	For by that way the entry into it is relieved with the small one.
Si autem excusatur reditus eius post hanc curationem, tunc finde in disruptione parum, cum instrumento quo secantur hemorrhoides.	If the return of it is excuses after this cure, then you will find a small disruption with the instrument which severs hemorrhoids.
Et curatio prima est melior quando praeparatur, quam sectio: et non fit coactio ad secandum post necessitatem et defectum instrumenti.	The first cure is better when prepared than when performed; and there should be no compulsion to perform according to necessity and want of instruments.
Sit pars eius una quae est torta, acuta, et pars eius altera non acuta, et extremitas subtilis non sit cum subtilitate Spatumilis, imo sit obtusior parumper: et est illa quae similatur caiada, sicut uides.	The part of the body which is twisted, acute, and the other part not acute, and the end small should not be with subtility, but rather more obtuse: and it is that which resembles a gash, as you see.
Cum ergo amplificatur uulnus, et ingreditur intestinum, tunc oportet, ut sit reductio eius secundum formam suam naturalem in loco suo sibi proprio, si possibile est super illud: quoniam est melius.	When therefore the fracture is increased and the intestine is brought in, then it should be that it is reduced according to its own natural form in its own place, if possible above it: for this is better.
Quando uero disruptio est ampla in inferiori parte uentris: tunc oportet ut facias iacere infirmum super dorsum suum, et pone crura sua altiora capite suo.	When however the fracture is wide in the lower part of the pelvis: then it should be that you make the sick person lie on his back, and set his legs higher than his head.
Et si est in superiore parte uentris, tunc pone caput eius, et pectus ipsius altiora quam eius inferiora.	And if it is in the upper part of the pelvis, then you should set its head and its chest higher than its lower parts.
Et similiter si est disruptio in una duarum partium uentris, tunc pone intentionem tuam, et tuam considerationem semper in hoc, ut pars in qua est uulnus sit altior parte altera.	And also if the fracture is in one of the two parts of the pelvis, then you should set your intention and your attention always in this, that the part in which is the fracture should be higher than the other part.
Et ita oportet, ut admimistres illud in uulneribus magnis, et in uulneribus mediis.	And thus it should be, so that you receive that in large wounds, and in medium wounds.
In uulneribus autem paruis, pone illud secundum quod praeparatur tibi.	In wounds however which are small, set it according to what is prepared for you.
Deinde fac ut sit praesens inter manus tuas minister pius, qui teneat disruptionem totam manu sua: et aggrega labia eius.	Then make a minister who has the whole fracture in his hand present between your hands: and add to it the lips.
Deinde detege ex ea ei qui sequitur suturam aliquid post aliquid: et iste est modus suturae communis unius.	Then find out from him who follows something after something: and this is the common method of sewing one.
Et est, ut accipias acum, aut numerum acuum secundum quantitatem amplitudinis uulneris.	And it is, so that you take an acute angle, or a number of acute angles according to the quantity of the width of the wound.
Deinde dimitte ab extremitate disruptionis quantitatem digiti anularis, id est, medici: et fige acum unam praeter quod intromittas in eam filum in duabus extremitatibuis cutis, cum duabus extremitatibus sifac quod est sub cute ab interioribus, donec facias eam penetrare ab alia parte, et tu iam aggregasti duas extremitates cutis, et duas extremitates sifac: et fiunt quatuor ordines.	Then let go from the end of the fracture a quantity of the index finger, that is, the doctor: and set now one besides which you introduce into it a thread in two ends of the skin, with two ends of the suture which is under the skin from within, until you make it penetrate from the other part, and you have already added the two ends of the skin, and the two ends of the suture: and there are four orders.
Deinde stringe cum filo duplo in circumitu acus aliquotiens a duabus partibus simul, quousque sint aggregata duo labia uulneris aggregatione decenti.	Then tie tightly with a double thread around the needle from both sides until the two lips of the wound come together as they dry out.
Deinde dimitte grossitudinem digiti etiam, et fige in eis acum aliam: postea reta eam cum filo, sicut fecisti cum acu prima.	Then release the grip with your finger and fix it with another knot: then sew it straight as you did with the needle first time.
Non ergo cesses facere illud cum eo quo indiges ex acubus, donec compleas constrictionem uulneris totius.	So do not cease doing that while holding on to it, until you have completed the tightness of the wound.
Et sint acus mediae inter grossitudinem et subtilitatem: quoniam acus subtiles ualde uelociter incidunt carnem: et grossae sunt difficilis introitus in cutem: propter illud oportet ut sint mediae in subtilitate, et grossitudine.	And let the needle be of medium thickness between the thickness and the fineness; for the fine needle wounds the flesh quickly: and the thick one is difficult to enter into the skin: therefore it should be such that it is of middle thickness and fineness.
Et non oportet, ut figatur acus in duabus extremitatibus cutis propinquae multum: ut non incidatur caro uelociter, et aperiatur uulnus ante consolidationem sui, et non elongentur etiam cum sutura, ut non prohibeatur uulnus a consolidatione.	And it should not be fixed by the needle at both ends of the skin near by much: so that the flesh does not get wounded quickly, and the wound does not open before its consolidation, and also does not stretch out with the sewing, so that the wound is not prevented from consolidating.
Deinde incide extremitatem acuum, ut non laedant infirmum apud somnum suum: et pone eis puluillos ex pannis ab omni parte, qui teneant extremitates acuum: et dimitte eos, donec scias quod uulnus iam consolidatum est.	Then cut off the ends of the needles so that they do not hurt the sick person while he sleeps: and put feathers from silk or wool at both ends of the needles: then release them until you know that the wound is consolidated.
Et haec quidem species suturae cum acubus taliter est conuenientior in uulneribus paruis.	And these kinds of sewing with needles are much more convenient for small wounds.
Quoniam sufficit in sutura eorum acus una, aut duae, aut circiter eas.	Since it is enough to sew them with one, or two, or all around.
Sutura autem secunda communis est, ut aggreges cum sutura extremitates quatuor: extremitates, duas cutis, et extremitates duas sifac in uice una, cum acu in qua sit filum inuolutum aequale in subtilitate, et grossitudine.	The second common stitch is to gather the four ends together with sewing: the two ends of the skin, and the two ends of the thread on one side, with a needle that has a thread attached to it of equal thickness and fineness.
Deinde quando penetraueris cum acu has extremitates quatuor, reduc acum a parte a qua incaepisti eadem, ut cadat filum retatum a superiori parte uulneris: ut sit sutura, sicut sutura panni quo stringuntur panni, et pone inter omnem suturam quantitatem grossitudinis digiti minoris.	Then when you pierce with the needle all four ends, reduce them from the part from which you began in order that the thread may hang from the upper part of the wound: so that it is a stitch like the stitching of the cloth when it is gathered together, and put between every stitch the quantity of thickness of the little finger.
Hanc autem suturam sciunt homines.	This type of sewing is known by people.
Et cum hac sutura ego sui uulnus quod acciderat uiro in uentre suo, qui fuerat uulneratus cum cultello, et erat disruptio uulneris maior palmo uno: et exierat ex intestinis circiter duos palmos ex intestino medio, et erat disruptio in medio uentris.	And with this stitch I sewed up the wound that a man got in his belly, which had been wounded with a knife, and there was a rupture of the gut by about one palm: and he came out of the intestines around two palms from the middle intestine, and there was a rupture in the middle of the abdomen.
Reduxi ergo illud postquam stetit intestinum eius extra uulnus xxiiii horis.	So I reduced it after he had stood for twenty-four hours outside the wound.
Consolidatum est ergo uulnus in spacio quod fuit circiter XV dies: et curaui ipsum, et sanatus est: et uixit post illud annis multis, conuersatus in suis dispositionibus.	The wound was then healed in a space that had been for about fifteen days: and I tended him, and he was cured: and after that he lived for many years, in good health.
Et medici iudicauerant, quod non sanaretur.	And the doctors judged that it would not heal.
Et ex miraculo fuit, quod non curaui illud cum unguento.	But by a miracle, I did not cure that with ointment.
Quoniam fui in loco in quo non inueniebatur unguentum, neque aliquid ex medicinis.	For I was in a place where the ointment was not found, and there were no medicines.
Posui ergo super uulnus cotum uetustum bis in die, et assiduaui ablutionem eius cum aqua mellis, donec sanatum est.	So I put on the wound a wet cloth twice a day, and tended it with a wash of honey water until it was cured.
Duas autem species suturae proprias dicam secundum narrationem sermonis.	Two kinds of stitches, I will call them, I shall mention according to the account of the speech.
Et est, ut incipias cum sutura acuta: et intromittas acum ab exteriori ad interiorem partem.	And is, as you begin with the sharp stitch: and introduce it from the outside to the inside part.
Cum ergo penetrat acus in cutem, et in lacertum euntem secundum longitudinem et latitudinem totius corporis: dimitte extremitatem sifac in latere in quo intromisisti acum, et fac penetrare in extremitatem aliam ab interiori parte ad exteriorem in extremitate altera mirach.	When the needle therefore enters into the skin, and goes into a fold according to the length and breadth of the whole body: release the extreme end of the siroc that you introduced from the outside, and let it penetrate into the extreme end from the inside part to the outside in the other end.
Cum ergo feceris eam penetrare, tunc fac eam penetrare secundum hoc in eadem hac extremitate mirach ab exteriori parte ad interiorem: et dimitte extremitatem sifac, quae est in hoc latere, et fac penetrare acum in extremitatem alteram ab interiori parte ad exteriorem: et fac penetrare cum penetratione tua qua facis eam penetrare in sifac extremitate mirach, quae est in parte eius, donec penetret in ipsum totum.	When you have made it penetrate then, so let it penetrate according to this in the same extreme end fold from the outside part to the inside: and release the extreme end of the siroc that is in that place, and let it penetrate into the extreme end from the inside part to the outside by means of your penetration with which you make it penetrate into the siroc end, which is in this part, until it penetrates into all of it.
Deinde incipe etiam ab hoc eodem latere, et sue ipsum cum extremitate, quae est ex sifac in latere alio, et extrahe acum ex cute quam penetrauit.	Then also from this same fold, and draw it with the end that is out of the siroc, which is on another side, and take away from the skin from whence it penetrated by means of the same end.
Deinde reduc eam in illam cutem, et sue extremitatem sifac, quae est in latere alio, cum hac extremitate mirach: et extrahe eam ex cute quae est ex parte eius, et fac illud uice una, et alia: et fac illud uice post uicem, usquequo suas extrinsecum totum secundum illud exemplum.	Then reduce the wound in that skin, and the extremities of a siffac, which is in another side, with this extremities mirach: and take it out from the skin that is on a part of it, and make that one way, and other: and make that way behind the first, until his external whole be second to this example.
Et summa huius suturae, est ut suas sutura pellipariorum qua suunt pelles: ita ut suas sifac uice una ex parte una extremitate cutis: et ut dimittas eam uice alia ex parte alia, donec compleas.	And the summit of this suture is as his suture that are between the skins that they are: so that his siffac way one from a part of one end of the skin: and leave it by another way from another part, until you complete it.
Secunda species suturae propriae, quam dixit Gale nus.	The second species of suture is its own, which said Galen.
Iste eius sermo narratus est, ut suas eam secundum similitudinem, qua suunt eas quidam medicantium, ita quod aggregant omnem partem ad comparem suam conuenientem per naturam: et applicant extremitatem sifac ad eius aliam extremitatem, et extremitatem mirach ad extremitatem eius aliam.	This speech is told, that his is according to the similarity with which they are some healing, so that they add all part up to compare his proper by nature: and apply the extremities of a siffac on its other extremities, and the extremities of mirach on its other extremities.
Et illud fit secundum quod narro tibi.	And this make you according to what I tell you.
Oportet ut figas acum in extremitatem mirach propinquam tibi ab exteriori parte, et facias eam penetrare ad interiorem in eo solo: et dimittas duas extremitates sifac.	It is necessary that you make this on the mirach end near to you from the external side, and make it penetrate in the internal with this soil: and leave the two extremities of a siffac.
Deinde reuolue acum, et fac eam penetrare ab exteriori parte ad interiorem in duas extremitates sifac, scilicet utrinque.	Then turn this again, and make it penetrate from the external side to the internal with two extremities of a siffac, that is, everywhere.
Deinde reuolue utrasque, etiam fac penetrare utrasque ab interiori usque ad exteriorem, in duas extremitates mirach alias, quae sunt in latere opposito.	Then turn them both, and make both penetrate from the internal to the external, in two ends of mirach different, that is, opposite.
Et iste modus suturae est melior sutura communi facili, et est sutura cuius praecessit rememoratio.	And this way of suture is a better suture common easy, and is the suture which its precedent memory.
Iste est ergo sermo Galeni etiam.	This is therefore the speech of Galen also.
Et dixerunt quidam.	And said some:
Retificatur sutura uentris cum duabus acubus.	The suture of the hand with two knuckles is straightened out.
Quod est, ut intromittas in eis utrisque filum unum: et incipe cum intromissione acus, ex eo quod est apud te, et fac eam penetrare usque ad latus aliud, secundum suturam eorum qui suunt coria aequaliter.	That is, so that you put in them both one string: and begin with the putting of an accuser, from where it is for you, and make it penetrate until another side, according to their suture which they are equally.
Et scias, quod quando disruptio est in medio uentris: tunc sutura eius est difficilior quam reliquorum locorum uentris.	And thou shalt know that when disruption is in the middle of the eye: then the suture thereof is more difficult than the rest of the places of the eye.
Iudicium uero medicationis uulneris, est iudicium reliquorum uulnerum.	The judgment of medicine on wounds, it is the judgment of the other wounds.
Quod est, quia quando tu consequeris uulnus recens cum sanguine suo, antequam alteret ipsum aer: et reducis intestinum, et suis ipsum, et aptas ipsum: tunc pone super puluerem incarnatiuum.	That is, for when you treat a fresh wound with its blood, before it has become dried up: and you reduce the intestines, and their content, and mend the wound: then place it on the powder of the inflamed flesh.
Quod si aer iam alterauit uulnus: tunc pone super ipsum quaedam unguenta, quae sunt tibi praesentia, donec faciant pus: et cadant fila, et consolidentur sifac, et mirach.	That is, if the air has already changed the wound: then place on the wound a certain ointment that is at hand, so that it may make pus: and let the threads fall away, and the sifac [scab] be solid, and the mirach [grew].
Deinde cura illud sicut est curatio reliquorum uulnerum, donec sanetur.	Then care for that as is the cure of the other wounds, until it is healed.
Si autem non sunt tibi praesentes medicinae, tunc pone super ipsum statim, exquo incipit emittere pus, cotum uetus: et permuta ipsum bis in die, sicut docui te, donec sanetur.	But if you have not at hand the medicines, then place on the wound immediately, so that it may begin to discharge pus, and change the dressing twice a day, as I taught you, until it is healed.
Nam tu non indiges medicatione alia in pluribus dispositionibus, quando uulnera sunt simplicia.	For thou dost not need other medicines in many places when wounds are simple.
Si autem times, quod communicet uulnus membris principalibus in laesione, tunc oportet ut submergas lanam lenem in oleo temperatae caliditatis, aut in oleo rosato: et pone ipsam in circumitu locorum quae sunt inter inguina, et sub ascellas.	But if you shall know, that the wound commingles with the principal members in injury, then it is necessary that thou shouldest dip the wool with lanolin in oil of moderate heat, or in rose-oil: and place it on the circumferents of the places which are between the hips, and under the armpits.
Quod si sentit dolorem, aut punctiones, aut putrefactionem in intestinis suis (nam multotiens accidit illud) tunc clisteriza ipsum cum uino stiptico, nigro, tepido: praecipue si putredo iam peruenit in intestino, et facta est exitura penetrans usque ad concauitatem eius.	That is, if it feels pain, or prickings, or corruption in the intestines (for this often happens): then bind up the wound with bitter wine, black, hot: especially if putrefaction has already set in on the intestine, and a piercing has come to its head.
Et scias, quod illud quod est ex intestino grosso, est facilioris sanationis: et quod ex eis est ex subtili, difficilioris sanationis.	And thou shalt know that what is of the large intestine is easier to be healed: and what is of the small one, is more difficult to be healed.
Intestinum autem quod nominatur Ieiunum, non suscipit sanationem ex uulnere quod accidit in eo omnino: et illud est propter multitudinem eius, quod est ex uenis, et magnitudine earum, et propter subtilitatem corporis eius, et propinquitatem ipsius naturae neruorum.	But the intestine which is called Jejunium, does not accept healing from a wound that has befallen it at all: and that is because of its multitude, inasmuch as it is of intestines, and of their great number, and of the fineness of the body thereof, and of the nearness thereof to the nerves of nature.
Si autem illud quod procedit ex uulnere est zirbum, et consequeris ipsum recens: reduc ipsum secundum reductionem tuam, qua reducis intestina aequaliter.	But if that which proceeds from the ulnar is sharp, and you have found it so: reduce it according to your reduction, as you reduce the intestines evenly.
Si uero praeteriit ei spacium, et iam factum est uiride, aut nigrum: tunc oportet ut stringas ipsum cum filo supra locum qui denigratus est ex eo, ut non accidat fluxus sanguinis.	If, however, there is a space beyond it and the wound has already been made dark or light: then you should hold it with a thread above the place that has turned black from it, so that blood does not flow.
In zirbo enim sunt uenae et arteriae.	For in the knuckle there are veins and arteries.
Deinde incide quod est praeter illud ligamentum, et pone duas extremitates fili pendentes ex inferiori parte uulneris extra ipsum: ut alleuietur super te attractio eius, et extractio ipsius apud casum zirbi, et emissionem pus uulneris.	Then cut what is beyond that ligament, and place two ends of a thread hanging from the lower part of the wound outside the knuckle: so that there is an attraction towards you from it, and extraction of it at the knuckle's edge, and emission of the wound's pus.
¶ Rememoratio uulneris quod accidit in Intestino.	Remembering the wound that happened in the intestine.
Quando accidit disruptio in Intestino, et est parua: tunc possibile est, ut restauretur in quibusdam hominibus: propterea, quia ego uidi qui fuit uulneratus in uentre suo cum percussione lanceae, et erat uulnus a dextra stomachi, et antiquatum est uulnus: et factum Fistula, et exiuit ex eo egestio, et uentositas.	When the disruption has occurred in the intestine, and it is small: then it is possible for some people to be restored: since I saw one who was wounded in his belly with a lance, and there was a sharp wound on the right side of his stomach, and an old injury: and there was made a fistula, and it came out of it a discharge, and a pus.
Posui ergo curationem, usque quod ego non fui confisus in sanatione eius: neque cessaui subtiliare ipsum, donec sanatus est, et consolidatus est locus.	So I applied the treatment, until I was not confident in his recovery: and I did not hesitate to examine it, until he was healed, and the place had been strengthened.
Postquam ego uidi locum iam consolidatum, timui super infirmum, quod accideret super infirmum accidens malum in uentre suo: et non accidit ei ex illo accidens malum.	After I saw the place had been strengthened, I feared for the illness that might happen to his belly, since there was a bad accident in his belly: and that did not happen to him from that accident.
Et remansit in melioribus dispositionibus suis, comedens et bibens, et futuens, et intrauit balneum, et exercitatus est in dietis suis.	And he remained in better health, eating and drinking, and enjoying himself, and entering a bath, and exercising in his diet.
Et iam dixerunt quidam experimentatorum, quia quando accidit in Intestino uulnus, et est paruum: tunc oportet ut ligetur secundum hunc modum.	And some experimental people said, for when it happened in the intestine a sharp wound, and it is small: then it should be bound according to this way.
Et est, ut accipias formicas magnorum capitum.	And it is, so that you take large ants' heads.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris, et pone formicam unam ex eis quae habeant os apertum super duo labia uulneris.	Then gather two lips of the wound, and place one ant with an open mouth on both lips of the wound.
Cum ergo capit super ea, et stringit os suum, abscinde caput eius, adhaeret enim, et non soluitur.	So when he has taken hold of it, and has tightened his grip upon it, cut off his head, for it is bound fast, and is not loosed.
Deinde pone formicam aliam prope primam, et non cesses facere illud cum formica post formicam secundum quantitatem uulneris totius.	Then put another ant near the first, and do not cease to make it work with the ant after the second quantity of wound on the whole.
Deinde reduc ipsum, et sue uulnus.	Then reduce the man, and bind his wounds.
Illa enim capita remanent annexa in Intestino, donec cibetur Intestinum, et sanetur, et non accidat infirmo nocumentum penitus.	Those heads remaining attached to the Intestines, until the Intestines are fed, and heal, and do not cause injury to the whole by being torn.
Et iam possibile est, ut ligetur Intestinum etiam cum filo subtili: quod abstersum est ex intestino animalis, annexo cum eo postquam intromittitur in acum.	And it is also possible that the Intestines be bound as well with a thin thread: which has been torn from the intestinal animal, attached to it once it has entered into the mass.
Et est, ut accipias extremitatem huius fili ex intestino, et excarnetur multum.	And is, that you take hold of the end of this thread from the Intestine, and cut off a great deal of flesh.
Deinde liga in extremitate eius filum lini subtile inuolutum.	Then bind on the end of this thread with a thin wrapped thread.
Deinde intromitte illud filum in acum, et sue cum eo intestinum.	Then insert that thread into the mass, and follow it up with the Intestine.
Deinde reduc ipsum in disruptionem.	Then reduce the man to dismemberment.
Et iste modus suturae cum formicis et intestino, non est nisi secundum uiam fiduciae et spei.	And this method of stitching with ants and intestine is not but second to the first in trust and hope.
Scias, uulnus quod est magnum, amplum, praecipue si est in uno intestinorum gracilium: tunc non est ingenium nisi subtiliatio, neque est eius sanatio omnino.	You should know that the wound is great and broad, especially if it be in one of the thin Intestines: then it is not but a cunning device, nor is its healing at all.
¶ De cura Zuchemen, et Fistularum.	Of care for Zoochus and Fissures.
Caput LXXXVIII.	Head LXXVIII.
Scias, quod omne uulnus, aut apostema quando ueterascit et antiquatur, et fit ulcus, et non consolidatur, et emittit pus semper, et non abscinditur: tunc nominatur uniuersaliter in quocunque membro fuerit Fistula, et nos nominamus ipsum Zuchemen.	You should know that every wound, or suppurating wound when it has aged and become old, and turns to a sore, and does not heal, and always discharges pus, and does not close: then it is called by the universal name of a Fistula wherever it may be in any member. And we call this same Zuchenus.
Et Fistula quidem est secundum ueritatem nodatio filtrata, dura, alba: cum qua non est dolor, cui est concauitas pennae auis: et propter illud nominant eam quidam Risati, id est, pennam.	And the Fistula is indeed by virtue of age a filtered, hard, white discharge, not causing pain, which has a small curly hair: and for that it is called by some Risatus, that is, a hair.
Et est in quibusdam horis humida, quae emittit pus.	And it is in certain hours damp, which emits pus.
Et fortasse scinditur humiditas in quibusdam horis.	And perhaps the moisture splits in certain hours.
Et quandoque est haec humiditas multa, et est pauca: et est grossa, et est subtilis.	And when this moisture is much and little, and it is thick and fine.
Et ego iam praemisi in diuisione, tunc cum dixi uulnera, quod omne ulcus quod non sanatur, neque nascitur in eo caro, non est illud nisi propter unam nouem caussarum.	And I have already pre-empted in the division, then when I said wounds, that every wound which does not heal and does not grow in it, is not this but because of a new cause of causes.
Quarum una est, aut propter paucitatem sanguinis in corpore: aut propter maliciam eius: aut quoniam inter ipsum, et super labia eius est caro dura, prohibens natiuitatem carnis: aut quia est multae sordis et sordiciei: aut quoniam ulcus in seipso est putridum, et materia quae mittitur ei est malae qualitatis: aut quoniam medicina est inconueniens in curatione eius: aut quoniam corruptio cadens in regione est genus pestilentiae, aut per proprietatem in regione, sicut accidit in Caesaraugusta: in qua fit difficilis digestio aegritudinum, et tardatur in ea sanatio apostematum per naturam: aut quoniam in eo est os unum, aut numerus ossium.	Of which one is because there is little blood in the body: or because of wickedness in it: or because it is between itself and the lips is hard flesh, preventing the birth of flesh: or because there is much dirt and filthiness: or because the wound is putrid within itself, and the matter that is cast out of it is of a bad quality: or because the medicine is inconsistent in its cure: or because corruption falling into the region is a kind of pestilence, or by virtue of the region, as happened in Caesar Augustus: in which it is difficult for diseases to be digested, and the healing of aphses by nature is delayed: or because there is one hole, or a number of bones.
Et ego iam ostendi omnes istas caussas et signa earum, et curationes ipsarum cum medicinis in diuisione: et oportet hic ut faciam te scire curationem Fistulae et Zuken, quae fit per uiam operationis cum manu.	And I have already shown all the stations and causes of these and their cures with physicians in a division: and it is necessary here that I make you aware of the cure of the Fistula and Zuka, which happens through a path of operation with the hand.
Scias ergo, quod Fistula accidit in omnibus membris corporis.	You therefore know that the Fistula happens in all the members of the body.
Nam ex eis sunt Fistulae quae perueniunt ad uenas magnas et arterias, aut neruos, aut sifac: aut ad intestinum, aut ad uesicam, aut ad aliquam ex costis: aut ad aliquam ex spondilibus dorsi, aut ad aliquam iuncturarum compositarum compositione: sicut manus, et pedis: et ex eis sunt quae uadunt ad propinquitatem membri principalis, et similium.	For from them are Fistulas that reach into large veins and arteries, or nerves, or intestinal tract, or urinary bladder, or some of the ribs of the back, or some of the joints of the compound: such as the hand and foot: and from them are those that reach into the vicinity of a main member, or others.
Quae ergo ex his Fistulis est secundum hunc modum, est ex aegritudinibus difficilis sanationis, et non recipit curationem, et occupatio cum ea est labor et ignorantia.	Which therefore of these Fistulas is according to this manner, it is from diseases that are difficult to be cured, and does not receive healing, and the employment with it is labor and ignorance. Et si sic sicut deos iustis praesumerem, quod in qua est peccatio, et peccatio in qua est imperitia: qui cum dicamus, et agimus, ut saepe facimus, nonne illam curare deb
Quod si est ex Fistulis aliqua cuius profunditas non peruenit ad haec loca quae dixi: et speras, et confidis in curatione eius, et uis peruenire ad cognitionem illius, tunc accipe tentam ex aere, aut ferro, si Fistula tendit secundum rectitudinem, et perquire eam cum ipsa.	If it is from the fistulas any of which does not reach to these places which I have said: and you hope, and trust in its cure, and perceive into it, then take hold of it trying out of air, or iron, if the fistula tends according to rectitude, and inquire it with itself.
Si autem in Fistula est tortuositas, tunc inuestiga eam cum tenta de plumbo subtili.	But if there is a tortuosity in the fistula, then investigate it with a thin lead.
Quoniam plumbum cum lenitate sui corporis alleuiatur, et curuatur circa tortuositatem.	For because lead with its own lenity lightens it, and deals with the tortuosity.
Quod si Fistula est habens orificia multa, non est tibi possibile ut significes super eam cum tenta.	That if the fistula has many openings, it is not possible for you to indicate over it with a try out.
Clisteriza ergo ex eis orificium ex orificiis suis.	So make use of the opening from its openings.
Nam humiditas qua clisterizas ipsum, uadit uersus orificia alia, et currit ex eis.	For because of the moisture which clisterizes itself, it turns toward other openings, and runs out of them.
Deinde exquisite inquire secundum quem modum est tibi possibile: ut cognoscas quod illic est os, aut neruus, et est Fistulae concauitas longinqua, aut propinqua: aut est Fistula una cui sunt orificia multa, et sta super totum illud, cum summa fortitudinis tuae: cum interrogatione tua, qua interrogas infirmum, et inuentione doloris apud compressionem cum manu tua super locum, et similibus ex significationibus et caussis accidentibus apostemati.	Then inquire with care how it is possible for you: that you may know what is there a mouth, or a nerve, and is the fistula long distant, or close by: or is the fistula one whose openings are many, and lies over all of it, with your great strength: with your questioning, which questions about the sick, and with the finding out of pain at the pressure with your hand on the place, and similar signs and causes of accident.
Cum ergo steteris super omnia illa statione uera, tunc uade ad curationem secundum confidentiam: et est, ut consideres tunc, si est Fistula propinqua apparens, aut in loco saluo longinquo a iunctura, aut a neruo, aut arteria, aut uena, aut uno locorum quae dixi tibi: tunc seca Fistulam secundum quod praemissum est ex narratione mea, et aufer quod est in ea ex filtratione, et carnibus corruptis, quod nascitur in orificio eius ex carne, aut thelul, et similibus: et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	But when you are standing firmly on all these positions, then take a try out toward cure according to your confidence: and it is, if you consider then, that if there is a fistula which appears near by, or in a place healthy far from the joint, or from a nerve, or an artery, or a vein, or one of the places which I have said to you: then stop up the fistula according to what has been preceded from my account, and remove what is in it from filtration, and corrupt meat, which comes out of its opening by the flesh, or the sinew, and similar things: and care for it, until it is healed.
Si autem Fistula est longinquae profunditatis, et est secundum rectitudinem: tunc oportet ut seces eam in profundo quantum est tibi possibile.	But if the fistula is a long distance deep, and extends according to rectitude: then it is necessary that you should separate it from the depth as much as is possible for you.
Deinde mundifica ipsam ex omnibus carnibus eius corruptis.	He then cleanses it from all its corrupted flesh.
Deinde administra licinia inuoluta in medicinis acutis: et intromitte ea usque ad concauitatem Fistulae quam comprehendisti cum ferro: fac cum ea illud aliquotiens, donec corrodat medicina acuta totum quod remansit in concauitate Fistulae ex corruptione.	Then he applies the poultice of fresh blood mixed with acute medicines and inserts it as far as the fistula comes together with the iron: you should do this a few times until the acute medicine completely corrodes what is left in the fistula's hole from corruption.
Deinde restaura ipsam cum unguentis quae generant carnem sanam, donec sanetur.	Then restore it with ointment that generates healthy flesh until it heals.
Si uero non sanatur per illud, tunc cauteriza ipsam secundum quod narrauimus.	If it does not heal through this, then you should cauterize it according to what we have described.
Si ergo caussa Fistulae est os, et certificatur apud te illud: tunc inquire ipsum, et seca ipsum secundum quod narraui tibi: si non prohibet te aliquid ex uena, aut neruo, aut membro principali, sicut diximus.	If the cause of the fistula is an opening, and you have verified this for yourself: then examine the patient, and dry it up according to what I have told you: if it does not allow you to remove anything from its blood, or nerve, or main member, as we have said.
Si ergo detegitur tibi os, et est in eo quiddam corruptionis, et nigredinis: tunc rade ipsum, donec auferatur corruptio eius tota.	If a hole is detected within it and there is some corruption and blackening: then shave it, until all corruption is removed from it.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod incarnat ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then take care of the patient with what induces flesh to grow on his flesh until he heals.
Quod si non sanatur, et emittat pus sicut faciebat: tunc scias, quod tu non peruenisti ad totam eradicationem corruptionis.	That if it does not heal, and it discharges pus as it did before: then you should know that you have not achieved total eradication of the corruption.
Detege ergo super illud secundo, et exquisite fac rasionem eius, et mundificationem ipsius cum ultima fortitudine tua.	Detect therefore on top of it again, and carefully examine what kind of shaving it has, and wash it with your last strength.
Deinde restaura ipsum.	Then restore the patient.
Si ergo sanatur, bonum est: et si non, tunc scias quod illa corruptio est in profunditate longinqua corporis, quam non es consecutus.	If he heals, then that is good: and if not, then you should know that that corruption is in the distant depth of the body, which you have not achieved.
Non est ergo tibi in ea ingenium, nisi dimittere ipsam naturae.	That is not in it for you to do, unless you release it from nature.
Quod si corruptum est os paruum, et est possibile tibi, attrahe ipsum cum forficibus subtilibus quae conueniunt ad illud.	If the corruption is in a small opening, and it is possible for you, attract it with subtle hooks that suit it.
Si autem sunt ossa multa, tunc exquisite fac attractionem eorum omnium, neque dimittas ex eis aliquid cum tua fortitudine.	If there are many bones, then carefully examine all of them, and do not release any from your strength.
Si uero contrarietatem facit tibi aliquid ex humiditatibus, et non est in incisione eorum timor, uel error: tunc incide illas humiditates et carnes, si sunt illic, et libera ossa.	If it does not suit you to release any of its humors, and there is no fear or mistake in cutting them: then cut those humors and flesh, if there is any, and free the bones.
Si uero non est tibi praeparatio auferendi ossa ex hora tua, tunc pone super uulnus quod putrefaciat ipsum: et dimitte ipsum, donec putrefiat quod est in circumitu illorum ossium ex carnibus et humiditatibus.	If you are not prepared to remove the bones from your own body at a given time, then place them over the elbow joint so that they rot away; and leave them until they rot away completely, as long as they rot away along with the surrounding muscles and fluids.
Et custodi uulnus ut non consolidetur.	And guard the elbow joint so that it does not stiffen.
Et constringatur sectio quam tu secuisti in operatione tua.	And tighten the section that you have cut on your own body during your surgery.
Imo pone super ipsum, si times, cotum submersum sulfure trito cum oleo: aut cotum submersum in unguento aegyptio, aut aliquo unguentorum uiridium.	Then place the bone, if necessary, in a bath of sulphur treated with oil: or in a bath of Egyptian ointment, or some other kind of ointment.
Nam quando putrefient illae scilicet humiditates, et separantur ex eis ossa, alleuiatur ablatio eorum, et ipsorum attractio.	For when those fluids rot away and the bones separate from them, it is a relief to remove them, and their attraction diminishes.
Si autem est os unum magnum, sicut os cruris, aut os coxae, et similia illis, et quod ex eo corruptum est, est pars magna: tunc rade ipsum rasione ultima, donec auferatur illa nigredo et corruptio.	But if it is one large bone, such as a leg bone or a hip bone, or similar ones, and the part that has rotted away is large, then saw off the last bit with a saw, until the blackness and rot are removed from it.
Deinde restaura uulnus.	Then restore the elbow joint.
Si uero quod est in eo corruptum, est pars magna, et corruptio iam consecuta est medullam ossis, tunc necesse est serrare ipsum, et incidere ipsum totum usque ad locum, ubi peruenit corruptio: tunc cura ipsum, donec consolidetur.	But if the part that has rotted away is large, and the rot has already reached the marrow of the bone, then it must be sawn off, and cut all the way through to the place where the rot has reached: then take care of the bone, until it stiffens up.
Et ego narro tibi zuken, quae accidit uiro in crure suo: ut ponas ipsam exemplum et adiutorium super operationem tuam.	And I will tell you the story of the man who cut his leg. So that you have an example and a help for your surgery.
Fuit uir iuuenis aetate circiter triginta annos, cui accidit dolor in crure suo, a caussa quae mota est super ipsum intra corpus, id est, ab interioribus, donec peruenerunt materiae ad crus, et apostematum est apostemate magno: et non fuit ei caussa extrinseca.	He was a young man of about thirty years of age, who felt a pain in his leg, which arose from within the body, that is, from the inside, until it reached the bone, and there was an ulcer; and there was no external cause.
Extensum est ergo cum eo tempus cum errore medicorum, donec apertum est apostema, et concurrerunt cum eo materiae multae.	Then, at that time, when he went to the doctor, the ulcer had already opened up and many substances had collected around it.
Et postposita est curatio eius, donec fistulatum est crus, et facta sunt in eo orificia multa: quae omnia emittebant pus, et humiditates corporis.	And his treatment was delayed until his leg was tied up, and many holes had been made in it; all of which were emitting puss, and fluids from the body.
Curauit ergo ipsum multitudo medicorum circiter duos annos, et non fuit in eo sapiens in arte manus, donec uocatus sum, et uidi crus eius, et materias quae currebant ex illis orificiis cursu magno: etiam omne uiri corpus iam tabuerat, et color eius citrinus erat.	So many physicians had been working on him for about two years, and there was no wisdom in the art of his hands until I was called to his side, and I saw the crux of his body and the materials that were flowing out of his orifices with a great flow: also, all his body was already covered, and his color was citrin.
Intromisi ergo tentam in uno locorum orificiorum, et peruenit tenta ad os.	So I entered one of his orifices, and the probe reached his mouth.
Deinde perscrutatus sum orificia omnia: et inueni ea peruenire ad se inuicem ex omnibus partibus cruris.	Then I scrutinized all the orifices, and I found them all coming together at one place from all parts of the body.
Properaui ergo, et secui super unum illorum orificiorum, donec detexi partem ossis: et inueni ipsum corruptum: quod iam corrosum erat, et denigratum, et putruerat, et perforatum erat, donec penetrauerat usque ad medullam.	So I properly looked and followed one of those orifices until I reached a bone part: and I found it broken: which was already broken, and discolored, and rotten, and pierced, until it penetrated all the way to the marrow.
Serraui ergo quod detectum est mihi, et praeparatum ex osse corrupto.	So I cut off what I had found, and prepared it from corrupt bone.
Et deputaui, quod non esset in osse nisi illa corruptio, quam abscidi, et serraui.	And I removed what was not in the bone, but that corruption, which I took out and cut off.
Et ego iam eradicaueram eam.	And I have now removed it.
Deinde posui restaurationem uulneris cum medicinis consolidatiuis spacio longo.	Then I put in place a repair of the wound with long- consolidated medicine.
Et non est consolidatum.	And that was not consolidated.
Deinde tentaui, et detexi super os secundo supra detectionem primam: et inueni corruptionem continuam cum osse: et serraui quod apparuit mihi etiam ex illa corruptione.	Then I probed again, and I found a second bone above the first detection: and I found continuous corruption with bone, which I cut off what seemed to me also from that corruption.
Deinde conatus sum restaurationem eius.	Then I tried to repair it.
Et non est restauratum.	And it was not repaired.
Detexi ergo super ipsum iterum, et non cessaui incidere os particulatim, et conari restaurationem eius: et non est restauratum, donec incidi ex osse circiter palmum unum, et extraxi illud cum medulla sua.	So I probed again on the body, and I did not cease to hit the bone with a sharp tool, and tried to repair it: and it was not repaired until I hit around the base of a palm bone, and took it out along with its marrow.
Deinde restauraui ipsum cum medicinis, et consolidatum est uelociter, et sanatum: et non fuit necessaria haec iteratio in operatione eius, et sectione ipsius, nisi propter dispositionem debilitatis infirmi, et paucitatem tolerantiae eius, et timorem meum super ipsum de morte: quoniam accidebat ei in omnibus horis ex superfluitate euacuationis syncopis mala.	Then I repaired it with medicine, and it was quickly consolidated, and healed: and this repetition of his operation and sectioning out of him was not necessary, except for the weakness of the nurse, and his lack of tolerance, and my fear of him dying: for it often happened to him in all times from an excessive evacuation of bad syncopes.
Sanatus est ergo sanatione integra: et nata est in loco ossis caro dura, et bona facta est dispositio in corpore suo, et rediit uirtus eius: et conuersatus est in dispositionibus suis: et non fecit ei contrarietatem in ambulatione nocumentum omnino.	He is therefore whole-heartedly healed: and the new bone has grown up in place of the old, and the arrangement in his body is good, and his power has returned; and he has adapted himself to his dispositions: and he has not done him any harm at all in walking.
Si autem os eminens in loco corporis iam fractum est: tunc oportet ut serres ipsum, secundum hunc modum: et est: ut accipias ligamentum, et stringe ipsum in extremitate ossis eminentis: et praecipe alicui, qui extendat ipsum ad sursum: et pone ligamentum aliud ex lana grossius ligamento primo.	But if the jaw is broken in place in the body already: then it should be bound, according to this method: and so it is: that you take the ligament, and tie it tightly at the end of the prominent bone: and order someone who extends it upwards: and put another ligament made of thick wool after the first ligament.
Deinde liga ipsum super carne, quae est suh osse: et extende extremitatem eius, ut trahas carnem ad inferiora: et tu detegis carnem super locum quem uis serrare, ut non laedat Serra carnem.	Then bind the flesh above the bone: and extend its end so that you can pull the flesh down below: and you cover the flesh over the place that you want to bind, so as not to hurt the flesh by cutting it.
Pone lignum, aut tabulam sub osse inferius decenter: quoniam quando facis illud, non prohibetur quin secet carnem corruptam.	Place the ligament, or a board below the bone: because when you do so, you are not forbidden to cut the corrupt flesh.
Et oportet ut sit Serratura super locum corruptum parumper, ut non sit in concauitate ossis corruptio: et non appareat in apparitione sua sensui, et cogat ad Serraturam sui uice alia.	And it should be so that it is closed over the corrupt place a little, so that it does not appear in its appearance to the sense, and compels its own closure by another force.
Quod si os est corruptum, et non est eminens, imo continuatur pars eius cum parte: et corruptio est in medio eius, aut in parte ipsius: tunc detege carnem ab omnibus partibus totam.	That if the bone is corrupt, and it does not stand out, then a part of it continues with another part: and corruption is in its middle, or in some part of it: then you detect the flesh from all parts entirely.
Deinde pone lignum inferius.	Then place the ligament below.
Postea serra illud ex parte prima, ubi est corruptio, donec continuetur Serratura ex parte altera: et sit Serratura secundum longitudinem a corruptione parumper, secundum quod diximus.	Then close it from the first part, where there is corruption, until it continues to be closed from the other part: and let it be closed according to the length a little, according to what we said.
Quod si corruptio est in iunctura, incide ipsam iuncturam corruptam, et serra os ubi continuatur ex parte altera.	That if corruption is in the joint, then cut that joint corruption, and close the bone where it continues from the other part.
Si uero corruptio est in continuatione duarum iuncturarum, tunc non est in ea ingenium nisi abrasio.	But if corruption is in the continuation of two joints, then there is no strength in that except for a scar.
Quod si corruptio est in pectine manus, aut in pectine pedis: tunc res in eo est difficilis ualde.	That if corruption is in the palm, or in the sole: then the matter is difficult to mend very much.
Verum oportet, ut inquiras corruptionem qualiter appareat tibi.	It is true that you should inquire how corruption appears to you.
Et abradas eam, et mundes ipsam secundum quamcunque dispositionem tibi possibile est, et cum quocunque ingenio rectificatur tibi: quando non facit tibi contrarietatem Vena, aut Neruus.	And if it cracks, dry it and make it as clean as you can by means of whatever instrument is at hand and whatever skill you possess: when it does not give a contrary vein or nerve.
Et scias quod incisoria, et Serrae ad incidendum ista ossa sunt multa, secundum situm ossium, et praparationem eorum, et ipsorum grossitudinem, et subtilitatem eorum, et magnitudinem, et paruitatem ipsorum, et duriciem ipsorum, et eorum raritatem.	And know that there are many chisels and saws for cutting these bones, depending on the position of the bones and their preparation, and their thickness and fineness, and their size and porosity, and their hardness and their rarity.
Quapropter oportet, ut praepares omni speciei operationis instrumentum conueniens ad illam operationem.	Therefore you should prepare instruments suitable for all kinds of operations.
Et scias, quod operationes istae significant tibi super speciem instrumenti quo indiges, quando tecum est studium longum.	And know that these operations require a long-term study of the instrument you are using.
Et cognitio modorum huius artis, testimonium modorum aegritudinum: tunc enim iam inuenies per teipsum illud quod conuenit ei ex instrumentis ad omnem infirmitatem.	And knowledge of these ways of practice is a testimony to the types of sicknesses: for then you will find out by yourself what is suitable for him from instruments, for every disease.
Et ego sum firmans tibi in ultimo huius capituli numerum instrumentorum, quae pones exempla super quae incides, et probationem qua experiaris super alia.	And I confirm to you at the end of this chapter the number of instruments, which you place as examples for those that you cut, and a proof from your experience on other ones.
Forma Serrae.	(Shape of the Saw)
Forma alterius Serrae.	(Shape of another saw)
Forma Serrae alterius.	(Shape of yet another saw)
Forma Serrae alterius.	(Shape of still another saw)
Haec forma Serrae depicta, sit decenter facta.	This shape of the saw is slightly off-centered.
Fiat arcus eius superior, acuitas eius ex ferro: et manubrium eius ex buxo, et sit pyramidale decenter factum.	Let its bow be curved upward, and its keenness from iron: and its handle from beech, and its pyramid-like shape slightly off-centered.
Forma Rasorii iuncturarum.	(Shape of the scalpel)
Sit caput huius Rasorii, secundum formam capitis claui stellati: et puncta eius sint secundum formam punctorum elischetfegi.	(The head of this scalpel is shaped like a star-shaped claw): and its dots are shaped like the dots of an elk's horn.
Et non conuenit, nisi ut fricentur cum eo capita iuncturarum, quando corrumpuntur, aut os amplum, et magnum est.	And it is not suitable unless it rubs against the scalpels when it is cutting, when it is corroded, or has a wide and large mouth, and is great in size.
Forma maioris Rasorii.	(Shape of a larger scalpel)
Forma medii Rasorii.	(Shape of a medium-sized scalpel)
Forma Rasorii lati.	(Shape of a wide scalpel)
Forma Rasorii in quo est concauitas.	The shape is sharp.
Forma Rasorii alterius subtilis.	The shape is sharp.
Forma Rasorii alterius curuatae extremitatis.	The shape is sharp.
Forma Rasorii parui, subtilis tentae.	The shape is sharp.
Forma Rasorii cum quo inciduntur ossa.	The shape is sharp.
Forma etiam Rasorii magni.	The shape is also sharp.
Hoc similatur Radio, et extremitas est sicut Serra: exhibetur in locis multis ex rasione ossium.	This is similar to the radio, and the end is like a saw: it appears in many places from the cutting of bones.
Forma Rasorii quod conuenit ad rasionem eius quod perforatum est ex ossibus.	The shape is sharp, which is suitable for its incision, as it is pierced through bone.
Extremitas eius triangula, acutarum est extremitatum.	The end of it is triangular, and its ends are acute.
Fit ex Indi.	This fits from India.
Et similiter oportet, ut fiant omnia quae diximus ex Rasoriis, et Incisoriis, et Serris.	And likewise it is necessary that all that we have said of the rasors, and the incisers, and the saws be made.
¶ De incisione extremitatum, et Serratura ossium.	Regarding the incision of ends, and the sawing of bones.
Caput LXXXIX.	Head 89.
Putrefiunt extremitates, aut ex caussa extrinseca, aut intrinseca.	The ends rot, either from an external cause, or an internal one.
Cum ergo medicatus fueris illam corruptionem curatione medicinarum, et non confert curatio: et uides corruptionem incidere in membrum, quam non repercutit aliquid: tunc oportet ut incidas illud membrum usque ubi consequitu corruptio, ut euadat infirmus per illud a morte, aut a malicia quae est maior defectu membri.	But when the patient has been cured by medicines, and does not respond to treatment with medicines, and you see corruption affect a limb, but it does not spread to the whole body, so it is necessary to cut off that limb to where the corruption spreads, so that the sick person is saved from death, or from a greater defect of the limb.
Et signum cui accidit illud est, quod denigratur membrum, donec putetur: quod ignis combussit ipsum, aut putrefit post nigredinem: donec inciditur illa putredo usque ad illud quod sequitur illud membrum, et serpit in totum corpus.	And the sign that has happened to it, namely that it becomes corrupted, should be cut off until it is cured: for fire burns it and puts out its ardor, or腐敗後，直到它被治好：當它腐朽到身體那部分，並蔓延到全身。
Propera ergo cum incisione eius, et similiter si caussa corruptionis est a percussione quorundam uenenosorum: sicut scorpionis marini, et uiperae, et rutellae, et similium.	Then approach it with care, and likewise, if the cause of corruption is from percussion of certain venenosae (poisonous creatures): such as the sea scorpion, the spider, the rat, and others.
Si ergo corruptio, aut percussio est in extremitate digiti, tunc incide digitum, et non des spacium corruptioni, ut incedat usque ad reliquam manum.	Then if corruption, or percussion is at the end of a finger, then cut off the finger, and not leave room for corruption, so that it is cut off up to the remaining hand.
Et similiter si accidit in manu, tunc incide eam ex radice focilis, et non des spacium corruptioni, donec capiat in focili brachii.	And likewise, if it happens in the hand, then cut it from the root with a sharp knife, and not leave room for corruption, until it is taken off into the sharp-witted arm.
Et si inuadit in eo, tunc incide brachium apud cubitum in iunctura sua.	And if it has broken into it, then incision is made on the arm at the joint.
Si autem pertransit corruptio, et uides eum circiter cubitum: tunc in illo est mors infirmi.	But if corruption has passed through, and you see him around the hip: then death is in him.
Et administrare praeter illud ex curatione, est quantitas uirtus.	And to administer in addition to this cure, is a quantity of virtue.
Et similiter fac de pede, quando inuadit corruptio in digito, tunc incide ipsum apud unum nodorum: et si capit in pectine pedis, tunc incide pedem totum.	And likewise do for the foot, when corruption has entered into a toe, then incision is made on it at one of the joints: and if it has entered into the nail of the toe, then incision is made on the entire foot.
Si autem ascendit ad genu, tunc incide crus apud iuncturam genu.	But if it has ascended to the knee, then incision is made on the leg at the joint of the knee.
Quod si corruptio iam peruenit supra genu, tunc non est in ea ingenium, nisi dimissio, et relinquere infirmum morti.	That which if corruption has already reached above the knee, then there is no power in it, except for discharge, and leave behind the sick to death.
Et modus incidendi membrum, aut serrandi ipsum est, ut stringas ligamentum in inferiori, quem uis incidere: et stringe ligamentum aliud supra locum.	And the mode of incision on the limb, or of wrapping it up is, so that you tighten the ligaments below, which you wish to incise: and tighten another ligament above the place.
Et extendat minister ligamentum unum ad inferiora: et extendat minister aliud ligamentum superius ad sursum.	And let one minister extend a ligament to the lower: and let another minister extend a ligament upward to the upper.
Et tu separa carnem quae est inter duo ligamenta, cum Spatumili lato, donec detegatur caro tota.	And you separate flesh which is between the two ligaments, with your finger, until all the flesh is visible.
Deinde incidatur, aut serretur.	Then incision is made, or it is wrapped up.
Et oportet, ut ponas ab omnibus partibus pannum lini, et non tangat Serra locum sanum: et accidat infirmo laesio addita, et apostema calidum.	And it should be so, that you put a cloth from all parts before the wound, and so that it does not touch the healthy place of the incision: and so that the sick person suffers from injury, added to it, and the swelling is hot.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis interius dum operaris, tunc cauteriza locum uelociter: aut pone super ipsum quosdam pulueres abscindentes sanguinem.	But if blood flows inward while you are working, then the place is quickly burned: or put on it some powder which cuts the blood.
Deinde redi ad medicationem tuam, donec compleatur.	Then return to your own medication, until it is complete.
Deinde liga membrum uulneratum cum ligamento conueniente ei, et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then wrap the wounded limb with a suitable ligament, and care for it, until it heals.
Et ego narro tibi quod accidit uiro in pede suo, hoc idem accidens quod narro tibi.	And I tell you what happened to the man in his foot, this is the same accident that I tell you.
Quod est, quia accidit in pede suo nigredo, cum adustione quae assimilatur combustioni ignis: et corruptio illa in primis accidit in digito suo, donec coepit pedem totum.	That is, because it happened in his black foot, when the ash which resembles the burning of fire: and that corruption first occurred in one of his toes, until it began his entire foot.
Properauit ergo uir ex seipso, postquam uidit corruptionem incidere in membro cum uehementia eius, quod inuenit ex dolore, et adustione eius: et incidit ipsum apud iuncturam, et sanatus est.	So the wound was healed when he saw that a boil had formed on his limb, which he felt due to pain and itchiness, and he cut it open at the joint, and was cured.
Et postquam praeteriit ei tempus longum, accidit ei illa eadem corruptio in digito manus suae indice.	And after a long time had passed, the same corruption again occurred to him on his finger of his right hand.
Venit ergo ad me, et conatus sum recuperare illam superfluitatem cum eo quod posui super manum ex medicinis post mundificationem corporis eius: et non repercussa est superfluitas, et coepit incedere in digitum alium: donec coepit coruptio in manum.	So he came to me and I tried to remove the excess with him when I put on his hand some medicines after purifying his body: and there was no response to the excess, and it began to itch again on another finger: until the corruption began to spread on the hand.
Vocauit ergo me, ad incidendum manum eius: et nolui illud, sperans ex me super repercussionem illius superfluitatis: et timui etiam super ipsum apud incisionem manus eius mortem.	He called me to cut off his hand: and I did not want to do so, hoping for a response from it regarding the excess: and I was afraid even of cutting off his hand himself.
Quoniam uirtus uiri erat super casum.	For the strength of the arm was above falling.
Postquam ergo desperauit de me, reuersus est ad terram suam: et peruenit ad me de eo, quia properauit, et incidit manum suam totam: et sanatus est.	After he had despaired of me, he turned back to his land: and he approached me about it, because he wanted to recover, and he cut off all his hand: and he was cured.
Et non attuli hanc narrationem, nisi ut sit adiutorium super illud quod cadit de genere huius aegritudinis: et ut sit significatio qua significetur, et secundum quam agatur.	And I did not bring this story forward except to make it an aid in the case of such a sickness: and that it may be a sign, and according to what is relevant.
¶ De cura Sinuum, et qualitate clisterizationis cum medicinis.	Regarding the treatment of boils, and the quality of the lancing with medicines.
Caput XC.	Chapter 100.
Quando accidit apostema in quibusdam membris carnosis, et prolongatur spacium apostematis, donec collectionem facit saniei: deinde rumpitur, aut perforatur, et egreditur quod in eo est ex sanie, et remanet locus uacuus quasi sit uas: et cutis quae est super ipsum sicut pannus qui iam subtiliatus est: et non peruenit ad ultimum in corruptione sua, neque imprimit in os, neque in neruum, neque in ligamentum: meretur ut nominetur Sinus: et non nominatur Fistula: uerumtamen si prolongatur spacium eius, donec imprimat corruptio in aliquid horum membrorum, tunc nominatur Fistula, aut zuken.	When a boil occurs in some fleshy member, and the boil remains for a long time without breaking, until it makes the juice rise: then it bursts, or pierces, and the pus that is in it comes out, leaving a hole like a wound, and the skin over it becomes like a thin cloth: and it does not reach the end of its corruption, nor prints into the bone, nor into the tendons, neither does it touch the ligaments: it seemed to be called a Sinus: but it is not called a Fistula: however, if it prolongs that space, until it prints the corruption on some of those limbs, then it is called a Fistula, or a pustule.
Et cura eius est, ut incidas illam cutem totam sicut reuoluitur: et praecipue quando subtiliata est, et facta sicut pannus: et confidis quia non aaehaeret cum loco, propter corruptionem suam.	And the cure is such that you should strike off all of the skin like a garment; and most especially when it has been thinned out, and made like a piece of cloth; and be confident because it would not adhere to the place, for its corruption.
Si autem speras quod adhaereat cutis, et non consequitur ex eo corruptio illa ultima consecutione: et si in cute est spissitudo ex carne, tunc cura ipsum cum Clisteri: et est, ut consideres ad Sinum.	But if you hope that the skin will adhere, and does not follow from it that corruption: and if there is a thickness of flesh there, then the cure itself with the use of the plaster: and is, as you should consider towards the sinus.
Tunc si est magnus, et pus quod emittitur ex eo est foetidi odoris: tunc clisteriza ipsum cum medicamine aegyptio, quod est aceti, et olei, et ziniar, partes recipiens aequales, aggregentur in uase: et decoquantur super ignem, donec rubeat medicamen: et ueniat in spissitudinem mellis.	Then if it is large, and the pus that is discharged from it has a foul odor: then plaster it itself with the use of Egyptian medicine, which is vinegar, oil, and myrrh, equal parts, mixed together in a vessel; and let it boil on the fire until it turns red: and let it come to a consistency of honey.
Deinde accipe ex eo quod tibi necesse est: et dissolue ipsum cum aqua et melle, et clisteriza cum eo Sinum: et stringe orificium eius, et dimitte medicinam in eo ad quantitatem duarum horarum.	Then take from it what you need: and dissolve it with water and honey, and plaster it up with the sinuses; and tightly close the opening, and release the medicine into it for a duration of two hours.
Deinde extrahe ipsum cum expressione: fac illud diebus tot, donec mundificetur Sinus, et remoueatur foetor.	Then extract it with an expression: let it be for days, until the sinuses are cleaned out, and the smell is gone.
Et quandoque clisterizatur cum aqua cineris, quando non est tibi praesens hoc medicamen: et est, ut accipias cinerem lignorum uitis, aut cinerem ex lignis ilicis: et proiicias super eam aquam.	And whenever you plaster it with water of ash, when this medicine is not present: and is, as you should take ash from wood of oak, or ash from oak-wood: and pour it over the ash.
Deinde cola eam, et clisteriza cum ea, donec confidas quod Sinus iam ablutus est.	Then dip it in, and plaster it up with it, until you are confident that the sinuses are now clean.
Quod si infirmo non est tolerantia super medicamen aegyptium, neque aquam cineris, tunc clisteriza ipsum cum aqua et melle, cui iam permixtum est aliquid ex ziniar contrito.	That if the sick person does not tolerate the Egyptian medicine and water of ash, then plaster it itself with water and honey, in which has already been mixed a little crushed myrrh.
Aut clisteriza ipsum cum melle et uino permixtis, quoniam de proprietate mellis est, ut mundificet, et abluat: et uinum facit adhaerere Sinum, praecipue quando in uino est superfluitas stipticitatis et siccitatis.	Or plaster it itself with honey and wine because the property of honey is to clean and wash away: and the wine makes the sinuses adhere, especially when there is a surplus of stinginess and dryness.
Cum facis illud aliquotiens, et confidis quod Sinus corruptio iam remota est: tunc clisteriza ipsum cum eo quod facit nasci carnem in eo.	Whenever you do this, and are convinced that corruption has already been removed: then cleanse him with water along with what he does to give birth to flesh within him.
Et est, ut accipias ex emplastro dyafinicon: et dissoluas ipsum cum oleo rosato, et uino stiptico: aut clisteriza ipsum cum quibusdam medicinis, et unguentis aliis, quorum proprietates scripsi in tractatu unguentorum.	And is, that you take from an ointment dyafinicon: and dissolve it with oil of roses, and wine astringent: or cleanse him with certain medicines, and other ointments, whose properties I have written in a book about ointments.
Quod si orificium Sinus est strictum, in quo non capit cannula clisteris: tunc amplifica ipsum cum ferro parumper: aut pone in ipso licinium inuolutum in unguento aegyptio, aut in unguento basilicon, donec amplificetur.	That if the opening of the sinus is strict, in which the cannula of the clister does not enter: then increase it slightly with iron: or put in it a little licorium that has been infused in Egyptian ointment, or in basilicon ointment, until it increases.
Et similiter si est orificium etiam amplum, tunc aggrega labia eius cum sutura: et dimitte ex eo quantitatem in quam ingrediatur clistere sine additione.	And also if the opening is also wide, then add the lips together with a stitch: and let go out of it a quantity in which the clister enters without addition.
Et similiter si orificium eius ex quo currit pus, est eleuatum ad superiora: tunc seca ipsum in depressiori loco qui est in ipso, ut currat ex eo pus usque inferius: quoniam pus quando coartatur in profunditate Sinus, prohibet carnem generari in eo.	And also if the opening from which there runs pus is raised upwards: then dry it in a lower place which is in it, so that the pus runs down: for when the pus is held back in the depth of the sinus, it prevents flesh from being generated in it.
Quod si non est tibi possibile secare Sinum circiter inferius eius secundum quod uis: tunc conare, ut praepares membrum praeparatione qua currat ex eo pus cum facilitate secundum quod praeparatur tibi.	That if it is not possible for you to dry the sinus all around below it according to what you want: then be careful, that you prepare the member with a preparation which runs out of it pus easily according to which you are prepared.
Conare, ut non retineatur in eo aliquid ex pus omnino: et accipe medicinas consolidatiuas quae ponuntur super signum, conuenientes ad illud quod uis.	Be careful, that nothing of the pus is retained within it at all: and take medicines that are put on the patch, which are suitable for the sinus you want.
Et extende eas super pannum lini.	And extend them over a linen cloth.
Et sit pannus tantae quantitatis, qua fiat communicatio totius Sinus.	And place such a quantity of the cloth so that it communicates with all of the sinus.
Deinde incide cum forficibus in directo orificii Sinus foramen, amplius orificio Sinus parumper.	Then cut with pincers into the direct opening of the sinus hole, a slightly larger opening of the sinus.
Deinde extende ex unguentis lenibus super pannum alium, secundum quantitatem foraminis: et pone eum super ipsum positione longinqua ab orificio Sinus, ut alleuietur exitus pus ex eo: et non auferas pannum magnum, nisi post dies aliquos uice una.	Then extend from the ointment soft things over another cloth according to the quantity of the hole: and place it on the member at a distance from the opening of the sinus so that it allows the exit of pus out of it: and do not remove the large cloth, unless after a few days one time.
Ille autem qui est super orificium Sinus, est ille quem remoues in omni hora, ut egrediatur quod aggregatur in eo ex pus: et ut scias, an illud quod currit ex eo uirus, est multum, aut parum: aut digestum, aut indigestum.	But he who is above the sinus opening, is he who moves at all times so that he goes out what is gathered in him from pus; and know that this which runs out of it virus, is much or little: or digested or undigested.
Et cum hoc iterum considera locum Sinus ipsius, an in ipso sentiat dominus eius dolorem, aut non sit in eo dolor, et an sit in eo apostema, aut non sit in eo apostema.	And when you consider this place again of the sinus itself, does he not feel the master's pain, or is there no pain in it, and is there a pimple in it, or is there no pimple?
Cum ergo protenditur medicatio tua taliter, et uides materiam quae egreditur super orificium Sinus, tunc scias, quod Sinus iam adhaeret, aut approximat adhaerentiae: tunc ergo solue ipsum in mane, aut in tertio die: et quando soluis uulnus, tunc permuta pannum alium, et renoua unguentum.	So when your treatment extends thus far, and you see the matter that comes out over the sinus opening, then know that the sinus is already attached, or approaching attachment; so then dissolve it in the morning, or on the third day: and when you dissolve the wart, then change the cloth with another, and renew the ointment.
Si autem egreditur ex Sinu post spacium longum uirus subtile, tunc non desperes de adhaerentia eius, nam sanatio eius appropinquat, quoniam ex hominibus sunt qui tardant generationem carnis in uulneribus suis, et ex eis sunt qui agunt econtrario illius.	But if the virus comes out of the sinus after a long time interval, then do not despair of its attachment, for its healing approaches, because from men there are those who delay the generation of flesh in their wounds, and from them there are those who act in opposition to it.
Si autem egreditur ex Sinu post dies multos pus indigestum, tunc scias quod sinus non adhaeret.	But if it comes out of the sinus after many days with undigested pus, then know that the sinus does not attach.
Si ergo tardatur adhaerentia Sinus, et prolongatur res eius: tunc adde in exiccatione medicinarum, uerum faciant medici, ut sint medicinae in substantia sua humidae, et in uirtute sua siccae: sicut unguentum dyafinicon, quando additur in eo superfluitas additionis ex zegi.	But if the attachment of the sinus is delayed and its course is prolonged, then add to the drying up of medicines, truly let doctors do so that they be in their substance moist, and in their virtue dry: as the balm of daphnescene, when added thereto an excess of addition with zagi.
Et ex magis ultimo quo curatur, est, ut accipias unguentum dyafinicon, et soluatur cum oleo rosato, et roretur super ipsum uinum antiquum aequale in substantia sua.	And from the greater part, when it is cured, take the balm of daphnecene, and dissolve it with rose oil, and let it flow over the old wart in equal substance.
Deinde confice ipsum cum eo, et utere ipso.	Then bind it up with that, and use it.
Et iam facit simile huic actioni, quando non est tibi praesens unguentum dyafinicon, mel, quando decoquis ipsum, donec ingrossetur, et uteris eo.	And this same action of yours is similar to that of the balm of daphnecene when it is not present with you, honey when you heat it up until it thickens, and use it.
Aut accipe myrrham, et aloen, et olibanum: tere totum, et pulueriza illud super mel dum est super ignem.	Take myrrh, and aloe, and olibanum: mix them together and reduce them to a fine powder, and sprinkle it on honey while it is being heated.
Deinde line super ipsum pannum, et stringe ipsum super Sinum: et line cum melle quod decoquisti, donec ingrossatum est: et pulueriza super ipsum species, et pone super ipsum pannum, et stringe eum.	Then cover the wound with a cloth, and bind it tight over the sinew: and cover the cloth with the honey you have prepared, until it has thickened: and sprinkle the powder on the wound, and put the cloth back over it, and bind it tight.
Et quandoque administratur in illo aristolochia longa, et radices lilii coelestis, et est lilium: et farina herbi, et centaurea.	And when this is applied to him, take long-leaved aristochaos and the roots of the star lily, and there is a lily; and herb flour, and the daisy.
Utere eis simplicibus, aut aggregatis, tere ea, et cribella ipsa: et pulueriza super mel quod narraui, et utere eo.	Use them in their simple state, or crushed up, mix them well, and sprinkle the powder on the honey you have prepared, and use that.
Quod si prolongatur res Sinus, et non sanatur hac curatione: tunc scias, quod in profundo eius est corruptio: aut iam facit impressionem in ossibus, aut in reliquis membris duris, aut ligamentis: tunc cura ipsum curatione Fistularum, secundum quod praemissum est.	If the injury does not heal with this treatment, then know that there is corruption in its depths; or it has already made an impression on the bones, or the other hard organs, or the ligaments: then treat it with treatments for fistulas, as has been set out.
¶ De cura Panaritii et unguis attritae, et incisione digiti additi, et sectione.	Of the treatment of finger injuries and the use of ointments and incisions of the fingers and their sectioning.
Caput XCI.	Chapter LXI
Panaritium est apostema quod nascitur sub ungue pollicis manus, aut pedis: et fortasse nascitur in reliquis digitis.	Is a finger injury that arises under the nail of the thumb or another finger, and perhaps it also arises in the other fingers.
Cum ergo prolongatur res eius, et negligitur curato eius, et apostematur apostemate calido: aut corrumpitur, et emittit pus, donec corrodit radicem unguis: et fortasse corrumpit eam totam, et fortasse peruenit corruptio ad os, donec est ei odor foetidus: et fit extremitas digiti lata, et fit color eius fuscus.	But when this injury persists and its treatment is neglected, and it becomes infected with pus: or it corrupts, and discharges it from the nail root: and perhaps it corrupts all of it, and perhaps the corruption reaches the mouth, until it has a foul smell: and the tip of the finger becomes swollen, and its color turns dark.
Quando ergo tu curas ipsum, cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio tua: tunc oportet ut incidas cum ferro totam superfluitatem quae remansit ex ungue.	When you treat this finger, following the division that we have described, and your treatment does not bring about a cure: then you must cut off all the excess that remains from the nail.
Deinde cauteriza uulnus post illud.	Then cauterize the finger after that.
Cauterium enim iuuatiuum est ualde.	For a cauterized wound is very hot.
Si uero os est sanum, et est unguis etiam sana, et additiones uacuae unguis iam comprimunt carnem ad interiora, et incipiunt pungere ipsam, et laedunt eam: tunc oportet ut ponas Radium subtilem sub angulo unguis quae pungit carnem, et impelle eam sursum: et incide eam carnem cum facilitate, et pone super illud quod remanet de carne ex medicinis comburentibus, corrosiuis, donec remoueatur totum eius.	If the bone is actually sound, and the nail also is sound, and the calluses of the nail are already pressing the flesh to the interior, and they begin to sting it, and hurt it: then it is necessary that you put Radium subtil under the angle of the nail which stings the flesh, and push it upward: and cut the flesh with ease, and place over it what remains of the meat from the medicines burning, scorched until all of it has moved.
Deinde cura illud cum unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then the care for that with the nail, until it heals.
Si autem corruptio iam imprimit in os, tunc oportet ut incidas illud os, et extrahas ipsum: non enim sanatur unquam dum permanet in eo os corruptum.	If however the corruption has already impressed on the bone, then it is necessary that you cut that bone and take it out: for the bone does not heal at all while it remains in it.
Quod si uides corrosionem et corruptionem incedere in digitum, tunc incide eum in uno nodorum, secundum quod praemissa est eius rememoratio.	That if you see the corruption and the corruption entering into the finger, then cut it at one of its joints, according to what has been said above in memory of it.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then the care for the finger, until it heals.
Si autem accidat ungui attritio, aut percussio: et contingit in ea dolor uehemens, tunc oportet ut phlebotomes infirmum in primis.	If however there is a loss of the nail, or a knock: and there comes into it a severe pain, then it is necessary that you draw blood from the injured part at first.
Deinde seca unguem cum Spatumili acuto sectione transuersa de sursum ad uisum.	Then dry the nail with a sharp Spatula from above towards the nail.
Et custodi, ne sectio perueniat ad carnem quae est sub ungue, nam tu facies accidere per illud super infirmum dolorem uehementem, et erit caussa ad natiuitatem carnis additae in loco.	And guard, so that the cut does not reach the flesh under the nail: for you will cause to happen through it a severe pain in the injured part, and it will be a cause of birth of flesh added in place.
Deinde cura locum cum eo quod sedat dolores.	Then the care for the place with him that sits with the pains.
Digitus uero additus qui nascitur in quibusdam manibus hominum, fortasse est carnosus totus: et fortasse sunt in quibusdam eorum ossa, et fortasse est in eo unguis: et quidam eorum nascitur in radice iuncturae, aut est natiuitas eius in quibusdam nodis digiti.	The finger however that is added which is born in some hands of men, perhaps is fleshy all over: and perhaps are bones in it, and perhaps has a nail there: and the birth of some of its joints, or is the birth in some of its joints of the finger.
Ille ergo qui nascitur in quibusdam nodis digiti, non mouetur: et ille qui nascitur apud iuncturam digiti, fortasse mouetur.	This one then that is born in some joints of the finger does not move: and this one that is born at the joint of the finger, perhaps moves.
Eius ergo qui ex eis est carnosus, sectio eius facilis est.	Therefore, he who has flesh, his sectioning is easy.
Quod est, ut incidas ipsum apud radicem suam cum Spatumili lato.	That is, so that you strike him at the root with a broad flat chisel.
Eius autem cuius natiuitas est in radice iuncturae curatio, est difficilis.	But as for the one whose birth is in the root of the joint, his cure is difficult.
Abstine ergo ab incisione eius.	So then abstain from incising him.
In illo uero qui nascitur in digito apud ultimum nodorum, tunc oportet ut incidas in primis carnem eius incisione rotunda usque ad os.	But as for the one who is born in a finger at the very last of the nodes, then you must strike him first with a round incision all the way down to the jaw.
Deinde serra os cum una illarum Serrarum conuenientium ad illud.	Then tighten the jaw with one of the appropriate saws for that.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then cure him, until he is healed.
Consolidatio autem quae accidit digitis adinuicem, multotiens accidit aut ex natiuitate hominis, id est, nascitur cum eo, aut a consolidatione uulneris, aut combustione ignis, et similibus.	But as for the consolidation that has occurred in the fingers, it often happens or from the birth of man, that is, he is born with it, or from the consolidation of the wound, or from the burning of fire, and similar things.
Oportet ergo ut seces illam consolidationem, donec redeant digiti secundum formam suam naturalem.	So then let him separate that consolidation, until the fingers regain their natural shape.
Deinde pone inter eos licinia, aut pannos infusos in oleo rosato: ut non consolidentur uelociter, et separa inter eos: aut pone inter eos laminam plumbi subtilem, donec consolidetur locus secundum quod oportet.	Then place between them a linen cloth, or cloths soaked in rose oil: so that they do not quickly consolidate, and separate them from each other: or place between them a thin lead sheet, until the area is consolidated as it should be.
Et similiter si accidat consolidatio quibusdam digitis cum palma, tunc seca illam consolidationem, secundum quod praeparatur et conuenit figurae membri.	And similarly, if a consolidation occurs in some fingers with the palm, then dry out that consolidation, according to how it is prepared and suited for the shape of the limb.
¶ De incisione Vitium.	Regarding the Incision:
Caput XCII.	Chapter LII. The Head.
Uites sunt Venae inuolutae, grossae, plenae superfluitatibus melancholicis quae accidunt in pluribus membris corporis: et plurimum euentus earum est in cruribus, praecipue in cruribus iter agentium et laborantium, et portantium.	Veins are swollen, large, and full of melancholy excesses that occur in many parts of the body: and many of them end in the legs, especially in the legs of those who walk a lot, and those who carry loads.
Oportet ergo ut administres excussionem corporis ex cholera nigra aliquotiens excussione forti.	So then let him administer to the body a strong exhaustion from black cholera sometimes with an infusion.
Deinde phlebotoma patientis eas basilicam.	Then draw blood from the patient's arm with a bowl.
Curatio uero earum cum ferro, est secundum duos modos.	The cure of these veins with iron is according to two methods.
Vnus eorum est, ut secentur, et extrahatur sanguis niger.	They should cut off the leg, and draw out the black blood.
Et modus alter est, ut eleuetur Vena, et extrahatur tota.	And another way is, that they should cut away the vein, and draw all of it out.
Sectio uero eius est secundum hunc modum.	The sectioning, however, is according to this method.
Embroca crus in primis cum aqua calida multum, donec resoluatur sanguis grossus faeculentus.	First wrap the leg with warm water until the black, foul blood dissolves.
Deinde stringe crus infirmi a superiori parte coxae eius, usque ad inferiorem partem genu cum uitta.	Then tie the leg by the upper part of the hip, all the way down to the knee with sutures.
Deinde seca uenam in loco uno, aut duobus, aut tribus sectione ampla.	Then cut off a wide strip of vein at one, two, or three places.
Deinde eleua, id est, extrahe sanguinem in manu tua ab inferiori parte cruris, usque ad sursum, et a superiori oportet ut phlebotomes infirmum in primis.	Then squeeze the blood out by hand from the lower part of the leg, all the way up to the top, and it should be done first by the phlebotomist so that the patient does not faint.
Deinde seca unguem cum usque inferius: donec egrediatur ex sanguine quantitas quam uides sufficere, et quam tolerat uirtus infirmi.	Then cut off the nail down to the bottom: until a quantity of blood is shed which you see is sufficient, and which the strength of the nurse can tolerate.
Postea liga eam: et praecipe ei, ut abstineat a cibis generantibus choleram nigram: et itera euacuationem et phlebotomiam, quando implentur Venae, et nocet illud infirmo.	Then tie it up: and command him to abstain from foods that generate black cholesterol; and again, to let go of the blood when the veins are filled, and this will harm the patient.
Eleuatio autem eius est secundum hunc modum.	The raising, however, is according to this method.
Rade crus infirmi, si in ea sunt pili multi.	Shave the leg if there are many hairs.
Deinde intromitte ipsum in balneum: aut embroca ipsum in crure eius cum aqua calida, donec rubeat, et exuberentur Venae: aut exercitetur exercitio forti, si non est ei praesens balneum, donec calefiat membrum.	Then put him in a bath, or wrap him in the leg with warm water until he reddens, and the veins burst; or exercise him strongly if there is no bath present, until he warms the limb.
Deinde seca cutem in directo uenae sectione per longitudinem: aut in ultimo eius apud genu, aut in inferiori parte eius apud calcaneum.	Then cut off the skin according to the direction of the vein along its length: or at the end of the leg at the knee, or on the lower part near the heel.
Deinde aperi cutem cum uncinis, et excoria uenam ab omni parte, donec appareat sensui: et est apud apparitionem eius, quod uides eam rubeam ad nigredinem decliuem.	Then open the skin with a hook, and scrape off the vein from all parts, until you can see it; and when you see it turn from red to black, you will know that it is the right one.
Cum ergo uadit ex cute, uides eam albam quasi sit chorda.	When, therefore, you have cut off the skin, you will see it white as a cord.
Deinde intromitte sub ea Radium, donec quando eleuatur et egreditur de cute: suspende eam cum uncino caeco, leni.	Then insert the rod under it until it comes out and leaves the skin: hang it with a blind hook, soft.
Deinde seca sectionem aliam prope illam sectionem tribus digitis.	Then dry another piece of flesh next to that piece of flesh with three fingers.
Deinde excoria cutem a superiori parte uenae, donec appareat.	Then scrape the skin from the upper part of the buttocks until it appears.
Deinde eleua eam cum Radiis sicut fecisti, et suspende eam cum uncino alio, sicut fecisti in primis.	Then clean it with the rods as you did before, and hang it with another blind hook as you did at first.
Deinde seca sectionem aliam, aut sectiones plures, si indiges illo.	Then dry another piece of flesh or more pieces if you can tolerate it.
Deinde eleua, et incide ipsam ultima sectione apud calcaneum.	Then clean it again and cut it last near the heel.
Deinde extrahe eam ad sectionem quae est supra eam.	Then pull it out to the length of the piece that is above it.
Et fac illud, donec extrahas eam ex sectione quae est superior, uel altior sectionibus omnibus, donec quando egreditur tota: tunc incide eam.	And make it so that you pull it out from the upper piece or longer pieces until it comes out completely: then cut it.
Si autem non obedit tibi ad extrahendum, et eleuandum: tunc intromitte acum cum filo forti duplo, et liga eam, et extrahe ipsam: aut intromitte sub ea Radium: et reuolue manum tuam ad omnem partem, donec egrediatur.	If it does not submit to you when pulling and cleaning, then insert a strong double thread with her and tie her and pull her out: or insert the rod under it and roll your hand all over it until it comes out.
Et caue, ne incidatur.	And cut, so that it is not cut.
Nam si incidatur, fit difficile tibi eleuare eam ualde, et ingreditur super infirmum ex ea nocumentum.	For if it is cut, it will be difficult for you to clean it well, and it enters on the injured part of the wound.
Cum ergo extraxeris eam totam: tunc pone super locum uulnerum lanam submersam in uino et oleo rosato, aut oleo: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	When you have completely pulled it out: then place it on the site of the wound that is soaked with wine and oil or rosin, and care for it until it heals.
Quod si Vitis est contracta, habens tortuositatem cui sit inuolutio ad partes, et non est sicut diximus secundum rectitudinem: tunc oportet ut findas super eam ad omnem partem tortuositatis eius, et loca inuolutionis ipsius.	That if the vine is contracted and has a twist in its parts to which it applies the involution, and is not like what we said according to rectitude: then you should find on it for all the parts of its twist, and the places of its involution.
Deinde suspende eam cum uncinis, donec eleues eam totam: et caue apud sectionem tuam super eam ne incidas uenam, aut uulneres: nam difficile fiet super te eleuare, uel extrahere eam.	Then hang it with a hook so that you clean it all: and be careful near the cut section on it so that you do not get hurt, or hurt your wound: for it will be difficult to clean it well on you, or pull it out.
Conserua ergo prudentiam tuam.	Preserve therefore your prudence.
Forma Incidentis quo sanatur Vitis.	Form of incision where the vine heals.
Forma Vncini caeci.	Form of incisions in a blind person.
Non est ei curuitas sicut reliquis Vncinis, neque est acutae extremitatis, ut non uulneret uenam: et est grossae flectuositatis, lenis: quoniam si esset subtilis, incideret uenam subtilitate sua: imo sit ei superflua grossitudo, sicut diximus.	It is not prudence like the rest of the vine, nor has it acute extremities, lest it wound the hand: and it is a great flexibility, soft: for if it were subtle, it would fall on the hand with its subtility: but it has superfluous grossness, as we have said.
De extractione Venae cruris.	On the extraction of a vein from the leg.
Caput XCIII.	Chapter XCI.
Haec Vena generatur in cruribus in terris calidis, sicut Alizegi, et terra Arabum, et in terris aridis, calidis, paucae teneritatis, id est, in quibus non nascitur herba, neque arbor.	This vein is produced in the legs in warm countries, such as that of a horse, and the land of the Arabs, and in arid lands, hot and scarce of verdure, that is to say, where no grass grows, nor trees.
Et fortasse generatur in locis aliis corporis praeter crura.	And perhaps it is produced in other parts of the body besides the legs.
Et generatio quidem eius est a putrefactione quae accidit sub cute, sicut accidunt intra corpora serpentes et uermes ascarides, et uermes generati inter cutem et carnem.	And its generation is from putrefaction which occurs under the skin, such as happens within the bodies of serpents and flies, and of worms between the skin and meat.
Et signum incaeptionis euentus huius Venae est, quod accidit in crure inflammatio uehemens.	And the sign of the beginning of this vein is, that which happens in the leg, a painful inflammation.
Deinde uesicatur locus.	Then the site becomes sore.
Deinde incipit Vena exire ex loco illius uesicationis, quasi sit radix plantae, aut animal.	Then the vein begins to exit from the site of its inflammation, as if it were a root of a plant, or an animal.
Cum ergo apparet ex ea extremitas eius, tunc oportet ut inuoluas super ipsam frustum plumbi, cuius pondus sit ex drachma keil, usque ad drachmas II et noda ipsam: et dimitte plumbum suspensum ex crure.	So when that end thereof appears, you shall wrap thereon a leaden rod, the weight of which is from a drachm to a centune, to two drachms, and mark it: and let go the lead hanging from the leg.
Quotiens ergo egreditur ex ea aliquid ad exteriora, inuolue illud in plumbo, et noda illud.	So whenever anything goes out from it towards the outside, wrap that on a leaden rod, and mark that:
Quod si prolongatur multum, tunc incide partem eius, et inuolue residuum.	That if it is prolonged for a long time, then cut a part of it, and wrap the remnant on a leaden rod.
Et non incidas eam radicitus antequam egrediatur tota.	And do not cut that root before it has gone out all together.
Quoniam si incidis, contrahitur, et ingreditur in carnem: et facit accidere apostema, et putredinem in loco, et ulcus malum.	For if you should cut it, it will contract itself, and go into the flesh: and it causes the formation of a boil, and putrefaction in that place, and a bad sore.
Quapropter oportet, ut suauiter tractetur, et extrahatur paulatim, donec egrediatur ex ultimo sui, et non remaneat ex ea aliquid in corpore: et ex hac quidem Vena egreditur in quibusdam hominibus quod est in longitudine sua quinque palmorum et decem.	So then it should be handled gently and slowly withdrawn until it has completely emerged from the last of its own, and nothing remains of it in the body: and from this very vein emerges in some men which is in length of five palms and ten.
Et iam peruenit ad me, quia exiuit uiro ex XX palmis.	And already I have reached him, for he has passed out through twenty palms.
Si autem inciditur tibi in hora medicationis tuae: tunc intromitte radium in foramine eius, et perfora eam foramine longo, cum corpore, donec euacuetur totum quod est in ea ex materia: et administra putrefactionem loci cum medicinis diebus aliquot.	But if you are injured during your treatment: then introduce a ray into the opening and pierce it through the long hole with the body until all the matter inside is emptied out: and administer medicine to the site with some drugs for several days.
Deinde cura ipsum curatione apostematum.	Then take care of yourself in curing the pustules.
Et haec quidem Vena quandoque habet ramos multos, praecipue quando apparet in iunctura pedis, aut in pede ipso: et accidunt ei orificia multa, et egreditur ex omni orificio ramus.	And this very vein sometimes has many branches, especially when it appears in the ankle joint of the foot, or in the foot itself: and it has many openings, and emerges from every opening with a branch.
Cura ergo ipsam, sicut diximus in diuisione, et cum eo quod praemissum est.	So take care of yourself, as we have said in the division, and with that which was said above.
¶ De sectione super Vermes generatos sub cute, et dicitur Aegritudo bouina.	Regarding the section on worms born under the skin, it is called "aegritudo bouina.
Caput XCIIII.	Head 84th
Haec Aegritudo nominatur in quadam terra apud nos Aegritudo bouina: propterea, quia multotiens accidit bouibus, et est uermis paruus unus, qui nascitur inter cutem et carnem.	This sickness is called in some country "Aegritudo bouina" because it often happens that worms are born and there is a scaly single one which is born between the skin and flesh.
Et uadit in corpore toto, ascendendo et descendendo: et ostenditur sensui apud ambulationem eius de membro ad membrum, donec disrumpit ubicumque disrumpit in cute locum, et egreditur.	And it makes the whole body move up and down, and shows itself through the movement of a limb to another, until it breaks off at some place on the skin and emerges: and it disappears from that member to another.
Et generatio eius est ex putredine quorundam humorum.	And its birth is of some corrupted human flesh.
Sicut accidunt uermes et serpentes, id est, lumbrici, et ascarides in uentre.	As happen worms and snakes, that is, earthworms and roundworms in the stomach.
Et timetur ex malicia eius.	And they fear its evil.
Quia quando ipse uadit in corpore, et eleuatur ad caput, et peruenit ad locum: tunc fortasse aperit in eo, et egreditur, et destruit oculum: et accidit illud multotiens.	Because when it makes itself in the body, and moves to the head, and reaches a place: then perhaps it opens within, and emerges, and destroys the eye: and this happens often.
Cum ergo uis curare eum, et extrahere ipsum, tunc non fit illud nisi apud ambulationem eius, et apparitionem ipsius sensui.	And so you should take care of him and extract it, then he will not feel that until he walks on it and feels the sensation himself.
Oportet ergo, ut stringas quod est supra eum, et quod est sub eo cum ligamento constrictione forti.	It is necessary therefore that you should tie what is above him and what is below him with strong constriction.
Deinde seca super ipsum, et extrahe eum.	Then dry off on top of him, and extract it.
Quod si profundatur in carne, et non inuenis ipsum: tunc pone super locum cauterium cum igne, donec moriatur.	If it penetrates the flesh, and not injure him: then place on the spot a caustic with fire, until he dies.
Et maius quod timetur, est corruptio eius, qua corrumpit oculum, sicut diximus.	And greater what is feared, is corruption of it, which corrupts the eye, as we have said.
Si autem uides eum iam peruenisse in capite prope oculum, tunc stringe sub eo supercilium strictura bona.	But if you see him already reaching at the head near the eye, then tie under it a good stricture of the eyebrow.
Deinde seca super ipsum, et extrahe eum.	Then dry off on top of him, and extract it.
Et oportet ut utatur infirmus mundificatione sui corporis, cum medicinis soluentibus humores putridos malos.	And it is necessary that the sick one should use his own purification, with physicians dissolving bad putrid humors.
Et caueat sibi a cibis generantibus putrefactionem.	And let him beware of foods that generate putrefaction.
¶ De sectione super aegritudinem Nakir.	[On the section on illness by Nakir.]
Caput XCV.	Chapter L.
Haec aegritudo nominatur in terra nostra Nakir: et est dolor qui accidit in quibusdam membris: deinde permutatur de membro ad membrum.	This disease is called in our land Nakir: and it is a pain that happens to some member: then it changes from one member to another.
Et ego quidem iam uidi ipsum, secundum quod narro tibi.	And indeed I have already seen him, according to what I tell you.
Vocatus sum ad mulierem infirmam in quibusdam uillis.	I was called to a sick woman in some wombs.
Et detexit brachium suum, et uidi inflationem paruam in uena funis brachii.	And she held out her arm, and I saw an inflammatory swelling in the armpit of the arm.
Et postquam remansi hora una, uidi unam inflationem incedere cum focili, sicut incedit uermis, ascendendo ad humerum eius uelocius quam esse potest: ut sit sicut argentum uiuum, quando currit de loco ad locum.	And after an hour had passed, I saw one swelling go down with fire, like a burn, rising faster than it could go up: so that it is like shining silver when it runs from place to place.
Recessit ergo dolor ex illo loco, et fixus est in humero.	Then the pain receded from that place, and was fixed in the shoulder.
Deinde sedi hora una, et cucurrit in reliquum corpus, donec perueniret in brachium aliud.	Then after an hour he sat, and ran all over his body until it reached another arm.
Deinde narrauit mihi, quia reuoluebatur in toto corpore suo, secundum quod uidi.	Then he told me that he was running all over his whole body, according to what I saw.
Miratus sum ergo de uelocitate permutationis eius de membro ad membrum.	I marvel therefore at the swiftness with which he changes from one limb to another.
Et ego quidem ante illud non uideram hanc aegritudinem oculis meis taliter secundum hunc modum.	And I too did not see this disease with my eyes before this way.
Verumtamen uidi multos, qui inueniunt dolorem permutari de membro ad membrum: et non uidi ipsum oculis, sicut uidi eum in muliere.	But I see many who suffer the pain of change from one limb to another: and I did not see him with my eyes, as I saw him in a woman.
Et ego non cogito illud esse, nisi quod est propterea, quod mulier fuit ex illis qui sunt ex uillis sicci corporis detectarum uenarum: hinc ergo apparet sensui illa uentositas permutata.	And I do not think that this is because it is he who is from the scaly limbs of the spotted women: therefore, this sense of change seems to me to arise from that.
Et est necesse, ut non appareant secundum hanc rationem in illis qui sunt deliciosi, et corporibus humidis, occultarum uenarum.	And it is necessary so that they do not appear in this way in those who are delightful and have moist bodies, of hidden women.
Cum ergo uis curationem eius, et sentit patiens illud dolorem: tunc si est apparens tibi oculo, sicut diximus, tunc stringe supra ipsum, et sub ipso uelociter: et seca supra ipsum, donec egrediatur illa uentositas coartata: et cauteriza locum.	But when you are performing his cure, and the patient feels this pain: then if it appears to you with your eye, as we have said, then lift him up and move him quickly: and dry him above him until he is free of this change: and burn the place.
Si autem non uides ipsum oculis tuis: tunc cura ipsum cum excussione corporis, et cum eo quod expellit uentositates, et carminat eas cum pillulis foetidis, et pillulis de serapino, et similibus.	But if you do not see him with your eyes: then cure him by peeling his body, and along with it so that he expels the winds, and makes them red with the help of foul pills and pills made from serapine, and others like them.
¶ De extractione Sagittarum.	Về việc loại bỏ các gai hành.
Caput XCVI.	Chương 66 đầu.
Sagittae diuersificantur secundum species suas, et secundum loca in quibus cadunt ex corpore.	Gài hành khác nhau theo loài và vị trí của chúng trong cơ thể.
Earum uero diuersitas est: quoniam ex eis sunt quae habent cuspides magnos, et paruos: et concauae, et surdae.	Nhưng có nhiều loại khác nhau: vì có những cái có gai lớn và nhỏ, và tròn, và nhọn, và đen.
Et ex eis sunt quae habent tres angulos.	Và trong số chúng có những thứ có ba góc.
Et ex eis quibus sunt linguae.	Và từ số đó có lưỡi liềm.
Et ex eis quibus sunt astellae.	Và từ số đó có các sao.
Illae uero quae sunt secundum membra in quibus cadunt, est secundum duos modos.	Nhưng những thứ nằm theo chiều dọc của các chi thì rơi theo hai cách.
Aut enim membra sunt ex membris principalibus concauis, sicut cerebrum, et cor, et epar, et pulmo, et renes, et intestina, et uesica, et eis similia.	Hoặc những chi chính của cơ thể, chẳng hạn như não bộ, tim, phổi, thận, ruột và bàng quang thì tròn.
Quando ergo cadit in aliquo horum membrorum, et apparent tibi signa mortis, quae ego narro tibi post, tunc oportet ut deuites extractionem illius sagittae ex eis, nam mors consequitur illum in quo est, in pluribus dispositionibus.	When then falls into one of these limbs, and apparent to you are the signs of death, which I shall tell you about later, then it is necessary that you extract this arrow from them, for death follows him where he is, in many dispositions.
Et quando non apparent tibi ista signa mala, et sagitta non est absconsa in profunditate membri, tunc extrahe ipsam, et cura uulnus.	And when these bad signs do not appear to you, and the arrow is not hidden deep within the limb, then extract it, and heal the wound.
Ex signis enim cerebri quando cadit in eo sagitta, et penetrat os, et egreditur siphac quod est super cerebrum, est: quoniam accidunt ex illo soda uehemens, et scotomia, et uertigo, et rubedo in oculis, et inflatio, et rubedo linguae, et spasmus, et permixtio intellectus, et uomitus cholerae.	For when the signs occur in which the arrow enters the bone and goes out through the skull, it is: for then happen from it violent headache, scotoma, vertigo, reddening of the eyes, swelling, reddening of the tongue, spasm, confusion of thought, and paralysis of cholera.
Et fortasse egreditur sanguis ex naribus, aut auribus.	and perhaps blood comes out from the nose, or ears.
Et fortasse abscinditur sermo, et destruitur uox.	and perhaps speech is lost, and speech is destroyed.
Et egreditur ex loco uulneris humiditas alba similis pulti.	And comes out from the wound place a white, similar to pulp moisture.
Et exit ex eo simile aquositati carnis.	And comes out from it a similar liquid of meat.
Si ergo apparent tibi ista signa, tunc abstine a curatione, et extrahe sagittam si non egreditur.	If then these signs appear to you, then refrain from curing, and extract the arrow if it has not come out.
Signa autem sagittae quando cadit in corde, sunt: quod ipsa est prope mammillam sinistram: et sentit cum ea quasi ipsa sit fixa in re dura, non in re uacua.	The signs of the arrow when it falls into the heart are: for it is near the left nipple: and feels as if it were fixed to a hard thing, not to a soft thing.
Et fortasse sagittae est motus similis motui pulsus: et currit ex uulnere sanguis niger.	And perhaps the arrow has a movement similar to a pulsation: and black blood runs from the limb.
Et sequitur illud frigus extremitatum, et sudor frigidus, et syncopis.	And follows it extreme coldness of the extremities, and cold sweat, and fainting.
Scias ergo, quod mors descendit procul dubio.	Know therefore that death has certainly come.
Et signum sagittae quando uulnerat pulmonem, est exitus sanguinis spumosi ex uulnere: et uasa quae sequuntur collum, apostematur, et mutatur color infirmi.	And the sign of the arrow when it wounds the lung is the exit of frothy blood from the limb: and the clothes that cover the neck are torn, and their color changes, as the nurses tell.
Et expirat spiritum magnum, altum: et quaerit attractionem aeris frigidi.	And breathes a great, deep breath, and seeks cold air.
Quod si cadat sagitta in uelamen, quod est in pectore: tunc est prope costas paruas: et fit anhelitus magnus cum dolore uehementi, cum suspirio: et mouentur omnia membra humerorum.	If the arrow falls into a wound that is in the chest: then it is near to the few ribs: and causes a great, painful sighing with a sigh: and shake all the shoulders of the arms.
Et si cadat sagitta in stomachum, tunc fortasse egreditur ex uulnere ex cibo aliquid indigestum.	And if a arrow falls into the stomach, then perhaps it will come out of the ulnar bone with some undigested food.
Et si cadit sagitta in Ventrem, et figitur in eo: egreditur aliquid stercoris ex uulnere, aut zirbum, aut intestinum quod iam disruptum est.	And if an arrow falls into the belly and lodged therein: it will come out of the ulnar bone, or a piece of dung, or an intestine which has already been broken.
Non est ergo spes in curatione eius, neque in extractione sagittae.	There is therefore no hope for his cure, nor for the extraction of the arrow.
Quod si sagitta cadat in Vesicam, et egrediatur urina: et procedit ex ea aliquid ad exteriora, et fortior sit dolor super infirmum: tunc scias, quia est mortale.	If an arrow falls into the bladder and passes out through it: and if anything comes out to the outside, and the pain is greater on the sick person: then you should know that it is a lethal wound.
Reliqua autem membra, sicut facies, et collum, et guttur, et spatula, et adiutorium, et spondiles dorsi, et furcula, et coxa, et crus, et eis similia ex membris saluantur secundum plures dispositiones: quando non inuenit sagitta arteriam, aut neruum: et non est sagitta uenenosa.	The rest of the limbs, such as the face, neck, throat, jaw, aid, spine, collarbone, femurs, thighs, legs, and similar bones, are saved according to multiple dispositions: when the arrow does not hit an artery or nerve: and there is no deadly arrow.
Et ego narro tibi quod uidi de esse harum sagittarum, ut significes per illud super curationem tuam.	And I will tell you what I have seen of these arrows, so that you may understand it with regard to your cure.
Quod est, quia cuidam uiro cecidit sagitta in lachrymali oculi eius, in radice nasi.	That is, because an arrow fell into the tear duct of a man's eye, at the root of his nose.
Extraxi ergo eam ipsi ex parte altera, sub adipe auris eius: et sanatus est, et non accidit ei in oculo eius nocumentum.	So I extracted it for him on the other side, under the fat of his ear: and he recovered, and there was no harm to his eye.
Et extraxi sagittam aliam Iudaeo, quae cecidit ei in adipe oculi sui sub palpebra inferiori: et sagitta iam occultata erat, et non consecutus sum ex ea nisi extremitatem paruam eius, cum qua adhaeret in ligno suo: et erat sagitta magna ex sagittis arcuum Turcorum, cum ferro leni, in qua non sunt aures.	And I extracted another arrow from the Jew, which had fallen into his fat under his lower eyelid: and the arrow was now hidden, and I could not extract it except for the tip of his ear, where it adhered to its wood: and it was a large arrow of the arrows of the Turks, with soft iron, in which there are no ear-holes.
Sanatus est ergo Iudaeus, et non accidit in oculo eius accidens malum.	The Jew therefore recovered, and there was no bad accident to his eye.
Et extraxi sagittam aliam ex gutture Christiani.	And I extracted another arrow from the throat of a Christian.
Et erat sagitta arabica, et est illa cui sunt aures.	And it was an Arabic arrow, and that one has ears.
Secui ergo super ipsam inter duas guidegi: et iam submersa erat in gutture eius.	So I tied a knot around it between two threads; and it was already submerged in his throat.
Subtiliatus sum ergo cum ea, donec extraxi eam: et sanatus est Christianus.	So delicate was I when I drew it out, that it bled profusely; and the man recovered.
Et extraxi sagittam aliam uiro quae ceciderat in uentre eius: et cogitauimus, quia moreretur ex ea.	And I took out another arrow from the belly of the man who had fallen; and we were thinking that he would die of it.
Postquam ergo praeterierunt ei triginta dies, et non mutatum est super eum aliquid ex dispositionibus eius, secui super sagittam: et ingeniaui super eam, et extraxi eam: et sanatus est, et non accidit ei accidens malum.	After that, he remained with us for thirty days, and there was no change in him regarding his condition, so I tied a knot around the arrow; and I cut it off from him, and he recovered, and nothing bad happened to him.
Et uidi uirum cui cecidit sagitta in dorso eius, et consolidatum est uulnus super eam.	And I saw a man who had an arrow in his back, and the wound was healed over it.
Postquam ergo fuit post septem annos, exiuit sagitta in radice coxae eius.	After that, he was out of bed after seven years, and the arrow had come out from the root of his thigh.
Et uidi mulierem cui cecidit in uentre suo sagitta, et consolidatum est uulnus super eam, et remansit sagitta intra ipsam: et non mutata est ex dispositionibus eius aliqua, et mulier non inuenit ei nocumentum in aliqua ex operationibus suis naturalibus.	And I saw a woman who had an arrow in her belly, and the wound was healed over it, and the arrow remained inside her; nor did she have any change regarding her condition, and this woman didn't notice any harm in any of her natural functions.
Et uidi uirum alium, cui cecidit sagitta in facie sua: et consolidatum est uulnus, et remansit, non inueniens ei multum dolorem: et similia istis multa.	And I saw another man, to whom an arrow had fallen on the face; and the wound was healed over it, and remained there, causing him no great pain; and similar things were many.
Et extraxi sagittam uiro ex principibus Regis, quae ceciderat ei in medio nasi sui, et iam declinauerat ad partem dextram parumper: et occultata erat sagitta tota.	And I took out an arrow from the prince of the king, which had fallen into his nose, and had already fallen towards the right side a little; and the arrow was completely concealed.
Vocatus sum ergo ad curationem eius post casum sagittae usque ad tres dies.	So I was called to heal him after the loss of the arrow for three days.
Inueni ergo uulnus sagittae strictum ualde.	Then I found the arrow's shaft tightly bound.
Inquisiui ergo eam cum tenta subtili, et non sensi eam: et ipse quidem inueniebat punctionem et dolorem sub aure sua ex parte dextra.	So I asked him what it felt like, and he didn't feel it either; but himself felt the prick and the pain on his right side.
Speraui ergo, quod erat illa punctio ex extremitate sagittae.	I hoped that was where the prick came from.
Emplastraui ergo locum cum emplastro in quo erat uirtus attractiua, et digestiua, confidens apud me, quod apostemaretur locus, et appareret mihi signum sagittae, ut secarem super eam: et non accidit in loco accidens significans quod sagitta consecuta sit locum.	So I applied a plaster to the place where the power of attraction and digestion came from, trusting myself that the place would heal; and it appeared to me a sign of the arrow, so that I could tie it up: and nothing happened in that place indicating that the arrow was still there.
Assiduaui ergo cum emplastro super eum diebus multis: et non accidit accidens, et consolidatum est uulnus interim: et remansit infirmus de extractione eius spacio dierum, donec sensit sagittam die quodam intra nasum suum.	Therefore be diligent with the plaster on it for many days; and there was no accident, and the break mended in the meantime; and he remained weak from the removal of it for some space of time, until one day he felt a bowstring in his nose.
Et narrauit mihi illud.	And he told me that.
Posui ergo super illud uulnus medicinam acutam, corrosiuam diebus multis, donec apertum est: et cum tenta tentaui ipsum, et sensi extremitatem sagittae subtilem quae adhaeret in ligno.	So I put a sharp medicine on the break, and tried it after many days, until I felt a slight pain of the bowstring sticking to the wood.
Deinde addidi in apertione uulneris per illam medicinam acutam, donec apparuit nobis uisibiliter extremitas sagittae: et praeteriit mihi cum eo spacium temporis circiter quatuor menses.	Then I added more of the sharp medicine to the opening of the wound, until we could see the end of the bowstring clearly; and it passed by me with that space of time of about four months.
Deinde postquam amplificatum est uulnus, et possible fuit mihi intromittere forcipes in ipsam, et mouere ipsam, et non obediuit ad exitum: tunc non cessaui subtiliare, et ingeniare super eam cum modis ingeniorum, donec coepi super eam die quodam cum forcipibus decenter factis, secundum quod ueniet forma eorum in fine capituli, donec extraxi eam.	Then after the swelling of the wound had lessened, and it was possible for me to stick my finger into it, and move it, and not come out: then I did not cease to be diligent, and thought up means with which to deal with it, until one day I stuck it in with bent fingers, according to the form of their ends, so that I drew it out.
Deinde restauraui uulnus.	Then I restored the break.
Et medici quidem iudicant, quod cartilago nasi non restauratur.	And some doctors say that the nose cartilage is not restored.
Restauraui ergo ipsam, et consolidatum est uulnus, et sanatus est infirmas sanitate integra: nec nocuit ei aliquid omnino.	I restored it, and the break mended, and the injury was healed completely in health: and he did not hurt him at all.
Et ego narro tibi qualitatem extractionis quarundam sagittarum: ut ponas illud regulam et significationem super illud quod non dixi.	And I tell you the quality of the extraction of some bowstrings: so that you put that rule and sign on it which I did not say.
Quoniam partes huius artis et distinctiones earum non comprehenduntur cum narratione: neque comprehendit illud liber, et artifex prudens comparat cum pauco super multum: et cum eo quod est paesens, super illud quod est absens: et inuenit operationem nouam, et instrumentum nouum apud descensus rerum extranearum huius artis quando accidunt.	For the parts of this art and their distinctions are not understood when they are told: nor does that book understand, and the skilled craftsman compares little with much: and he finds a new operation and a new instrument for going down things which are outside the scope of this art when they happen.
Dico ergo, quod sagittae non egrediuntur ex membris quibus sunt fixae, nisi secundum duos modos.	I say then, that bowstrings do not come out of the member from which they are fixed, unless by two ways.
Aut per attractionem ex loco ex quo intrauit.	He entered through a door from which he was attracted.
Aut contrario partis alterius.	Or by another part on the opposite side.
Et illa quae egreditur unde intrauit, aut est sagitta procedens in loco carnoso: et attrahitur, et egreditur.	And that which had exited from where he entered, or is a projectile proceeding in fleshly place: and it is attracted, and it exits.
Quod si non obedit ad exitum ex hora in qua cadit: tunc oportet ut dimittas ipsam aliquot diebus, donec putrefiat caro quae est in circumitu eius: et alleuietur attractio eius, et eius egressio.	That if it does not obey to exit at the time in which it falls: then it is necessary that you should let go of that for a few days, until it putrefies the flesh which is in circumambiention of it: and the attraction of it shall be alleviated, and its exit.
Et similiter si figitur in osse, et non obedit tibi ad exitum, tunc dimitte ipsam etiam aliquot diebus: et itera eam cum attractione et motione omni die, donec egreditur.	And also if it is figured in a bone, and does not obey to you to exit, then you should let go of that also for a few days: and repeatedly make it with the attraction and movement every day, until it exits.
Quod si non obedit tibi ad exitum post dies, tunc oportet ut perfores in circumitu sagittae in ipso osse ab omni parte cum terebro subtili, donec amplificentur sagittae.	That if it does not obey to you to exit after days, then it is necessary that you should perform in circumambiention of the projectile in that bone with a sharp material from all parts until it increases.
Deinde attrahe eam, et extrahe ipsam.	Then attract it, and extract it.
Si autem sagitta est fixa in capitis osse, et iam processit in uno uentrium cerebri, et apparent ex infirmo quaedam illorum accidentium quae dixi: tunc abstine ab attractione sagittae, et dimitte eam, donec aequetur esse eius post dies.	If however the projectile is fixed in a bone of the head, and has already proceeded in one ventrum cerebri, and appears from an accident of those which I mentioned: then abstain from attracting the projectile, and let go of it, until it becomes equated to be in its place after days.
Nam si sagitta peruenit ad sifach, tunc mors non prolongatur ei.	For if the projectile reaches to the soft part, then death does not prolong for him.
Et si sagitta non est fixa, nisi in corpore ossis tantum, et non penetrat usque ad sifach: et remanet infirmus aliquot diebus, et non accidit ei ex illis accidentibus aliquid: tunc ingenia in attractione sagittae et extractione eius.	And if the projectile is not fixed, unless it penetrates to the soft part only through a bone's body, and remains for a few days, and nothing happens to him from those accidents: then you should use your devices in attracting the projectile and extracting it.
Si autem est fixa ualde, et non obedit tibi ad attractionem: tunc administra terebella in circumitu sagittae, sicut narraui tibl: deinde cura locum, donec sanetur.	If however it is fixed tightly, and does not obey to you to attract: then administer sharp devices in circumambiention of the projectile, like a needle: then take care of the place, until it heals.
Si autem Sagitta iam absconsa est in loco corporis, et occultatur et absconditur a sensu: tunc inquire eam cum tenta.	If however the projectile has already gone out from its place in the body, and is concealed and hidden from your sense: then seek it out.
Si autem sentis eam, tunc attrahe eam cum quibusdam instrumentis quae conueniunt attractioni eius.	If you feel it, then draw it with some instruments suitable for drawing.
Si autem non potes super eam, propter constrictionem uulneris, et propter longitudinem sagittae in profundo: et non est illic os, neque neruus, neque uena: tunc finde super eam, donec amplificetur uulnus, et sit possibile extrahere sagittam.	If you cannot stretch it out above the bone because of the constriction of the skin, and its length in the deep: and there is no bone, nor nerve, nor vein: then find on it till the tendon thickens and becomes able to be pulled out the arrow.
Quod si sunt ei aures quibus teneatur, tunc libera carnem fixam in eis ab omni parte, omni ingenio quo potes illud, et ingenia, si non potest super euasionem carnis in fractura aurium, et contorsione earum, donec euadat.	If it has ears that can hold the hook, then free the meat from within them with all your skill and effort: and if you cannot remove the meat from the break in the ears, and their twist, till it heeds.
Et tu quando administras extractionem Sagittae, in quocumque loco est, tunc utere contorsione manus tuae, cum forficibus ad partes omnes, donec facias eam euadere: et subtilia ultima subtilitate, ut non frangatur Sagita, et fiat difficilis tibi attractio eius, et ipsius extractio.	And you, whenever you are extracting the arrow, whatever part it is in, then use your twisted hand with forceps to all parts, till you make it heede: and the finest of things, so that the arrow does not break, and makes it difficult for you to attract it, and its extraction.
Quod si non potes super eam ex hora una, tunc dimitte eam diebus aliquot, donec putrefiant quae sunt in circumitu eius.	If you cannot take hold of it in one hour, then leave it for a few days, till what is around it rotten.
Deinde itera eam: alleuietur enim tuncia Si uero contrarietatem tibi facit fluxus sanguinis, tunc administra quod diximus ex curatione in capitulo suo: et custodi uirtutem tuam ab incisione uenae, aut nerui, aut chordae.	Then try again: for if the flow of blood annoys you, then administer what we said in our book on curing: and guard your skill from cutting into bone, or nerve, or tendon.
Et administra ingenium omni modo quo tibi possibile est euasionis Sagittae: et sit illud cum facilitate, et tranquillitate, uel tarditate, et firmitate, sicut narraui tibi.	And administer skill in every way that is possible for you to remove the arrow: and let it be with ease, and quietness, or slowness, and strength, as I told you.
Et oportet, ut facias cum trahis Sagittam, ut infirmus sit secundum figuram, secundum quam fuit apud casum Sagittae in ipso.	And it should be, that when you are drawing the arrow out, so that it is bent according to its shape, according to what it was like at the time of the break of the arrow in itself.
Quoniam est magis iuuatiuum.	Since it is more careful.
Si autem non est tibi possibile illud, tunc administra quod tibi est possibile ex figuris.	If you cannot do that to it, then administer what is possible for you in shapes.
Sagitta autem quae egreditur ex contrario partis alterius, aut iam procedit ex ea aliquid ad exteriora: aut facit gibbositatem extremitas Sagittae per sensum ex superiore parte cutis propinquae, et uides eam eminentem: seca ergo super eam, et sit sectio secundum quantitatem quod capiant in ea forcipes.	But the arrow which is coming out of the opposite part, or has already come out a little to the outside: or makes the end of the arrow go up by sensation from the upper part of the skin nearby, and you see it rising: so cut off over it, and let the section be according to the quantity that the forceps hold in it.
Deinde attrahe eam: ipsa namque fit facilis ad exitum.	Then attract him: for it is easy to bring about death.
Si uero retinetur in osse, tunc torque manum tuam secundum rotunditatem, donec imprimat Sagitta in osse, et amplificet sibiipsi: deinde trahe ipsam.	But if it is retained in the bone, then twist your hand according to the roundness, until the Arrow prints on the bone, and amplifies itself: then pull it out.
Et si non: dimitte eam diebus aliquot: deinde itera eam, donec egrediatur.	And if not: let it go for a few days: then repeat it, until it leaves.
Quod si lignum Sagittae est in ea, tunc impelle ipsam cum eo.	That if the Arrow is in it, then push it with it.
Si autem cecidit lignum, et uis administrare impulsionem: tunc intromitte ad eam instrumentum concauum, ut ingrediatur concauitas eius in caudam Sagittae: deinde impelle eam cum ipso.	But if it has fallen, and you administer a push: then introduce the sharp tool into it, so that its sharpness enters at the end of the Arrow: then push it with it.
Si autem Sagita est concaua, tunc impelle eam cum instrumento intrante in ipsam.	But if the Arrow is sharp, then push it with the instrument that enters into it.
Sagitta enim alleuiatur per illud.	For the Arrow glides through it.
Quod si Sagitta est toxicata, tunc oportet, ut concaues carnem totam, in qua est uenenum: si est tibi possibile illud.	That if the Arrow is poisoned, then let him make a sharp flesh, in which there is poison: if you can do that.
Deinde cura eam cum eo quod conuenit ad illud.	Then take care of it with him when it comes to that.
Quod si Sagitta est cadens in pectore, aut in uentre, aut in uesica, aut in latere: et est propinqua ex eo quod tangis cum tenta, et possibile est tibi secare super eam: tunc seca, et caue ab incisione uenae, aut nerui, et extrahe eam.	That if the Arrow is falling in the chest, or in the belly, or in the vein, and is close to that which you touch by trying, and it is possible for you to cut above it: then cut, and guard against the incision of the vein, or nerve, and remove it.
Deinde sue uulnus, si uides, et cura illud, donec sanetur.	Then take care of the wound, if you see it, and guard that, until it heals.
Et haec est forma Forcipum, quibus extrahuntur Sagittae.	And this is the form of the pincers, with which the Arrows are removed.
Sint extremitates similes rostro auis, quae factae sunt sicut ferra: quando capiunt super Sagittam, non dimittunt eam.	The ends should be similar to the ear, which have been made like irons: when they grasp on to the Arrow, they do not let go of it.
Et fiunt ex eis species multae, magnae, et paruae, et mediae, secundum quantitatem magnitudinis Sagittae, et paruitatis eius, et amplitudinis uulneris, et constrictionis eius.	And they are made in various shapes, large and small, and medium, according to the length of the Arrow, and its thickness, and the constriction of the wound.
Forma Impellentis concaui.	Form of the Pincer.
Et forma Impellentis surdi.	And form of the Pincer is deaf.
Hoc est surdae extremitatis sicut Radius, ut alleuietur introitus eius in sagittam concauam, et impellatur cum eo.	This is the extremities of the radius as regards the entrance into the arrowhead and it is forced with it.
Huius extremitas impellentis concauae est concaua sicut penna auis: ut alleuietur introitus sagittae in ipsam et impulsio eius.	This extremities, when impelling concauld, are concauld like the feather of a bird: that is to say, the entrance into the arrowhead and its impulsion.
¶ De phlebotomia Venarum.	On venesection of veins.
Caput XCVII.	Chapter LVII. On venesection of veins.
Uenae phlebotomandae, quarum cucurrit consuetudo in corpore, sunt triginta.	The venesections, of which there is a tradition in the body, are thirty.
Ex quibus in capite sunt sexdecim: duae Venae pulsatiles, quae sunt post aures, dictae duae Herbae: et duae Arteriae, quae sunt in duobus timporibus apparentes: et duae Venae quae sunt in duobus lachrymalibus duorum oculorum, quae dicuntur Aspicientes: et Vena praeparata in medio frontis: et uena quae est in extremitate nasi.	From which in the head are sixteen: two pulsating veins, which are behind the ears, called two herbs; and two arteries, which are appearing in two temporals; and two veins, which are in the two tear ducts of the two eyes, called two aspics; and a vein prepared in the middle of the forehead; and a vein that is at the end of the nose.
Et duae Guidegi, quae sunt in collo.	And two jugulars, which are in the neck.
Et duae uenae quae sunt in labio superiore oris.	And two veins, which are in the upper lip of the mouth.
Et duae uenae quae sunt in labio inferiore.	And two veins, which are in the lower lip.
Et istae sunt uenae quae dicuntur Algecherich.	And these are called Algecilla.
Et duae uenae quae sunt sub lingua.	And two veins, which are under the tongue.
Venae autem quae phlebotomantur in brachiis, sunt quinque uenae in omni brachio.	The venesections, however, in the arms, are five veins in every arm.
Vna earum est Cephalica, et est ex latere syluestri: et nominat eam uulgus uenam capitis.	One of them is the cerebral vein, and it comes from the side of the wood; and it is called by the common name of the head vein.

Et phlebotomia earum fit secundum duos modos.	And the phlebotomy of them is done according to two ways.
Aut pungendo cum phlebotomo myrtino lato: aut oliuari ad subtilitatem decliui: aut secando cum phlebotomo cultellari, et est Alnesil.	Or with a needle and phlebotomize on the point of a pin: or oiling to soft the drying-out: or cutting with a knife, and it is Alnesil.

Sic Alnesil est, quod conuenit ad sectionem.	Thus Al-Nisīl is, which is suitable for the incision.
Et ex eis sunt species latae, et subtiles secundum amplitudinem uenarum et stricturam earum Forma phlebotomi myrtini sit lata, sicut uides.	And from them are wide species, and subtle according to the width of their ears and their form The shape of the phlebotomy of the myrrh tree is wide, as you see it.
Et conuenit ad aperiendas uenas concauas, plenas, procedentes, apparentes, grossas, et illas quae continent sanguinem grossum, turbidum.	It is suitable for opening closed veins, full, coming from the skin, apparent, thick, and those that contain thick blood, turbulent.
Et iste phlebotomus est minoris latitudinis, et subtilioris extreminatis.	And this phlebotomist is smaller in width, and more subtle at its ends.
Et conuenit ad phlebotomiam uenarum subtilium, quae continent sanguinem subtilem citrinum	It is suitable for the phlebotomy of thin veins that contain thin citrines blood.
¶ De phlebotomia Basilicae.	[The text continues with a discussion of the "Basilica" vein.]
Basilicae autem quae est una harum trium uenarum phlebotomiae iuuamentum est.	(But the "basilica" which is one of the three veins that phlebotomy should be performed on.)
Quia extrahit sanguinem ex aegritudinibus, quae sunt sub gutture et collo, ex eo quod sequitur pectus, et uentrem: et conuenit phlebotomatori cum phlebotomat eam, ut caueat, et sit super timorem ex ea nam sub ea est arteria.	(Because it draws blood from the ailments that are below the throat and the neck, since it follows the chest and the belly; and it is suitable for the phlebotomist to cut her, so that he warns about her, and because under her is an artery.)
Si ergo errat, et addit in punctura phlebotomi, incidet illam arteriam, et accidet fluxus sanguinis.	(So if he makes a mistake, and adds to the incision of the phlebotomy, he will cut that artery, and will cause the flow of blood to stop.)
Quapropter oportet, ne phlebotomet eam cum phlebotomo pungente: imo sit secans cum Alnesil.	(Therefore it should not be performed with the phlebotomist while he punctures it: but rather it should be performed using An-Nisīl.
Quod si non apparet Basilica apparitione manifesta, tunc oportet, ut alienes ipsam, et permuteris ad aliam, aut quaeras aliquem ramum eius: aut phlebotomes loco eius Funem brachii.	(If the "basilica" does not appear with a clear sign, then you should separate it, and turn it to another one, or you should seek some of its branches: or you should perform phlebotomy at the place of its branch of the femoral artery.)
Ipsa enim est manifesta, et seca eam cum phlebotomo Anesil, sicut diximus.	(Indeed it is apparent, and dry it out with Al-Nisīl using the phlebotomist as we have said.)
Si autem uis phlebotomiam ipsius eiusdem, tunc oportet ante stricturam brachii, ut tangas locum, donec cognoscas locum pulsus.	(But if you want to perform the phlebotomy on its own, then you should touch the end of the arm before the pulse stops, until you know the place.)
Deinde signa super locum cum encaustro, postea brachium, et seca uenam sectione concaua cum phlebotomo Alnesil, sicut diximus.	Then mark the spot with a caustic, and then the arm, and dry out the vein using an incision using Al-Nisīl as we have said.
Et caue ne cadat percussio per spacium a loco arteriae.	And so that the blow does not fall through space from the place of the artery.
Et quando uides, cum tu stringis ligamen, inflationem in loco quem signasti cum encaustro, tunc illa inflatio est inflatio arteriae: deuita ergo eam.	And when you see, as you tighten the ligature, swelling at the place you have marked with cautery, then that swelling is swelling of the artery: so remove it.
Quod si uides sanguinem apud phlebotomiam salire, sicut urina pueri, et est sanguis subtilis, rubeus: tunc scias, quia est ex sanguine arteriae.	That if you see blood rise at the phlebotomy site, like a boy's urine, and it is pale blood, red: then you know that it is from the artery's blood.
Tunc ergo propera, et pone digitum tuum super ipsum spacio longo, deinde aufer digitum tuum.	Then therefore approach, and place your finger on the same space far away, then remove your finger.
Si ergo abscinditur sanguis (multotiens namque abscinditur) tunc stringe brachium, et dimitte ipsum: et caueat infirmus a motione eius: et sit super timorem eius.	If then is severed the blood (for indeed it is often severed) then tighten the arm, and let go of it: so that he does not move at all: and let him sit on his fear.
Et non moueat ipsum diebus aliquot, donec sanetur.	And let him not move for several days, until he is healed.
Si autem non abscinditur sanguis, et uincit te: et non est tibi praesens in momento tuo medicina, tunc incide arteriam, si apparet tibi.	If then is not severed the blood, and it knocks you down: and there is no present remedy for you at your moment: then cut the artery, if it appears to you.
Nam extremitates eius contrahuntur, et abscinditur sanguis.	For its ends do contract, and the blood is severed.
Aut accipe corticem fistici, et finde eum: accipe medietatem unam, et stringe eam super locum uenae strictura decenti, cum ligamento et puluillis usque ad diem alium.	Or take the skin of the palm, and find it: take a half, and tighten it over the place of the artery narrowing, with a ligature and powder until another day.
Tunc si abscinditur sanguis, est bonum.	Then if is severed the blood, it is good.
Et si non: tunc cura ipsum cum eo cuius praecessit rememoratio ex loco puluerum abscindentium fluxum sanguinis: et abscisio sanguinis eius non est difficilis in pluribus dispositionibus, propter locum paruum uulneris, et possibilitatem ligamenti ex brachio.	And if not: then take care of the person with him which his memory from the place of the powder-flushed blood: and severing that blood is not difficult in many dispositions, because of the small wound, and possibility of the ligature from the arm.
¶ De phlebotomia uenae Fuscae.	On phlebotomy of the vein of the palm
Venae autem Fuscae phlebotomiae iuuamentum est, quod trahit sanguinem ex superiori parte capitis, et inferiore corporis: propterea, quia est composita ex ramo Basilicae, et ramo Cephalicae, sicut diximus.	Of the veins However phlebotomy is a technique that draws blood from the upper part of the head, and the lower body: because it is composed of the branch of the Basilica, and the branch of the Cephalic, as we have said.
Et conuenit phlebotomanti eam, ut sit super timorem ex phlebotomia eius, nam sub ea est neruus.	And it belongs to the phlebotomist to make it sit on his fear from its phlebotomy, because under it is a nerve.
Si ergo addit in punctura phlebotomi, et inuenit neruum, accidit in ea stupor, et difficilis fit sanatio eius, et fortasse non sanatur penitus.	If therefore he adds phlebotomy to the puncture, and the nerves remain unhealed, then a stupor will occur, and its healing will be difficult, and perhaps it will not heal completely.
Et iste neruus multotiens apparet sensui.	And this nerve often appears to sensation.
Si autem occultatur in quibusdam hominibus, et est subtilis, et non ostenditur: tunc oportet ut ponas phlebotomiam tuam qua eam phlebotomas, sectionem cum Alnesil, et deuita neruum cum fortitudine tua.	But if it is concealed in some people and is fine and not visible: then you should put your phlebotomy there which you phlebotomize, section with Alnece, and remove the nerves with your strength.
Quod si uena est inter duos neruos, tunc finde uenam in longitudine.	Which if it is between two nerves, then find one nerve in length.
¶ De uena Cephalica.	De the head.
Phlebotomiae autem uenae Cephalicae iuuamentum est, quia attrahit sanguinem ex capite, et confert ad aegritudines oculorum.	But the phlebotomy of the cerebral vein is a support, because it draws blood from the head, and contributes to the sickness of the eyes.
Et oportet in hac uena proprie, si uis, ut phlebotomes eam pungendo cum phlebotomo oliuari, aut cum phlebotomo myrtino: quoniam est saluior uenarum omnium, quoniam non est subea arteria, neque neruus.	And you should use this proper vein if you want, so that you phlebotomize it with the phlebotomy oil, or with the phlebotomy myrrh: because it is salutary for all veins, because it is not under an artery, nor a nerve.
Verumtamen conuenit tibi apud phlebotomiam, ut deuites cum phlebotomo caput lacerti tantum, et quaeras locum leniorem: et non nocet ei, si non inuenitur cum percussione prima, ut iteretur super eam cum phlebotomia aliquotiens.	But it is necessary for you to phlebotomize, that you go with the phlebotomy only at the back of the head, and ask for a softer place: and it does not hurt him if he has not been discovered with percussion first, so that he returns over it with phlebotomy from time to time.
Verumtamen fortasse apostematur in quibusdam hominibus quando non phlebotomatur in percussione prima, sed non nocet ei illud apostema in aliquo.	But perhaps he stops bleeding in some people when he is not phlebotomized in the first percussion, but it does not hurt him that stop-bleeding in some.
¶ De utilitate Phlebotomiae, et cautelis in ea obseruandis.	Of the utility of Phlebotomy and the observations to be made in it.
Qualitas autem Phlebotomiae, et accidentia eius ex ea, in cuius rectificatione oportet te cogitare.	The quality of Phlebotomy and the events from it that you should consider in its correction.
Primum ergo illius est de quo oportet ut scias, quod phlebotomia non administratur, nisi in conseruatione sanitatis, et perseuerantia eius, et cautela ab aduentu aegritudinum.	First therefore of its is that you should know, that phlebotomy is not administered unless in the conservation of health, and perseverance of it, and caution from the advent of sickness.
Et ut fiat phlebotomia in una uenarum trium quae sunt in cubito, scilicet Cephalica, et Fusca, et Basilica.	And let phlebotomy be made from one vein of the three that are in the bed, namely the cerebral, and the fuscă, and the basilica.
Et ut fiat phlebotomia in principio Veris super ieiunium, in uere, et aestate: et autumno, et hyeme post comestionem, quando apparent significationes repletionis.	In order that phlebotomy be performed at the beginning of spring, during fasting, in summer and autumn after a meal, when there are signs of bloating.
Et fiat phlebotomia in die primo, aut in tertio, postquam praeterierint de die tres horae.	And let phlebotomy be performed on the first day, or on the third day, after three hours have passed since the last meal.
Phlebotomia autem quae administratur in aegritudinibus, non habet horam determinatam: sed quando prouocat conuenientia et necessitas ad illud, in nocte, aut die, et in omni hora, et in omni tempore.	But phlebotomy that is administered to the sick does not have a determined time: but when occasion and need prompt it, at night, or during the day, and at any hour, and at all times.
Et non oportet, ut phlebotomentur pueri, donec ueniant super eos quatuordecim anni.	And it is not necessary that boys be bled until they are fourteen years old.
Neque phlebotometur mulier praegnans, nisi a mense quarto usque ad septimum.	Nor should a pregnant woman be bled until the seventh month.
Neque phlebotomentur senes, qui iam pertransierunt sexaginta annos.	Nor should elderly people be bled who have already passed their sixty years.
Cum ergo aliquis uult phlebotomari propter quemcumque modum sit: oportet, ut mundificet intestina sua ante phlebotomiam cum clisteri leni, si in eis est stercus multum retentum: ut non attrahant uenae apud phlebotomiam ex intestinis superfluitates putridas nocentes membris principalibus.	Since, however, anyone may choose to have phlebotomy in any way that he wishes: it is necessary for him to cleanse his bowels before phlebotomy with laxatives, if they have accumulated a great deal of waste therein: so that the venose vessels are not drawn upon by putrid excrements from the intestines which harm the principal members.
Neque phlebotometur patiens toctina, id est, satietatem nauseatiuam: neque crapulatus, neque euadens ab ebrietate, donec remoueatur illud ab eis.	Nor should a patient who is dizzy or nauseous be bled: nor those who have drunk wine, until they have removed that from them.
Neque infirmus cum hydropisi.	Nor a sick person with hydropisis.
Et caueatur phlebotomia iterum post colicam passionem, et uomitum, et fluxum uentris, et multiplicationem coitus, et laboris, et exercitii, et uigiliarum, et ieiunii, et omnis quod dissoluit uirtutem ex re corporea aut animali.	And let phlebotomy be performed again after a fever, and a fainting, and a flux of blood, and an increase in sexual intercourse, and labor, and exercise, and vigils, and fasting, and any that dissolve virtue out of the corporal or animal body.
Deinde considera in subtilitate humorum ante illud, si sanguis est grossus cum cibis et potibus, et medicinis: si possibile est ei illud.	Then consider the temperaments of the humors before that, if the blood is thick with food and drink, and medicine: if it is possible to do so.
Deinde introeat balneum, si non prohibet ipsum aliquid: aut exercitetur aliquo exercitio, ut subtilietur sanguis.	Then give him an enema of cold bath, if he does not object to anything: or let him exercise himself a little, as to subtilize the blood.
Et pone phlebotomiam eius in pectore, circa tertiam diei, sicut diximus: et conare, ut euacuetur pectus eius illa die ex omnibus accidentibus animalibus malis: sicut angustia, et ira, et timor: et ex omnibus accidentibus corporeis, sicut labor, et poena, et superfluicoitus, et illis similia.	And let him place phlebotomy in his bosom on the third day of the week, as we have said: and take care, so that his chest is emptied of all animal evils on that day: such as anger, fear, and dread: and of all bodily evils, such as labor, pain, excesses, and things similar to them.
Et sedi suae faciat esse praesentes res cum quarum usu cucurrit consuetudo hominum ex aromaticitate, et odoramento, et tripudio et similibus illis per quantitatem possibilitatis.	And so that these things may be present with her, for from which habit of man used to come, from the aromaticity and odour and mirth and similar things by quantity of possibility.
Deinde sedeat phlebotomator super puluinari, quod sit altius quam puluinar phlebotomandi: postea extrahat brachium suum, et fricet ipsum phlebotomator manu sua bis, aut ter.	Then he shall sit the phlebotomator on top of the arm, which should be higher than the arm that is to be phlebotomized: then he shall draw out his own arm, and shall rub the phlebotomator with his own hand twice, or three times.
Deinde stringat ligamentum cum corrigia, et inuoluat eam bis.	Then he shall tighten the ligature with the thongs, and shall wrap it up twice.
Et sit strictura temperata, quoniam strictura quando est inaequalis, aut per superfluitatem in strictura, tunc prohibet cursum sanguinis: aut in mollificatione, tunc etiam prohibet cursum sanguinis.	And let the constriction be tempered, for when the constriction is uneven, or by excess in the constriction, then it prevents the course of blood: or in softening, then also it prevents the course of blood.
Deinde post stricturam oportet, ut fricet phlebotomandus manus suas simul adinuicem, donec inflentur uenae, et declarentur sensui.	Then after the constriction, let the phlebotomator rub his hands together in opposite directions until the veins are dilated and feel to the touch.
Deinde abstergat phlebotomator phlebotomum cum pauco oleo, antiquo proprie.	Then the phlebotomator shall wipe off the phlebotomy with a little oil, old by itself.
Deinde ponat digitum suum indicem manus sinistrae super ipsam uenam sub loco cuius phlebotomiam uult, parum: ut non fugiat uena, et cassetur percussio.	Then he shall put his index finger of his left hand on the vein at the place where he wishes to make the phlebotomy, a little bit: so that the vein does not flee, and may it be struck by a blow.
Quoniam ex uenis est quam inuenis sicut chordam fugientem apud phlebotomiam: et ex eis est quae est plena uentositate: et quando ponis phlebotomum super eam, contrahitur sub phlebotomo, et decipitur phlebotomator, et non aperit phlebotomus uenam: et si aperit eam, est stricta: propter illud ergo oportet, ut firmetur phlebotomator, et sit sollicitus in his rebus omnibus.	For from the veins it is as if a string runs, striking against the phlebotomy: and those are full of blood: and when you put the phlebotomy on them, it is struck by the phlebotomist, and does not open the vein: and if it does open it, then it is constricted: therefore, so that the phlebotomist may firm it, and be alert in all these things.
Deinde deponat phlebotomum.	Then he shall lay down the phlebotomy.
Si ergo aperitur uena ex uice una, tunc bonum est.	If then one vein opens from a single source, then it is good.
Et si non, tunc itera illud uice alia sub illo loco parum, aut supra ipsum cum festinatione: si non apostematur locus.	And if not, then go to another vein below that place a little bit, or above it with force: if not, the place will not stand.
Quod si apostematur, aut expauescit infirmus, tunc dimitte eum die, aut duobus diebus: et non stringat ligamentum.	That if it should stop bleeding, or go away slowly, then send him off for a day, or two days: and do not tighten the ligature.
Fortasse enim attrahet apostema calidum.	For perhaps a warm poultice attracts pus.
Neque ingrediatur balneum.	And let no ointment be added.
Deinde iteret phlebotomiam, si amat.	Then let the bleeding be stopped, if he loves life.
Quod si apertio est parua, aut currit sanguis subtiliter: et times ut non egrediatur ex sanguine quantitas quam uis: tunc itera phlebotomum in foramine ipso secundum rectitudinem, et adde in operatione parum.	If the opening is small or the blood flows gently: and be careful not to lose a small amount of blood: then repeat the phlebotomy at the same site according to the direction, and add a little to the procedure.
Et fac illud cum festinatione, antequam apostemetur locus, apostematus enim locus est in multis hominibus apud operationem paruam.	And do it quickly before the place heals over, for the site of the poultice is dangerous in many people during surgery.
Si ergo uides ipsum iam apostematum, tunc non iteres super ipsum omnino, non enim excusat apud te aliquid.	If you therefore see that the poultice has already been applied, then do not touch it again at all, for you will not excuse yourself from anything before me.
Et pone super ipsum aliquid ex faece olei: quoniam alleuiat cursum sanguinis.	And place something soft of oil on the poultice: for it soothes the course of blood.
Et est melior in hoc loco quam oleum ipsum, et quam reliqua olea.	And this is better at this site than oil itself, and better than any other oil.
Et similiter administra faecem olei in omni phlebotomia tua, qua phlebotomas uenas apud prohibitionem cursus sanguinis: et faciunt illud tyriaca alfarach, et sagzenea, quando ponitur ex una earum super locum.	And administer the same oil to all your phlebotomies except where the course of blood is prohibited: and they make it with myrrh when placed from one of them on the site.
Sanguis enim subtiliatur et resoluitur, quando est grossus.	For blood is thinned and made smooth when it is thick.
Quod si accidat in loco phlebotomiae apostema magnum, nam multotiens accidit, praecipue ei qui non est phlebotomatus nisi uice illa, aut est apertio uenae parua, tunc propera et pone super locum spongiam infusam in aqua et sale, calefacta parumper: et stringe eam hora una: quoniam soluitur.	If a large poultice happens to be placed at the site of phlebotomy, for many happen there, especially if the person has not been phlebotomized before, or if an opening in the skin is small, then properly place and put a sponge soaked with water and salt, slightly heated: and tie it for an hour. For it is made smooth.
Et oportet, ut facias illud post exitum sanguinis ex uena ipsa, cum complemento sui, aut ex uena alia.	And it should be done, so that you do the poultice after the exit of blood from the vein itself with its own plug, or from another vein.
Quod si remanet in loco post dies aliquid nigredinis, aut uiriditatis, non nocet illud: et si uis, pone super ipsum aliquid aloe, aut myrrhae solutorum: aut aliquid ex succo menthastri, id est, calamenti aut simile illius.	For if it remains in place for a few days of blackening or reddening, it does not hurt that: and if it is swollen, place something soft of aloe, or of myrrh dissolved: or some juice of mint, that is, of calamus or similar to it.
Et multotiens quidem accidunt apostemata et eminentiae apud phlebotomiam Basilicae.	At times indeed do occur apoplexes and eminences at the phlebotomy of the Basilica.
Pone ergo manum tuam super ipsam, tunc si inuenis molliciem apud compressionem tuam super ipsam, tunc illa eminentia est mala.	Place then your hand upon it; if then the wound is moist with pus under your pressure upon it, then that eminence is ill.
Caue ergo, ut ponas super eam aliquid ex eo quod diximus.	Have therefore ready upon it something of what we have said.
Nam fortasse fluet ex ea sanguis arteriae.	For maybe there flows from it blood of an artery.
Sed fac emplastrum ei cum eo in quo est stipticitas, ut induretur locus.	But do make a plaster for him with the one upon which is the stitches, so that the place may heal.
Deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then take care of the patient with the rest of the cure, until he heals.
Et oportet, ut extrahas omni homini ex sanguine secundum quantitatem uirtutis suae.	And it is necessary, that every man should have a second amount of his blood of its virility.
Et quod apparet ex colore uincente super sanguinem.	And which appears from the color that shines upon the blood.
Nam sanguis si est niger, tunc dimitte ipsum exire, donec rubeat: et similiter si uides ipsum grossum: tunc dimitte eum, donec subtilietur: et similiter si est acutus, donec auferatur acuitas eius.	For if the blood is black, then let him cease to go out, until it turns red; and likewise if you see him gross: then let him cease, until he grows subtile; and likewise if it is acute, until its acuity is taken away.
Et oportet ei qui est plenus, fortis, et indiget extractione sanguinis uice una, ut amplificetur phlebotomia uenae, et sit phlebotomus latus: et in eo qui est debilis, sit econtrario illius.	And of him who is full, strong, and accustomed to the extraction of blood, let one vein be enlarged for phlebotomy, and let the phlebotomist stand on the side; and of him who is weak, let that side be opposite to him.
Et oportet, ut extrahat ipsum in uicibus, et ut sit foramen strictum: et melius quod administratur in phlebotomia uenae est, ut sit transuersa sectio, non punctura.	And let him be extracted by the veins, and let there be a tight opening; and it is better that he should be administered in phlebotomy of the vein, that it be a transverse section, not a puncture.
Et iste modus phlebotomiae est saluus a fluxu sanguinis, et ab incisione nerui: et est laudabilior, et saluior quam phlebotomia per latitudinem et longitudinem.	And this mode of phlebotomy is safer from the flow of blood, and from the cutting of a nerve; and it is more praiseworthy, and healthier than phlebotomy by the width and length.
Et cui consueuit peruenire apud phlebotomiam syncopis, oportet ut cibes ante phlebotomiam modico pane infuso in aqua granati muzi: aut secaniabin, si est calefactus: et extrahas ei ex sanguine in tribus uicibus, aut quatuor.	And of whom it is customary to syncope at phlebotomy, let him eat before phlebotomy with moderate bread and water: or if he is hot, let the secaniabin be used; and let him have blood from his blood in three veins, or four.
Et si est infrigidatae complexionis, tunc accipiat ante phlebotomiam panem infusum in syrupo miua, aut in syrupo de melle aromatizato cum speciebus, aut in syrupo aromatizato odorifero.	And if it is a pale complexion, then he should take before phlebotomy bread with syrup of myrrh, or with syrup of honey seasoned with spices, or with fragrant syrup.
Quod si accidat syncopis apud phlebotomiam, et est caussa eius exitus sanguinis multi: tunc oportet, ut sumat in potu aquam carnis, et syrupum odoriferum subtilem: et utatur aromaticitate cum algalia, et liniatur pectus eius cum ea: et utatur reliquis quae diximus in diuisione in capitulo syncopis ex euacuatione.	If syncopis should occur during phlebotomy, and it is due to the exit of blood in great quantity, then he should take into a jug water of the flesh, and syrup with a strong odor: and he should apply aromatics with algars, and smooth out his chest with it: and he should use the other things which we mentioned in the division about syncopis in evacuation.
Qui autem uult euentare brachium suum, et soluere sanguinem suum secundo: oportet ei cuius phlebotomia est propter euacuationem multam, et uirtus eius est debilis, ut soluat sanguinem paulatim per quantitatem uirtutis in diebus continuis.	But whoever wants to cut his arm and let his blood out: it is necessary for him who phlebotomizes due to great evaporation, and his power is weak, that he should let his blood out little by little through a quantity of power over many days.
Qui uero uult euentare brachium suum, et soluere sanguinem suum secundo, et est corpus eius forte: tunc faciat illud post septem horas, aut nouem a phlebotomia sua prima.	But whoever wants to cut his arm and let his blood out for the second time, and his body is strong: then he should do it after seven or nine hours from his first phlebotomy.
Qui autem uult attrahere sanguinem ex corpore suo ad contrarium partis ad quam declinat: oportet ut euentetur ei in die secundo, aut in tertio.	But whoever wants to draw blood from his body towards the opposite side of which he leans: it is necessary for him to do this on the second or third day.
In cuius uero corpore est sanguis multus iam calefactus, et acuitur, et facit accidere febrem: oportet, ut egrediatur ex eo sanguis in uice una, et extrahatur ex eo quantitas multa: et amplificetur apertio usquequo accidat syncopis: postquam tu fueris conseruans omnes conditiones phlebotomiae: et ut ponas manum tuam super pulsum eius apud cursum sanguinis, ut non accidat mors loco syncopis.	But in whose body there is already much blood that has been warmed up and made sharp, and which causes fever: it is necessary for him to go out of it in a single direction, and to extract from it a great quantity: and to increase the opening until syncopis occurs: afterwards, you shall keep all the conditions of phlebotomy: and so that you put your hand on the pulse of his body at the course of blood, so that death does not occur at the place of syncopis.
Multotiens enim accidit illud, quando ignorat phlebotomator, et cadit negligentia.	Many times, indeed, has this happened to him, when the phlebotomizer ignores it and falls by neglect.
Et non oportet quando uis soluere brachium, et soluere sanguinem secundo, cum iam clausum sit orificium uenae, et fiat difficilis exitus sanguinis, ut prematur super ipsum cum uehementia, et curuatum extendatur uelociter.	And it is not necessary when you want to cut the arm and let the blood out for the second time, with the orifice of the vein already closed, and the exit of the blood becomes difficult, so that it presses upon him with vehemence, and extends itself quickly.
Nam illud est malum ualde, imo dimitte ipsum, donec phlebotometur secundo.	For this is bad when there is vehemence: then let go of him until the second phlebotomy.
Aut remoue cum acuitate phlebotomi illud quod coagulatum est ex sanguine in orificio uenae, et pone super ipsum aliquid salis dissoluti in aqua.	The thing that is removed with the sharp phlebotomy is this one that has been coagulated from blood in the hole of the anus, and put on it some dissolved salt in water.
Et pone super ipsum aliquid ex tyriaca alfaroch, aut sagzenea, et pone ipsum compressione leni, donec egrediatur sanguis.	And put on it something from the tar-oil, or from the sage green, and put on the mass a soft compression, until the blood comes out.
Si uero iam apostemata est uena, tunc dimitte eam, et non tegas eam, donec sedetur apostema.	But if the anus has already been opened, then let go of it, and do not seal it, until it heals on its own.
Quod si necessitas prouocat ad soluendum sanguinem secundo, et non est excusatio, tunc aut phlebotoma ipsum supra illum locum, aut in brachio alio in uena alia.	That if need requires to cure the blood that is flowing, and there is no excuse, then either phlebotomize the person above the place, or in another arm in a different anus.
Funis autem brachii phlebotomatur loco Fuscae, et Basilicae, cum non inueniuntur, et sunt occultae, quoniam est composita ex eis.	But the vein of the arm is phlebotomized at the place of the fuscus, and of the basilica, if they are not found, and are hidden, because it is made up from them.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut intromittat infirmus manum suam in aqua calida, donec rubeat focile, et appareat uena manifeste.	And the quality of the phlebotomy is that it should put the hand of the sick in hot water until it turns red, and the anus appears clearly.
Deinde stringatur super ipsam cum ligamento parum constrictione media.	Then bind on it with a little constriction by means of a thread.
Deinde phlebotoma secundum transuersationem paulatim, non latitudinaliter, neque secundum longitudinem: et sit apertio ampla, et sit phlebotomia tua qua eam phlebotomas super iuncturam manus parumper.	Then phlebotomize a little bit at a time, not across and not along the length of it; and let there be an opening that is wide, and your phlebotomy should be like this one that you phlebotomize just below the wrist a little.
Quod si prohibetur exitus sanguinis, tunc itera manum in aqua calida, et dimitte sanguinem currere in aqua, donec consequaris necessitatem tuam.	That if the blood is prevented from flowing out, then once more put the hand in hot water, and let the blood run into the water, until you satisfy your need.
Si autem fueris in diebus aestatis, tunc excusaris ab iteratione manus in aqua calida.	But if you are in the days of summer, then you are excused from the repetition of putting the hand in hot water.
Et plurimum quidem ponitur cursus sanguinis in aqua calida in tempore hyemis.	And indeed the blood course is put in hot water in the time of winter.
Et phlebotomia huius uenae est saluior omnibus uenis, quoniam non est sub ea uena pulsatilis, neque neruus.	And the phlebotomy of this anus is healthier for all the anuses, because there is no pulsating anus under it, and there is no nerve.
Phlebotomia uero Saluatellae manus dextrae, est conferens aegritudinibus epatis.	The phlebotomy of the right hand of salutations does indeed give relief to diseases of the liver.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut stringas mahason manus cum ligamento, aut manu tua, postquam tu intromittis eam in aquam calidam, donec infletur uena, et demonsteretur sensui ualde.	And the quality of phlebotomy is such that you should tighten the tendon of the hand with a ligature, or your own hand, after you have immersed it in warm water, until it bends and shows great sensation.
Deinde phlebotoma eam transuersando.	Then phlebotomize it by passing a needle through.
Et si incidis eam totaliter, non nocebit ei illud in aliquo.	And if you cut it entirely, it will not hurt him at all.
Et conserua, ne ultimes manum tuam cum phlebotomo.	And keep your hand away from the phlebotomy site.
Sub ea enim sunt nerui digitorum denudati ex carne.	For under that are the nerves of the fingers stripped of their covering of flesh.
Deinde itera manum ad aquam calidam, et dimitte currere sanguinem in ea.	Then repeat the hand to warm water, and allow the blood to flow out of it.
Nam si tu non iteras eam in aqua calida, coagulatur sanguis in orificio uenae, et prohibetur a cursu.	For if you do not heat it in warm water, the blood will coagulate in the opening of the vein, and the flow will be prevented.
Cum ergo extraxeris ex sanguine quantitatem necessitatis, tunc pone super uenam oleum et sal: ut non consolidetur uelociter.	When you do extract a quantity of blood as needed, then put oil and salt on the vein so that it does not solidify quickly.
Et similiter oportet, ut facias cum omni ramo stricto.	And likewise you should do, so that you make it with any tight knot.
Iuuamentum uero phlebotomiae eius ex manu sinistra, est: quoniam est conferens ad aegritudines splenis: et similiter fac in phlebotomia eius, sicut fecisti in secunda aequaliter.	The grasp of the phlebotomy, however, is from the left hand; for it is suited to diseases of the spleen: and likewise do the same on the phlebotomy side as you did on the second one.
Saphenae autem phlebotomiae iuuamentum, est ad aegritudines quae sunt in inferiori parte corporis, sicut aegritudines matricum, et retentionem menstruorum, et infirmitates renum, et ulcera coxarum et crurium antiqua, et similia ex aegritudinibus.	The grasp of the phlebotomy, however, is for diseases that are in the lower part of the body, such as those of the uterus, and retention of menses, and ailments of the kidneys, and old ulcers of the hips and testes, and similar ailments from illnesses.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut intromittat infirmus pedem suum in aquam calidam: et faciat super ipsum fricationem, donec exuberent uenae: et liga supra iuncturam pedis cum corrigia.	And the quality of the phlebotomy is such that you should put the sick foot in warm water: and make a friction on it until the veins bend; and tie above the knot with a ligature.
Et uenae quidem locus est apud calcaneum, apparens uersus pollicem: et ramificantur ex ea in facie pedis rami multi.	And the vein does indeed lie near the heel, visible towards the thumb: and they ramify from it on both sides of the foot.
Phlebotoma ergo eam in ampliore ramo eius, aut apud calcaneum in aggregatione eius: quoniam est melius et saluius.	So phlebotomize it in a larger branch of the vein, or near the heel in a gathering of the veins; for it is better and more salutary.
Quod si phlebotomas eam in facie pedis, tunc caue a neruis qui sunt sub ea super faciem pedis.	If you phlebotomy her on the face of the foot, then cause the nerves that are under it on the surface of the foot.
Et pone phlebotomiam tuam qua eam phlebotomas ex transuerso, quasi tu uelis incidere eam: et sit phlebotomus Nesil.	And place your phlebotomy so that you do not cut into her from behind, as you wish to avoid injuring her: and let the phlebotomist be nesile.
Si autem prohibetur exitus sanguinis, tunc itera pedem eius in aqua calida: et dimitte sanguinem currere in eam, donec euacuatur.	But if the blood flow is prohibited, then dip her other foot in warm water: and let the blood flow out of her, until she is cleansed.
Quod si errat uenam phlebotomator in prima uice, tunc iteret cum phlebotomia ad superiora parumper, nam locus est saluus, et non times ex eo maliciam, quando tu caues a neruis, sicut diximus.	That if the phlebotomist makes an error in the first cut, then let him continue with the phlebotomy for a while longer, since the place is safe, and do not fear to come out of it with harm, when you cause the nerves, as we have said.
Et similiter cum Saphena pedis alterius aequaliter.	And similarly with the saphenous vein of the other foot equally.
Venae autem Sciaticae locus, sicut diximus, est apud calcaneum ex latere syluestri.	But the Sciatic veins, as we have said, are located near the heel from the lateral side.
Et iuuamentum phlebotomiae eius est, ad dolorem anchae, quando est propter sanguinem calidum.	And the pledge of her phlebotomy is, to the pain of the aching, when it is due to hot blood.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut ingrediatur infirmus balneum, et festinet: et stringe crus eius a latere anchae usque supra calcaneum quatuor digitis, cum uitta subtili longa: non enim apparet nisi propter illud.	And the quality of her phlebotomy is, that she enter a lukewarm bath and refresh herself: and tighten her legs from the lateral side up to the heel with four fingers, for it does not appear otherwise except because of that.
Quando ergo apparet, tunc phlebotoma eam secundum quodcumque ingenium est tibi possibile, aut secundum transuersionem: et est melius, aut ut incidas eam incisione, aut seces eam sectione.	When she then appears, then phlebotomy her according to what ability you have, or according to the transversion: and it is better, or as if you wish to cut her with an incision, or to separate her with a section.
Locus enim eius est saluior, et ipsa est in pluribus hominibus occulta ualde.	For the place of her is safer, and she herself is hidden greatly in many people.
Quod si non inuenis eam, et non apparet sensui omnino: tunc phlebotoma aliquem ramum eius, et est ille qui apparet in dorso pedis, et uersus auricularem: et caue a neruis, et fac currere ex sanguine quantitatem quam uis.	That if you do not feel her at all: then phlebotomy a small branch of her, and that is which appears on the back of the foot, and towards the ear: and cause the nerves to be cut, and let blood flow in quantity as much as you wish.
Deinde solue stricturam, et pone super locum phlebotomiae corium, et stringe locum.	Then bind it tightly, and place it on the site of phlebotomy, and tighten the site.
Uelociter enim sanatur.	He heals quickly.
¶ De Ventosatione, et qualitate usus eius.	Regarding ventilation and the quality of use.
Caput XCVIII.	Chapter 88.
Uentosae fiunt ex cornibus, et ex aere, et ex uitro.	Wind-sores arise from corns, from air, and from moisture.
Et Ventosatio quidem fit secundum duos modos.	And wind-sore is caused in two ways.
Cum scarificatione, et extractione sanguinis: et alter est uentosatio sine scarificatione.	When there is ablation and the drawing of blood: and a second type is wind-sore without ablation.
Et haec Ventosatio quae est sine scarificatione, est secundum duos modos.	And this wind-sore, which is without ablation, is of two types.
Aut enim est cum igne.	For it may be with fire.
Aut est absque igne.	Or it may be without fire.
Et uentosis quae administrantur cum scarificatione et extractione sanguinis sunt quatuordecim loca corporis.	And the wind-sores that are administered with ablation and drawing of blood are four parts of the body.
Quorum unus est, Ventosatio Alnocrati, et est postremum capitis: et Alkehel, et est medium colli: et uentosae Alhagdahim, et sunt duae laminae colli a duabus partibus simul: et uentosae menti, et est sub mandibula in inferiori oris: et uentosae duarum spatularum: et uentosae Alachosos super finem caudae: et uentosae duorum focilium, et sunt medium duorum brachiorum: et uentosae duorum crurium: et uentosae duarum cauillarum.	The four parts of the body where wind-sores may occur are as follows: one is the "Venosatio Alnocrati" and it is at the very top of the head; another is "Alkehel", and it is in the middle of the neck; two more are on either side of the neck together; a fourth is on the mind, under the chin in the lower mouth; a fifth is on the two spatulae; a sixth is on the end of the tail; a seventh is on the two palms, middle of the two arms; an eighth is on the two forearms; and a ninth is on the two legs.
Et Ventosatio quidem non extrahit sanguinem tibi ex uenis minutis sparsis in carne, et propter illud non cadit uirtus ex eis, sicut est casus eius ex phlebotomia.	And it should not draw blood from you through small scattered veins in the flesh, and for that reason its power does not decrease as it does with bleeding.
Neque oportet, ut administretur uentosatio siue cum igne, aut absque igne in aliqua aegritudinum quae fiunt ex repletione, donec euacuetur totum corpus.	Nor should wind-sore be administered with fire, or without fire for any sickness caused by a buildup, until the entire body has been drained.
Quod si necessitas prouocat ad Ventosationem ex aegritudine, aut propter consuetudinem, administramus eam in omni hora in principio mensis, in fine eius, et in medio ipsius, et in quocumque tempore fuerit.	If necessity requires the administration of wind-sore for any illness, or out of custom, let it be given at the beginning, end, and middle of the month, and at any other time as well.
Quod est, quia ex hominibus est qui quando multiplicatur in eo sanguis, donec indiget extractione eius per uentosationem, inuenit in capite suo grauedinem, et sodahan.	That is, there is a man who, when blood multiplies within him, does not suffer until he is drained by wind-sore; in his head he has a grayish complexion, and he perspires.
Et ex eis est qui inuenit repletionem et rubedinem in facie sua, capite suo, et collo suo.	And from these [surfaces] comes the expansion and redness on his face, head, and neck.
Et ex eis est qui inuenit pruritum in facie sua, et fronte sua, et tenebrositatem, et hebetudinem in oculis suis.	And from these [surfaces] comes the itching on his face and forehead, darkness and dullness in his eyes.
Et ex eis est qui scalpit locum uentosationis suae.	And from these [surfaces] comes the place of his wound.
Et ex eis est cuius risus multiplicatur.	And from these [ surfaces ] comes the laugh.
Et ex eis est qui inuenit gustum sanguinis in ore suo: aut apostematur lingua, et expuit sanguinem.	And from these [surfaces] comes the taste of blood in his mouth, or he swallows it with his tongue and spits out the blood.
Et ex eis est cuius somnus multiplicatur.	And from these [surfaces] comes the sleepiness.
Et ex eis est qui uidet in somno suo sanguinem et rubedinem, et interfectos, et plagas, et quae sunt similia illis.	And from these [surfaces] comes the vision of blood and redness, and the killed and the plagues, and that which is similar to them.
Quando ergo uidemus aliquid ex illis, et proprie si est in tertia media mensis: praecipimus tunc uentosationem fieri, postquam praeterierunt de die duae horae, aut tres.	When therefore we see anything from these [surfaces], and especially if it is in the third month: we then make the wound heal, having passed over two or three hours after daylight.
Iuuamentum autem Ventosationis nuchae, est: quoniam ipsa confert ad grauitatem in capite, et quod effunditur ad oculos.	But the wound-healing of the nape is this: for it confers weight on the head, and it runs out to the eyes.
At uero oportet, ut sit illud post euacuationem totius corporis.	But indeed it should be, that it be after the evacuation of all the body.
Et haec quidem Ventosa est loco phlebotomiae Cephalicae.	And this  [wound] is a locum phlebotomy of the head.
Et non licet, ut utatur ea qui est frigidae complexionis, aut in quo est catarrus.	And it is not appropriate to use it who has a cold disposition, or in which there is a catarrh.
Nam infert ei nocumentum magnum.	For indeed it brings great harm.
Et propter illud non oportet, ut utantur ea senes, et in cuius capite sunt aegritudines frigidae.	And because of this  [wound] it is not appropriate for the elderly to use it, and in which there are ailments of the head due to cold.
Qui autem super eam fit assiduus, generatur super eum obliuio.	But who applies this  [wound] regularly, he makes himself forgetful.
Et propter illud oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ut deponat manum suam cum uentosa parumper ad inferiora, timendo ex generatione obliuionis.	And because of this   [wound] it is necessary that you order the Wind-healer, so that he puts his hand when wind-healing, a little lower towards the bottom, fearing the generation of forgetfulness.
Ventosatio aut Alkehel, est loco phlebotomiae Fuscae, et phlebotomiae Basilicae, et propter illud confert asmati, et constrictioni anhelitus, et fissurae instrumenti anhelitus, et tussi, et repletioni.	Wind-healing or Alkohl is a locum phlebotomy of the purple color, and also of the purple color in the Basilica, and because of this it brings a soothing breath, constriction, hole, cough, and swelling.
Et oportet, ut impellatur Ventosa Alkehel parumper, quoniam si ponitur inferius, generat debilitatem in corde, et stomacho.	It is necessary that Ventosa Alchehel be applied a little, since if it is put on lower down, it generates weakness in the heart and stomach.
Ventosatio uero alhagdahim, confert doloribus accidentibus in capite, et obtalmiae, et hemigraneae, et perforationi, et dolori in radicibus dentium: et est loco phlebotomiae Basilicae.	Ventosation however (in the head) confers relief from headaches, eye pains, headaches, perforations, and toothache; and it is a place for phlebotomy at the Basilica.
Et oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ne premat manum suam cum scarificatione: ut non incidat arteriam, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	And one should have the person using Ventosa not touch his hand with the scarification so that an artery is not struck and blood flow occurs.
Ventosatio autem sub mento, confert alcolae in ore, et corruptioni gingiuae, et similibus eis ex aegritudinibus quae sunt in ore: et stat loco phlebotomiae alieherich, quae sunt in duobus labiis.	However, if  (Ventosatio) is placed under the chin, it confers alcohol in the mouth, corruption of the gums, and similar ailments that occur in the mouth; and it is a place for phlebotomy at the side of the throat, which is between the two lips.
Ventosatio autem spatularum, confert ad alchafacham, quae fit ex replexione, et caliditate.	However, if   (Ventosation with a spatula) is done, it is applied to Alchafacham, which is made from a rebound and heat.
Ventosatio uero interiorum partium duorum focilium, confert iuuamentum phlebotomiae uenarum trium, Basilicae, et Fuscae, et Cephalicae: quoniam ipsa attrahit sanguinem ex omnibus illis uenis minutis, quae sunt in carne: et attrahunt illae uenae minutae ex uenis aliis grossioribus eis, donec peruenit attractio ad uenas tres.	Ventosation on the inner parts of the body are two foci, which confers a facility for phlebotomy at the veins of the hand, Basilicae, and Fuscae, and Cephalicae: since it itself attracts blood from all those small veins that are in the flesh: and these small veins attract that blood from other larger veins until the attraction reaches the three veins.
Et oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ne multum procedat in scarificatione: quoniam locus est denudatus carne, et sub eo sunt nerui et arteriae.	And one should have the person using Ventosa not go too deep with the scarification: since there is a place that is bare of flesh, and under it are nerves and arteries.
Ventosa autem quae uentosatur super alchausos, confert hemorroidibus Ani, et ulceribus inferioribus.	However, if    (Ventosatio) is applied to Alchaus, it brings hemorrhoids of the Anus and ulcers from below.
Et oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ut sit uentosa magna, et ut sit ex aere: quoniam locus indiget suctione forti, et fortasse franguntur Ventosae subtiles: et scarificetur scarificatione magna.	And one should have the person using Ventosa so that there is a strong suction, and perhaps they break because of the subtle application of Ventosa: and it is scarified with a deep scarification.
Ventosae autem crurium minuunt diminutione manifesta: quoniam attrahunt sanguinem ex toto corpore, et conferunt doloribus antiquis in renibus, et matricibus, et uesica: prouocant menstrua, et conferunt bothor, et ademenul: et stant loco phlebotomiae duarum saphenarum, et alhorcobeni.	However, if     (Ventosae) are on the knees they decrease gradually: since they attract blood from the whole body, and bring about pains of old age in the kidneys, and membranes, and venereous members: they provoke menses, and bring about bothy and seduction; and they stand at the place of phlebotomy between the two saphenous veins, and Alhorcoben.
Verumtamen debilitant corpus multum, et faciunt accidere syncopim in pluribus hominibus.	Indeed, the body weakens greatly, and causes fainting in many people.
Et Ventosarum alhorcobeni iuuamentum est propinquum iuuamento Ventosarum duorum crurium.	And the treatment of ventilating two crura is near to the treatment of ventilation.
Qualitas positionis Ventosarum est, ut ponas uentosam in primis uacuam, et sugas suctione temperata: et non prolonges positionem uentosarum, sed pone eas uelociter, et remoue eas uelociter, ut ueniant humores ad locum aduentu aequali: et non cesses iterare illud et continuare, donec uideas locum iam rubere et inflari, et appareat rubedo sanguinis: tunc ergo scarifica, et itera suctione paulatim.	The quality of the position of the wind is that you put the wind in the first place in vacua and pour on a moderate suction: and do not prolong the position of the wind, but put them quickly and move them quickly so that the humors come to the place of entry equal: and do not cease to repeat this and continue, until you notice the place already red and swollen, and appears redness of blood: then therefore cut, and again suction slowly.
Deinde considera in dispositione corporum.	Then consider in the disposition of the bodies.
Nam qui ex hominibus est tenerae carnis, rarorum pororum, oportet ut scarifices ipsum semel, non plus: ut non ulceretur locus.	For he who is of a tender body, rare porridge, should cut himself once, not more: so that the place does not ulcerate.
Et praecipe Ventosatori, ut amplificet scarificationem, et profundet parum: et temperet suctionem in facilitate, et uelocitate, et motu suaui.	And order the wind-sucker to make the incision deep, and a little shallow: and moderate the suction in ease, and velocity, and movement he move.
Quod si in sanguine est grossitudo, tunc oportet, ut scarifices ipsum bis.	That if there is grossness in the blood, then you should cut yourself twice.
In uice quidem prima aperitur uia subtiliationi sanguinis, et aquositati eius: et in secunda quidem perscrutationi exquisitae extractionis sanguinis grossi.	In a vessel indeed the first opening is subtilization of blood, and aqueous of it: and in the second quidem perscrutation of exquisite extraction of gross blood.
Si uero sanguis est faeculentus ualde, tunc fiat scarificatio uice tertia: ut consequatur ultimum.	But if the blood is very foul, then let the incision be made in a fourth place: that it may bring about the last thing.
Et ad ultimum, quando uolumus extrahere sanguinem paulatim, uel parumper, sufficit nobis scarificatio una.	And to the last, when we have cut off the blood little by little, a single incision is enough for us.
Quod si uolumus extractionem sanguinis multi, scarificamus scarificatione plurima.	That if we wish to extract the blood many times, we shall cut with many incisions.
Et si nos mensuramus, quod sanguis est grossus: tunc oportet, ut scarificetur scarificatione profunda: et terminus aequalis in scarificatione, est profunditas cutis.	And if we measure that the blood is gross: then it is necessary that the incision be deep: and an equal end in the incision is the depth of the skin.
¶ Quid sit illud quod oportet administrari ex oleis apud positionem Ventosarum, et quid caueat uentosandus.	What is this that needs to be administered from oils when positioning the wind? And what does the wind-sucker guard?
IN illo quidem cuius cutis est grossa, dura, fusca, et pori eius sunt stricti, oportet ut ungantur loca Ventosare cum oleis apertiuis, lenitiuis, resolutiuis: si est in tempore aestatis, sicut est oleum alkeiri, aut oleum uiolatum, aut oleum de amigdalis dulcibus, aut oleum de semine cucurbitae.	IN illo quidem cuius cutis est grossa, dura, fusca, et pori eius sunt stricti, oportet ut ungantur loca Ventosare cum oleis apertiuis, lenitiuis, resolutiuis: si est in tempore aestatis, sicut est oleum alkeiri, aut oleum uiolatum, aut oleum de amigdalis dulcibus, aut oleum de semine cucurbitae.
Et si est in tempore hyemis, tunc oleum narcissinum, aut oleum de lilio, aut oleum camomellinum, aut sarbatinum: et eis similia.	And if it is in the time of winter, then let the places where wind blows be anointed with oil that is open, soothing, and healing: if it is in the time of summer, as is the oil of ale, or the oil of violets, or the oil of sweet almonds, or the oil of cucumber seed.
Si uero superfluitas est grossa, frigida: tunc oleum sit amaracinum, aut oleum de balsamita aut oleum alben, aut oleum anetinum: et eis similia.	But if there is too much hair, cold: then let the oil be bitter, or of myrrh, or of white balm, or of gold; and similar ones.
Si uero uentosandus est amplorum pororum, tenerae carnis: tunc oportet, ut prohibeatur ab oleo, et oportet ut isti abluant loca Ventosarum earum post uentosationem cum aqua rosata, aut cum aqua frigida, aut cum aqua solatri, aut cum aqua cucurbitae, aut cum aqua portulacae: et similibus eis.	But if it is windy and has wide pores, soft flesh: then let it be forbidden from oil, and it should be washed with rose water, or cold water, or sunshine water, or cucumber seed water, or portulaca water; and similar ones.
Ille autem cuius sanguis est multae humiditatis, abluat uentosas cum aceto, aut cum aqua myrti, et sumach: et similibus eis.	But he whose blood is very moist should wash the windy places with vinegar, or with myrtle water, and sumach; and similar ones.
Cuius autem superfluitates sunt grossae, abluat uentosas suas cum uino antiquo, aut cum aqua samsuci, aut decoctione aneti, aut camomillae: et eis similibus.	But if there is too much fluff, he should wash his windy places with old wine, or with sarsaparilla water, or with a decoction of fenugreek, or of chamomile; and similar ones.
Et oportet, ut caueatur uentosatio in balneo, aut in uestigio balnei, imo oportet, ut administretur post exitum ex balneo per horam, aut per horas duas.	And let the bathing be done in a bath, or in a bathhouse; and it should be administered after leaving the bath for an hour, or two hours.
Et non oportet, ut dormiat aliquis post uentosationem.	And let no one sleep after bathing.
¶ Quid est quo oportet ut regatur Ventosandus, aut Phlebotomatus ante uentosationem.	What is it that should be done to treat wind and bleeding before bathing?
ET post eam oportet, ut consideres in primis: tunc si Ventosatus, aut Phlebotomatus sit cholericus, et uincunt super sanguinem eius acuitas et inflammatio: tunc oportet, ut accipiat infrigidantia, sicut granatum muzum: et etiam endiuiam cum aceto et lactuca, et secaniabin, et iuleb: et eis similia.	And after that, it should be considered first of all: then if the wind is in him and his blood is sharp and inflamed: then let him take cooling things, such as granated fruit; and also lettuces, vinegar, and tarragon; and similar ones.
Et pone cibaria eius pullos, et carnes ouium sekebiget, et cibos conditos cum agresta: et eis similia.	And put his food, poultices, and meat that he might drink, and prepared food with fruit: and the same for him.
Et cuius complexio est frigida, oportet ut sumat in potu syrupum de melle, aut de almiua, aut alsecaniabin de seminibus factum: et sumat uinum odoriferum medium, quod est inter uetus et nouum: et praecipiatur, ut utatur paucitate cibi.	And if his complexions are cold, he should take syrup of honey or of almond or alssecania made from seeds; and he should drink a little wine with aroma, which is between new and old; and let him be instructed to eat a little food.
Et pone cibum eius pullos, et canebir: et passeres, id est, paruas aues: et pullos columborum issiadebet.	And put for him poultices of fowls, and carnes ouium sekebiget, and food prepared with fruit; and let him eat pigeons' flesh.
Et oportet, ut potus die uentosationis et phlebotomiae plus sit quam cibus: et oportet, ut detur in potu in quibusdam hominibus in horis tyriaca alfaroch, aut medicamen de musco, id est, muscata, aut alesselithe ante uentosationem: et ante phlebotomiam, aut post: ut confortentur membra principalia, et subtilietur sanguis.	And it should be, that the drink of the day of bloodletting and phlebotomy is more than food; and it should be given to some men in syrup of myrrh or medicine of musk, or alssecenia, before bloodletting: and before phlebotomy, or after: so that the principal members are comforted, and the blood is made subtle.
Et non oportet, ut sumant eam in potu calefacto.	And they should not take it in hot drink.
¶ De Ventosis sine scarificatione.	On Bloodletting without Scarring.
Uentosae autem quae sunt sine scarificatione, sunt Ventosae quae ponuntur super epar, et splenem, et podagram, et super uentrem, umbilicum, et loca renum, et pixidem anchae: quoniam ista membra non sufferunt scarificationem super se.	Of Bloodletting without Scarring, those which are made on the skin without scarring, are made on the liver, and on the spleen, and on the kidneys, and on the belly, and on the places of the testicles, and on the pintle: for these members do not suffer from scarring.
Et non quaeritur per eas, nisi aut attactio ex membro sanguinis ad membrum: sicut ponimus Ventosam super mammillas in aegritudine fluxus sanguinis narium.	And it is not sought after them, unless there be a flow of blood from one member to another: as we make Bloodletting on the breasts in disease of flux of blood to the nose.
Et utimur eis, ut soluamus a membro uentositatem frigidam inuiscatam in membro: sicut ponimus uentosam super uentrem, et umbilicum.	And we use them, that we may cure a cold bloodletting in the belly: as we make Bloodletting on the belly and on the pintle.
Ipsa enim rarificat membrum, et calefacit ipsum, et remouet dolorem propterea, quia resoluit illam uentositatem.	For itself it rarefies the member, and warms it, and takes away the pain, because it resolves the bloodletting.
Etiam ponitur super renes, quando accidit in eis opilatio, aut lapis.	Also is laid on the kidneys when there is a deposit of ochre, or a stone.
Uirtute enim attractionis suae fortasse aperit opilationem, aut eradicat lapidem ex loco suo.	By virtue of its power of attraction it may open the wound and extract the stone from its place.
Et similiter facit quando ponitur super epar, et splenem apud uentositatem terendam in eis utrisque.	And in like manner when placed on an opening, and splen on a wisp of hay to be held in both hands against it so that it rubs the wound on either side.
Et istae Ventosae administrantur uacuae cum sectione tantum.	And these are administered with a small saw with only a section.
Et quandoque administrantur cum igne.	And sometimes they are administered with fire.
Et quandoque administrantur plenae aqua tepida in aegritudinibus pleuresis: et illud est, ut impleatur Ventosa, et sit magna, aqua calida sola, aut aqua in qua decoctae sint herbae quae conueniunt.	And sometimes they are administered with warm water when the patient has a pleuritic illness: and that is to the effect that the Ventosa be full, and great, of only warm water, or of water in which herbs have been boiled which are suitable.
¶ Forma Ventosae administratae cum igne.	The form of the administration of the Ventosa with fire.
Sit amplitudo orificii eius duorum digitorum apertorum, secundum quod formauimus: et quantitas eius in profundo sit medietas palmi: et sit in latere eius in loco qui est circiter medium eius, foramen paruum, secundum quantitatem quod ingrediatur ipsum acus: fiat ex aere simul, aut citrino, grossorum marginum, lenium, aequalium, tersorum: ut non laedat membrum apud positionem suam super ipsum: et sit in medio eius uirga transuersa ex aere, aut ferro, ubi ponitur candela cum igne.	It is to be the width of two clenched fingers, measured as we have made it: and its quantity in the depth is half an inch: and it should be at the edge of its place which is about the middle of it, a small hole, according to the quantity which it ingests from the point: let it be made of brass, or yellow metal, of thick margin, soft, equal, of three parts: so that it does not hurt the limb in its position over it: and let there be run through it a wire from brass, or iron, where the candle with fire is placed.
Et iam fit haec uentosa magna, maior ea quam narrauimus, et parum minor illa, secundum aegritudines et aetatem eius qui utitur.	And this kind of Ventosa may be large, larger than we have described, and less small ones, according to the illness and age of him who uses it.
Ventosae enim puerorum, et extenuatorum sunt aliae, quam uentosae uirorum, et grossorum corporum.	For the Ventosas are different for boys, and for those who are weak, and for men, and for large bodies.
Qualitas autem ponendi hanc uentosam cum igne super membrum, est, ut accendas licinium cum igne ex lino decenter, aut candelam paruam ex caera: et pone eam super medium uirgae transuersae quae est in medio uentosae: ut sit accensus ignis circiter inferiorem partem uentosae, ut non comburatur corpus infirmi.	But the quality of placing this Ventosa with fire on a limb is that you kindle a small candle with fire from hay, or a small wax candle: and place it on the middle of the transverse wire which is in the middle of the Ventosa: so that the heat of the fire be all around its lower part, so that the body is not burned.
Deinde ponatur super membrum: et digitus sit super foramen quod dixi, donec quando tenemus uentosam: dum indigemus, auferamus digitum, et egredietur uapor super illud foramen, et soluetur uentosa statim.	Then place it on the limb: and let the finger be over the hole which I have said, until we hold it in place: but when we release it, a vapour will come out of that hole, and the Ventosa will instantly become looser.
Deinde igni licinium secundum modum suum, et itera eam, si indiges illa.	Then, with fire, burn the wound according to its kind, and repeat this if you wish.
In Ventosa autem quae administratur in aegritudine pleuresis cum aqua, non est uirga transuersa, neque foramen: et non administratur, nisi quia impletur aqua, et ponitur super membrum tantum.	In the case of Ventosa, which is administered in illness with water, there is no twisting of the sinews, nor a hole; and it is not administered unless it is filled with water and placed on the limb alone.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form.
Et haec Ventosa quanto plus est magna, ut capiat aquam multam, est melior.	And this Ventosa is all the better as it takes in much water, for that makes it better.
¶ De suspensione Sanguisugarum.	[On the Suspension of Blood-Sugar.]
Caput XCIX.	Chapter LXIX.
Sanguisugae non administrantur in pluribus, nisi in quibus membris non est possibilis positio uentosarum, propter paruitatem eorum, sicut labium, et gingiua, et eis similia.	The Blood-Sugar should not be administered in many cases, unless the limb is in a position where it cannot be put on account of its smallness, as the lip, or the gums, and such like.
Aut in membro denudato a carne, sicut digitus, et nasus, et eis similia.	Or on a member of the body bare of flesh, as a finger, or a nose, and such like.
Et qualitas utendi eis est: ut ueneris ex Sanguisugis quae sunt in aquis dulcibus, mundis a putredinibus.	And the quality of the use of them is: that you take those from Blood-Sugar which are in sweet waters, clean from corruption.
Deinde dimittantur die et nocte in aqua dulci, donec famelicae sint, et non remaneat in uentre earum aliquid.	Then let them be left off day and night in sweet water, until they are hungry, and let nothing remain in their stomachs.
Deinde euacuetur corpus in primis cum phlebotomia, et cum uentosis.	Then the body is to be evacuated first with phlebotomy, and then with blood-sugar.
Deinde absterge membrum infirmi, donec rubeat.	Then wash the limb with water, until it turns red.
Postea ponantur super ipsum.	Then let them be placed on the body itself.
Cum ergo implentur, et cadunt, et est possibilis suctio loci cum uentosa, tunc est magis ultimum in iuuamento: et si non, tunc ablue locum cum aceto.	When they are filled, and fall, and it is possible to move the spot with blood-sugar, then it is more dangerous in the making; and if not, then wash the place with vinegar.
Deinde cum aqua multa, et fricetur, et exprimatur.	Then with much water, and a friction, and press out.
Quod si prolongatur cursus sanguinis post casum Sanguisugarum, et est illud resudando: tunc infunde pannum lini in aqua frigida, et pone ipsum desuper, donec abscindatur resudatio.	What if the course of blood is prolonged after the application of Blood-sugar, and it remains a residue: then let a cloth of linen be soaked in cold water, and let it be placed upside down, until the residue is separated.
Quod si multiplicatur sanguis, tunc pulueriza super ipsum zegi tritum, aut gallas, et similia eis ex stipticis: donec abscindatur sanguis.	What if the blood multiplies, then let a powder of astringent be scattered on the body that is crushed, or eggs, and such like: until the blood is separated.
Aut ponantur super locum medietates fabarum excorticatarum: et dimittantur, donec adhaereant fabae in loco, nam sanguis abscinditur.	Let them be placed on the spot half-way between the wounds to be extracted: and let them cease, until the beans stick to the place, for blood is cut off.
Et oportet si necessaria est iteratio Sanguisugarum, quando est possibile, mutare eas.	And it is necessary, if necessary, to make a journey of the blood-suckers, when possible, to change them.
Si autem prohibentur Sanguisugae a suspensione, tunc abstergatur locus cum sanguine recenti.	But if they prohibit the blood-suckers from suspension, then the place is cleansed with recent blood.
Aut fige acum in locis, donec egrediatur aliquid ex sanguine.	Or let them be tied now in the places, until someone goes out with some blood.
Deinde ponantur, nam ipsae quando sentiunt aliquid ex sanguine, adhaerent statim.	Then let them be placed, for they themselves, when they feel some blood, stick at once.
Quando ergo uis ut cadant, pulueriza super eas aliquid ex aloe trito, aut salem, aut cinerem: et cadent statim.	When then you wish that they fall down, sprinkle on them some powdered aloe, or salt, or ash: and they fall down at once.
¶ Partis Secundae Finis.	Second Part End.
¶ Liber Chirurgici Albucasis Pars III.	The Book of Surgery of Albucasis Part III.
¶ Sermo uniuersalis de restauratione, et dislocatione, et curatione torsionis, et similibus.	The universal speech on restoration, and dislocation, and curing of torsion, and similar cases.
Caput I.	Chapter I.
Hoc Capitulum etiam multotiens est necessarium in arte Medicinae, et est restauratio fracturae, et dislocationis accidentium in ossibus.	This chapter is also often necessary in the art of Medicine, and it is the restoration of fractures, and the dislocation of accidents in bones.
Scitote o Filii, quia iactant se de hoc Capitulo stolidi medicorum et uulgi, et qui non inspexerunt unquam antiquorum librum, neque legerunt ex eo literam.	Know, O sons, for they mock this chapter, the stupid doctors and the people, and do not examine at all the ancient book, nor read from it a word.
Et propter hanc caussam fit, quod iste modus ex scientiis in terra nostra est priuatus.	And for this reason it is made, that this method of knowledge is private to our country.
Et ego non obuiaui in eo unquam bono omnino, et non adeptus sum ex eo illud, quod sum adeptus nisi propter longitudinem lectionis librorum antiquorum, et studium super intellectum eorum, donec extraxi scientiam illius ex eis.	And I was not pleased with it at all, and I was not satisfied from it unless because of the length of reading ancient books, and study over their understanding, until I extracted the science from them.
Deinde adhaesi experimento et studio longitudine uitae meae.	Then through experiment and study I advanced a long way.
Et iam descripsi uobis ex illo in hoc Capitulo totum quod continet scientia mea: et super quod praeteriit experimentum meum, postquam abbreuiaui illud uobis, et liberaui illud ex occupatione elongationis, et abbreuiaui illud fine abbreuiationis, et ostendi illud fine declinationis: et formaui in eo formas multas ex formis instrumentorum quae administrantur in eo, cum sit ex additione declinationis, sicut feci in duobus Capitulis praecedentibus.	Then I have described to you all that contains my science from experimentation and study: and besides what I have shown you through experiment, after I have shortened it for you, and released it from the occupation of extension, and shortened it by abbreviation, and shown it by abbreviation, and formed in it many forms of forms of instruments that are administered in it, with sit from the addition of declination, as I did in the two preceding chapters.
¶ Summae, et collectiones ex esse fracturae ossium, ex eis quarum praemissio necessaria est, antequam incipiamus rememorationem membrorum fractorum, et diuersorum, si uniuscuiusque.	It is necessary to sum up and collect from the fracture of bones, from those for which the prerequisite is necessary, before we begin to remind the members of the broken ones, and diverse, if each one.
Caput II.	Chapter II.
Oportet, ut dicamus in prologo huius Capituli, summas sermonis, et capitula, ad quarum intellectum cogitur in primis artifex ad stationem super earum ueritatem: scilicet ut uos, et qui sunt prompti, sciant, uel addiscant hanc artem nobilem, et alii a uobis.	In the first chapter of this book, we should mention in the prologue what has been discussed so far and what is to be considered in the future by the artist who wants to study this craft with great effort: that you, and those who are willing, may know or learn this noble art from you, and others may benefit from your teaching.
Dico, ergo, quod quando accidit alicui fractura, aut dislocatio, aut torsio, aut casus: tunc oportet, ut properes in primis ad phlebotomandum eum, et soluendum ipsum, aut utraque simul: si non prohibeat aliquid, sicut debilitas uirtutis: aut est ille cui accidit aliquid ex illis puer, aut senex decrepitus: aut est tempus uehementis caloris, aut uehementis frigoris ualde.	I say then that when it happens to someone that there is a fracture, or a dislocation, or a twist, or a fall: then it is necessary that you prepare first of all to bleed him and to cure him, or both at the same time: unless something prevents it, such as the weakness of vigor: or he is that young boy who has fallen ill, or an old man declining; or the time is hot, or cold very much.
Deinde sit contentus in cibo suo, oleribus frigidis, et carnibus auium, et haedorum: et prohibe uinum, et carnes grossas, et repleri ex cibis et omni cibo qui replet uenas sanguine.	Then let him be content with his food, cold herbs, and birds' flesh, and hairs; and forbid wine, and fatty meats, and anything that fills the veins with blood.
Donec quando securus sis ex apostemate calido, et non times effusionem materiei ad membrum: tunc redeat infirmus ad regimen suum primum cum quo cucurrit consuetudo eius.	Until you are secure from feverishness, and do not wait for the flow of matter to the member: then let the sick person return first to his habitude with which he has been accustomed.
Cum ergo incipit os fractum restaurari, tunc oportet, ut cibetur infirmus cibis nutrientibus nutrimento multo, grosso, graui, in quibus sit uiscositas: sicut cibaria facta ex tritico cocto cum aqua, et rizum, et capita, et pedes, et uentres uaccarum, et oua, et pisces recentes: et uinum grossum, et similia illis.	But when the mouth begins to be healed and restored, then it is necessary that the sick person eat food that nourishes him much, dry, heavy, and full of blood: such as food made from wheat cooked with water, and rice, and peas, and beans, and venison fresh, and wine thick, and like things.
Cum hoc enim regimine fit coagulatio fracturae uelocius, et melius.	This regimen, then, causes the clotting of a fracture to be more rapid and better.
Et scias, quod ossa fracta, quando sunt in uiris qui sunt in prima senectute, et decrepitis, non est possibile, ut continuentur et consolidentur secundum naturam suam semper, propter exiccationem membrorum eorum: et consolidantur et continuantur quae ex eis sunt in fine lenitatis, sicut ossa puerornm paruorum.	And know that bones which are fractured, when they are in the prime of old age and declining, can never continue to heal and consolidate according to their nature forever, because of the drying out of their members: but they heal and continue somewhat limp, like those of a boy's young.
Verumtamen natura annectit super os fractum ex omni parte aliquid simile glutino, in quo est grossitudo, quo adhaeret et stringit ipsum, donec conglutinantur adinuicem, et ligantur adinuicem, donec uenit in fine fortitudinis et firmitudinis, sicut fuit in primis, donec non prohibet ipsum aliquid ab operationibus suis: et propter hanc caussam est necesse, ut ponas nutrimentum infirmi cibaria, in quibus sunt grauitas, et uiscositas, et grossitudo, sicut diximus.	Indeed, nature joins to the broken bone from all parts a similar glue, in which there is roughness, by which it adheres and holds itself fast until they are conjoined together, and bound together, until it arrives at its strength and firmness, as it was in the first place, until it does not prevent it from its operations: and for this reason it is necessary that you should put nourishment into the sick dishes, in which there are grains, and drinks, and roughness, as we have said.
Et scias, quod fracturae species sunt diuersae, secundum diuersitatem membrorum: quoniam fractura cruris, est diuersa a fractura ossis capitis: et fractura ossis pectoris, est diuersa a fractura ossis dorsi: et similiter reliqua membra omnia diuersa existunt adinuicem: et ego ueni cum rememoratione omnis speciei fracturae expositae in Capitulo suo distinctae ab alia.	And know that the types of fractures are diverse, according to the diversity of limbs: for the fracture of the thigh is different from the fracture of the skull, and the fracture of the breast bone is different from the fracture of the spine, and likewise all the rest of the limbs differ from each other. And I came with a reminder of all the types of fractures presented in its own chapter, distinct from the other.
Et diuersificantur species fracturae ossis etiam in seipsa.	And the species of bone fractures also differ from one another.
Quoniam fit fractura eius arcuata, praeter quod accidant in ea astellae.	For it is made by its curved arc, except that which happens in it of the arrows.
Et quandoque fit fractura eius secundum longitudinem ossis: et sunt fracturae eius satagiae, id est, astellae, et additiones procedentes, sicut sunt in calamo, cum aptatur cultello ad scribendum.	And when a fracture is made according to the length of the bone: and there are fractures of his legs, that is, arrows, and additions from it, as there are in the reed when cut with a knife for writing.
Et non procedentes: et est fractura cum uulnere et disruptione in capite: et est fractura fissura parua.	And not from it: and there is a fracture with an arrow and dislocation in the head: and there is a fracture, a small crack.
Et omni speciei est ingenium, uel instrumentum proprium in restauratione eius, secundum quod ueniet rememoratio eius, distincta in locis suis.	And every species has its own invention, or its own special instrument for restoring it, according to which the reminder of it comes, distinct in its own places.
Et ex eo quo cognoscitur fractura ossis, est tortuositas eius, et ipsius eminentia: et apparitio eius sensui, et sonitus eius quando comprimis ipsum manu tua.	And from this it is known that the fracture of the bone is its curvature and its eminence: and its appearance to the sense, and its sound when you compress it with your hand.
Quando ergo non est in loco tortuositas apparens, neque sonitus apud tactum tuum cum tangis os cum agitatione, neque inuenit infirmus magnum dolorem: tunc non est illic fractura, imo possibile est, ut sit tortuositas, aut fissura parua: non ergo oportet, ut moueas ipsum cum manu et compressione omnino, imo pone super ipsum ex medicinis, quarum uenit rememoratio, post momentum illud quod conuenit loco: deinde stringatur strictura subtili.	So then, when it is not in place, the curvature does not appear, and its sound does not be heard when you touch it with agitation, and great pain does not find it weak: then it is not a fracture there, but possible that there is a curvature or a small crack: so then you do not need to move it with your hand and compression at all, but put it over it from the doctors, of which the reminder comes, after the moment in which it arrives in place: then tighten it lightly.
Et scias, quod locus quando arcuatur, et scinditur in duo, praeter quod accidant in eo satagiae, uerumtamen remouetur omnis pars a compari sua: tunc oportet tibi, ut incipias ab hora tua ad rectificationem eius, aequando ipsum antequam accidat ei apostema calidum.	And you should know that when the place is arced and split into two, apart from what happens there in terms of sat agoe, all parts are nonetheless moved away from their comparators: then it is necessary for you to start from your own time to rectify it, equating it before it happens to her an apoplectic heat.
Si autem accidat ei apostema calidum, tunc dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot, donec quiescat apoestema.	If, however, an apoplectic heat occurs to her, then you should leave him for a few days until he quiets down the apoplexy.
Deinde aequa ipsum secundum quemcunque modum potest ex lenitate et ingenio.	Then make equal him according to whatever way he can from leniency and intelligence.
Et scias, quod restauratio eius, et ipsius aequatio, est facilior quam ossis, in quo accidunt satagiae.	And you should know that the restoration of him and his equality are easier than the bones, in which sat agoe occurs.
Deinde stringe ipsum, secundum quod ueniet tibi rememoratio eius.	Then tighten him up, according to what you remember of him.
Si uero in osse sunt satagiae, tunc necessaria est extensio huius membri fracti ex duabus partibus, si manus sit, aut pes: aut cum manu tua, si membrum est paruum: aut cum duobus funibus, aut cum fune et manu.	If, however, the sat agoe is in a bone, then necessary is the extension of this broken member from two parts, if it is a hand, or a foot: or with your hand, if it is a small member: or with two strings, or with a string and a hand.
Et sit positio tua qua ponis membrum super locum aequalem, secundum figuram suam naturalem, donec quando extenduntur partes membri fracti: tunc conare, ut redire facias illas additiones omni ingenio, et secundum quemcunque modum potes in locis suis: et caue secundum fortitudinem tuam, ne accidat super infirmum per operationem tuam dolor, neque laesio: et conare secundum fortitudinem tuam, ut applices unum duorum ossium cum socio suo, secundum meliores formas.	And your position should be that you place the member on a place equal to it, according to its natural figure, until when the parts of the broken member are extended: then try, by all means, to bring back those additions with skill, and according to whatever way you can in their places: and carefully, according to your strength, so that no pain occurs to the weak one through your operation, nor from laziness: and carefully, according to your strength, so that you apply one of two bones with its partner, according to the better forms.
Et oportet in illa hora, ut tentes et tangas ipsum manu tua.	And it is necessary in that hour, so that you try and touch him by hand.
Si ergo uides illic aliquid diuersum, rectifica ipsum, et aequa illud per quantitatem tuae uirtutis.	If, however, you see anything different there, then rectify the member, and make equal it by your strength.
Et caue extensionem uehementem, et compressionem fortem, sicut faciunt multi stolidorum.	And carefully avoid sharp extension and strong compression, as many stoics do.
Multotiens enim faciunt accidere per operationem illam suam apostema calidum, aut contractionem in membro: sicut iam uidimus illud ex operationibus eorum multotiens.	For many times they bring about an apoplectic heat or a contraction in a member by their operation: as we have already seen that one from their operations.
Deinde annecte post aequationem, et decentem operationem, et stricturam illius membri, et quietem, et tranquillitatem: et mone infirmum super ipsum.	Then, when he has recovered from his exhaustion, and is settled in his bed, and his limb is set firmly, and he is at rest, and calm, and tranquil: and remind the sick man of himself.
Et fac ipsum cauere, ne moueat ipsum in hora suarum uigiliarum, et somni sui apud reuolutionem suam, et agitationem suam, et apud egestionem suam, et omnes motus suos ultima uirtute sua.	And let him be careful not to move himself in the hour of his travail, and his sleep in his revolution, and his agitation, and his vomiting, and all his movements by the last strength of his own power.
Et ut caueat, ne sit positio membri positio cum qua sequatur dolor.	And so that he may be careful, that the position of the member should not be such as to cause pain.
Quod est, quia quando sentit in dispositione positionis membri dolorem, aut laesionem: tunc oportet, ut permutes ipsum ad dispositionem aliam ab illa cum qua non sentiat dolorem.	That is, because when he feels pain in the position of the member's disposition, or injury: then it is necessary that you change him to a disposition from which he does not feel pain.
Et caue cum illo, ut sit positio eius illa aequalis, recta: ut non accidat in membro tortuositas, quando restauratur.	And be careful with him, so that his position is equal and straight: so that no torosity occurs in the member when he is restored.
Et qualitas stricturae membri fracti est, secundum quod narro.	And the quality of a broken limb is to be firm.
Scias, quod membra fracta diuersificantur in paruitate sua, et eorum magnitudine, et ipsorum forma.	You should know that broken limbs differ from one another in their length and size, and in their form.
Quae ergo ex eis sunt parua, sicut brachium, et digitus, et focile, et similia eis, tunc oportet, ut sit inuolutio panni mollis, subtilis.	Which of them are shorter, such as the arm, and the finger, and the hoof, and others like them, then it should be that the covering cloth is smooth and soft.
Quae autem ex eis sunt grossa, sicut coxa, et crus, oportet ut sit in eis inuolutio lata, dura.	Which, however, are coarse, such as the hip, and the shin, it should be that the covering cloth is large and hard.
Quoniam ligamentum latum, connectit membrum magnum, et stringit ipsum ab omni parte strictura aequali, ita quod non ingreditur ipsum macula.	Because a wide ligament connects the large member, and tightens it by equal stricture, so that it does not enter it with a spot.
Deinde incipe post euacuationem tuam ab aequatione ponere linimentum conueniens ad illud, in stuppa leni super locum fracturae ipsius.	Then, after you have drained (it) from the equating, to begin putting on the ointment suitable for it, in a soft poultice over the place of the fracture.
Deinde incipe inuoluere ligamentum super locum fracturae ipsius tribus inuolutionibus, aut quatuor, secundum quod meretur membrum: et stringe manum tuam parumper cum ligamento.	Then, begin to cover with three or four applications of the poultice over the place of the fracture, according as the limb deserves: and grasp your hand lightly with the bandage.
Deinde uade cum eo ad partem superiorem a loco fracturae, et stringe minus quam fuit strictura tua, qua strinxisti locum fractum.	Then walk with him on the part above the place of the fracture, and tightener less than when you tightened the broken place, as you did.
Deinde elonga te cum inuolutione a loco fracturae parumper, et mollifica stricturam paulatim, donec capias ex loco sano rem magnam.	Then lengthen you with the evolution from the place of fracture somewhat, and soften the tightening gradually, until you get out of the place healthy thing great.
Deinde accipe uittam aliam, et inuolue eam iterum super locum fractum inuolutionibus.	Then take another one away, and evolve it again over the broken place with evolutions.
Postea uade cum inuolutione ad partem inferiorem a fractura.	Then lead with the evolution to the lower part from the fracture.
Et sit operatio tua in strictura inuolutionis, et mollificatione eius, secundum quod diximus in inuolutione prima superiore.	And let your operation be in the tightening of the evolution and its softening, according to which we said in the first evolution above.
Deinde pone inter inuolutiones ex stuppa leni, aut panno, cum quo aequetur tortuositas fracturae, si est in ea tortuositas: et si non, non ponas in ea aliquid.	Then put between evolutions from the splint soft, or cloth, with which it is equivalent to the curvature of the fracture, if there is a curvature: and if not, do not put anything in it.
Deinde inuolue super ipsam uittam aliam.	Then evolve over the other one away.
Postea aequa super has inuolutiones astellas decenter factas statim, si non est in loco inflatio, neque apostema calidum.	Then equal on these evolutions stars out of place immediately if there is no swelling, and no feverishness.
Si autem in ea est inflatio, aut apostema: tunc pone super eam quod sedet illud apostema, et auferat inflationem: et dimitte eam aliquot diebus.	But if there is inflammation, or swelling: then put on it what sits that swelling, and remove the inflammation: and let go of it for a few days.
Deinde stringe super ipsam tunc astellas.	Then tie on it then stars.
Et sint Astellae ex medietatibus cannae latae, rasae, formatae sapienter: aut sint ex ligno unde fiunt cribra, quae fiunt ex pino, aut geraid, id est, ramis palmae, aut calingi: et sit amplitudo omnis Astellae, secundum hanc formam, et hanc eandem figuram.	And let the stars be from the middle of the canes broad, rasped, shaped wisely: or from wood where cribra are made, which are from pine, or splints, namely, branches of the palm tree, or calingi: and let the width of each star be, according to this form, and this figure.
Verumtamen oportet, ut Astella quae ponitur super ipsam tracturam, sit grossior et latior parumper, quam reliquae Astellae: et longitudo Astellae sit secundum quod licet membro ex magnitudine et paruitate.	But it is necessary that the star which is put on the fracture be somewhat thicker and broader than the other stars: and the length of the star be according to what is suitable with size and shape.
Deinde stringe super Astellas cum uitta alia, secundum stricturam primam eandem.	Then tie on the stars with another one away, according to the first tightening.
Deinde liga desuper cum filis decenter, secundum quod diximus de strictura: et est, ut sit strictura tua super locum fracturae plus: et quanto plus elongatur a fractura sit, strictura minor.	Then tie from above with fils out of place, according to which we said about the tightening: and let be your tightening on the place of fracture more: and how much more is elongated from the fracture, so is the tightening less.
Et oportet, ut sint fila media in grossitudine et subtilitate, et sint ex lino molli.	It is fitting that they should be fine in length and slim in width, and made from soft linen.
Quoniam si fila sunt grossa, sicut uidi ex operatione stolidorum ponentium fila sua ex chordis lini tortis, est error magnus: quoniam cadit strictura cum eis extra qualitatem.	For if the sutures are thick, as when the sutures of the surgeons who perform operations on the heads are made with twisted linen thread, it is a great mistake: for tightness occurs outside the quality.
Et fila subtilia iterum non conueniunt: quoniam tu non consequeris per stricturam cum eis illud quod uis.	And fine sutures also do not agree: for you do not achieve that which you wish with tightness when you use them.
Et non oportet, ut sit inter astellam et astellam minus quam digitus.	And it should not be between a thumb and a finger in length.
Quod si laeditur infirmus per extremitates astellarum post stricturam in locis sanis: tunc pone sub eis ex stuppa leni, aut lana carminata, donec nihil laedatur ex illo.	That if an invalid is injured by the edges of the sutures in the places where there is tightness: then place under them from soft stuff, or red wool, until nothing is hurt from that.
Quando autem est fractura cum uulnere, et accidit disruptio in cute, ego ueniam cum rememoratione eius in capitulo secundum singularitatem.	When, however, there is a fracture with a bone, and there is a rupture in the skin, I return to this discussion in the second chapter with regard to its singularity.
Et scias, quod non omne membrum fractum oportet ut stringatur cum astellis a primo die.	And know that not every broken limb needs to be sutured from the very beginning.
Quod est, quia membrum quando est magnum, non oportet ut ponas superipsum astellas, nisi post quinque dies, aut septem, aut plus, secundum securitatem tuam ab euentu apostematis calidi.	That is, because the limb is large when it is broken, you should not put stitches on top of each other, unless after five days or seven or more, according to your confidence in the absence of infection.
Et iste est modus emplastrorum, quibus restaurabant antiqui, quae ponuntur super fracturam et dislocationem.	And this is the method of the ancient doctors who put on fractures and dislocations.
¶ Modus Emplastri communis abbreuiati, restaurans fracturam, conueniens pluribus complexionibus, praecipue mulieribus, et pueris: quoniam est ex eo super quod non uincit calor, neque frigus.	The common abbreviated method of the patch, restoring a fracture, suitable for many complexions, especially for women and children, because it is not affected by heat or cold.
Et est, ut accipias ex puluere molendini, et est medulla farinae quae pendet in parietibus molendini apud motum molae: et conficias ipsum sicut est, praeter quod cribelles ipsum cum albugine oui: et pone confectionem eius non spissam, neque subtilem.	And it is so that you take from the flour which is ground, and it is a sponge which hangs in the walls of the mill when it is moved by the millstone; and burnish it as it is, except for those little holes with white chalk: and place the coating not too thick, nor too thin.
Deinde utere eo.	Then use it.
¶ Modus Emplastri alius, restaurantis fracturam, et dislocationem, et torsionem.	The other method of the patch, restoring a fracture and dislocation and torsional injury.
Recipe almess, et laudani, et acaciae, et enulae, et mugath: et suc, omnium ana ʒ X myrrhae, et aloes amborum ana ʒ V et alethil ʒ XX terantur omnia, et cribellentur, et misceantur cum aqua alethil: aut cum albugine oui, si complexio infirmi est calefacta.	Recipe almess, et laudani, et acaciae, et enulae, et mugath: et suc, omnium ana ʒ X myrrhae, et aloes amborum ana ʒ V et alethil ʒ XX terantur omnia, et cribellentur, et misceantur cum aqua alethil: aut cum albugine oui, si complexio infirmi est calefacta.
Deinde utere hoc emplastro.	Then use this ointment.
Nam ipsum est bonae compositionis, restaurat ossa fracta uelociter, et confert pluribus hominibus.	For it is a good composition, quickly heals broken bones, and serves many people.
¶ Modus Emplastri alius, quod etiam confert fracturae et torsioni.	A different method of making an ointment, which also serves for fractures and twists.
Recipe mugath, et mess, et alteae albae, omnium ana ʒ X myrrhae, et aloes amborum ana ʒ V acaciae ʒ VI boli armeni ʒ XX terantur omnia contritione multa, et cribellentur, et conficiantur cum aqua, aut albugine oui: et administrentur.	Mugath, and aless, and white honey, all of which are made from myrrh in amounts of 10 parts, and aloe in 5 parts, and acacia in 6 parts; bolus armeni in 20 parts; well knead all together, and strain it out with water, or with alum, and administer.
¶ Modus Emplastri ad iuncturas, et ossa separata ex locis suis: et sedat dolorem accidentem eis, et scissuram ossis, et fracturam.	This is the method of ointment for joints, and separated bones from their sites; it calms pain from injuries, and fracture of the bone, and separation of the bone.
Sumatur lana succida, et submergatur in aceto, et oleo decocto: et ponatur super locum.	A dampened wool is soaked in vinegar, and oil is cooked with it; and it is placed on the site.
Et in hoc quidem Emplastro non est uirtus restaurationis, sed est bonum in sedatione apostematis calidi: et expellit dolores proprie.	And this ointment has no power to restore, but it is good for numbing hot blisters; and drives away its own pains.
¶ Modus Emplastri, quod restaurat os fractum.	This is the method of ointment, which restores a broken bone.
Sume folia fici surdi, et folia papaueris syluestris: et tere omnia, et fac emplastrum ex utrisque.	Gather leaves of the fig tree and leaves of the wild papaw; then dry them all out, and make an ointment from both.
¶ Modus Emplastri abbreuiati, administrati apud restaurationem fracturae ossis: et quando tu uis resolutionem residui apostematis.	This is a short method of ointment, to be applied to the restoration of a broken bone; and when you wish to remove a hot blister.
Recipe radicis alteae, et camomillae, et florum uiolarum, et farinae herbi, omnium ana partem unam: terantur omnia, et conficiantur cum uino, si non est membrum calefactum.	Melt together the root of aloe, and chamomile, and flowers of violet, and herb flour, all in one part; strain them all out, and make it with wine, if it is not a heated member.
Si uero est calefactum, tunc confice illud cum aqua coriandri humidi, aut cum aqua, et utere eo.	If it is indeed heated, then confer that with water from coriander seeds, or with water, and use it.
¶ Modus Emplastri alius fortioris in resolutione, quam istud primum, quando accidit apostema durum apud restaurationem membri.	A stronger method of application for this remedy, when a hard apoplexy occurs during the restoration of a limb, is to put it on with coriander seed water, or just water, and use it.
Recipe radicis alteae, et seminis lini, et balaustiae, et melliloti, et samsuci, et floris uiolarum, et camomillae, omnium ana, partem unam, terantur omnia, et conficiantur cum aqua salicis, aut cum aqua dulci, aut cum uino.	Take the root of wormwood, and the seed of flax, and balsam, and mealy-nut, and sassafras, and the flowers of violet, and chamomile, all of which are to be well ground, and confect with water of willow, or sweet water, or wine.
Totum illud secundum caliditatem membri, et quietem caloris eius.	All of this should be used according to the temperature of the member, and the calmness of its heat.
Hippocrates uero non dixit in libro suo, quod ponatur super membrum fractum apud restaurationem eius, nisi caerotum factum ex caera, et oleo: non aliud: et narrauit, ut sit medium inter grossitudinem et subtilitatem.	Hippocrates did not say in his book that which should be put on a broken member during its restoration, unless it is made from ash and oil: nothing else: and he related that it should be of a middle nature between coarseness and fineness.
Galeno autem uisum est, ut ponantur super membrum fractum apud restaurationem eius res, in quibus est exiccatio caliditatis, sicut myrrha, et aloes et olibanum, et similia eis ex eis quae narrauimus.	But Galen used to say that which should be put on a broken member during its restoration, in which there is a drying up of heat, such as myrrh, and aloe, and olive oil, and things like these from those which we have related.
¶ Modus Emplastri quod confert ad laesionem et dolorem.	A method of application that is used for an injury and pain.
Recipe mugath, et ciceris, et capillorum hominis incisorum, aut pennae auis, et alteae, et salis partes aequales: terantur, et cribellentur, et conficiantur: et fiat ex eo emplastrum.	Take mugget, and chickpeas, and hairs of a man's beard, or feathers of a bird, and wormwood, and salt, equal parts: grind them, and rub them together, and make an ointment: and let it be made from this.
Quantitas autem secundum quam oportet, ut remaneat ligatura, deinde soluatur, est, ut consideres tunc, si non accidit infirmo dolor, neque pruritus, neque mouetur os fractum a loco suo: tunc non resoluas ipsum diebus multis.	But the quantity, according to how much should remain of the paste, so that it remains bound together, and then is dissolved, you must consider this at that time, if it does not occur to the sick person pain, or itching, or the broken jaw moves from its place: then do not dissolve it over many days.
Quod si accidat ei in loco pruritus uehemens, aut dolor inquietans, aut inflatio: tunc propera, et solue in hora ipsum, et aufer emplastrum ab eo: et accipe pannum lenem, aut spongiam marinam lenem, humidam: et submerge eam in aqua tepida, et ablue cum ea locum, donec quiescat pruritus, et sedetur dolor.	If this occurs to him in a painful itching, or an unsettling pain, or swelling: then take care, and dissolve it at that very hour, and remove the ointment from him: and take a cloth of linen, or a marine sponge of linen, damp with water: and dip it into the water, and wash that place with it until the itching is calmed, and the pain subsides.
Deinde dimitte membrum quiescere una hora.	Then let the limb rest for an hour.
Deinde pone super ipsum lanam succidam, submersam in aceto et oleo, aut oleo rosato: et liga super ipsum nocte una, donec sis securus ab apostemate calido, et quiescat inflatio membri, et remoueatur dolor eius.	Then cover the wound with wool, soaked in vinegar and oil, or oil with a little rosin; and bandage it over night, so that it is kept away from heat, and the inflammation of the member may have time to subside, and the pain to be allayed.
Deinde itera ipsum ad stricturam subtilem, et emplastrum paruum: et non stringas ipsum constrictione tua prima, et subtilia cum eo, donec sanetur.	Then keep it moist with a thin plaster; and do not tighten it at first with your own bandages or with rough ones, but allow the wound to heal in its own way.
Quod si uides, quod apostema, et rubedo, et dolor, et inflatio, et omnia accidentia iam remota sunt penitus, et indiges emplastro et strictura, tunc itera illud sicut fecisti in primis aequaliter.	If you see that the swelling and redness and pain and inflammation and all other disorders are completely gone, and that the plaster and bandaging are comfortable, then apply the plaster as before with equal care.
Quod si non accidit membro aliquid ex eis quae diximus, tune non soluas ipsum, nisi post tres dies, aut quatuor, aut quinque, aut septem.	That if any of these things do not occur in the member, then do not remove the plaster until after three days, or four, or five, or seven.
Et quando que dimittitur uiginti diebus totum illud, secundum quod apparet tibi ex solutione membri, sicut diximus, donec quando adhaeret fractura, et approximat coagulatio carnis super eam: adde etiam tunc in strictura plus quam strictura tua prima tota: et adde etiam in ingrossatione cibi infirmi, secundum quod praecessit rememoratio eius.	And when it has been removed after twenty days, according to what you find out from the healing of the member, as we have said, until it seems that the fracture is healed and the blood clot has approximated to it: add also then to your bandaging more than you did before; and add also to the swelling of the food which is there, according to precedent.
Si autem uides locum fracturae iam exiccari, et extenuari plus quam oportet: tunc scias, quod nutrimentum prohibetur peruenire ad ipsum.	If you see that the place of the fracture has dried up and become thin more than it should: then know that food is prevented from reaching it.
Embroca ergo ipsum cum aqua tepida apud omnem uicem qua soluis ipsum, et sit illud in omnibus tribus diebus, et alleuia stricturam parumper.	Wrap it again with warm water about every second day, and leave the plaster on for all three days, and give a little relaxation to the bandage.
Per hanc ergo operationem currit ad membrum nutrimentum, et sanatur uelociter.	By this means then food runs to the member, and it heals quickly.
Illud autem quod faciunt stolidi restauratores ex fractura membri uice alia, quando non restauratur in primis, secundum quod oportet, et restauratur secundum tortuositatem, est error ex operatione eorum, et timor magnus: et si esset rectum, dixissent illud antiqui in libris suis, et operati fuissent cum eo.	But the action of the dull surgeons when they do not restore it at first, according to what is required, and restore it according to its tortuosity, is an error in their work, and a great fear: and if it had been right, the ancient writers in their books would have said so, and would have worked with it.
Et ego non uidi alicubi eorum uestigium in illo omnino, et rectius est, ut non fiat illud.	And I did not see their trace anywhere at all in that, and it is better that it should not be.
¶ De factura accidente in capite.	On the making of an accident in the head.
Caput III.	Chapters on the head.
Species fracturae sunt diuersae, et figurae eius multae: et caussae eius sunt distinctae.	There are various kinds of fractures, and many shapes of them; and their causes are distinct.
Nam ex fractura est quae fit a percussione cum ense: et percussio aufert os totum usquequo peruenit ad siphac, quod est sub osse, sicut facit axia in ligno: et propter illud nominatur haec species fracturae Axialis.	For from a fracture caused by impact with an instrument, the impact causes the whole bone to break until it reaches the cavity beneath the bone, which it does as it makes its way through wood; and therefore this type of fracture is called a axial fracture.
Aut ensis incidit quiddam ossis, et incidit faciem eius, et non penetrat incisio usque ad ultimum eius: et nominatur haec species fracturae Kalaan, id est, Leuatio absolute.	Or an instrument strikes some bone, and strikes its surface, but the incision does not penetrate to its tip; and this type of fracture is called a caloan, that is, a complete slippage.
Et est uulnus duarum fracturarum, aut magnum, aut paruum.	And there is a bar between two fractures, or it is great, or small.
Et ex fractura est, quae est contritio, aut attritio: et caussa eius est percussio cum lapide, aut casus super lapidem, aut eis similia.	And one is a fracture that is crushed, or rubbed; and its cause is impact with a stone, or falling on a stone, or similar.
Et haec fractura est etiam aut penetrans, quae iam appropinquat panniculo, quod est sub osse: aut est in facie ossis: et est uulnus harum duarum fracturarum etiam aut paruum, aut magnum.	And this fracture also is either perforating, which is approaching a patch, which is beneath the bone: or it is on the surface of the bone; and these two fractures are a bar between them, or small, or great.
Et ex fractura est, quae est occulta in osse in subtilitate capilli: et est fissura parua, et propter illud nominatur haec species fracturae Capillaris.	And one is a fracture that lies hidden in the bone in a hair's breadth; and it is a small split, and for this reason this type of fracture is called a capilar fracture.
Et ex eis est fractura, quae fit a casu, aut percussione lapidis, et eis similium, quae faciunt ingredi laminam ossis ad interiora, et fit loco concauitas: sicut accidit caldariis aeris, quando occurrit eis percussio, et ingreditur pars eorum ad interiora.	And of these is a fracture that is caused by a fall, or by the impact of a stone, and similar things which make the lamina of the bone come inwards, and it is done with a jolt: as happened to the bones of the air, when they were struck, and some of them came inwards.
Et plurimum quidem fit illud in capitibus humidorum ossium, sicut sunt capita puerorum.	And many things come about from this in the heads of the moist bones, as are the heads of boys.
Et fiunt omnibus istis speciebus fracturae satagiae separatae, et ego ueniam cum rememoratione illius totius in loco suo.	And all these types of fracture have separate names; but I shall remember them all together with their locations.
Et cognoscimus omnes has species fracturae per detectionem super eam, et inquisitionem earum cum tentis, et ablationem carnium corruptarum, quae sunt super eas.	And we know all these kinds of fractures by inspection above them, and by inquiry about them with the aid of bands, and by removal of the corrupted flesh which is above them.
Species uero Capillaris cognoscitur per hoc, quod detegitur super os, et abstergitur, et linitur super ipsum cum encaustro: fractura enim apparet nigra.	Indeed, the capillary species is recognized by being detected above the bone, and cleaned off, and placed over it with a caustic: for the fracture appears black.
In curatione autem fracturae, considera in primis accidentia infirmi: tunc si uides ex accidentibus quod significet significatione manifesta super timorem, sicut uomitus cholerae, et extensio, et amissio intellectus, et abscisio uocis, et syncopis, et febris acuta, et egressus oculorum, et rubedo eorum, et similia eis ex accidentibus in pluribus dispositionibus, proculdubio non sanatur: et si uides accidentia non terrentia te, et speras salutem: tunc incipe curationem eius.	In the curing of a fracture, consider first the symptoms of disease: if you see from the symptoms that it means a manifest warning about fear, such as vomiting cholera, and extension, and loss of reason, and loss of speech, and fainting fit, and acute fever, and outgoing of the eyes, and their rubor, and similar to these symptoms in many dispositions, surely he will not be cured: and if you see that the non-terrifying symptoms are there, and you hope for a cure: then begin his treatment.
Quod est, si uenit ad te uulneratus in primis cum uulneratur: et est illud in diebus hyemis, tunc oportet, ut studeas in ablatione ossis ante diem quartumdecimum secundum omnem dispositionem.	What is, if he comes to you wounded first with a wound: and it is that after a half-day, then it should be, that you try to remove the bone before the fourteenth day according to all dispositions.
Et si est in diebus aestatis, tunc oportet, ut properes remouere os ante diem septimum, antequam corrumpatur quod est sub osse ex panniculo, et accidant illa accidentia quae narrauimus.	And if it is in the days of summer, then it should be, that you remove the bone before the seventh day, before it corrupts what is under the bone from a flap, and those accidents which we have described.
Quod si fractura ossis iam peruenit ad panniculum tangentem cerebrum, et est cum minutiis, et attractione: tunc oportet, ut incidas partem comminutam, et attritam, secundum quod narro tibi.	What is, if the fracture of the bone has already reached a flap touching the brain, and it is with small pieces, and pulling: then it should be, that you break off a piece crushed, and ground, according to what I tell you.
Et est, ut radas caput uulnerati: et detege super os secundum quemcunque modum possibile est tibi: et secundum figuram uulneris, et quod leue est super infirmum.	And it is, that you shave the head of the wounded person: and detect above the bone according to any possible way for you: and according to the shape of the wound, and what is lighter is above the weakness.
Quod si accidat tibi apud detectionem ossis fluxus sanguinis, aut apostema calidum: tunc oppone ei cum eo quod oportet.	What is, if it happens to you in the detection of the bone of a flow of blood, or of hot pus: then oppose it with that which is necessary.
Et est, ut impleas locum cum pannis infusis in uino, et oleo rosato: et facias quiescere uulnus, donec sedetur apostema, et sis securus a fluxu sanguinis.	And it is, that you fill the place with cloths soaked in wine, and with olive oil: and make the wound rest, until the pus sits, and are secure from a flow of blood.
Deinde incipe in curatione ossis, et ablatione eius.	Then begin with the treatment of bones and the removal thereof.
Et illud fit secundum unum duorum modorum.	And that is done in two ways.
Modus quidem unus est, ut incidas os cum Incisorio strictae aciei: et haec est forma eius.	The one mode is that you strike the bone with a sharp chisel, and this is its form.
Dende administra Incisorium aliud post Incisorum latius eo parumper: et haec est forma eius.	Then take another chisel, wider by a little than the first one, and this is its form.
Deinde administra etiam Incisorium aliud latius etiam quam secundum.	Then also take another chisel, wider still than the second one, and this is its form.
Et modus secundus est, ut sit apud te numerus Incisoriorum diuersorum: quorum quaedam sint latiora quibusdam, et quaedam eorum breuiora quibusdam: et sint in ultimo acuitatis extremitatum suarum, et sint ex ferro indo, aut fuled: et utere facilitate in percussione super Incisorium, ut non concutiat caput, et laedat ipsum.	The second mode is that you have a number of chisels of different sizes; some are wider than others, and some are narrower than others: and let the last ones be pointed at their ends, and let them be made of steel or iron: and use one with ease in striking on the chisel, so that it does not injure the bone, but wounds it.
Si autem os est forte, durum: tunc oportet, ut perfores in circumitu eius, antequam tu administres Incisoria, cum Terebris quae nominantur Terebra non profundantia: et non nominantur ita, nisi quoniam ipsa non pertranseunt terminum ossis carnei ad illud, quod est post ipsum: propterea, quod Terebro est extremitas rotunda super illud, quod est sub capite eius acuto, similis margini, et circulus paruus prohibet submergi, et pertransire spissitudinem ossis.	If, however, the bone is strong and hard: then you should pierce around it before administering the chisels with the terbiums which are called terbums that do not cut into the flesh to that bone behind it: therefore, because the terbium is a rounded end above that sharp point, like a margin, and a little circle prevents its submerging, and penetrating the thickness of the bone.
Et conuenit tibi, ut accipias ex istis Terebris numerum multum, quorum unumquodque conueniat quantitati spissitudinis ossis, donec praesens sit tibi omni craneo Terebrum: cuius extremitatis acutae quantitas in longitudine et breuitate sit, secundum quantitatem spissitudinis illius cranei.	And it is fitting that you take a great number of these terbiums, each of which corresponds to the thickness of the bone, until you have had all of them for every cranium: whose acute end quantity in length and brevity is according to the thickness of its cranium.
Et haec est forma trium specierum Terebrorum, uel Trepanorum.	And this is the form of the three kinds of terbiums, or trepans.
Qualitas autem perforandi in circumitu ossis fracti, est: ut ponas Terebrum super os, et reuoluas ipsum digitis tuis, donec scias, os iam penetratum esse.	The quality of the piercing around a fractured bone is: that you place the trepan on the bone, and rotate it with your fingers, until you know that the bone has been penetrated.
Deinde permuta Terebrum ad locum alium, et pone quod est inter omne foramen quantitatem grossitudinis radii, aut circiter illud.	Then change the trepan to another place, and put whatever thickness of radius there is between all its holes.
Deinde incide cum Incisoriis quod est inter omne foramen ex osse: et fac illud subtilius quam potes super illud ex fine leuitatis, sicut diximus, donec eradices os, aut manu tua, aut cum aliquo alio ex quibusdam instrumentis, quae parasti ad illud: sicut tenaliae, et forpices subtiles.	Then cut with the incision, which is between all holes from bone: and make it finer than you can on that from the end of lightness, as we said, until you cut the bone, or by your hand, or with some other from among certain instruments, which you have prepared for him: like the nails, and fine hooks.
Et oportet, ut caueas omni cautela, ne tangat Terebrum, aut Incisorium aliquid ex siphac.	And it is necessary that, with all care, you do not touch the nerve, or some of the incisor from the sihap.
Cum ergo circumieris os perforando, et separatum fuerit a siphac, si fuerit continuum cum eo, et extraxeris ipsum, oportet ut radas, et aeques extremitatem eius quod remanet in osse cum instrumento alio simili Incisorio.	When you have surrounded the jaw by perforating it and separating it from the sihap, if it is continuous with it, and you extract it, it is necessary that you smooth, and equal the end of it which remains in the bone with another similar incision instrument.
Verumtamen oportet, ut sit tenuis et subtilis magis aliis Incisoriis.	However, it should be thinner and finer than other incision instruments.
Quod si remanet aliquid ex ossibus paruis, et satagiae: tunc accipe ea cum facilitate, cum eo quod est apud te ex instrumentis.	That if any of the small bones remain, and they are loose: then take them easily, with what is with you from instruments.
Deinde cura uulnus post illud cum liciniis, et unguentis quae diximus.	Then care for the wound after that with liniment, and the ointment which we said.
Et modus alius operationis est facilis, prorsus longinquus a timore: quem dixit Galenus, et laudauit ipsum laude magna: et iste est sermo eius.	And another way of the operation is simple, far from fear: which Galen said, and praised it greatly: and this is his speech.
Necese est tibi in primis, ut incipias detegere partem ossis ex loco, in quo fractura est uehementior, et manifestior: donec quando detexeris illam partem, et posueris sub eo extremitatem huius Incisorii lenticularis, cuius haec est forma.	It is necessary that you first, when you begin to move the side of bone where the fracture is more severe and more apparent: until, when you have moved it, and placed under it the end of this lens-shaped incision, whose this is the form.
Et pars lenticularis, lenis non incidit aliquid: et pars acuta eius in duabus lateribus eius uadens in longitudinem, sicut uides: ut sit pars lenticularis innixa ad siphac, facie eius incidente acuta in osse.	And the lens part, it does not cut anything: and the acute end of it in its two sides moving in length, as you see: so that the lens part be placed at the sihap, making the acute end of it touching the bone.
Deinde percute super Incisorium a parte una cum malleo paruo, donec incidas totum os cum facilitate, sicut reuoluitur: et tu sis securus ex panniculo, quod non accidat in eo accidens, quod timeas prorsus.	Then strike on the incision from one part with a small mallet, until you cut all the jaw with ease, as it is turned out: and you are safe from panic, that the accident does not happen in it, which you really fear.
Et si medicans non esset stultior hominum, et magis ignarus eius, nec esset dormiens, tunc si remaneret aliquid annexum ossi ex panniculo in quibusdam locis, incideret ipsum ab eo cum extremitate incisorii lenticularis ipsius, et liberaret ipsum ab eo cum facilitate.	If a surgeon were not more foolish than man, and less ignorant of him, and were not sleepy, then if there remained something attached to the bone from the pannicle in some places, he would strike himself with the lenticular edge of his scythe and set it free from him easily.
Liberatur enim ab eo sine nocumento, et absque timore.	For it is freed from him without harm, and without fear.
Et si fractura ossis non penetret usque ad panniculum, et illud quod abscinditur ab osse est facies eius, et remanent in ipso asperitas et satagiae subtiles: tunc oportet, ut radas illam asperitatem, et eradices illas satagias cum rasoriis subtilibus ex quibus praeparasti numerum diuersarum quantitatum, ut sit tibi possibile administrare ex eis in omni loco conuenientiora eorum, et rectiora ipsorum, secundum illud ad quod perducit te operatio, et ipsum os fractum, et figura eius.	And if the bone fracture does not go down to the pannicle, and what is cut off from the bone is the face of it, and in him remains roughness and subtle injuries: then you should rub off this roughness, and pluck out these injuries with sharp razors that you prepared a long time ago, so that it is possible for you to administer them in every place more convenient for them, and more rectilinear, according to what the operation leads you, and the broken bone, and its shape.
Et oportet, ut administres in rasione tua, qua in primis radis os, latius illorum rasoriorum.	And it is necessary that you administer in your razors, first of all, a groove of the bone, wide of these razors.
Deinde utere post ipsum subtiliore eo.	Then use after him a smaller one.
Et non cesses facere illud secundum continuitatem, donec peruenias ad administrandum tenuius, et subtilius eorum omnium.	And do not cease to make it according to the continuity, until you reach the administration of the thinnest, and the smallest of them.
In unaquaque autem fissurarum reliquarum paruarum capillarium, et fractura subtili, oportet ut administres curam, secundum illud quod perducit ad rectificationem eius.	In each and every one of the small cracks that remain from the thin skin, and in the subtle fracture, it is necessary that you administer care, according to what leads to its rectilinear.
Et est res quae non occultatur super omnem, cui in hac arte est quodlibet studium, et stetit super illud quod scripsimus, et ostendimus in fracturis magnis.	And it is a thing that does not hide over everything, to which in this art is any study, and stands on what we wrote, and showed in the large fractures.
Si autem panniculus detectus retinetur, quando tu eradicas os: tunc oportet, ut accipias pannum lini, secundum quantitatem uulneris, et submerge ipsum in oleo rosa, et pone ipsum super orificium uulneris.	But if the pannicle is caught, when you cut off the bone: then it is necessary that you take the linen cloth, according to the quantity of wound, and submerge it in rose oil, and put it over the opening of the wound.
Deinde accipe pannum alium duplicatum, aut triplicatum, et submerge ipsum in uino et oleo rosa, et pone ipsum super pannum primum: et fac illud quam facilius potes super illud, ut non grauetur siphac.	Then take another piece of cloth, doubled or tripled, and submerge it in wine and rose oil, and put it over the first cloth: and make it so that you can do it as easily as possible, so that it does not wriggle.
Deinde administra supra ipsum ligamentum latum: et non stringas ipsum, nisi per quantitatem quae teneat uulnus tantum: et dimitte ipsum cum hac cura die uno, aut diebus duobus, donec sis securus ab apostemate calido.	Then apply the ointment above the ligament; and do not tie it up tightly, unless by a quantity sufficient to keep only the fracture in place: and let go of it after one or two days' rest from fever.
Deinde solue ipsum, et administra post illud medicinas cum quibus est superflua siccitas: sicut radices lilii, et farina herbi, et puluis thuris, et aristolochia, et similia eis: et est, ut facias ex istis medicinis puluerem, qui puluerizetur super uulnus sicut sunt siccae.	Then unbind it and apply the medicines after it with which there is no need of dryness: such as the roots of lilies, and the flour of herbs, and the powder of turpentine, and of aristaolochia, and others like them; and you make a powder from these medicines, which you spread over the fracture as if dry.
Et uniuersaliter administra in illo omnem medicinam de proprietate cuius est ut abstergat, et non mordicet.	And universally apply to it all the medicine of its kind which is good for cleansing and not biting.
Et caue secundum tuam uirtutem, ut uulnus in curatione tua sit limpidum: neque sit in ea sordes unguenti, neque sordicies.	And cause the fracture in your cure to be smooth: so that the ointment is not sticky or dirty in it.
Neque dimittas uirus aggregari in eo omnino: quoniam quando uirus aggregatur super panniculum cerebri, corrumpit eum, et putrefacit ipsum, et accidit super infirmum post illud malicia magna: et iam accidit in siphac capitis, cum mundificatur ab eo os, praecipue quando negligitur cura eius, nigredo in superficie eius.	And do not allow any wound to accumulate anything at all; for when a wound accumulates on the skin, it corrupts and spoils itself, and causes great illness afterwards: and has already happened in the skull-cap, when it is cleaned out by it, especially when this care is neglected, blackening on its surface.
Considera ergo tunc, si accidunt infirmo accidentia quae diximus, scias, quia est pernitiosum proculdubio.	Therefore consider then, if these accidents happen to the sick, that they are certainly deadly.
Et si nigredo non accidit, nisi a medicina quae ponitur super ipsum, et est in uirtute illius medicinae, ut faciat illam nigredinem: tunc oportet, ut accipias ex melle partem unam, ex oleo rosato partes tres, et linias cum eis pannum.	And if blackening does not happen, except by the medicine which is put on it, and there is in its virtue to cause blackening: then you must take a part of honey, a part of rose-oil, three parts of linseed oil, and with them a cloth; and bind it up.
Deinde pone ipsum super siphac: postea cura ipsum cum speciebus curationis quae conueniunt, donec sanetur.	Then put the bandage on the wound: then care for the wound with the signs of cure which are suitable, until it is healed.
¶ De restauratione Nasi quando frangitur.	¶ Of the restoration of the nose when it is broken.
Caput IIII.	Chapter IV.
Scias, quod non franguntur ex Naso nisi duae partes eius superiores simul, aut una earum: propterea, quod ipse sunt duo ossa: quoniam inferius eius est cartilaginosum, non frangitur, et non accidit ei nisi attritio, et tortuositas, et simitas.	You should know that the two upper parts of the nose do not break together unless one of them does; for each is a bone: since the lower part is cartilage, it does not break and does not happen to it except by wear and tear, and twists, and similarity.
Si frangitur una duarum partium eius, tunc oportet, ut intromittas digitum paruum in foramen Nasi, et aeques illam fracturam digito tuo indice, et pollice deforis, donec redeat Nasus super figuram suam naturalem: et fiat illud arte, cum facilitate.	If one of its two parts is broken, then you should insert your little finger in the nasum foramen and with your index finger and thumb even out that break until the nose returns to its natural shape; and do this artfully and with ease.
Et caue, ne accidat per operationem tuam illam super infirmum dolor.	And take care not to cause that pain by your operation on the sick one.
Quod si fractura est in superiore parte Nasi, et non perueniat ad illam digitus: tunc oportet, ut aequetur extremitate radii, in quo sit grossitudo parua.	If the break is in the upper part of the nose and does not reach that digit: then it should be evened out with the tip of the little finger where there is a small thickness.
Si uero fractura est in duabus partibus, tunc fac simile illius: et propera cum restauratione eius in die primo fracturae, si est possibile.	But if the break is in two parts then make it similar to that; and take care with its restoration on the first day of the break if possible.
Et si non, tunc post diem septimum, aut decimum apud quietem apostematis calidi.	And if not, then after seven or ten days at the latest at rest with heat.
Deinde intromitte in extremitate Nasi licinium ex panno lini, si fractura est in parte una: aut intromite duo licinia si fractura est in duabus partibus: et sit in licinio grossitudo tantae quantitatis, quae impleat foramen Nasi.	Then insert into the tip of the nose a piece of linen cloth if the break is in one part; or two pieces of linen if the break is in two parts: and let it be so thick with such a quantity that it fills up the nasum foramen.
Et dixerunt quidam antiquorum restauratorum, ut infundantur licinia in butyro, et permutentur omni die.	And some old restorers said that they fill them with butter and change them every day.
Illud uero non uidetur mihi, imo oportet, ut infundatur licinium in albugine oui, confecto cum puluere molendini.	That, however, does not seem to me; but it should be filled with wax that has been ground up with powder for polishing.
Deinde dimitte licinium, donec firmetur os, et induretur cartilago.	Then remove the linen until the nose is firm and the cartilage is tough.
Et quandoque intromittitur in Nasum loco licinii penna anseris, postquam inuoluitur super ipsam pannus lenis: et fit, quod ipsa tenet fracturam Nasi uehementius, et ut non prohibeatur infirmus ab inspiratione.	And sometimes a feather of a duck is inserted into the nose after the linen has been wiped off it: and that holds the break together better, and does not prevent the sick one from breathing.
Et non est haec res necessaria.	That is not necessary.
Si uis, fac illud: et si uis, fac licinia.	If you want to, then do that: and if you want to, then make the linen thicker.
Quod si accidat Naso iterum dum operaris apostema calidum, emplastra nasum cum caeroto, aut cum coto infuso in oleo rosato, aut modico ex dyaquilon.	But if while you are operating the nose again the patient has a fever, then fill up the nose with mint, or with oil infused with rosemary, or with a little dandelion.
Si autem non accidit apostema calidum, tunc oportet, ut emplastres ipsum cum farina sisami, et puluere thuris confecti cum albugine oui.	But if there is no feverish blisters, then you should make a paste of himself with fine rice flour, and the powder of turpentine mixed with alum.
Deinde pone super ipsum stuppam lenem, et non liges Nasum cum aliquo omnino.	Then put on him a layer of wood-chip, and do not bind his nose at all.
Si uero franguntur ossa Nasi fractura parua, aut comminuuntur, tunc oportet, ut scindas super ea, et extrahas ipsa cum instrumentis quae conueniunt eis.	But if the nasal bones are broken or crushed, then you should cut them off, and remove the bone with the appropriate instruments.
Deinde sue scissuram, et cura ipsum cum eo quod incarnat, et consolidat ex emplastris conuenientibus ad illud, uel unguentis.	Then carry out a cure for the infection and consolidation with the appropriate paste or ointment.
Quod si accidat inter Nasum uulnus, tunc oportet, ut cures ipsum cum liciniis: et administres cannulam de plumbo, donec sanetur.	But if there is a fracture between the nasal bones, then you should cure it with a liniment: and administer a lead tube until it heals.
¶ De restauratione Mandibulae inferioris, quando disrumpitur.	For restoration of the lower jaw when it has been broken.
Caput V.	Chapter V
Quando disrumpitur Mandibula inferior, et fractura eius non est cum uulnere: conspice tunc si est fractura eius deforis tantum, et non frangitur in duo, et curuatur ad interiora: tunc cognitio eius est facilis.	When the lower jaw is broken and not joined to the nose: examine then if the fracture is only of the bone and not broken into two parts, and treat it from within: then it is easy to recognize.
Oportet ergo, si est fractura eius in parte dextra, ut intromittas digitum indicem sinistrae in os infirmi: similiter si fractura est in mandibula sinistra, tunc intromitte indicem manus dextrae: et impelle cum eo gibbositatem fracturae deintus cum facilitate ad exteriora cum manu tua altera ab interiori parte ossis decenter, et cum eo aequa ipsam.	Therefore, if the fracture is on the right side of the jaw, introduce the index finger of the left hand into the mouth: likewise, if the fracture is on the left side of the jaw, then introduce the index finger of the right hand: and push it from inside with ease towards the outside with your other hand from the inside of the bone, and thus level it evenly.
Quod si fractura mandibulae iam separata est in duo, tunc oportet, ut administres extersionem a duabus partibus, secundum rectitudinem: donec possibilis sit aequatio eius.	But if the fracture of the jaw has already separated it into two parts, then you should administer external pressure from both sides, according to the line of fracture: until it is possible to restore its alignment.
Si autem iam accidit in dentibus commotio, aut disruptio: tunc stringe illos de quibus speras quod remaneant cum filo auri, aut argenti, aut seta.	But if the disturbance or rupture has already occurred in the teeth: then tighten them with a gold wire, or silver, or silk thread.
Deinde pone super mandibulam fractam caerotum.	Then put on the fractured jaw a poultice.
Deinde pone super ipsum pannum duplicatum, et pone super pannum astellam magnam decenter factam: aut frustum cutis soleae aequale, in longitudinem mandibulae.	Then put on himself a double cloth, and a long piece of skin from the sole of a horse: or a fragment of leather of equal length to the jaw.
Deinde liga ipsum desuper, secundum quod praeparatur tibi ligatura eius, et conuenit ipsius applicatio, donec non destruitur: et praecipe infirmo, uti tranquillitate et quiete: et pone cibum eius sorbitiones lenes.	Then bind the wound well, according to the preparation of his ligature, and the application of it agrees with him until it is destroyed; and order the sick man to use peace and quietness; and put food for his drinkings.
Si autem estimas, quod iam alteratur aliquid figurae aliquo modorum: tunc propera, et solue ipsum in die tertio.	But if you think that a little change has occurred in the shape by some kind of motion: then approach and remove it on the third day.
Deinde rectifica quod alteratum est ex eo, et emplastra ipsum ex puluere molendini, cum albugine oui, aut cum farina sisami, postquam tu abstuleris caerotum: et pone super emplastrum lanam lenem.	Then straighten out what has been disturbed from it, and patch up the wound with flour that has been ground, or with wheat flour, after you have removed the scabs: and put wool on top of the patch.
Dum ergo permanet annexum illud emplastrum super ipsum, et non alteratur ossis dispositio, dimitte ipsum, ne soluas, donec sanetur: aut stringe fracturam.	While this patch remains attached to the wound, and the arrangement of the bones does not change, let go of it, do not tear it apart, until it has healed: or tighten the fracture.
Multotiens enim stringitur haec fractura in tribus septimanis.	This fracture is often tightened seven times.
Quod si interim accidat apostema calidum, tunc administra illud quod diximus multotiens in sedatione eius, donec remoueatur illud apostema.	If, however, a heat blister occurs, then administer to it what we have said many times in its sedative, until it removes that blister.
Et si fractura est cum uulnere, considera.	And if the fracture is with the ulna, consider.
Namsi iam separatur ex osse frustum, aut a satagie: tunc subtilia te in hoc, ut auferas illa frusta satagiae cum eo quod conuenit tibi in ablatione eorum ex instrumentis.	Now I have separated the small bone, or from a saw: then carefully do you in this case, so that you remove those splinters of the saw with it when it agrees with you to take them away from the instruments.
Si uero orificium uulneris est strictum, tunc amplifica ipsum cum phlebotomo secundum quantitatem necessitatis tuae.	But if the opening of the wound is tight, then widen it with a phlebotome according to the quantity of your need.
Deinde quando abstuleris illa satagie, et non remanserit ex eis aliquid, sue tunc orificium uulneris, si est amplum: et si non, pone super ipsum ex emplastris quae conueniunt ad illud, et incarnant illud, donec sanetur.	Then when you have removed those splinters, and there remains none of them, then make the opening of the wound wide, if it is wide: and if not, put on top of it from the patches which agree with it and make it grow, until it has healed.
¶ De restauratione Furculae, quando frangitur.	The restoration of the fork, when it breaks.
Caput VI.	Chapter VI.
Plurimum quidem frangitur Furcula ab anteriore parte ex parte humeri, et fractura eius fit secundum unum trium modorum.	The fork is often broken in the front part from the shoulder blade, and its fracture is made according to one of three kinds.
Aut enim frangitur et separatur in duo, praeter quod accidant in ea satagiae: et est facilius ad restaurationem eius.	Or it is broken and separated into two, except that they fall into it from a saw: and it is easier to restore it.
Aut ita, quod accidunt in osse satagiae: et est difficilius ad restaurationem.	For thus happeneth in the bone that is broken; and to restore it is more difficult.
Aut ita, quod est fractura cum uulnere.	Or thus when the fracture is with the ulna.
Et operatio in ea quando fractura est absque uulnere, est, ut facias praesentes esse duos ministros, ut teneat unus eorum adiutorium quod sequitur Furculam fractam, et alter extendat collum uersus partem.	And the operation when the fracture is without the ulna, that is, as you are doing present two ministers, one to hold the help that follows the broken furcula, and the other to extend the neck opposite the side.
Deinde aequa fracturam digitis tuis, donec fiat forma eius, secundum quod oportet: et non sit in ea eminentia, neque concauitas.	Then make the equal break in your fingers until it takes on shape as is necessary: and there should not be any突出 or concavity in it.
Quod si indiges extensione plus, tunc oportet, ut ponas sub titillico infirmi spheram ex panno, aut lana: et sit magnitudo eius secundum quantitatem necessitatis tuae: et extende, et eleua Furculam, et coarta spheram manu tua, donec aeques fracturam, secundum quod oportet.	That if you wish to extend further, then it is necessary that you place under a tickle ball of cloth or wool: and the magnitude of it should be according to the necessity of yours: and extend, and smooth the furcula, and with your hand compress the ball, until the equal break takes shape as is necessary.
Quod si non potes trahere extremitatem Furculae ad exteriora: propterea, quia peruenit ad profundum: tunc oportet, ut resupinetur infirmus super ceruicem suam: et ponas sub humero eius puluinar medium in magnitudine, et premat minister humerum eius ad inferiora, donec eleuetur os Furculae quod est in profundo ad sursum: atque tunc rectifica fracturam, et aequa eam digitis tuis.	That if you cannot draw the extremity of the furcula towards the outside because it reaches to the depth: then it is necessary that he lies down on his chest: and place under his shoulder in the middle a ball of wool, and press the minister of his shoulder to the inferior part, until he raises the bone of the furcula which is in the depth upwards: and then correct the break, and make it equal with your fingers.
Si autem sentis sathaiatum ex Furcula, et mouetur: tunc oportet, ut findas super illud, et extrahas ipsum alsathaiatum cum facilitate.	That if you feel pain in the furcula, and it trembles: then it is necessary that you find out on it, and draw out the piece of bone with ease.
Si autem est retentum in osse, tunc ingenia in incisione eius cum uno Incisoriorum quae praeparasti ad illud, postquam tu posueris sub Furcula instrumentum quod seruat sifach: et est instrumentum ex ligno, aut ex ferro.	That if it is stuck in the bone, then use in the incision of it one of the incisors which you prepared for it, after you have placed under the furcula an instrument that keeps the piece: and that instrument is made of wood, or iron.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form.
Assimilatur cochleari cui non est concauitas.	It is like a shell which has no eminence.
Et sit latitudo eius secundum illud quo indiges eo ex magnitudine ossis, et paruitate eius.	And its width is according to what you wish by the size of the bone, and the evenness of it.
Longitudo uero eius etiam secundum quod possibile est tibi ad operationem.	The length is indeed also what you need to operate.
Et habeat duas extremitates, sicut uides: et extremitas una sit ampla, et altera stricta.	And it has two ends, as you see: one end is wide and the other is tight.
Si autem disruptio uulneris quod scidisti quando extraxisti sathaiatum ossis, est ampla, et securaris ab apostemate calido: tunc aggrega duo labia uulneris cum sutura.	But if the wound you cut when you extracted the bone shavings is wide and cool to touch, then join the two sides of the wound together with a stitch.
Et si disruptio est parua, aut times apostema calidum: tunc imple uulnus cum pannis, et puluillis secundum quantitatem scissurae uulneris.	And if the wound is small, or the scar is warm: then fill the wound with cotton wool and powder according to the amount of the wound.
Quod si accidat apostema calidum, tunc infunde pannum in oleo rosato, et aceto, et uino, et pone super ipsum.	What if a scar is warm, then pour oil made from rose and vinegar and wine on it, and place it on the wound.
Strictura uero ossis quando est absque uulnere, et absque sectione, est, ut ponas super os emplastrum factum ex farina molendini cum albugine oui.	The bone is hard when it is without a wound, and without being cut, it is, as you put it on the bone plaster made from ground flour with alba (a white substance).
Et pone stuppam lenem super ipsum.	And place a wooden brace on top of the bone.
Deinde pone spheram sub titillico eius, si indiges illa.	Then place a sphere under the title (a device to hold something in position), if you like it.
Deinde accipe himematem, id est, rotam quam tenent Saraceni, quae sit longa ualde: et sit latitudo eius palmi unius, aut circiter illud.	Then take blood, which the Saracens call "hammem," which is long and wide: and make its length about the palm of your hand, or around it.
Deinde pone puluillum duplicatum super stuppam et emplastrum.	Then place a doubled layer of cotton wool on top of the brace and plaster.
Deinde accipe astellam ex tabula subtili, cuius latitudo sit trium digitorum, et in longitudine similiter.	Then take an astrolabium from a thin board, whose length is like that of three fingers, and its width similarly.
Deinde inuolue eam in panno.	Then wrap it in a cloth.
Deinde inuolue pannum illum cum astella in loco alhimemati qui cadit super fracturam et locum.	Then wrap the cloth with the astrolabium in the place of alchemy which falls on the fracture and the place.
Deinde pone alhimemati super fracturam sicut reuoluiur, et inuolue eam super collum eius, et sub titillico eius sano, et sub titillico eius infirmo: et reduc eam super omnem partem, et quomodo uides quod strictura tenet fracturam strictura decenti: et est illud, quod non occultatur super te, et totum, ut non remoueatur astella desuper os fractum.	Then place the alchemy on top of the fracture as a cover, and wrap it on top of his neck, and under the title of health, and under the title of sickness: and if it is not hidden from above you, and all, so that it does not move the astrolabium from above the bone fracture.
Et propter hoc oportet, ut aspicias infirmum in omni die.	And for this, you must look at the sick person every day.
Quotiens ergo mollificatur ligamentum, et uides astellam iam remoueri: tunc rectifica illud, et stringe ligamentum.	Whenever therefore the ligaments are softened, and you see that they have been loosened: then straighten them out, and tighten the ligaments.
Deinde pone somnum infirmi super dorsum eius, et pone sub titillico eius apud somnum eius puluinar paruum in nocte, ut cum eo eleuetur adiutorium eius a latere ipsius.	Then put the poultice of nurse behind his back, and place under his side near his sleeping place in the night some fine powder, so that when he moves he may find help from it on either side.
Eleuatur ergo fractura furculae per eleuationem humeri.	So the fracture of the femur is healed by the elevation of the shoulder.
Aut liga brachium eius ad collum ipsius: et non soluas ligamentum, si non accidat in loco accidens ex pruritu, aut ab apostemate, usque ad duodecim dies.	Or bind his arm to his neck: and do not loosen the ligaments, if it is not a case of accident from scratching or being torn away, until after twelve days.
Deinde renoua emplastrum, si uideris faciem eius ad illud.	Then renew the poultice, if you see that his face turns towards it.
Et adde in strictura, et dimitte ipsum, donec restauretur et coaguletur.	And add to the strapping, and let him go, until he is restored and coagulated.
Et fractura quidem furculae stringitur et confortatur secundum plurimum in uigintiocto diebus: et quandoque fit in quibusdam hominibus in minore illo.	And the fracture of the jaw is tightened and supported according to many in twenty days: and sometimes it is done in some men with less.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Spatulae.	Of the restoration of the fracture of the spatula.
Caput VII.	Chapter VII.
Raro frangitur Spatula, et in loco lato eius: et non franguntur ex ea nisi margines eius.	Rarely does the spatula break, and not in its width: and it does not break from it except at its edge.
Quando ergo frangitur ex eo locus, et frangitur in medio eius, et non cognoscitur illud nisi per tactum: tunc secundum quod est figura fracturae conare praeparationem eius.	When therefore it breaks from the side, and it breaks in the middle of it, and it is not known except by touch: then, according to the shape of the fracture, prepare the treatment for it.
Et reduc eam super figuram naturalem omni modo ingenii, quod est tibi possibile.	And reduce it to its natural shape in every way that is within your power.
Deinde pone super locum puluerem molendini cum albugine oui, et stuppam lenem, et pone desuper puluillum ex panno duplato.	Then put on the place with powdery plaster made from chalk and linseed oil, and a wisp of rags, and put on the upper part a poultice made from a double cloth.
Deinde pone super ipsum astellam latam ex tabula subtili secundum quantitatem Spatulae totius, aut ampliorem ea parum.	Then put over it a thin plate of lead according to the quantity of the whole spatula, or somewhat larger than that.
Si uero sub astella est concauitas in aliquo locorum Spatulae, tunc aequa illam concauitatem cum stuppa leni, donec descendat astella secundum aequalitatem.	If, however, under the plate there is an indentation at any place of the spatula, then make the indentation equal with soft lead, until the plate descends according to equality.
Deinde ftringe desuper cum alhimemati longa, constrictione decenti, et firmitudine astellae, donec non remoueatur a loco suo.	Then, the wound is covered with long, tight bandage and hard pad, until it does not move from its place.
Et considera ligamentum in omni die.	And consider the ligature every day.
Quotienscunque ergo mollificatur ligamentum, stringe ipsum, et aequa astellam si remoueatur a loco suo: et iaceat infirmus super latus suum sanum.	So whenever the ligature softens, tighten it again and if it moves from its place, keep it in place with an equal pad, and let the sick lie on his healthy side.
Et Spatula quidem restauratur in uiginti diebus, aut in uigintiquinque diebus.	And indeed the spatula is restored after twenty days, or after twenty-five days.
Quando ergo completur iste numerus, tunc solue ligamentum: et tu sis in securitate.	So whenever this number is completed, then loosen the ligature: and you shall be safe.
Nam ipsa est ex ossibus quorum communitio non timetur, neque eorum solutio.	For this same is made of bones whose comunion is not feared, and their loosing.
Si autem procedat ex osse frustum, et pungit sub cute: tune scinde super ipsum, et aufer ipsum.	But if it proceeds from a bone-fragment, and pierces the skin: then cut over it, and remove it.
Et fac quod diximus in fractura furculae ex sedatione apostematis calidi, si accidat ex eo aliquid.	And do what I said in the fracture of the fork from a sitting hot blister, if anything happens from it.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Pectoris.	As for the restoration of the fracture of the breastbone.
Caput VIII.	Chapter VIII.
Pectus quandoque frangitur in medio sui, et raro accidit illud.	The breastbone sometimes breaks in the middle of it, and that rarely happens.
Extremitates eius quidem plurimum franguntur, et comminuuntur ex accidentibus eius.	Its extremities, however, most frequently break, and they are broken from its accidents.
Quando frangitur eius medium, quod declinat ad inferiora, et accidit ei dolor uehemens, et difficultas in anhelitu, et tussis: et fortasse euomit sanguinem, et declaratur concauitas in osse fracto, et non occultatur sensui, Restauratio eius est, ut resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum: et pone inter Spatulas eius puluinar.	When it breaks in the middle, which inclines towards the lower part, and happens to it a severe pain, and difficulty in breathing, and possibly spitting blood, and reveals a fracture in the breastbone, and is not concealed from sensation, its restoration is that he shall lie on his back, and place under its sides the spatula.
Deinde preme humeros eius, et aggrega costas a duabus partibus uel lateribus cum manibus: et subtiliare in aequatione eius, secundum omnem modum quo possibile est illud et conuenit, donec redeat figura ossis, secundum quod oportet.	Then squeeze his shoulders, and bring together the ribs on both sides or sides with the hands: and gently adjust its alignment, in accordance with any possible way, as it fits, until he regains his figure, according to what is required.
Deinde pone super ipsum emplastrum et stuppam, et pone desuper astellam ex tabula subtili ex salice, aut chalingi, et ex eis similibus in leuitate, postquam tu inuoluis eam in panno.	Then place over the patient an ointment and a pillow, and place over it on a board from thin wood, or a plank, and from those similar in lightness, after you have washed it with a cloth.
Deinde subtiliare in ligando eam super os fractum, ut non remoueatur: et uade cum ligatura secundum rotunditatem ad dorsum aliquotiens, et stringe ipsum strictura decenti.	Then, with a subtle tying, bind it over the broken bone so that it does not move; and sometimes, with the tie, go around the back according to its roundedness, and tighten it by tightening it gently.
Deinde considera ligaturam in omni hora, et quotienscumque mollificatur, stringe eam: et si necessitas eius prouocat ad solutionem eius apud pruritum, uel corrosionem quae accidit in loco, aut dolorem, aut apostema: tunc propera, et solue eam, et eradica emplastrum, et rectifica quod accidit cum modo curationis eius.	Then consider the bandage at all times, and whenever it softens, tighten it; and if necessity calls for its unbinding in order to treat pruritus, or corruption that has occurred on the site, or pain, or aphesis: then approach, and loosen it, and remove the plaster, and set right what has happened with regard to the mode of its cure.
Deinde reduc emplastrum, si uides ad illud faciem: et annecte ei stricturam, donec sanetur.	Then, if you see fit to do so, reduce the plaster, and attach the tie again until it heals.
¶ De restauratione Costarum, quando franguntur.	For the restoration of ribs when they are broken.
Caput IX.	Chapter IX.
Scias, quod Costarum fractura non accidit, nisi in locis grossis quae sequuntur dorsum, et ex extremitatibus earum ab anteriori parte.	You should know that a rib fracture does not occur unless in the regions far from the back and from the extremities of it towards the front.
Et non accidit eis attritio, nisi propterea, quia sunt cartilaginosae.	And they do not undergo wear and tear except for this reason, because they are cartilage.
Et cognitio ipsius non occultatur sensui apud inquisitionem cum digitis.	And the knowledge of it is not hidden from the sense of inquiry with fingers.
Et restauratio eius fit ita, ut aeques fracturam cum digitis secundum modum possibilem, donec aequetur figura, secundum quod oportet.	And its restoration is done so that an equal fracture with fingers in the second possible mode, until it is equal in form, according to which it is necessary.
Deinde emplastra, et stringe os fractum cum astella, si indiget illo.	Then bind with a plaster, and tighten the broken bone with an axle if he needs it.
Et si fractura Costarum est decliuis ad interiora: tunc accidit infirmo dolor uehemens, et punctura, sicut punctura illa quae accidit illi qui habet pleuresim: propterea, quod os pungit uelamen, et etiam ei accidit difficultas anhelitus, et tussis, et uomitus sanguinis multi: et haec est difficilis curationis.	And if the fracture of the ribs is a declivity towards the inner parts: then there occurs a painful pain to the sick person, and puncturing, like that which happens to him who has pleurisy: for the bone pricks the wound, and also there occurs to him difficulty in breathing, and coughing, and spitting up of blood: and this is a difficult cure.
Et iam ingeniati sunt antiqui in ea cum ingeniis multis: et ex eis sunt qui dicunt, ut ponas cibos infirmi qui generent inflammationem et uentositatem, ut inflammetur uenter, et extendatur, et impellatur fractura ad exteriora.	And the ancient people have devised many devices in it: and from them are those who say, "Let you set fire to food which generates inflammation and ventilation, so that inflammation may be kindled in the abdomen, and it may spread, and push the fracture towards the outside.
Nos uero abhorremus, ut non fiat caussa uelox ad faciendum apostema calidum, si non accidit.	We do not despise, so that it does not happen quickly to make an apostema hot, if it does not happen.
Si autem iam accidit, tunc addit in eo.	But if it has already happened, then add it in there.
Et dixerunt quidam eorum: ponatur super locum uentosa, deinde sugatur cum fortitudine, et est similius ratiocinationi.	And said one of them: Let it be placed on a windy place, and then sucked with strength, and it is similar to the reasoning.
Verumtamen timetur, quod attrahat uentosa superfluitates ad locum, propter dispositionem debilitatis.	But they are afraid that what is drawn by the winds will draw away to a place of weakness because of its disposition.
Et dixerunt quidam eorum: oportet ut cooperiatur locus cum lana quae iam submersa est in oleo calido: et ponantur puluilli inter Costas, donec impleatur: ut sit ligatura aequalis quando inuoluis eam secundum rotunditatem.	But said one of them: It should be that a place covered with wool that has already been submerged in hot oil: and let them put down feathers between the sides, so that it fills up: and to be a bond equal when it is rolled over by the roundness.
Deinde curetur infirmus curatione pleuresis ex cibo et medicina.	Then take care of the sick with poultices from food and medicine.
Quod si coartat infirmum res uehemens, quam non tolerat, et os pungit uelamen punctura laedente, et timemus super infirmum: tunc oportet, ut scindamus super locum, et detegamus a Costa fracta.	That if it is pulled out from under the sick man, which he does not bear, and it pokes the mouth with a piercing wound that hurts him, and we are afraid over the sick: then it should be that we break out on the spot, and we find from the side broken.
Deinde ponamus super ea instrumentum quod conseruat sifac, cuius rememoratio praecessit: et incidamus os cum facilitate, et incidamus ipsum.	Then let us put on it an instrument that holds the syringe, of which memory preceded: and let us break the mouth with ease, and let us break him himself.
Deinde aggregemus duo labia uulneris, si est magnum cum sutura: et curemus ipsum cum emplastris, donec sanetur.	Then let us gather together two lips of the wound, if it is large with a stitch: and we will take care of him with plasters, until he heals up.
Quod si accidat interim apostema calidum, tunc propera, et infunde puluillos in oleo rosato, et pone super locum: et curetur infirmus cum eo quod conuenit apostemati.	That if the hot apostema happens to come on, then let it approach, and pour in feathers in rose oil, and put on the spot: and take care of the sick man with it because it is appropriate for the apostema.
Interim etiam resupinetur super latus super quod dormit, donec sanetur.	In the meantime also let him lie down on the side where he sleeps, until he heals up.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Spondilium dorsi et colli.	Of restoring a broken spine of the back and neck.
Caput X.	Head 10.
Ossibus quidem colli quandoque aduenit fractura, et raro accidit eis attritio: et similiter Spondilibus dorsi etiam.	Of bones of the neck when a fracture comes about, and rarely happens to them that they are worn out: and also for the spinebones of the back.
Cum ergo accidit illud alicui, et uis scire, an sanetur, an non sanetur: tunc confidera.	So if it happens to someone that he is healed or not healed, then trust in God.
Nam si uides manus eius iam mollificatas, et stupefactas, et mortuas: et non potest mouere eas, neque extendere eas, neque constringere eas: et quando constringis eas cum digitis tuis, et pungis eas cum acu, non sentit illud, et non sentit in eis dolorem: tunc scias, quia non sanatur, et in pluribus dispositionibus est mortale.	For if you see his hands already softened, and stupefied, and dead; and cannot move them, or extend them, or contract them: and when you press them with your fingers, and prick them with a sharp instrument, he feels nothing, and does not feel pain in them: then you will know that he is not healed, and is mortal in many dispositions.
Quod si mouet eas, et sentit in eis constrictionem cum digitis et puncturam: tunc scias, quia nucha ossis salua est, et quod infirmus sanabitur cum curatione.	That if he moves them, and feels a constriction in them with your fingers, and a prick: then you will know that the spine of the bone is healed, and that the sick person will be healed with treatment.
Quod si eueniat Spondilibus dorsi simile illius, et uis scire, an sanetur etiam, an non: tunc considera ad pedes eius: tunc si uides quod mollificati sunt, et accidit in eis illud quod accidit in manibus: deinde quando iacet super dorsum suum, egreditur uentositas et egestio absque uoluntate: et quando resupinatur super uentrem suum, egreditur egestio sine uoluntate: et quando resupinatur super dorsum suum, et uult mingere, et non potest: tunc scias, quia est mortale.	That if it should become like the spine of a horse on his back, and you wish to know whether he is healed or not, then examine his feet: then if you see that they are softened, and that what happens to his hands also happens to his feet: then when he lies down on his back, he walks with a wavering walk, and does so without volition; and when he rises up on his stomach, he walks with eagerness, but cannot: then you will know that it is mortal.
Non ergo labores in curatione eius.	Do not therefore engage in the cure of him.
Si uero non accidit ei aliquid ex illo, res est leuior.	But if nothing at all happens to him from it, then the matter is lighter.
Et curatio eius quod accidit ex illo est, ut coneris sedationem apostematis calidi: ita, ut ponas super Spondilem attritam oleum rosatum solum: aut cum uitellis oui assati.	And the cure that happens from it is, as you know, to cool down the inflammation with hot oil: so that you put on top of a broken spine oiled rosin: or when you rub out with a towel.
Pone super ipsam illud aliquotiens in die, donec quando sedatur apostema calidum: tum pone super locum unum ex emplastris confortantibus, exiccantibus, et stringe super ipsum cum ligamento: et praecipe infirmo, ut utatur quiete et tranquillitate.	Place on top of it sometimes in the day, until he becomes settled in a calm state of heat; then place on a place that is comfortable, drying, and tighten over him with a strap: and direct the sick person to use tranquility and calmness.
Nec dormiat super partem cum qua inuenit dolorem, donec sanetur.	And let him not sleep on the side where he feels pain, until he is healed.
Quod si accidit apud attritionem ossis sathaiatum, aut aliquid quod iam separatum fit ex eo: tunc oportet, ut seces super cutem, et auferas illud.	If it happens that the bone is worn away, or something that has already been separated from it: then one should let it separate above the skin and take that away.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris, si est magnum, cum sutura.	Then join together the two lips of the wound, if it is large, with a stitch.
Deinde cura ipsum cum aliquo incarnatiuo, ex unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then take care of him himself, with some ointment, until he heals.
Si uero frangitur postremum ossis alhausos, et est finis caudae: tunc oportet, ut intromittas pollicem manus sinistrae in anum, et aeques os fractum manu altera, secundum quod possibile est, et secunda aequatione.	But if the bone is finally broken at the end of the tail: then one should insert the thumb of the left hand into the anus, and with the right hand, as well as possible, and by equal division.
Deinde pone super ipsum, et aufer ipsum: et cura uulnus cum curatione quae praecessit, donec sanetur.	Then put something on top of it, and take it away: and take care of the wound with the cure that has preceded, until it heals.
¶ De restauratione Anchae.	For the restoration of the anus.
Caput XI.	Chapter XI.
Raro franguntur ossa Ancharum.	Bones rarely break in the anus.
Quod si franguntur, tunc fractura eorum non est, nisi comminutio in extremitatibus ipsorum: et scinduntur in longitudine, et declinantur ad interiora: et accidit infirmo dolor in loco, et punctura: et stupescit crus quod frangitur.	If they break, then the fracture is not, unless it is a tear at the ends of them: and they split along their length, and turn towards the inside: and it happens that there is pain in the place, and a prickle: and the leg that breaks goes limp.
Et restauratio quidem eius est, ut extendas manum tuam super ipsum, donec stes super fracturam qualiter est figura eius.	And its restoration is such that you extend your hand over it, until you stand on top of the fracture, which is as in this figure.
Quod si fractura est in extremitatibus eius tantum, tunc aequa illam fracturam, secundum quod praeparatur tibi ex aequatione, donec assimiletur figurae suae naturali.	If the fracture is only at the ends of it, then make the fracture equal, according to how you are prepared by equalization, until it resembles its natural figure.
Si autem fractura est in longitudine, aut iam declinat ad interiora: tunc fac iacere infirmum super uentrem suum, donec praeparetur tibi restauratio illius fracturae.	But if the fracture is along its length, or has already turned towards the inside: then let the sick one lie on his belly, until its restoration is prepared for you.
Quando ergo aequaueris ipsam, pone super ipsam emplastrum: deinde pone super ipsam astellam ex ligno, aut ex cute: et stringe strictura super quam non timeas permutationem fracturae, neque remotionem astellae.	When you have made it equal, put a plug on top of it: then put over it a wooden or skin bar: and tightly tighten the bar so that you do not fear the move of the fracture, nor the removal of the bar.
Et aequa concauitatem illorum cum eo quod impleat eam, donec capiat eam strictura secundum aequalitatem: et praecipe infirmo, ut dormiat super dorsum suum, aut super latus suum sanum.	And make the equalization of them with it so that it fills it, until it takes it by strictness according to equality: and order the sick one, so that he sleeps on his back, or on his side, healthy.
Si autem accidat ei apostema calidum: tunc cessa ab extensione eius, et ipsius restauratione, donec sedetur apostema calidum: et pone super ipsum quod sedet ipsum, secundum quod praecessit, deinde redi ad restaurationem eius: et stringe ipsum sicut oportet.	But if he has a hot swelling: then cease from the extension and restoration until the hot swelling sits down; and place over it what sits him, according to what preceded, then return again to his restoration; and bind him as is necessary.
Si uero accidit in osse satagie, aut comminuitur, extrahe.	But if in the bone it is stuck, or it has been crushed, extract it.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Adiutorii.	¶ On the restoration of a fracture, the assistant.
Caput XII.	CHAPTER XII.
Adiutorium est illud, quod est inter cubitum usque ad caput Spatulae.	The assistant is that which is between the hollow and the head of the spoon.
Si ergo frangitur, tunc restauratio eius est secundum unum duorum modorum.	But if it is broken, then its restoration is according to two ways.
Quorum unus est: ut accipias lignum planum mediae grossitudinis, secundum hanc formam, quae sequitur.	Of which one is: that you take a flat piece of wood of middle thickness, according to this form, which follows.
Et ligentur in duabus extremitatibus duo ligamenta.	And are bound with two straps at the ends.
Deinde suspendatur ex loco eleuato: et sedeat infirmus super sedem.	Then let it hang from a raised place: and let the sick one sit on a seat.
Deinde proiiciat brachium suum fractum super lignum, donec perueniat ad titillicum eius, in cuius medio sit annexa curuitas ligni.	Then let him throw his broken arm over the wood so that it comes to rest at the tip of its curve, which is in the middle of the wood.
Deinde suspende desuper ipsum aliquid graue, ut extendat ipsum minister ad inferiora.	Then let him be suspended from above the sick one something heavy, so that he may stretch his hand down for the workman at the bottom.
Deinde aequet medicus fracturam manibus suis simul, donec redeat fractura, secundum quod oportet.	Then the doctor will even out the fracture with his hands together, until the fracture is set, according to what is necessary.
Et modus alter est, ut resupinetur infirmus super ceruicem suam: et suspende manum eius a collo ipsius cum ligamento.	And the other way is that he lie down on his back on his pillow, and let his hand be suspended from his neck with a strap.
Deinde praecipe duobus ministris, ut teneat unus eorum illud quod est supra fracturam cum manibus suis: et ut alter teneat inferius eius, et extendat unusquisque eorum ad partem suam.	Then command two workmen that they hold the one which is above the fracture with their hands: and that the other holds him below, and stretches his hand to each side.
Et si uis, ut sit extensio fortior, tunc stringe sub fractura cum ligamento, et supra ipsam cum ligamento alio: et extendat ea unusquisque duorum ministrorum ad duas partes suas.	And if you wish that the extension be stronger, then bind under the fracture with a strap, and above it with another strap: and let each of the two workmen stretch his hand to each side.
Si ergo fractura est propinqua extremitati humeri, tunc oportet, ut ponatur unum ligamentum sub titillico, et alterum sub fractura uersus cubitum.	But if the fracture is near the end of the arm, then it is necessary that one strap be placed under the tip, and the other above the fracture toward the hollow.
Et similiter si fractura est propinqua cubito: tunc oportet, ut ponatur ligamentum super illum locum, et super cubitum ipsum.	And likewise if the fracture is near the elbow: then it should be placed, so that the ligaments are put over that place, and over the elbow itself.
Deinde aequa fracturam cum facilitate absque labore, donec quando aequatur fractura secundum quod oportet, et applicatur applicatione bona: tunc stringe eam, si non accidit apostema calidum.	Then the broken bone should be made equal with ease without labor, until it is straightened out when it should be and applied with good application: then tighten it up, if a hot swelling does not occur.
Si uero accidit apostema calidum, tunc dimitte stricturam usque ad diem septimum.	If a hot swelling does occur, then release the tightening until the seventh day.
Et pone super ipsum lanam succidam imbibitam in aceto et oleo rosato, donec quando quiescit apostema: tunc stringe eam: et modus stringendi eam est, ut ponas emplastrum super fracturam.	And place on top of it a woolen cloth dipped in vinegar and oil with rose water, until the swelling stops: then tighten it up: and the mode of tightening it is so that you put an ointment over the fracture.
Deinde pone inuolutionem ex panno nouo super emplastrum.	Then put a new poultice on top of the ointment.
Deinde aggreget brachium super adiutorium ipsum, et ponat manum suam apertam super humerum suum.	Then grind the arm over the shoulder, and let his hand be open over his shoulder.
Et pone pannum, et stringe super adiutorium brachium, ut brachium stet loco astellarum: si non prohibet te ab illo aliquid, neque alteretur super te aliquid ex osse fracto.	And put the poultice on, and tighten over the shoulder arm so that the arm stays in place with the help of the braces: if it does not prohibit you from doing anything else, nor should any other thing be placed on top of you from a broken bone.
Quod si times, quod alteretur super te ex osse fracto aliquid, tunc utere astellis: et est, ut ponas super fracturam ipsam astellam quae sit latior et fortior reliquis astellis.	That if you use braces, that anything be placed on top of you from a broken bone, then use the braces: and it is like, so that you put on top of the fracture an brace that is wider and stronger than the others.
Et ponas inter omnem astellam latitudinem digiti: et sit longitudo astellarum secundum fracturam cum additione trium digitorum ab omni parte.	And place a space between each brace of about a finger's width; and the length of the braces should be according to the fracture with the addition of three fingers on all sides.
Deinde stringe super astellas strictura quam dixi in principio capituli.	Then tighten over the braces with the tightening that I have mentioned at the beginning of this chapter.
Et est, ut sit strictura tua super locum fracturae strictior.	And it should be, so that your own tightening is tighter on the fracture location.
Et quanto plus elongatur fractura, sit strictura minor.	And the more the fracture is elongated, the looser should be the tightening.
Si ergo uides situm astellarum et stricturam, sicut diximus, in hora qua restauras membrum statim, tunc fac: et si times apostema calidum, tunc dimitte stricturam et astellas usque ad diem septimum, sicut diximus.	If therefore you see a slacking of the braces and tightening, like I have said, in the hour when you restore the limb to life right away, then do it: and if you are concerned about a hot swelling, then release the tightening and the braces until the seventh day, as we have said.
Deinde considera ligamentum in omnibus tribus diebus, ut non accidat in loco pruritus, aut inflatio, aut prohibeatur cibus peruenire ad membrum, propter dispositionem superfluitatis stricturae.	Then consider the ligament for all three days so that there is no itching or swelling at the place, or to prevent food from reaching the member due to excess fluid.
Rectifica ergo illud totum, secundum quod diximus.	Correct this whole thing, according to what we have said.
Si uero es super fiduciam, ut non accidat ex illo aliquid: tunc non soluas ligamentum, nisi post tres dies, aut plus.	But if you are really concerned that nothing will come out of it: then do not open the ligature, unless after three days or more.
Et sit dormitio infirmi super dorsum suum, et manus eius super stomachum suum: et pone sub adiutorio culcitram plenam lana aequaliter.	And let the nurse sleep on her back, and his hands on his stomach; and place under the pillow a blanket full of wool, equal in thickness.
Et considera in omni hora noctis, aut diei, ut non soluatur figura membri fracta, aut mollificetur ligamentum.	And consider at every hour of the night or day that the broken member does not loosen, or that the ligaments become softer.
Rectifica ergo illud totum uirtute tua.	Correct this whole thing with your skill.
Et pone cibum infirmi secundum ordinem quem praemisimus, ita ut sit cibus subtilis in primis, donec incipiat os stringi: tunc oportet, ut ingrosses cibum eius.	And provide the nurse with food according to the order we have given, so that there is a small food for the first time until her mouth begins to close; then it should be increased, so that it grows thicker.
De consuetudine enim adiutorii et cruris est, ut stringatur in quadraginta diebus: tunc ergo oportet, ut soluatur, et administretur balneum, et medicetur cum unguentis quae rectificant illud.	For the habit of the assistant and the limb is to be tightened for forty days; then it should be opened, and bath taken, and treated with ointment that makes it right.
Quod si fractura fuerit foeda, attrita: tunc non soluas ab ea ligamentum et astellas usque ad quinquaginta dies, et usque ad duos menses.	If the fracture is sore, rub it; then do not open the ligaments or the splint until fifty days, and until two months.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Brachii.	For the restoration of a fractured arm.
Caput XIII.	Chapter XIII.
Brachium est compositum ex duobus ossibus, quae nominantur duo focilia.	The arm is made up of two bones, which are called the two splints.
Quorum unum est paruum: et est illud quod sequitur pollicem.	One of them is small; and that is what follows the thumb.
Et alterum est magnum, et est illud quod est positum sub paruo ab inferiori parte.	And the other is big, and that which is placed below a little from the lower part.
Fortasse ergo frangitur focile maius solum, aut paruum: et fortasse franguntur simul.	Perhaps therefore the bigger splint breaks alone, or the smaller one; and perhaps both break at the same time.
Quando ergo frangitur focile paruum superius, tunc restauratio eius est facilis, et sanatio eius est facilior.	When therefore the splint breaks above, then the restoration of it is easy, and its cure is easier.
Et quando frangitur focile inferius, est fractura eius mala, et sanatio eius difficilis.	And when the splint breaks below, it is a bad break, and its cure is difficult.
Et deterior ea est, quando franguntur duo ossa simul.	And it is worse when two bones break together.
Si ergo os quod frangitur est focile parum superius, tunc conuenit medico apud restaurationem eius, ut ponat extensionem paruam cum facilitate, donec aequet ipsum.	But if the bone that breaks is not very strong above, then it is appropriate for the doctor to approach its restoration, so that he puts an extension with ease until it is even.
Si uero focile magnum est illud quod fractum est: tunc oportet, ut ponat stricturam fortiorem ualde.	But if the bone that breaks is large and strong: then it should be, so that he puts a stronger extension quickly.
Et oportet, ut ponat figuram manus apud restaurationem eius, et ipsius extensionem extensam super puluinar.	And it should be, so that he puts the shape of the hand at its restoration and a long extension over the little finger.
Et sit pollex manus ad superiora altior omnibus digitis: et sit articularis inferior omnibus digitis, uel reliquis: et infirmus sedens quadratus super seipsum, et sit puluinar coram eo, uel in directo eius, in altitudine, ut non incurrat infirmus laborem.	And the thumb of the hand should be set higher than all the other fingers; and the articular joint of each finger, or whatever is left of it, and a quadratus should sit on his own self when sitting down, and the little finger in front of him, or directly before him, at an elevation, so that the infirm one does not suffer any labor.
Deinde extendat minister Brachium ab inferiori parte, aut manu sua, aut cum ligamento.	Then he should put the extension under the arm from the lower part, or with his own hand, or with a ligament.
Et minister alius extendat desuper similiter.	And another minister should put the extension above in the same way.
Deinde aequet medicus os, donec reducat ipsum secundum meliorem figuram quam potest.	Then the doctor should make the bone even, until he reduces it according to the best shape he can achieve.
Quod si in fractura ossis sunt satagiae, tunc conare reducere omne frustum in loco suo uirtute tua.	But if there are pieces of bone in the fracture, then you should strive to restore all the fragments to their places with your power.
Si uero apparet in eo sathaiatum separatum, et pungit cutem, et non est tibi spes in restauratione eius: tunc finde super ipsum, et aufer ipsum secundum modum quem diximus in eis quae praemissa sunt.	But if it seems to you that there is a separated piece of bone, and it pricks the skin, and you have no hope of restoring it: then find under it, and remove it according to the way that we said above in those that are preceded.
Si autem fractura est cum uulnere, ego iam feci ad illud capitulum singulare, ergo accipe curationem illius inde.	But if the fracture is with the radius, I have already done for this single capitulum, so accept its cure from it.
Quod si accidat in principio tuae restaurationis apostema calidum, tunc line pannum cum caeroto facto ex oleo rosato, et caera alba, et sit medium inter spissitudinem et subtilitatem: et stringe pannum super ipsum strictura subtili, donec quando sedatur apostema: tunc remoue caerotum, et pone emplastrum praeparatum ex puluere molendini cum albumine oui.	But if it happens that the first restoration is hot, then take a thin cloth made of linen with oil and white wax, and place the medium between its thickness and subtility: and tightly wrap the cloth around the bone, until when sitting down, the heat disappears: then remove the wax, and put on an prepared patch of powdery lint with albumen mixed.
Deinde pone astellas, et sit astella quae ponitur super fracturam ipsam latior parumper, et fortior.	Then put on stars, and let there be a star which is placed above the fracture itself slightly wider and stronger.
Et scias, quod numerus astellarum Brachii est sex in pluribus dispositionibus: siue sit fractura in focili uno, aut in duobus focilibus simul.	And you shall know that the number of stars of the arm is six in various dispositions: whether it be a fracture in one fascicle, or in two fascicles simultaneously.
Deinde pone stricturam tuam super locum fracturae fortiorem et uehementiorem, et aliquanto plus cum strictura ad superiora fracturae, aut ad inferiora eius: aut pone stricturam molliorem strictura eius parumper, secundum quod praecessit rememoratio eius in principio capituli.	Then put on your bandage over the place of the fracture stronger and more durable, and slightly more with the bandage to the upper fracture, or to the lower one: or put on a softer bandage according to what has preceded in the memory of it at the beginning of this chapter.
Et sint panni qui inuoluuntur super fracturam, panni lenes, humidi: et non sint duri, asperi.	And there be rags that are wrapped around the fracture, soft, moist: and not be hard, rough.
Et sit filum quo stringitur ex lino proprie, medium inter subtile et grossum, sicut narrauimus.	And let there be a thread with which he is tied from linen itself, middle between thin and thick, as we have reported.
Et considera membrum et ligamentum post dies.	And consider the limb and the ligaments after some days.
Quod si accidat aliquid cuius rectificatio sit necessaria, sicut pruritus qui accidit membro: tunc oportet, ut embroces membrum cum aqua calefacta, donec quiescat ille pruritus, et dimittas membrum non constrictum, donec quiescat, deinde itera stricturam.	That if anything happens for which correction is necessary, such as itching that occurs in the limb: then one should, as the itch abates, dip the limb in hot water, until it subsides, and then remove the bandage not constricted, until it subsides, and then repeat the bandage.
Quod si strictura iam mollificata est, et os iam remotum, et similia illis: tunc rectifica illud totum uirtute tua, et considera iterum.	That if the bandage has already softened, and the bone is slightly removed, and similar things: then repair it with your own skill, and consider again.
Nam si nutrimentum prohibetur peruenire ad membrum, propter superfluitatem stricturae, tunc oportet, ut mollifices ipsum parumper, et dimittas ipsum aliquot diebus, donec currat ad ipsum nutrimentum, deinde stringe ipsum.	For if nourishment is prevented from reaching the limb, due to the excess of the bandage: then one should, as it softens a little more, remove it a little each day, until it runs with blood, and then bind it up.
Si autem non accidit infirmo aliquid eorum quae diximus, tunc non oportet, ut soluatur, nisi post uiginti dies, aut circiter hos.	If, however, nothing happens of what we have said, then one should not repair it until after twenty days, or about those.
Deinde suspendatur manus infirmi ad collum eius.	Then hang the hand to be nursed on its collarbone.
Et sit collum eius aequale, et custodiatur uirtute sua a motibus agitatiuis.	And let the collarbone be equal, and guarded with your own skill from restless movements.
Et fac eum dormire super dorsum suum.	And let him sleep on his back.
Et scias, quod haec fractura in triginta diebus, aut in triginta duobus diebus restauratur: et fortasse restauratur in uigintiocto diebus.	And know that this fracture is restored in thirty days, or in thirty-two days; and perhaps it is restored in fifty days.
Totum illud est secundum dispositiones complexionum, et dispositiones uirtutis.	This whole thing is according to the dispositions of the complexion, and the dispositions of virtue.
¶ De restauratione fracturarum Manus.	On the restoration of fractures of the hand.
Caput XIIII.	Chapter XII.
Scias, quod pectini Manus, et nodis digitorum raro accidit fractura.	Know that it is rare for a fracture to occur in the palm of the hand or in the knuckles of the fingers.
Et non accidit ei, nisi attritio multotiens.	And it does not happen to him, except through repeated injuries.
Quando ergo accidit plantae fractura, aut attritio: tunc oportet, ut sedeat infirmus quadratus: et coram eo sit sedes secundum aequalitatem.	When therefore a fracture occurs in the sole of the foot, or through repeated injuries: then he should sit on an equal seat: and before him there should be a second seat on which to rest his feet.
Deinde pone Manum eius super eam extensam.	Then put his hand on it extended.
Deinde extendat minister ossa fracta, et aequet ea medicus, donec quando coniunguntur coniunctione bona.	Then the assistant shall extend the bones that are broken, and shall equalize them with the help of the physician, until they are joined together by a good joint.
Tunc oportet, ut ponat emplastrum et stuppam, si non accidat apostema calidum.	Then it should be put on unguent and poultice, if there does not occur an apoplexy of heat.
Deinde pone astellam desuper secundum quantitatem loci: et tu iam inuoluisti eam in panno lini.	Then place the plaster above him according to the quantity of the wound's depth: and you have already wrapped it in linen cloth.
Si autem fractura est ad inferiora circiter uentrem plantae, tunc fac simile spherae ex panno: et praecipe infirmo, ut coartet super eam cum planta sua fracta: deinde stringatur cum panno longo.	But if the fracture is around the lower part of the foot near the sole: then make a spherical shape out of linen cloth: and order the sick person to put it on with his own foot that is broken: and then tie it up with long linen cloth.
Et sit astella ex corio, in quo sit lenitas, ut applicetur corium cum corpore plantae: et stringe eam, secundum quod oportet.	And he should sit on a wooden stool on which there is a smooth layer, so that it is applied to the body of the foot with the skin: and tie it up, according to what needs to be done.
Si autem fractura est ad exteriora, tunc oportet: ut ponas astellam desuper, et astellam aliam ab inferiori in planta: et sit manus aperta recta.	But if the fracture is on the outside: then it should be put on a wooden stool above him, and another below it in the sole: and he should sit with his hand open and straight.
Deinde pone stricturam, sicut reuoluitur manus: et extende inter digitos cum ligamento.	Then put a bandage on, as it is stretched out from the hand: and extend it between the fingers with a band.
Quod si accidat fractura alicui nodorum digitorum, tunc si est pollex, aequetur secundum quod oportet.	If a fracture occurs in one of the knuckles of the fingers, then if it is the thumb, equalize it according to what needs to be done.
Deinde stringatur cum planta: et si amas, pone ei astellam rectam, paruam: ut eleuetur fractura, et non moueatur.	Then tie it with a strap: and if you love, put there a straight splint, of pine: that the fracture may be held fast, and not move.
Si autem fractura est reliquis digitis, sicut medio, et indici, aut auriculari, et anulari, tunc aequetur, et ligetur cum digito sano qui sequitur eum: aut ligentur omnes secundum continuationem: et est melius.	If the fracture is in the little finger, or middle finger, or index finger, or ring finger, then it should be reduced and tied to the finger next to it: or all should be tied according to the order of their length, and that is better.
Aut pone super ipsum astellam paruam, sicut diximus in pollice.	Or put a splint over it, as we said before, for the thumb.
Et considera in restauratione tua, et post ipsam dispositionem apostematis calidi: et oppone cum eo quod oportet, quando accidit aliquid ex illo, secundum quod iteratur eius narratio.	And consider, when you are healing, and after it the application of hot plasters: and oppose to it what is necessary, when something happens from that, according to which its story returns.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Coxae.	On the restoration of a fractured hip.
Caput XV.	Chapter XV.
OS Coxae multotiens frangitur, et declaratur sensui: quoniam conuertitur ad interiorem et posteriorem partem.	The hip bone often breaks and is felt: because it turns towards the inner and back parts.
Et restauratio eius fit ita, quod stringitur ligamentum supra fracturam, et ligamentum aliud sub fractura.	And its restoration is so that a strap is tied above the fracture, and another strap is tied below the fracture.
Et infirmus prostretur super faciem suam.	And the sick one extends his hand on his face.
Deinde extendat omne ligamentum minister ad partem suam secundum aequalitatem: et hoc, quando est fractura in medio ossis.	Then let him stretch out all his ligaments to the side according to equality: and this, when there is a fracture in the middle of the bone.
Si autem est fractura propinqua radici Coxae, tunc sit ligamentum ad partem pectinis, ut cadat extensio ad sursum: et ligamentum aliud sub fractura.	If the fracture is near the root of the hip, then let there be a strap on one side, so that it drops down towards the top: and another strap below the fracture.
Et sic similiter si est fractura propinqua genu, tunc sit ligamentum propinquum genu, ut sit extensio ad inferiora.	And in the same way, if there is a fracture near the knee, then let there be a strap near the knee, so that it drops down towards the bottom.
Deinde aequet medicus os utriusque manibus suis, donec reducat ipsum secundum similitudinem figurae naturalis: et coniugatur os coniunctione bona.	Then the doctor will make both hands equal in length, until he reduces it according to the natural figure: and the bones are joined together with a good joint.
Tunc oportet, ut ponas emplastrum et stricturam, si non accidit membro apostema.	Then let there be applied plaster and binding, if something does not happen from that member.
Quod si accidat in eo apostema: tunc dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot, donec sedetur apostema calidum, deinde redi ad curationem tuam.	If something has happened to it: then let him stay at home for a few days, until the heat of the apथम begins to subside: and then return to your healing.
Strictura autem eius ita sit.	The incision should be made thus.
Oportet ut inuoluas super fracturam imema duram, id est, bindam: et dupla eam bis, aut ter: et remaneat ex ea superfluitas.	You should cut through the skin over the fracture, that is to say, lather it up: and make it twice or three times: and leave a surplus on it.
Deinde inuolue crus, donec perueniat calcaneus apud radicem natis.	Then incise the flesh, until you reach the bone at its root.
Et intromitte filum longum inter Coxam et crus prope genu ad inferiora, et ueniant extremitates fili a superiori parte duarum partium.	And insert a long thread between the thigh and the leg close to the knee from below, and bring the ends of the thread from the upper part of the two parts.
Deinde reuolue super Crus et Coxam quod superfluit ex alimema.	Then cut off the excess flesh on the skin and bone.
Deinde pone super Coxam in loco fracturae ipsius astellas, et pone ex eis astellam unam super os cruris.	Then place above the thigh, in the place of the fracture, stars from it, and place one star above the bone of the leg.
Deinde imple uacuitates inter crus et coxam cum pannis lenibus, ut aequetur strictura.	Then fill with poultices between the flesh and the thigh with soft cloths, to make the incision even.
Deinde incipe cum strictura forti a medio super locum fracturae tribus inuolutionibus, aut quatuor.	Then begin with a strong hand from the middle of the place of the fracture, three incisions, or four.
Et quanto plus elongaris cum ligamento a loco fracturae, sit strictura tua minor et mollior, et lenior.	And as you make it longer with a rope from the place of the fracture, your incision will be smaller and softer, and gentler.
Deinde intende ad duas extremitates fili, quod tu intromisisti inter coxam et crus.	Then extend to both ends of the thread, which you have inserted between the thigh and the leg.
Liga ergo cum utrisque tres astellas quae sunt desuper.	Bind together with a knot each of the three stars that are above.
Deinde uade cum duabus extremitatibus fili ad inferiora, donec peruenias ad cauillam pedis.	Then extend to the two ends of the thread to below, until you reach the heel of the foot.
Et cum utrisque stringe etiam extremitates astellarum a parte altera: ut non remoueatur ligamentum ex loco suo.	And also tighten and bind the ends of the stars from the other side: so that the ligament does not move away from its place.
Deinde dimitte stricturam super illud, dum permanet, ita quod non accidat membro corrosio, neque apostema, neque inflatio, et similia eis.	Then remove the incision while it is still there, so that the member does not corrode, nor swell, nor become puffy, and similar things to it.
Quod si accidat aliquid ex illo.	If anything of this should happen.
Propera ergo cum solutione eius, et rectifica illud quod accidit inde totum, secundum quod diximus multotiens.	Then bring it near to the solution of it, and make straight that which has happened from there entirely, as we have said many times.
Si uero in osse est frustum ex osse quod pungat: tunc oportet, ut aeques illud, si est tibi possibile.	If however a piece of bone has come out of the bone and stings: then it should be made even, if it is possible for you to do so.
Et si non, finde super illud, et remoue illud: et cura cum eo cuius praecessit rememoratio, donec sanetur.	If not, find above it, and move it: and cure with it that memory which preceded it, until it is healed.
Et quandoque stringitur haec fractura Coxae, praeter quod addantur ei astellae, sicut diximus in adiutorio et brachio.	And sometimes this fracture of the hip joint is stretched, besides that strels are added to it, as we have said in the aidiorium and brachiis.
Verumtamen in restauratione eius taliter fracta, non accidit infirmo claudicatio.	However, in restoring this fracture in such a way that does not happen an abnormal walking with lameness.
Et si restauratur sola, praeter quod applicetur ei crus alterum, tunc necesse est, ut claudicet ille cuius est, semper.	And if it is restored alone, besides that another leg is applied to it, then it is necessary, so that this one who has it always walks with a limp.
Et scias, quod Coxa stringitur in quinquaginta diebus, uel additur parum, aut minuitur parum: totum illud est secundum diuersitatem complexionum, et reliquarum dispositionum.	And you should know that the hip joint is stretched in fifty days, or added a little, or tightened a little: all this is according to the difference of complexions and the remaining dispositions.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Rotulae genu.	Regarding the restoration of the fracture of the knee rotula of the genii.
Caput XVI.	Chapter XVI.
Scias, quod Rotulae genu raro accidit fractura, sed accidit ei attritio multotiens.	You should know that the fracture of the knee rotula of the genii rarely happens, but it often happens to him because of friction.
Si uero accidit ei fractura, tunc non nisi aut fissura, aut foramen in partibus suis.	If this fracture has really happened to him, then there is either a crack or a hole in his parts.
Et est illud cum uulnere, et absque uulnere.	And it is that way with a bone that has been broken, and without a bone.
Et statur super illud totum cum sensu.	And stands above it all with thought.
Et restauratio eius est ita, ut aequetur quod disruptum est ex partibus eius cum digitis, donec aggregetur, et coniungatur secundum quod possibile est ex aequatione et facilitate, et fabricatione.	And the restoration of it is so that what has been broken from its parts with fingers, comes together, and joins according to what is possible out of équation and ease, and by making.
Deinde pone emplastrum ex farina sisami, uel molendini, cum albumine oui: et pone super ipsum astellam rotundam, si indiges illa: et stringe desuper strictura conueniente ad illud.	Then put on an emplastre of flour Sisami, or to be ground, with white of egg: and put on top of it a round Astella, if you can bear that: and tighten very tightly the fitting onto it.
Deinde considera omnes dispositiones quas narrauimus in reliquis fracturis: sicut apostema calidum, et similia illi: ita, ut opponas omni accidenti cum eo quod conuenit ei, donec sanetur.	Then consider all the dispositions which we have told you about in the other fractures: such as the aposteme that is warm, and its like: so that you oppose every accident with it, until it is healed.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Cruris.	Regarding the restoration of the fracture of the leg.
Caput XVII.	Chapter XVII.
Scias, quod Cruri sunt duo ossa, quorum unum est grossum, et nominatur nomine Cruris: et alterum subtile, et nominatur Focile.	Know that there are two bones of the leg, one thick and called the tibia, the other thin and called the fibula.
Et accidit utrisque ex speciebus fracturae quod accidit duobus ossibus brachii: et propter illud fit restauratio eius, sicut restauratio brachii aequaliter, et operatio est una.	And it happens to both species of fracture that occurs in the two bones of the arm: and because of this, the restoration is made equal as the restoration of the arm, and the operation is one.
Quod si franguntur duo ossa simul, conuertitur Crus ad omnes partes.	That if both bones break at the same time, the leg becomes turned into all parts.
Et si frangitur os subtilius, conuertitur Crus ad anteriorem partem.	And if the thin bone breaks, the leg turns towards the front part.
Et si frangitur os grossius, inuenis illud inferius: et est ex eis quae non occultantur tibi.	And if the thick bone breaks, it injures the lower part: and it is from these that do not hide your leg.
Deinde administra extensionem, et aequationem, et ligationem astellarum secundum illud aequaliter.	Then administer the extension, and the equitation, and the binding of the joints according to that which is equal.
Verumtamen oportet, si fractura Cruris est fractura foeda, habens sethagie multa: ut sit extensio minor, et lenior alleuiatione tua.	However, it must be, if the fracture of the leg is a bad fracture, having many complications: so that there is a smaller extension, and less relief to your pain.
Et in Crure quidem est ex operatione quiddam super brachium: et est, ut quando tu aequas astellas, et comples omnem operationem tuam, tunc accipe duas fascias ex ligno pini, quod administratur in fabricatione solariorum quod ponitur sub tabulis: et fiunt ex spatulis palmae: et elige ex eis quibus est grossitudo parua, et neque sint ex minutis: et sit longitudo earum secundum longitudinem Cruris a genu usque inferius.	And in the leg itself there is some operation on the arm: and it is, as when you make the joints equal and complete all your operation, then take two strips of pine wood, which are used in the making of hinges that are placed under tables: and they are made from palm leaves: and choose from them those that have a small thickness, and there are none of the small ones: and let their length be according to the length of the leg from the knee to below.
Deinde inuolue super unamquamque pannum duabus inuolutionibus secundum longitudinem eius.	Then wrap it around one piece of cloth on two occasions, according to its length.
Et pone unam partem Cruris a parte una, et alteram a parte altera: et sint ex genu usque inferius pedis.	And place one side of the leg from one side and the other from the other side: and let them be from the knee to below the foot.
Deinde liga duas fascias in tribus locis ex duabus extremitatibus et medio.	Then bind the two strips in three places from both ends and from the middle.
Cum enim strictura prohibetur, Crus declinat ad dextram et sinistram, et stat statione bona.	Since when constriction is prevented, the leg turns to the right and to the left, and remains on good support.
Et iam quidem administretur cunabulum ex ligno secundum longitudinem Cruris, et ponatur in eo Crus, ut conseruet ipsum a motu.	And there are also given a stick made of wood according to the length of the leg, and placed in it, so that it may keep it from moving.
Et plurimum quidem oportet, ut facias illud in fractura quando cum ea est uulnus proprie.	It is indeed necessary that you do this for a fracture when it is a true avulsion.
Deinde considera Crus in omni die, et stude cum eo studio ultimo ab apostemate, aut inflatione, aut reliquis aliis.	Then consider the bone every day, and study with it the last attention from apoplexy, or swelling, or other.
Si ergo accidit aliquid ex illis, tunc oppone ei cum eo quod oportet, usquequo sanetur, si Deus uoluerit.	But if anything happens to any of these, then oppose it with him as is necessary until he recovers, if God wills.
De fractura ossium Pedis, et Digitorum.	Of the fracture of the bones of the foot and fingers.
Caput XVIII.	Chapter 18: Of the head.
Calcaneo quidem non accidit fractura penitus.	A heel fracture has not occurred within.
Ossibus uero Pedis accidit quandoque fractura, et Digitis parum etiam accidit fractura: et non accidit eis nisi attritio in pluribus dispositionibus.	But among the bones of the foot a fracture has happened when and a little too among the fingers a fracture has happened; and it has not happened to them except by a sprain in many situations.
Quod si accidit ossibus Pedis fractura, et uides illa ossa sublimari super se adinuicem, tunc ponat infirmus Pedem suum super terram praeparatam, sicut ambulans.	That if a fracture has happened among the bones of the foot, and you see those bones sliding one over another; then let the sick man put his足下土，如行路者。
Deinde sta tu, et pone Pedem tuum super illud quod eleuatur ex illis ossibus: postea preme, uel calca eam: et aequa ipsam, donec redeat in locis suis.	Then stand you, and put your足下土，如行路者。Then press, or trample on it: and make it even, until it returns to its place.
Deinde pone emplastrum, et stuppam desuper: et pone sub uentre Pedis tabulam paruam, cui sint duo capita plana.	Then put plaster above it: and set it down; and place under the足下土，如行路者。then put a thin board, which have two flat heads.
Deinde stringe eam cum Pede strictura decenti, postquam tu inuoluis eam cum pannis, et reliquis quibus indiget.	Then tighten it with the foot by stretching it, after you have wrapped it up with rags, and other things that it needs.
Cum ergo praetereunt ei tres dies, aut quatuor, tunc solue ligamentum.	When then pass over them three days, or four; then loosen the ligaments.
Nam tu inuenies ossa aequata, siue sint fracta, aut sint dislocata.	For you will find bones that are even; or if any are broken, or dislocated.
Operatio ergo in eis est, sicut uides.	Then the operation is in them, as you see it.
Si autem franguntur aliqui digiti, tunc restaura eos, et aequa ipsos secundum quod narraui tibi in restauratione digitorum manus.	But if any of the fingers are broken, then restore them, and make even among themselves according to that you told me about restoring fingers of a hand.
Deinde pone digito tuo astellam secundum longitudinem digiti, et sit latior eo parumper: deinde pone sub Pede hanc tabulam quam narraui tibi, et stringe eam strictura decenti.	Then put your finger on a splint according to the length of the finger, and make it somewhat wider; then place under the足下土，如行路者。then tighten it with the foot by stretching it.
Si uero quod frangitur ex ossibus est duo, aut tria, aut plus, tunc pone super omnem digitum astellam suae quantitatis, inuolutam in panno lini: et stringe tabulam in inferiori Pedis: et sit stans super unum capitum tabulae extra uentrem Pedis, ut teneat retentione bona.	If it is two or three or more bones that are broken, then place a splint of his size over all the fingers, folded into a cloth; and bind the table firmly in the lower foot: and stand on one head of the board outside the navel of the foot to hold it with good retention.
Et conuenit tibi, ut non obliuiscaris, quin consideres omnia quae dixi tibi in reliquis fracturis ex accidentibus quae diximus: et oppone omni accidenti cum eo quod oportet.	And it is fitting for you that you not forget, but that you consider all that I have said to you regarding the other fractures from the accidents which we mentioned: and resist every accident with him as is necessary.
¶ De fractura Vuluae mulieris, et ossis pectinis, et uirgae uiri.	Regarding the fracture of a woman's leg, and of the ribs and the man's testicles.
Caput XIX.	Chapter XIX.
Quando frangitur Vulua mulieris, tunc fac eam sedere quadratam.	When a woman's leg is broken, then let her sit square.
Deinde inclina eam ad partem dorsi ipsius parumper, et teneatur retro.	Then lean her slightly toward the back of her own side, and support her from behind.
Deinde impleat obstetrix Vuluam eius coto, donec impleat eam: et fiat in Vulua ex eo sicut sphera.	Then the midwife should fill the woman' s crotch, until she is filled: and let her stand in the woman from that like a sphere.
Deinde concutiatur mulier, et eleua dorsum eius paulatim.	Then the woman should be shaken, and raised slowly on her back.
Illud enim cotum egreditur, donec fiat ante portam Vuluae sicut sphera, et os fractum redit.	For that crotch moves away from the woman' s face like a sphere, and the broken bone returns to its place.
Deinde pone puluillum super dorsum eius.	Then place a pillow on her back.
Quando ergo uult mingere, remoueat cotum cum facilitate, deinde mingat: et reduc ipsum secundum modum, quo intromisisti ipsum in primis: deinde redeat ad puluillum suum primum.	When she therefore wishes to urinate, move the crotch with ease, and then let her urinate: and reduce it according to the manner in which you inserted it at first: and then let her return to her pillow first.
Faciat illud septem diebus, aut circiter, os ipsum enim restauratur.	Let that be done for seven days, or about that, because the bone itself is restored.
Et si uis, accipe uesicam ouis, et stringe super foramen eius cannulam arundinis, et intromitte uesicam totam in Vuluam eius.	And if you wish, take a black worm, and bind it tightly over its orifice with an awl, and insert the whole worm into the woman' s crotch.
Deinde suffla in cannulam cum uirtute, donec infletur uesica intra Vuluam, fractura enim redit.	Then blow into the cannula with force, until the worm bends inside the woman' s navel, for the fracture returns.
Deinde impleatur cum coto, et stet aliquot diebus, secundum quod narrauimus, donec sanetur.	Then let it be filled with the crotch, and stand for a few days, according to which we have spoken, until it is healed.
Et quando frangitur os Pectinis uiri, aut mulieris, tunc administra in restauratione eius, et ipsius aequatione illud quod narrauimus in osse Anchae.	And when the jawbone of a man or woman is broken, then administer to it restoration and its vyrovaning as we have said concerning the bone of Ancha.
Et non occultatur rectum in his fracturis propinquis, quae parum contingunt, praecipue cui est quiddam studii, uel usus.	And the rectum is not hidden in those who are close to breaking, which happens very little, especially in someone who has some study or use.
Et intellige librum meum istum multum, quoniam fractura ipsa significat tibi in pluribus dispositionibus uiam rectam in restauratione sui, et strictura sui: intellige ergo.	And understand my book very well, because the fracture itself indicates to you many ways of restoring its rectitude and strictness: therefore understand.
In Virga autem uiri quando frangitur, accipe guttur anseris: et intromitte uirgam in ipso.	But when the jawbone of a man is broken, take the throat of a goose: and insert the jaw into it.
Deinde pone super ipsum inuolutionem ex panno, et inuoluatur, et dimittatur tribus diebus, aut circiter eos, et sanabitur, si Deus uoluerit.	Then put on top of it a bandage from a cloth, and wrap it up, and leave it for three days or so, and if God wills, he will heal.
¶ De restauratione fracturae ossium, quando est cum uulnere.	Of the restoration of broken bones, when it is with an injury.
Caput XX.	Chapter 20.
Conuenit ei cui accidit fractura cum uulnere, praecipue si est magnum, sicut os coxae, aut adiutorii, aut simile illi, ut properes, et phlebotomes ipsum statim: si attestantur tibi conditiones phlebotomiae, sicut praemisimus.	It belongs to him who has suffered a fracture with an injury, especially if it is large, such as the hipbone or auxiliaries, or similar to it, according to your judgment, and immediately stop up: if you attest phlebothy conditions, as we have said.
Quod si uulnus effluit sanguinem, tunc oportet, ut properes ad abscisionem eius, ita ut puluerizes super ipsum zegi tritum: si non est tibi praesens aliud.	If the wound is spitting blood, then you should, according to your judgment, cut off as much of it as possible so that it crushes on top of the bone: if you do not have anything else present.
Deinde incipe restaurare fracturam in illo eodem die: et non postponas illud, si non accidit apostema.	Then begin to restore the fracture in the same day: and do not delay it, unless there is a swelling.
Si uero accidit apostema calidum, tunc dimitte restaurationem eius usque ad diem nonum, donec sedetur apostema.	But if a swelling should become hot, then leave off the restoration of it until the ninth day, until the swelling subsides.
Et non appropinques ei in die tertio, et quarto omnino, nam tu faceres ei accidere accidentia mala.	And do not approach him on the third and fourth days at all, for you would make it happen that bad accidents occur to him.
Si autem os fractum est eminens super cutem detectum: tunc oportet, ut coneris reducere ipsum, et aequare ipsum manibus tuis cum facilitate et extensione parua.	But if the broken bone is prominent above the skin detected: then you should, so that you reduce it and make it even with your hands with ease and a small extension.
Si autem non praeparatur extensio eius, et ipsius aequatio manibus tuis: tunc reduc ipsum cum isto instrumento.	If, however, it is not prepared for extension and its alignment with your hands: then reduce it with this instrument.
Et est instrumentum quod fit ex ferro, cuius longitudo est quantitas septem digitorum, aut octo: et eius latitudo est secundum quantitatem uulneris.	And this is an instrument which is made of iron, the length of which is the quantity of seven fingers, or eight; and its breadth is according to the quantity of the wound.
Et propter illud necesse est medico, ut accipiat ex eis tria, aut quatuor secundum quantitatem qua indiget ad illud ex curatione in omni specie fracturae.	And because of this, it is necessary for the surgeon to take three or four according to the quantity he needs for healing any kind of fracture.
Et sit rotundum: et sit in eo grossitudo parua, ut non duplicetur apud compressionem super ipsum in hora operationis: et sit acutae extremitatis, cui sit margo in extremitatibus suis.	And it should be round: and it should have little thickness so that it does not break under pressure on top of it during the operation: and it should have an acute extremity, having a rim at its extremities.
Et sit superius eius ad grossitudinem ex medietate eius usque ad inferiora.	And let it be above it to thickness from its half up to its lower part.
Et haec est forma eius.	This is its form.
Oportet in Hac Operatione, ut ponatur extremitas eius acuta curuata super extremitatem ossis eminentis: et impelle ipsum cum eo uice una, donec quando redit os et aequatur quadam aequatione.	It is necessary for this operation, that the extremity of it be curved on top of the prominent extremity of the bone: and push it with a single blow, until such time as the bone returns and is made level by some alignment.
Conare ergo aequare extremitates fracturae adinuicem.	Therefore take care to align the ends of the fracture in opposite directions.
Quod si extremitates eius fracta est subtilis, et non accipit eam instrumentum accaeptione bona, tunc opotet, ut incidas extremitatem illius ossis, donec instrumentum potestatem habeat eius.	That if the ends of it are fragile and do not accept it well with the instrument, then you should, in order to strike the extremity of its bone, until the instrument can have power over it.
Si uero non potes reducere eos cum eo quod narrauimus omnino, tunc incide ipsum cum eo quod conuenit ei ex Incisoriis quae diximus: aut serra ipsum cum una serrarum quocunque modo possibile est tibi.	If, however, you cannot reduce them with this instrument at all, then strike it with one of the knives which we have mentioned: or clamp it down with a single clamp in whatever way is possible for you.
Deinde rade illud quod remanet in osse ex asperitate et corticibus minutis.	Then sharpen that which remains in the bone from roughness and small bark.
Cum ergo reducitur os, et inuenit infirmus post reductionem eius dolorem uehementem laedentem, tunc scias, quod os non rediit ad locum suum naturalem.	When, however, the bone is reduced and finds after its reduction a very painful sore-like pain, then know that the bone has not returned to its own place.
Fac ergo illud.	Do this then.
Nam tu confers infirmo iuuamentum magnum, cum completur restauratio tua quam facis ossi.	For you confer a great strength of infirmity when your restoration is completed which does not restore the bone.
Tunc submerge pannum in uino stiptico, nigro.	Then dip the cloth in black stypic wine.
Et proprie si est in aestate.	It is proper if it is in summer.
Et non ponas super uulnus caerotum, neque aliquid in quo sit oleum: ut non faciat accidere in ipso putredinem et corruptionem.	And do not place the wound on a bony protrusion, nor apply any oil to it; lest it cause decay and corruption in itself.
Deinde administra astellas in hora complementi tui a restauratione ossis.	Then administer the medicine at the hour of the body's restoration from bone injury.
Et dimitte uulnus detectum: ita, ut incidas cum forficibus foramen in inuolutionibus secundum quantitatem uulneris.	And release the wound that has been caught: so that you will strike with a hook in the second solution according to the quantity of the wound.
Et caue omni cautela, ne stringas uulnus cum fractura.	And take every precaution, do not tighten the wound with a fracture.
Multotiens enim fecerunt istud stolidi medici: et fecerunt accidere super infirmos suos aut mortem, aut corrosionem, aut zuchem, id est, saniem.	For many times this has been done by the obstinate physicians: and they have caused to happen on their patients or death or corruption or putrefaction, or rotting, that is, disease.
Et sit strictura tua mollis, lenis, diuersa stricturae fracturarum reliquarum.	And your closure be soft, gentle, varied in the closures of broken fractures remaining.
Quod si uulnus est malum, aut est uulnus magnum, et times super ipsum quaedam accidentia mala quae narrauimus, et inuenis dolorem in loco suspensum: tunc non oportet, ut ponas super ipsum astellas.	That if the wound is bad, or is a large wound, and you wait for some bad accident that we have described, and suspend pain in the place: then it is not fitting that you should place stars on the wound.
Et fac eis inuolutiones ex pannis duris in loco astellarum, et stringe ipsum cum eis.	And make them solutions out of tough cloths at the site of the stars, and tighten the wound with them.
Cum autem est post diem unum, aut dies duos, et uides uulnus iam incipere, ut in eo generetur pus: tunc aufer desuper ipsum pannum quem posuisti super ipsum cum uino.	When however it is after a day, or two days, and you see the wound beginning to generate pus, then take away from above it the cloth that you placed on the wound with vinegar.
Deinde administra licinia, et unguenta cum quibus de consuetudine nostra est, ut medicemur uulnera: sicut unguentum tetrapharmacon, et similia illi.	Then administer leech and oil with which it is according to our custom to heal the wounds: such as the oil of the four-part compound, and similar to it.
Et conuenit tibi, ut soluas ligamentum.	And it is fitting for you, so that you release the ligaments.
Et considera uulnus in omni die mane et uespere, donec consolidetur, et sanetur.	And consider the wound every day, morning and evening, until it has healed, and is cured.
Et oportet, ut praeparetur membrum taliter, ut currat ex eo pus ad inferiora cum facilitate.	And it is fitting that the limb be prepared so that pus can flow out of it with ease to the lower parts.
Quod si praetereunt uulneri dies multi, et non consolidatur, neque abscinditur pus ab eo: tunc scias, quod illic sunt satagie ossis parua.	That if the days of the wounds are many and they have not healed, and there is no pus flowing out from them: then you know that there are small bone knots in them.
Quare oportet, ut inquiras uulnus cum tenta.	Quare oportet, ut inquiras uulnus cum tenta.
Quot uero ex illis alsatagie sunt separata, remoue ea, et extrahe ipsa.	Quare oportet, ut inquiras uulnus cum tenta.
Et quae ex eis sunt non separata, et pungunt membrum, et faciunt accidere dolorem, conare incidere ea, et auferre ea omni modo quo possibile est tibi illud.	Et si aliquid ex illis alsatagie est, qui non separatum est, et pugnatuum memebrum, et facit accidere dolorem, curi sit accidens, et ab illo aufertur, quanti possit, uti tibi possit.
Quod si accidat uulneri zuchen, aut ekileten, id est, estiomenus, aut species alia corruptionis et putrefactionis: tunc oportet, ut opponas unicuique ex eis cum eo quod conuenit ei ex curatione, cuius praecessit narratio in capitulo suo.	Et si aliquid ex illis alsatagie est, qui non separatum est a membris, et pugnatuum memebrum, et facit accidere dolorem, curi sit accidens, et ab illo aufertur, quanti possit, uti tibi possit.
Et ex eo in quo oportet ut stet sermo meus, et cui facias praesentem mentem tuam quando frangitur os, et eminet super membrum, sicut os coxae, et adiutorii, et similia eis ex membris magnis, est, ut non praesumas attractionem eius, multotiens enim accidit ex illo mors, imo dimitte ipsum, donec putrefiat.	Et si aliquid ex illis alsatagie est, qui non separatum est a membris, et pugnatuum memebrum, et facit accidere dolorem, curi sit accidens, et ab illo aufertur, quanti possit, uti tibi possit.
Fortasse enim cadet per se post uiginti dies, aut triginta.	Et si aliquid ex illis alsatagie est, qui non separatum est a membris, et pugnatuum memebrum, et facit accidere dolorem
Tunc ergo cura uulnus, si uidetur tibi: et sinon, dimitte ipsum.	Et si aliquid ex illis alsatagie est, qui non separatum est a membris, et pugnatuum memebrum, et facit accidere dolorem: tunc ergo cura uulnus,
¶ De curatione Nodationis in uestigio fracturae.	Si tu enim es uuleris qui sedes te habes cum iusto, et deorum cultus, et bonarum artium, et si in tua
Caput XXI.	Si tu enim es uuleris qui siedzis te
Multoties accidit haec Nodatio in uestigio sanationis fracturae.	Et si aliquid ex illis alsatagie est, qui non separatum est a membris, et pugnatuum memebrum, et facit accidere dolorem: tunc ergo cura
Praecipue, quae est prope iuncturas: et foedatur ex ea figura membri.	Deinde curi sit accidens, et si aliquid est, cuius forma facit accidere dolorem, aut cuius forma pugnatuum memebrum est, curi sit, et aufertur ab illa forma
Et fortasse prohibet membrum ab operatione sua naturali.	Et si aliquid ex illis alsatagie est, qui non separatum est a membris, et pugnatuum memebrum,
Considera ergo tunc, si nodatio est recens: administra in ea medicinas quae stipticitatem habent, sicut aloe, et olibanum, et myrrha, et sarcocolla, et acacia, et similia eis.	Et si aliquid ex illis alsatagie est, qui non separatum est a membris, et pugnatuum memebrum, et facit accidere dolorem: tunc ergo curi sit accidens, et si aliquid est, cuius forma facit accidere dolorem, aut cuius forma pugnatuum memebrum est, curi sit, et aufertur ab illa forma.
Ita, ut accipias ex istis quasdam, aut omnes eas: et confice eas cum uino stiptico, aut cum albumine oui, aut cum aceto: et pone eas super nodationem in stuppa, et stringe eas super ipsam strictura bona.	So that you take these some, or all of them: and bind them with wine of the astringent, or with albumen [egg white], or with vinegar: and place them upon nodulation in the pot, and tighten them above the good constriction.
Et dimitte stricturam, nec soluas eam diebus multis.	And discharge the constriction, and do not remove it for many days.
Deinde solue eam, et itera aliam, donec remoueatur nodatio.	Then discharge it, and again bind another, until the nodulation moves away.
Aut stringe super ipsam laminam plumbi decenter.	Or tighten above the same lead strip slightly askew.
Plumbo enim est proprietas remouendi omne quod timetur ex membris.	For lead is a property that removes whatever frightens from the body.
Si autem nodatio iam in lapidem conuersa est, et stricta est, et festine prouocat necessitas ad auferendum eam: tunc finde super eam ex superiori parte eius, et incide superfluitatem eminentem: aut rade eam cum quibusdam rasoriis, donec remoueatur: et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	But if the nodulation is already turned toward the rock and is tight, and necessity expeditiously calls for its removal: then find above it from its upper part, and strike off the protuberance: or else cut it with some scalpel, until it moves away: and be careful of it, until it heals.
¶ De curatione quando restauratur, et remanet membrum post illud subtile, non secundum naturam suam.	As for the cure, when it is restored, and remains a member after that, not according to its nature.
Caput XXII.	Chapter XXIII.
Quando restauratur fractura ossis, et remanet membrum post illud subtile, debile: tunc non fit illud nisi propter caussas multas.	When a bone fracture is restored, and remains a member after that, feeble: then it is not made for no reason.
Quarum una est, multitudo solutionis ligamenti et ligationis eius non secundum quod oportet: aut propter superfluitatem stricturae ligamentorum, donec prohibeatur nutrimentum currere ad membrum: aut propter multitudinem embrocationis superfluae in non sua hora: aut propter paucitatem sanguinis in corpore infirmi, et debilitatem eius.	Of which one is that a multitude of the solution of the ligament and its binding are not according to what should be: or because of the excess of the constriction, until it is forbidden for food to run to the member: or because of the multitude of emblications in the wrong time: or because of the scarcity of blood in the body, and the weakness of it.
Et curatio illius est, cibare infirmum, et tenerum facere corpus eius, donec multiplicetur sanguis in eo.	And its cure is, to feed the sick, and make the body strong, until the blood increases within it.
Et administra balneum.	And administer a bath.
Et intromitte gaudium et laeticiam super eum.	And introduce joy and happiness to him.
Deinde pone picem super membrum: ut attrahat pix ad ipsum nutrimentum multum.	Then place a pinch on the member: so that it attracts the pinch toward itself for much food.
Et assiduet embrocationem eius cum aqua tepida, donec currat nutrimentum, et redeat ad figuram suam naturalem.	And diligently apply its emblication with tepid water, until it runs as food, and returns to its natural form.
¶ De curatione ossium fractorum quando restaurantur tortuose.	On the cure for broken bones when they are healing in a twisted manner.
Caput XXIII.	De curatione ossium fractorum quando restaurantur tort
Quando accidit membro iam restaurato post sanationem eius tortuositas, et eminentia ossi fracto, aut nodatio: et foedatur per illud forma membri, uerumtamen membrum non prohibetur ab operatione sua naturali: tunc non oportet ut recipias sermonem eius, qui existimat, ut frangatur membrum denuo.	When a limb which has been restored after healing exhibits tortuosity or an突出 of the bone, or a droop; and when it is suitable to make this limb conform to its natural form, but not to prevent operation upon it: then you should not accept his story that he should break the limb again.
Et iam fuerunt multi stolidorum medicorum et restauratorum, qui fecerunt illud in terra nostra.	And there have been many stupid doctors and healers who have done this in our country.
Et haec quidem operatio est uituperabilis ualde, perducens ad mortem, uel timorem magnum, ut scilicet sit mortalis.	This operation is extremely dangerous, leading to death, or at least to a great fear of death.
Verum si claudicatio et nodatio sunt recentes: tunc oportet, ut embrocetur cum aqua tepida, in qua decoctae sint herbae mollificantes, sicut folia alteae, et radix eius, et mellilotum, et illis similia.	But if the swelling and droopiness are recent: then it should be dipped in warm water, in which herbs have been boiled that soften it, such as the leaves of the oak, its root, and mallow, and similar things.
Et fiat ei emplastrum cum emplastro mollificatiuo, sicut dyachilon decenter factum.	And let there be made for him a plaster with a softening plaster, like that made from dyachil, carefully prepared.
Aut sumatur mucilago radicis alteae, et concutiatur cum adipe gallinae, aut oleo sisamino: et emplastretur cum eo.	Or let there be used the mucus of the root of the oak, and let it be mixed with the fat of a hen, or with oil of sesamum; and let it be applied with this.
Aut sumantur ficus pingues, et terantur cum fimo columbino, et similibus eis quae nominantur ex medicinis diminuentes consolidationem.	Or let there be taken fig trees which are large, and let them be ground up with columba's clay, and similar things which are named by the doctors as those that soften consolidation.
Et quandoque soluitur nodatio cum fricatione assidua, antiqua, et leni, quae fit cum manibus humidis.	And when the droopiness has been alleviated by frequent dry friction, which is ancient and soft, which is done with moist hands.
Et administretur motus membri ad omnem partem in horis omnibus.	And let the limb be moved in all directions.
Si autem tortuositas iam antecessit, et fortis facta est, et conuersa est in lapidem, et prouocata est necessitas ad curatonem eius cum ferro: tunc oportet, ut secetur superius eius, et soluatur continuatio ossis, et incidatur quod superfluit ex nodatione aut osse cum Incisoriis subtilibus: et administretur facilitas in illo cum sollicitudine et studio.	But if the tortuosity has already preceded and is strong, and has become fixed in a stone, and there is a need to treat it with an iron: then let the upper part of it be cut off, and let the bone continue intact, and let what exceeds be removed with very fine incisions: and let ease be given to it with care and effort.
¶ De sermone in Dislocatione.	On dislocation.
Caput XXIIII.	Chapter on dislocations.
Dislocatio est exitus alicuius iuncturarum a loco suo.	Dislocation is the exit of a joint from its normal position.
Quare prohibetur a motu suo, et foedatur figura membri.	Why it is prevented by its own motion, and the figure of the limb is damaged.
Et facit accidere super infirmum dolores, et laesiones uehementes.	And causes pain on an injured person, and severe injuries.
Quando ergo accidit alicui dislocatio, tunc oportet festinare ad restaurationem eius: neque tardet eam omnino.	So when a dislocation occurs, then one should hurry to restore it: he should not delay it at all.
Nam si tardatur, apostematur locus, et fortasse cum eo reductio dislocationis.	For if it is delayed, the joint will be stiffened, and perhaps with that the reduction of the dislocation.
Propter illud ergo non oportet, ut moueatur, neque extendatur in hora apostemationis eius.	Therefore, it should not be moved, nor be stretched out at the time of its stiffening.
Quoniam multotiens facit accidere spasmum, et dolores laedentes.	For it often causes a spasm, and painful injuries.
Verum quando accidit illud, tunc oportet, ut properes ad phlebotomiam infirmi.	But when this happens, then you should go to have blood let from the injured person.
Deinde dimittatur, donec quiescat apostema.	Then it is dismissed, until it rests the stiffening.
Deinde embrocetur membrum cum aqua calida et oleo.	Then the limb is rubbed with warm water and oil.
Deinde reducatur cum facilitate.	Then reduce it with ease.
Et curetur omne membrum cum eo cuius rememoratio ueniet in loco suo.	And care for all limbs, so that each one stays in its own place.
Ego quidem iam ordinaui capitula dislocationis, etiam secundum quod praecessit in fractura, a superiori parte corporis usque ad inferiorem eius.	I have already arranged the chapters on dislocations, also according to what precedes, from the upper part of the body down to its lower part.
¶ De cura dislocationis Mandibulae inferioris.	Chapter on the care of the lower jaw.
Caput XXV.	Chapter 25.
Parum dislocantur duae Mandibulae nisi raro.	The two jaws rarely dislocate.
Et dislocatio ambarum fit secundum unum duoru modorum.	And the dislocation of the ears happens according to one of two ways.
Aut enim remouentur a locis suis remotione parua, et mollificantur parumper.	Or they are removed from their places by a small distance, and become slightly softer.
Aut dislocantur dislocatione integra, completa, donec mollificentur ad partem pectoris, donec currat saliua infirmi, et non possit tenere eam, neque possit claudere os suum, et inuoluatur lingua eius cum sermone.	Or they dislocate with an intact, complete dislocation, until they soften toward the chest, until they flow out a saliva of milk, and cannot hold it, nor can close their mouth, and hang their tongue out with speech.
Quando autem dislocatio eius est parua, tunc redit in pluribus dispositionibus per se cum paucitate.	But when the dislocation of it is small, then it returns to many positions by itself with a little bit of movement.
Si uero est dislocatio completa, integra: tunc oportet, ut administretur reductio eius uelociter, et non tardetur penitus: et est, ut teneat minister caput infirmi: et intromittat medicus pollicem manus suae unius in radicem Mandibulae dislocationis inter os eius, si dislocatio est a parte una.	If indeed there is complete dislocation, whole: then it should be given to him to reduce it quickly, and not be late: and it is that he hold the head of the nurse: and he enters his doctor's thumb of his hand on the root of the dislocation between his tooth, if the dislocation is from one part.
Aut intromittat duos pollices suos simul, si dislocatio est a duabus partibus.	Or he should enter two thumbs at the same time, if the dislocation is from two parts.
Et reliqui digiti manuum eius sint extra, quibus aequet.	And the other fingers of his hand are outside, which equates it.
Et praecipe infirmo, ut mundificet Mandibulas suas, et absoluat eas ad manducandum ad omnem partem.	And tell the sick one that he clean his teeth and allows them to eat everything.
Et medicus aequet Mandibulam, et impellat Mandibulam, donec redeat ad locum suum.	And the doctor cleans the jaw, and pushes it back, until he returns to its place.
Quod si difficilis sit reductio eius, praecipue si sunt ambae Mandibulae simul: tunc administra uaporationem cum aqua calida, et oleo, donec fiat facilis reductio ambarum: neque tardes reductionem ambarum omnino, sicut diximus.	That if it is difficult to reduce him, especially if both are dislocated at the same time: then he should administer vapor with warm water and oil until the reduction becomes easy: and do not delay the reduction of the two at all, as we have said.
Cum ergo redeunt et aequantur, et clauditur os infirmi, et non mollificantur: tunc pone super eas puluillos pannorum, cum ceroto quod sit factum ex cera: et oleo rosato.	When they are reduced and made whole, and the mouth of the nurse is closed, and do not relax: then put over them some soft blankets, with a cloth that has been made from wax: and oil of roses.
Deinde ligetur cum facilitate cum ligamentis mollibus.	Then it is bound easily with soft ligaments.
Et sit somnus infirmi super dorsum suum: et caput eius sit stans inter duo puluinaria, ut non moueat ipsum ad dextram et sinistram: neque conetur, uel cogatur masticare aliquid: imo ponatur cibus eius sorbitio lenis, donec quando remouentur dolores, et nodatur Mandibula: tunc comedat quod uult, et administretur illud cum facilitate.	And let the nurse sleep on his back: and let his head be between two blankets so that he does not move to the right or left: and he should not be forced to chew anything: but it is given to him to eat something soft, until he feels no pain, and the jaw moves: then he can eat whatever he wants, and administer it easily.
Non laboret super operationem oris sui apud comestionem et potum, et oscitationem, donec nodetur Mandibula, et sanetur.	He should not work on the operation of his mouth during digestion and drinking, and speaking, until he feels no pain, and his jaw heals.
Quod si difficilis fiat reductio duarum Mandibuiarum, quando dislocantur in hora aliqua, et non conuertuntur ad loca sua: tunc multotiens accidunt inde febres, et soda assidua: et fortasse soluitur uenter infirmi, et fortasse uomit choleram puram.	That if it is difficult to reduce the two jaws when they are dislocated at a time, and do not return to their places: then many times fever occurs from it, and frequent sizzling: and perhaps the stomach of the nurse is emptied, and perhaps pure cholera escapes.
Cum ergo uides illud: tunc scias, quia est perditio, et multotiens moritur ille cui accidit illud in decem diebus.	So then you see that: then you know that it is a loss, and he often dies who has experienced that in ten days.
¶ De reducione dislocationis Furculae, et extremitatis humeri.	§ On the Reduction of a Dislocation of the Foil and Extremity of the Humerus.
Caput XXVI.	Head XXVI.
Furcula quidem non dislocatur ex latere intrinseco, propter continuationem suam cum pectore.	The foil [i.e., the clavicle] does not dislocate from the internal side due to its continuation with the chest.
Et dislocatur quandoque ad exteriora: et declaratur illud sensui.	And it sometimes dislocates on the external side; and this is obvious to the sense.
Et restauratio eius est, ut iaceat infirmus super dorsum suum, et extendat brachia sua.	And its restoration is such that he lies injured on his back, and extends his arms.
Deinde coarta locum cum palma tua coartatione forti, nam ipsa redibit.	Then bind the place with your palm firmly, for it will return of itself. For it will come back.
Deinde pone super ipsam emplastrum, et puluillos, et stringe eam.	Then put a plaster over it, and wool, and tighten it.
Extremitates uero eius quae sequuntur cubitum, et continuantur cum eo, non dislocantur, nisi raro.	The extremities, however, which follow the bed and continue with it, do not dislocate, except rarely.
Quod si dislocatur die aliquo: tunc oportet, ut reducatur et aequetur secundum quod diximus, et quod praeparatur tibi.	If it dislocates on one day: then let it be reduced and made even as we have said, and let you be prepared.
Deinde pone super ipsam emplastrum, et puluillos, et stricturam.	Then put a plaster over it, and wool, and tighten it.
Et praecipe infirmo, adhaerere tranquillitati et quieti, donec sanetur.	And instruct the injured person to adhere to rest and quietude until he has healed.
Et cum hac eadem curatione reducitur extremitas Humeri, quando separatur etiam a loco suo.	And with this same cure the extremity of the Humerus is reduced, when it also separates from its place.
¶ De reductione dislocationis Humeri.	§ On the Reduction of a Dislocation of the Humerus.
Caput XXVII.	Head XXVII.
Scias, quod Humerus non dislocatur, nisi secundum tres modos.	You know that the Humerus does not dislocate unless by three ways.
Quorum unus est, ut dislocetur ad partem titillici ad inferiora.	Of which one is, so that it dislocates to the tickling side toward the lower part.
Secundus est, ut dislocetur ad partem pectoris.	The second is, so that it dislocates to the side of the chest.
Et fortasse dislocatur ad superiorem partem Humeri: et illud fit raro.	And perhaps it dislocates to the upper part of the Humerus; and this happens rarely.
Et non dislocatur ad posteriora, propter spatulam.	And it does not dislocate toward the rear due to the spatula.
Et non dislocatur ad anteriora, propter neruos.	And it does not dislocate toward the front due to the nerves.
Et plurimum quidem dislocatur et egreditur ad inferiora uersus titillicum: praecipue in illis, quorum carnes sunt paucae.	It dislocates and moves downward on the tickling side; above all, those who have little flesh.
Quoniam egrediur in eis uelociter, et ingreditur uelociter.	For he who hastens to go out, must also haste to come in again.
In illis autem quorum carnes sunt multae, est econtrario illius, scilicet quia egreditur cum difficultate, et ingreditur cum difficultate.	But as for those of whose flesh there is much, it is the contrary to him, that is to say, because he goes out with difficulty, and enters in with difficulty.
Et fortasse accidit quibusdam hominibus percussio, aut casus, et apostematur Humerus apostemate calido, et putatur propter illud, quia iam dislocatus est.	And perhaps it happens to some men that they are struck or fallen, and the shoulder is dislocated by heat, and it is thought on account of this, because it is already dislocated.
Oportet ergo, ut experiaris illud, donec stes super certitudinem eius, et tunc procedas in curatione eius.	Therefore, so that you may try this out, until you are sure about its effect, and then proceed to treat it.
Et cognoscitur dislocatio, quando est ad inferiora uersus titillicum: et distinguas inter Humerum dislocatum, et humerum sanum.	And the dislocation is recognized when it is towards the lower part against the tip; and you distinguish between a dislocated shoulder and a healthy one.
Nam tu inuenis inter eos diuersitatem manifestam, et inuenis in capite Humeri concauitatem, et sub titillico apud tactum caput humeri quasi ipsum sit ouum: et non potest infirmus reducere manum ad aurem suam, neque mouere eam omnibus motibus.	For you will find a manifest difference between them; and the injury in the head of the arm, and under the tip at the touch, seems to be itself; and the sick cannot bring his hand to his ear, nor move it in all its motions.
Et similiter, si dislocatur uersus pectus, aut ad sursum: tunc inuenis manifestum tactum, neque occultatur.	And also, if it is dislocated towards the breast or upwards; then there is a manifest touch, and it is not hidden.
Et huius quidem dislocationis fit facilis reductio, quando est recens, aut infirmus est puer.	And of this dislocation easy reduction is made when it is recent, or when the boy is weak.
Et reductio eius est, ut eleuet minister manum suam ad superiora.	And its reduction is, as he raises his own hand towards the upper part.
Deinde pone tu pollices tuos sub titillico eius, et eleua iuncturam cum fortitudine ad sursum ad locum suum: et minister eleuet manum suam, et extendat eam ad sursum.	Then put your fingers under its tip, and bring the joint with force upwards to its place; and the boy will raise his own hand, and extend it upwards.
Deinde ponat eam inferius, ipse enim redit uelociter.	Then let him put it down again, for himself he returns quickly.
Si autem non redit per illud quod diximus, et sunt a principio quo accidit dislocatio dies multi: tunc oportet, ut balneetur infirmus in aqua calida, et administretur embrocatio quae mollificat et lenit, sicut si decoquantur radices alteae, et foenugraecum, et mellilotum in aqua, et administretur.	But if he does not return by the means that we have said, and many days pass from the time of the dislocation: then it is necessary that the sick man should bathe in warm water, and receive an ointment which softens and soothes, such as if they were boiled herbs of aloes, and fenugreek, and melilot in water, and be applied.
Deinde resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum: et ponatur sub titillico eius sphera et lana, quae sit aequalis inter lenitatem et stricturam.	Then the sick person is laid on his back: and let a sphere and wool be placed under him, which is equal between softness and hardness.
Deinde ponat medicus calcaneum suum super spheram, et eleuet caput humeri cum uirtute, et attrahat manum infirmi ad inferiora.	Then the doctor places his heel on the sphere, and lifts up the shoulder with force, and draws the nurse's hand towards him from below.
Et minister alius teneat caput infirmi, ut non moueatur ad inferiora: ipse namque redit statim.	And another minister should hold the patient's head so that it does not move downward: for he himself will immediately return to life.
Et si uis, reduc eum secundum modum hunc: et est, ut facias esse praesentem uirum qui sit longior infirmo, et stet a parte lateris, et intromittat humerum suum sub titillico infirmi: et eleuet titillicum eius ad superiora, donec sit infirmus suspensus in aere.	And if you wish, reduce him according to this method: and he is, so that you may make the sick man present, and stand on one side, and introduce his shoulder under the nurse's grip: and lift up the nurse's grip upward until the sick man hangs suspended in the air.
Et minister alius trahat manum infirmi ad inferiora uentris eius.	And another minister should take the patient's hand from below the leg.
Si autem infirmus est leuis: tunc oportet, ut suspendatur cum eo aliquid aliud, ut grauet ipsum: nam redit dislocatio statim.	But if the sick man is light: then it should be suspended with something else, so that he does not return to his previous state: for dislocation returns immediately.
Et reducitur etiam secundum modum alium: et est, ut figatur in terra lignum longum, cuius caput sit rotundum figura: sicut manica mortarii: quod non sit grossum, neque subtile.	And he is also reduced according to another method: and it is, so that it is fixed in the ground a long wooden limb, whose head is a round shape: like a mortar's sleeve: which is neither thick nor thin.
Deinde ponatur sub infirmo postquam ponuntur super caput ligni panni lenes: et infirmus sit stans secundum longitudinem ligni.	Then let it be placed under the sick person, after you have placed it on the head of the limb; and let the sick man stand in line with the length of the limb.
Deinde extendatur manus eius ad inferiora a parte altera, et extendatur corpus eius ab altera parte cum fortitudine: nam iunctura redit ad locum suum cum uelocitate.	Then let him extend his hand from below on one side, and extend his body from the other side with force: for the joint returns to its place with velocity.
Quod si difficilis sit eius reductio per omnia quae diximus, tunc utere hac cura: et est, ut accipias lignum cuius longitudo sit quantitas duorum brachiorum, et eius latitudo quantitas quatuor digitorum, et grossitudo eius quantitas duorum digitorum: cui sit caput rotundum, ut alleuietur introitus eius in profundum titillici, secundum hanc formam.	That if it is difficult to reduce his limb by all the means which we have mentioned, then use this treatment: and it is, so that you take a limb whose length is equal to the length of two arms, and whose width is equal to the width of four fingers, and whose thickness is equal to the thickness of two fingers; and whose head is round, so as to ease his entrance into the deep hole, according to this form.
Deinde ligentur super caput rotundum panni lenes, ut non laedat lignum infirmum.	Then soft cloths are tied tightly around the head so that the weak wood does not hurt.
Deinde ponatur sub titillico infirmi, ut extendatur manus, aut brachium super lignum usque ad inferiora: et ligetur lignum super adiutorium et brachium et extremitatem manus.	Then care is taken to keep the hands and arms extended so that the wood does not touch the head from below; and the wood is tied on either side to the aid-arm, and to the extreme tips of the hand.
Deinde ponatur brachium super gradum scalae per latitudinem, et extendatur manus ad inferiora, et dimittatur reliquum corpus suspensum a parte altera.	Then the arms are placed on either side of the steps, and the hands are extended towards the bottom, and the rest of the body is suspended from the other side.
Iunctura enim ingreditur statim.	The sutures should be tied immediately.
Cum ergo completur introitus eius secundum quemcunque modum possibile est: tunc oportet, ut ponas sub titillico spheram aequalis quantitatis ex lana.	Once the entrance is complete in any way that is possible, then you should place a sphere of equal size made from wool under the scalp.
Deinde pone emplastrum praeparatum ex puluere molendini cum olibano, et albumine oui super humerum totum, sicut reuoluitur desuper.	Then put on a prepared plaster made from ground clay mixed with olive oil and white powder, as it is rolled up from above.
Deinde stringe sub titillico strictura decenti: et reuoluatur ligamentum super emplastrum desuper: et annectatur manus eius ad collum ipsius, et dimittatur, neque moueatur manus eius septem diebus.	Then tie it tightly under the scalp with a string that is being pulled down: and secure the ligature on top of the plaster; and connect his hands to his neck, and let go, and do not move his hands for seven days.
Et oportet, ut ponatur cibus infirmipaucus, donec confortetur membrum: quoniam est uelocius ad sanationem eius.	And it is necessary to provide food that is weak on the sick member, because he will recover faster.
Deinde ponatur amplior post septem dies, aut quinque, et ex ercitetur cum motu.	Then after seven or five days, let him take a larger meal, and let him exercise with movement.
Si ergo firmatur et non mollificatur, tunc iam sanatus est.	If then it remains firm and does not soften, then he is now healed.
Si uero iunctura dislocatur multotiens, propter humiditatem quae accidit ei, aut propter caussam aliam: tunc oportet, ut administretur in ea cauterium cum tribus foraminibus, secundum quod praemissum est in capitulo de cauterio.	If then the wound opens repeatedly because of moisture that has occurred with it, or because of some other cause: then you should administer cauterization to it with three holes, as it is described in the chapter on cauterization.
Quod si fiat hoc totum, et soluatur ligamentum post septem dies, et non confirmetur iunctura, et reducatur emplastrum et strictura super ipsum aliquotiens, et non firmetur, et cadat, et non possit eleuare ipsum ad superiora: tunc scias, quod nerui eius qui sunt ad caput humeri, iam incisi sunt, aut extensi, aut mollificati: et scias, quod iunctura nunquam figetur in loco suo.	If all of this has been done, and the wound heals without opening, and the ligature does not stand firm, and the plaster and tightness on top are relaxed a little, and he cannot raise his arm up: then you should know that the nerves going to his shoulder are cut or extended or softened: and you should know that the wound never heals in its place.
Dislocationis autem quae fit uersus pectus et mammillam, aut ad posteriora reductio, fit cum impulsione et extensione cum manibus: donec redeat, et administretur in ea reliqua strictura et cura, donec sanetur.	The dislocations which occur opposite the chest and nipple, or those which occur towards the rear and are reduced with the help of the hands by pushing and extending them until they have returned, and are given remaining constriction and treatment until they have healed.
Quod si accidat post sanationem grauitas in membro, et tarditas in motu eius, tunc utatur infirmus balneo multotiens, donec leniatur illa grauitas, et redeat ad naturam eius primam.	If however a slight weakness occurs in the limb after recovery, and there is delay in its movement, then the convalescent should often bathe in hot water until that weakness has become easier, and return to his normal state at first.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Cubiti.	The treatment of dislocation of the elbow.
Caput XXVIII.	CHAPTER XXVII.
Scias, quod iunctura Cubiti dislocatur cum difficultate, et similiter redit cum difficultate etiam: et ipsa quidem dislocatur ad omnes partes, et praecipue ad anteriorem, aut ad posteriorem.	Know that the dislocation of the cubitus occurs with difficulty, and in the same way returns with difficulty as well; and it itself is dislocated to all parts, especially to the front or rear.
Et eius dislocatio non occultatur tibi: quoniam est cadens sub uisu, et sub tactu, secundum quamcunque figuram dislocetur.	And its dislocation does not hide from you; for it is falling under the eye, and under the touch, according to whatever figure it is dislocated.
Et quando coniungis cubitum dislocatum cum sano, declaratur tibi illud manifeste.	And when you join a dislocated cubitus with a sound one, that [dislocation] is manifestly declared to you.
Concauatur enim iunctura, et non potest duplicare brachium, neque tangere cum eo humerum suum.	For the dislocation becomes tight, and it cannot double the arm, nor touch with it its shoulder.
Et oportet, ut properes, et reducas dislocationem statim, antequam accidat ei apostema calidum.	And you must do so that you repair, and reduce the dislocation immediately, before the cold apoplexy happens to it.
Nam si accidit ei apostema calidum, difficilis fit eius reductio: et fortasse non sanatur omnino, praecipue quando est ad posteriora.	For if it has happened to him that the cold apoplexy has occurred, its reduction is difficult; and it may well not be healed completely, especially when it is to the rear.
Est enim deterior omnibus speciebus dislocationis, et uehementioris doloris eis: et multotiens descendit cum ea mors.	For it is worse to all species of dislocation, and more painful pain to them; and often it falls with her death.
Et restauratio eius quando est ex eis quae possibile est reducere, est, ut extendatur manus eius cum duabus manibus: et brachium eius sit expansum, et manus medici sint supra cubitum et sub eo, et ipse impellat iuncturam cum pollicibus manuum suarum simul, aut cum radice palmae suae, donec redeat ad locum suum.	And the restoration of her is when it has come out of them what can be reduced, as he extends his hand with both hands: and his arm is spread out, and his fingers are placed above the cubitus and under it, and he pushes the dislocation with his thumbs of his hands simultaneously, or with the root of his palm, until he returns to his place.
Aut uero dislocatio est ad anteriora: tunc redit ita, ut duplicet manum cum manu sua, donec percutiat cum radice palmae suae cubitum qui est dislocatus.	Or rather the dislocation is to the front; then it returns so that it doubles the hand with its hand, until it hits the root of its palm against the cubitus that is dislocated.
Quod si non obedit dislocatio ad reductionem, tunc administra extensionem uehementem, fortem ualde: et est, ut extendant brachium duo ministri: et teneant ipsum duo ministri etiam, ut non remoueatur apud extensionem.	Which if it does not obey the reduction, then administer a painful extension, a strong one: and it is like two ministers who extend his arm: and they hold him too, so that he does not move during the extension.
Deinde reuoluatur brachium ad omnem partem postquam inuoluitur super manum eius pannus duplicatus longus, aut ligamentum latum.	Then the arm turns back to all parts after it has spun over its hand a long folded cloth, or a wide ligament.
Et quando tangit medicus manu sua iuncturam, inungat ipsam cum oleo: ut sit illud ex eis quae adiuuant in lubricitate iuncturae cum facilitate.	And when the doctor touches with his hand the suture, he should anoint it with oil: so that it may be out of the air that adds to the lubrication of the suture with ease.
Deinde impellat iuncturam impulsione uehementi, donec redeat.	Then he should remove the stitch with a sudden thrust, until it comes off.
Et post reductionem eius oportet, ut ponatur super ipsam emplastrum, in quo sit stipticitas, et exiccatio cum albugine oui: et stringatur strictura decenti.	And after the reduction, it should be placed on it an ointment, in which sits the cicatrization, and drying with alumen: and tighten the constriction while it is coming down.
Et suspendatur brachium a collo infirmi: et dimitte diebus aliquot.	And hang up the arm from the neck of the nurse: and let go after a few days.
Deinde soluatur.	Then let it be unbound.
Si ergo firmatur iunctura in loco suo, tunc solue ligamentum ab ea, et dimitte ipsam.	If then the stitch stays fast in its place, then undo the ligature from it, and let go of it.
Et si uides iuncturam non bene stringi, tunc itera emplastrum, et ligamentum, et dimitte ipsam diebus aliquot, donec stringatur.	And if you see that the stitch is not tightly bound, then repeat the ointment, and the ligature, and let go of it for a few days until it is tightly bound.
Deinde solue ipsam.	Then unbind it.
Si autem accidit ei grauitas post reductionem iuncturae, et dispositio sit in motu: tunc administra humectationem in balneatione, et fricationem subtilem, et compressionem, donec liniatur, aut pone super iuncturam iliati, id est, natem arietis pinguem.	If then it happens that he has gained weight after the reduction of the stitch, and the place is in motion: then administer humidity in balneation, and slight friction, and compression, until it gets better, or put on the stitch an ilium, that is, a drop of sheep's fat.
Deinde ligetur, et dimitte ipsam super eam die et nocte.	Then bind it up, and let go of it on top of her day and night.
Deinde aufer eam, et intromitte ipsum in balneum.	Then take it off, and introduce the patient into a bath.
Cum ergo sudat, tunc frica iuncturam fricatione temperata.	When then she sweats, then unbind the stitch with slight friction.
Deinde itera super ipsam aleliati uice una, et secunda, et tertia cum introitu balnei, donec leniatur.	Then repeat on top of her three times, with one between each entry into the bath, until it softens.
Et si uis, pone super ipsam stercus uaccinum, humidum, calefactum cum butyro, et stringe super ipsum.	And if the patient is cold, put on top of her dung, humid, warmed with butter, and tightly bind over it.
Fac illud aliquotiens.	Make it a few times.
Ipsa namque lenitur, et redit ad dispositionem suam.	She herself is getting better, and returns to her own place.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Almahassem.	The cure for the dislocation of Almahass.
Caput XXIX.	Head XXI.
Mahassem manus multotiens dislocatur, id est, iunctura quae est inter brachium et manum.	Mahassem's hand often dislocates, that is, the stitch between the arm and the hand.
Et reductio dislocationis eius est facilis.	The reduction of dislocation is easy.
Econtrario reliquarum iuncturarum.	Oppositely, the joints remain intact.
Verumtamen oportet, ut uelocitas sit in reductione dislocationis eius in hora in qua dislocatur, antequam apostemetur locus: aut accidat in eo apostema calidum.	However, it is necessary that the speed be in the reduction of his dislocation at the time when he is dislocated, before the measurement of the place: or happens in that apostema heat.
Et reductio dislocationis in eo est, ut ponas Mahassem manus infirmae super tabulam, et extendat minister manum eius: et ponat medicus palmam suam super eminentiam iuncturae, et impellat eam, donec redeat.	And the reduction of dislocation is in him, as you put Mahassem's hand weak on a board, and extends his hand Minister hand: and put the doctor his palm on the eminence of the joint, and push it, until it returns.
Verumtamen oportet, ut consyderetur, si palma iam recessit ad uentrem manus: tunc ponat infirmus dorsum manus suae super tabulam apud extensionem et reductionem: et si dislocatio est procedens ad dorsum manus, tunc sit positio manus eius intrinsece super tabulam, id est, interior pars manus eius super tabulam ponatur, ut cadat manus medici super ipsam eminentiam iuncturae.	However, it is necessary to consider, if the palm has already moved to the stomach of the hand: then put the injured back of his hand on a board in extension and reduction: and if dislocation is going to the back of the hand, then the position of the hand is inside the board, that is, the inner part of the hand of him is placed on the board, so that the doctor's palm falls on that eminence of the joint.
Si ergo redit statim, bonum est: et si non, tunc stringe eam cum emplastro sedante apostema: et dimitte ipsum, neque iteres illud.	If he comes back immediately, it is good: and if not, then tie him with a plaster while the apostema stands: and let go of him, do not return to it.
Nam si non tolerat, neque potes super reductionem eius, postquam praetereunt ei dies, uerumtamen iunctura remanet secundum tortuositatem suam: et non nocet infirmo aliquid, nisi quod mollificatur manus, et non potest stringere aliquid: tunc scias, quod nerui sunt abscissi, aut attriti.	For if he does not tolerate it, and you cannot reduce him after his time, then the joint remains according to its tortuosity: and does not harm the weak person unless the hand is softened, and he cannot grasp anything: then know that the nerves are cut off, or rubbed.
Non est ergo ingenium in ea, nisi ut stringatur cum cauterio prope casum eius.	Therefore there is no skill in it, except to tie him with a plaster near his danger.
Et fortasse non confert illud aliquid.	And perhaps does not offer anything.
Cum ergo non redit Almahassem, tunc pone super ipsum emplastrum, quod narrauimus.	Since Albucasis does not return to Mahessem, then put on him the plaster which we have described.
Deinde stringatur, et dimittatur quinque diebus: postea soluatur et dimittatur, et exercitetur manus.	Then tie him up, and let go after five days: then open it and let go, and exercise his hand.
Si autem priuatur motus eius, et accidat in ea aliquid grauitatis: tunc leni eam cum aqua calefacta, et fricatione aliquotiens, donec leniatur.	But if the movement is restricted, and happens in it something of lightness: then make it soft with warm water, and with a little friction, until it softens.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Digitorum.	On the treatment of finger dislocations.
Caput XXX.	Chapter 30.
Quando dislocatur ex eis Digitus ad omnem partem, uel ex eis Digitus ad dorsum palmae, aut uentrem eius: tunc extende Digitum, et impelle dislocationem pollicibus tuis, donec redeat.	If a finger becomes dislocated at any part, or if one of the fingers comes to rest on the back of the palm, or in the hollow of the hand; then extend that finger and push the thumb into its socket until it is back in place.
Deinde sustenta caput Digiti, et suspende ipsum uersus partem ad quam dislocatur, et dimitte ipsum duobus diebus.	Then support the end of the finger, and hang it towards the side where it is dislocated, and leave it alone for two days.
Deinde suspende eum, et extende ipsum, donec aequetur rectus in illo die suo.	Then hang it up, and extend it, until it is straight again on its own day.
Cum ergo fuerit nox, liga ipsum secundum narrationem ipsam: et non cesses soluere ipsum in die: et exerce eum cum motu: et liga ipsum in nocte.	When the time comes that he must be used, bind him according to the above description; and do not cease to put him into use during the day; and exercise him with movement; and bind him at night.
Fac illud diebus aliquot, donec stringatur.	Make it for a few days, until it is tight.
Et similiter fac cum eo, si dislocatur ad uentrem manus: et liga eum ad partem ipsam, et fac cum eo operationem tuam primam, donec sanetur.	And also do the same if it becomes dislocated towards the side of the hand; and bind it to the side, and perform your first operation on it, until it is healed.
Et similiter fac cum eo quando dislocatur ad reliquas partes.	And also do the same with him when he becomes dislocated towards any other part.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Spondilium dorsi.	On the treatment of dislocations of the spine of the back.
Caput XXXI.	Chapter 31.
Quando accidit alicui Spondilium dorsi, aut colli dislocatio completa, aut remouentur Spondiles multae a locis suis: tunc non est in ea curatio, quoniam mors properat infirmo.	If it happens to anyone that there is a complete dislocation of the spine, or if many vertebrae are lost from their places: then there is no treatment for this, because death is close at hand for the sick.
Et signum illius est, quod egestio infirmi egreditur absque uoluntate, neque potest tenere eam: et multotiens mollificantur ex eo quaedam membra eius, aut duo crura eius, aut duo brachia ipsius, aut unum eorum: aut remouetur Spondilis una de loco suo.	And the sign of this is that he walks with a limp and does not do it willingly; nor can he hold himself up: or sometimes one of his limbs becomes weak, or two of them on either side, or two of his arms, or one of them; or if one of the vertebrae is lost from its place.
Multotiens enim remouetur, quod multotiens fit remotio earum ad quatuor partes.	Indeed it often happens that it becomes dislocated again, for it often comes loose on all four sides.
Illa ergo quae remouetur ad posteriora, nominatur Gibbositas.	That which is dislocated towards the back is called gibbosity.
Curatio uero eius est, ut consyderes tunc, si Gibbositas accidit a puericia: tunc non est in ea curatio, neque ex ea est sanatio omnino.	But the treatment of this is that you should consider at that time, if gibbosity happens to occur from infancy: then there is no cure for it, and there is no healing from it at all.
In illa autem quae accidit a casu, aut percussione, aut similibus illis, iam dixerunt antiqui modos curationis sermone prolixo.	But regarding what happens due to an accident, or a blow, or something similar, the old scholars have already explained in a lengthy speech the ways of treating such things.
Cuius plurimum non redit cum proficuo.	Who does not return with profit.
Ego uero iam abbreuiaui ex illo, cuius parum excusat a multo eius ex propinquitate mea ad intentionem: et expositione mea qua exposui illud, et formaui instrumentum eius diuerso modo ab eo quo ostenderunt illud, et exposuerunt ipsum.	But I have already shortened it from that, which does not excuse him from much of his profusion out of nearness to my intention: and my exposition of it as I expounded it, and I formed an instrument of it in various ways from him by whom they showed it, and they presented it.
Dico ergo, quod in gibbositate quae accidit ab anteriori parte, non est ingenium, neque sanatio ex ea.	I say then, that the hunchback which happened from the front part is not a talent, nor a cure out of it.
Et similiter in illa quae fit ad duo latera etiam.	And also in that which happened on both sides.
Et non curatur ex eis, nisi illa quae accidit in dorso proprie, cum eo quod ego narro: et est, ut extendatur infirmus super faciem suam super podium aequale prope parietem: et expandatur sub eo stramentum humidum, ut non laedatur pectus eius.	And let not be cured out of them, except that which happened in the back own, with what I am telling: and it is, so that he extends the sick person on his face over a level platform next to the wall: and it spreads out under him a damp cloth, so that his chest does not get hurt.
Deinde ponatur lignum rectum fixum in fouea in terra, in extremitate podii, circiter caput eius: et lignum aliud circiter pedes eius in extremitate altera podii: et minister teneat lignum, et sit non firmatum in fouea.	Then a straight wooden beam is to be placed in the ground in the end of the foot, around the head of it: and another wooden beam around his feet in the other end of the foot: and the servant is to hold the beam, and not to stand fast in the ground.
Et minister alter teneat alterum.	And a servant is to hold the other one.
Deinde inuolue super caput infirmi, et sub titillicis eius ligamentum lene, firmum: et extende extremitatem ligamenti ad lignum quod est apud caput eius: et liga ipsum in eo.	Then an nurse is to turn over the head of it, and under its chin with a piece of lint, fast: and spread out the end of the ligament on the wood which is at his head: and bind him in it.
Deinde stringe ligamentum aliud supra anchas eius, et supra genua ipsius, et apud cauillas eius.	Then a servant is to tighten another ligament above the armpits of it, and above its knees, and at the wrists of it:
Deinde aggrega ligamenta omnia, et liga ea in ligno altero quod est apud pedes eius.	Then he is to gather all the ligaments together, and bind them in the other wood which is at his feet.
Deinde extendat omnis minister ad partem ligni ligamentum, et non remoueantur duo ligna ex locis suis in quibus sunt fixa: uerumtamen non sint firmata, sicut diximus.	Then the servant is to extend all of the ligaments out to the side of the wood, and not remove the two woods from their places in which they are fixed: but they are not fixed, as I said.
Et medicus ponat palmas suas super Spondilem cum fortitudine, donec redeat: aut ponat super eam tabulam.	Let the doctor place his palm on the spine with strength, until he stops: or let him place a board over it.
Deinde annectat super tabulam pedes suos, donec redeat.	Then he should connect his feet to the board with strength, until he stops:
Si autem non redit per hanc curationem, tunc accipe tabulam cuius longitudo sit circiter tria brachia.	But if he does not stop by this cure, then take a board whose length is about three arms.
Et caua in pariete de quo diximus quod est prope infirmum, locum in quem ingrediatur extremitas tabulae.	And make a hole in the wall that we mentioned earlier, which is near the sick person, at the place where the edge of the board enters.
Deinde pone medium tabulae super Spondilem.	Then put the middle of the board on the spine.
Et ponat pedes suos medicus super extremitatem alteram.	And let the doctor place his feet at the other edge.
Et stringat bene, donec coartetur Spondilis, et redeat ad locum suum.	And tighten it well, until the spine is pulled in, and return to its place.
Deinde si uis, operare cum torno quod inuoluitur cum manu tua: et est, ut figas in terram apud caput infirmi in postremo podii duo ligna, quorum longitudo sit brachii unius: et apud caput eius in postremo podii duo ligna.	Then if you want, operate with a turning tool that is rotated with your hand: and it is like this that you fix the two logs on the ground near the head of the sick person at the end of the foot two logs whose length is a single arm: and near the head of those two logs.
Et sit longitudo quae est inter omne lignum palmus unus: et iam factum est in omni loco foramen, in quo currit tornum: et firmetur lignum omne in terra multum, ne moueatur omnino.	And let the length between all the logs be one palm: and now it is done everywhere, a hole where the turning tool runs: and all the logs are tightened on the ground very much, so that they do not move at all.
Et intromittatur lignum rotundum: et est tornum in quo reuoluitur ligamentum in duobus foraminibus duorum lignorum.	And insert the round wood: and it is a turning tool where the ligament turns in two holes of two logs.
Et in extremitate eius est foramen, in quo firmatur lignum, cuius longitudo est palmus cum eo quod reuoluitur: et in duobus lignis aliis est similiter illius.	And at the end of it is a hole, in which the wood is fixed, whose length is a palm with that by which it turns: and in the other two logs is similar to that.
Deinde stringe ligamenta quae strinxisti in pectore infirmi torno quod est apud caput eius: et ligamenta quae strinxisti in cruribus eius in torno quod est apud pedes eius.	Then tighten the ligaments that you have tightened in the chest of the sick person with a turning tool that is at his head: and the ligaments that you have tightened in his legs with a turning tool that is at his feet.
Deinde stet apud omne tornum minister, qui torqueat manum suam cum licinio, cum quo reuoluitur tornum: et medicus aequet Spondilem, secundum quod diximus.	Then stand by every tool that tightens the hand with a turning motion, with which it turns: and the doctor adjusts the spine, according to what we have said.
Haec est forma torni, quae sequitur.	This is the form of the turning tool:
Deinde postquam redit Spondilis, et aequatur locus, tunc oportet, ut ponas emplastrum exiccatiuum cum albumine oui.	Then when the spine returns and the position is even, then you should put on a dried plaster with albumen.
Deinde stuppam.	Then put a collyry.
Postea pone supra emplastrum astellam ex tabula, cuius latitudo sit trium digitorum, aut circiter eos.	Then put a plate over the plaster which is three fingers wide or about that.
Et longitudo eius quantitas quae capiat locum Gibbositatis, et super partem Spondilis sanae.	And its length so much as to take up the space of the girth and over the sound side.
Deinde ligetur cum ligamento quod diximus.	Then bind with a bandage which we have spoken of.
Et utatur infirmus nutrimento subtili, donec sanetur.	And let the sick one be fed with subtle food until he is healed.
Quod si remaneat quiddam eminentiae in loco in fine sanationis: tunc oportet, ut administrentur medicinae quae mollificant, et leniunt, cum administratione tabulae quam narrauimus tempore longo.	That if anything remains of the eminence in the place at the end of the cure: then it is necessary that such medicines which soften and relax be given with the tablet which we have described at regular intervals.
Et iam administratur in illo lamina plumbi.	And now let medicine be given in that leaden plate.
Et quandoque accidit eminentia in postremo Spondilium dorsi: et putatur per eam dislocatio, et est illud os quod iam eminet.	And when anything of eminence comes about at the back of the spine: and it is considered by that dislocation, and that is the joint which has already begun to move out.
Quare non oportet, ut praesumptio fiat ei cum hac medicina: fortasse enim accidere faciet mortem.	Why it should not be supposed that he will get better with this medicine: for perhaps it may cause death.
¶ De curatione Anchae dislocatae.	On the treatment of dislocated shoulders.
Caput XXXII.	Chapter 32.
Scias, quod iuncturae Anchae, et iuncturae humeri, non accidit, nisi dislocatio tantum: neque accidit eis quod accidit reliquis iuncturis ex remotione parua, et concauitate.	You should know that the dislocation of the shoulder and the dislocation of the arm do not occur unless there is a total dislocation; and it does not occur to them what happens to other joints due to a slight distance or tightness.
Et iunctura quidem Anchae dislocatur secundum quatuor partes.	And the dislocation of the shoulder joint occurs according to four sides.
Quod est, quia dislocatur ad anteriora, et ad posteriora.	Because it is dislocated forward and backward.
Et plurimum quidem dislocatur ad interiora: et parum dislocatur ad anteriora, et ad posteriora.	And indeed it is often dislocated inwardly; and a little dislocated forward and backward.
Et curatio dislocationis eius ad interiora, est: quia quando tu coniungis crus infirmi sanum cum infirmo, est longius: et est genu eius eminens plus quam sani, et non potest infirmus duplicare pedem suum apud inguen: et est locus qui sequitur inguen apostematus apostemate calido, propterea, quod caput coxae iam peruenit illic.	And the treatment of its dislocation inwardly is this: because when you join a sound thigh to an infirm person, it is longer; and his hip bone which protrudes more than a sound one, cannot double the person's leg where the thigh follows the bent hip with a hot spot, that is, because the head of the hip has already come there.
Et signum eius cui accidit dislocatio ad exteriora est, quod sunt accidentia eius contraria istis accidentibus.	And the sign of him in whom dislocation has occurred is external, which are his opposite accidents to these accidents.
Et signum eius cui accidit dislocatio ad anteriora, est, quia expandit crus sanum secundum complementum: uerumtamen non duplicat ipsum absque dolore qui est in genu: et si conatur ad ambulandum, non potest super illud ad anteriora: et retinetur urina eius, et apostematur inguen eius, et apud ambulationem est calcatio eius super calcaneum.	And the sign of him in whom dislocation has occurred to the front is, because it expands the healthy limb according to the complement: however, it does not duplicate itself without pain which is in the leg: and if it attempts to walk, it cannot go over that to the front: and it holds back its urine, and takes a step with its toes, and when walking goes on tiptoe.
Et signum eius cui accidit dislocatio ad posteriora est, ut non expandat genu, neque possit duplicare ipsum antequam duplicet inguen: et est crus eius etiam breuius altero: et inguen est mollificatum, et est caput coxae apud locum ilii.	And the sign of him in whom dislocation has occurred to the back is, that he does not expand his leg, and cannot duplicate himself without duplicating his thigh: and his limb is also shorter on the other side: and his thigh is softened, and the head of the hip is at the place.
Reductio uero huius dislocationis specierum est, ut consyderes tunc, si dislocatio est uetusta, quae iam antiquatur cum habente ipsam.	The reduction of this dislocation of the joints is that you consider then, if dislocation is fresh, which has been set in motion with the one who has it.
Deinde si tu administres reductionem eius, et remanet secundum dispositionem suam: tunc non est in ea curatio omnino.	Then if you administer the reduction of it, and remains according to its position: then is not in it at all treatment.
Non ergo oportet, ut praesumptio fiat ei penitus.	Therefore it is not necessary that a pronouncement be made to him inside.
In illo autem cuius dislocatio est recens, et est ex una specierum quatuor dislocationis: tunc propera ad hoc, ut uoluas iuncturam, et extendas ipsam ad interiora et ad exteriora, et moueas eam dextra et sinistra: fortasse enim redit, et non indiget alia cura.	In that however whose dislocation is recent, and is from one of the four joints of dislocation: then approach to this, that you move the joint, and extend it to the inside and outside, and make it move on the right and left: perhaps it will return, and does not need another treatment.
Si autem non redit hoc modo, tunc oportet, ut praepares ministrum fortem, et extendat crus eius ab inferiori parte: aut cum manibus suis, aut cum ligamento, quod ligetur super crus eius supra genu: et minister alius extendat manum eius desuper, ita ut intromittat manus suas sub titillicis eius.	But if this does not return in this way, then you should prepare a strong instrument, and extend the limb of him from the lower part: or with its hands, or with a ligament that is tied above the limb of him: and another instrument extends his hand from above, so that it enters its hands under its toes.
Deinde stringat cum ligamento leni super radicem coxae, et teneat extremitatem ligamenti alterius.	Then tighten with a soft ligament on the root of the hip, and hold the end of the other ligament.
Et sit extensio eius aut ab anteriori parte inguinis ad partem furculae, aut a posteriori ad partem dorsi.	And the position of him should be extended or from the front part of the groin to the side of the thigh, or from the back to the side of the spine.
Et sit extensio eorum omnium uice una, donec eleuetur infirmus cum corpore suo a terra, et remaneat pendens.	And let it be an extension of all these in one way, until the sick man with his body rises from the ground and remains hanging.
Et haec enim species extensionis est species communis specierum quatuor.	For this is indeed the kind of extension that is a general kind of four kinds of species.
Si ergo redit dislocatio cum eo quod diximus, est bonum: et si non, tunc necesse est omni speciei illud quod dicam de curatione propria.	If then the dislocation returns with it that which I said is good: and if not, then to all species that which I say about its own cure is necessary.
In reductione quidem eius propria quando dislocatio est ad interiora, oportet, ut resupinetur infirmus super latus suum sanum.	In reductione indeed of his own when the dislocation is towards the inside, it is necessary that the sick person should lie on his healthy side.
Deinde ponat ligamentum super radicem coxae, in eo quod est inter caput coxae, et locum qui est sub inguine.	Then let him put a bandage over the root of the hip, in that which is between the head of the hip, and the place which is under the groin.
Deinde extende ligamentum ad sursum a parte inguinis ad altiorem partem corporis, ad partem furculae.	Then extend the ligament on high from the part of the groin to the higher part of the body, to the part of the shoulder-blade.
Deinde accipiat minister alius fortis brachia eius, et minuat locum grossum coxae infirmae, et extendat ad exteriora extensione uehementi.	Then another strong minister shall take his both arms, and shall make less the large place of the weak hip, and shall extend to the outside with a violent extension.
Iam enim redit ad locum suum.	For he has already returned to his own place.
Et haec species est facilioris reliquis speciebus curationis, qua reducitur hoc membrum.	And this kind is easier than the rest of the kinds of cure, that this limb is reduced in this way.
Si autem excusatur super te, et non obedit tibi ad introitum cum hac specie curationis omnino: tunc oportet, ut ligentur duo pedes infirmi simul cum ligamento forti, leni, super duos calcaneos, et super duo genua: et sit longitudo cuiusque a compare suo quantitatis quatuor digitorum: et sit crus infirmum extensum plus altero quantitate duorum digitorum.	If however he excuses himself from you, and does not obey to your approach at all with this kind of cure: then it is necessary that two nurses should bind strongly, soft, over the two heels, and over the two knees: and let the length of each one from its own compare be of the quantity of four fingers: and let the leg of the sick person be extended in length of two fingers more than that.
Deinde suspendatur infirmus super caput ligni, quod sit in domo: et sit longitudo eius a terra quantitas duorum brachiorum.	Then let the sick person be hung up on the head of the wood, which is in the house: and let the length of him from the ground be the quantity of two arms.
Deinde praecipe iuueni forti, ut muniat caput coxae: et suspendatur cum infirmo inuenis alius: et impellat iuuenis alius, muniens coxam cum fortitudine, nam iunctura redit ad locum suum cum uelocitate.	Then order a strong young man to support the head of the hip: and let another hang with the sick person's back: and let another push forward the hip with strength, for the join returns to its own place with speed.
In reditione autem eius propria, quando est dislocatio ad exteriora, oportet, ut iaceat infirmus super podium, secundum quod narrauimus in habente gibbositatem.	When reducing his own dislocation to the outside, it is necessary that the sick person lie on a bed, as we have said when having a gibbus.
Et stringatur ligamentum super crus eius, infirmum proprie, et super pectus eius.	And tighten the ligaments over his own leg and over his chest.
Deinde ponantur duo ligna, unum apud pedes eius, et alterum apud caput ipsius.	Then two beams are placed, one at his feet and another at his head.
Deinde ponatur lignum additum in medio podii, fixum bene: super quod inuoluti sint panni humidi, ut non laedat infirmum: et sit lignum inter coxas eius, ut non attrahatur ad inferiora apud extensionem.	Then a wooden beam is placed in the middle of the foot, well fixed: over it wet cloths are laid so as not to hurt the sick; and let the beam rest between his thighs so that it does not draw towards the bottom during extension.
Deinde extendat omnis minister ad partem suam, et medicus aequet reductionem manu sua.	Then all the assistants extend themselves on their side, and the doctor reduces with his own hand.
Si ergo obedit ad reuersionem, erit bonum.	If he obeys to the reduction, it is good.
Et si non, pone super ipsam tabulam, et preme ipsam, sicut diximus in gibbositate, aequaliter.	And if not, place over it the board and press it as we said for the gibbus, equally.
Verumtamen oportet, ut iaceat infirmus super latus suum sanum.	However, it is necessary that the sick person lie on his healthy side.
Et quando dislocatio est ad anteriora, tunc oportet, ut extendatur crus infirmi uelociter: et est secundum hanc eandem narrationem super podium: et ponat medicus palmam manus suae dextrae super inguen infirmum.	And when the dislocation is to the front, then it is necessary that the leg be extended quickly by the assistant; and it is as we have narrated about the bed; and the doctor places his right hand palm on the sick person's thigh.
Deinde coartet ipsum cum manu altera, et cum illa coartatione pone ipsum extensum ad inferiora ad partem genu.	Then he pulls him with the other hand, and with this pull he puts him extended towards the bottom of the leg.
Et si dislocatio est ad posteriora: tunc non oportet, ut extendatur infirmus ad inferiora, et sit eleuatus super terram: imo oportet, ut sit positus super rem duram, sicut oportet, ut fit etiam si dislocatur ancha eius ad exteriora, secundum illud quod diximus de accubitu eius super duas anchas: et est super faciem eius, et ligamenta extensa: secundum quod diximus nuper.	And if the dislocation is to the back: then it is not necessary that the sick person be extended towards the bottom, and that he be made to lie on the ground; but he should be placed on a hard thing, as we said also when we talked about his lying on two broad beams; and he should be on his face, and with stretched ligaments, as we have just said.
Et oportet, ut administretur compressio cum tabula etiam super locum ad quem egreditur iunctura, cum completur reductio secundum quod oportet.	And it is necessary that the compression be administered with the board also to the place from which the joint exits, when the reduction is complete, as is necessary.
Et signum reditionis eius non occultatur tibi: et est, ut extendas duo crura infirmi: et quando uides ea aequalia, et infirmus stringit crus suum, et expandit ipsum absque excusatione: tunc scias, quia iam redit membrum, secundum quod oportet: tunc coniunge duas coxas, et pone emplastrum, et stringe cum imemati, id est, rota: ita, ut non moueatur ancha ad aliquam partium: et adhaereat infirmus quieti tribus diebus, aut quatuor.	And the sign of his reduction should not be hidden from you: and it is when the two legs are extended by the assistant; and when you see them equal, and the sick person tightens his own leg and opens himself without any excuse; then you know that the member has been reduced, as is necessary; then join the two hips, and put a board under them, and tighten with thorns, that is to say, rotate them: so that they do not move the broad part to any side; and let the sick person be quiet for three days, or four.
Deinde solue ligamentum, et emplastrum, et compara crus cum altero: tunc si uides ea aequalia in statu, tunc scias, quod dislocatio iam firmata est: absolue ergo infirmum ad ambulandum.	Then dissolve the ligaments, and apply the plaster, and compare the legs with each other; then if you see them equal in position, then you know that the dislocation is already fixed: so permit the patient to walk.
Et si uides aliquid mollificationis: tunc redi, et emplastra illud, et stringe illud secundum stricturam tuam primam: et dimitte illud etiam tribus diebus.	And if you see any softening: then come again and plaster it, and bind it according to your first stricture: and let go of it also after three days.
Deinde solue illud et fac ipsum tardare in ambulatione super utrumque aliquot diebus, donec confortetur bene.	Then dissolve that one and make the person walk a little on each side for several days, until he is well comforted.
¶ De dislocationis Genu.	The Dislocation of the Knee.
Caput XXXIII.	CHAPTER 33.
Genu dislocatur secundum tres modos.	The knee may be dislocated in three ways.
Dislocatur ad exteriora, ad interiora, et ad inferiora, scilicet ad posteriora.	By the outside, by the inside, and by the lower part, that is to say, by the rear.
Et non dislocatur ad anteriora.	And it does not dislocate in front.
Et signum dislocationis eius, est, ut praecipias infirmo, ut applicet crus suum ad coxam suam.	And the sign of its dislocation is, as you order the sick person to apply his leg to his hip.
Si autem non adhaeret cum coxa: tunc scias, quod Genu est dislocatum.	But if he does not join it with the hip: then you know that the knee is dislocated.
Et restauratio omnium modorum dislocationis eius est, ut facias sedere infirmum rectum, ita ut iam extendat crus suum si potest super illud, et adhaeret dorsum tuum ad faciem eius: et pone pedem eius inter pedes tuos.	And the restoration of all kinds of dislocation is so that you may make the sick sit upright, so that he may stretch his leg out in front of him and join it with his hip, and place his foot between your feet.
Deinde adhaerere fac Genu eius cum palmis tuis, et recta eas inter digitos tuos super Genu eius.	Then adhere to the knee of the sick person with your palms, and make them straight between your fingers above the knee.
Deinde applica cum palma tua duo latera Genu eius cum fortitudine.	Then apply your two hands firmly on the sides of the sick person's knee.
Et minister alius extendat pedem eius, donec redeat Genu ad locum suum.	And another minister should stretch out his foot, until he returns the knee to its place.
Et signum reditionis est, ut adhaereat crus cum coxa in lenitate, non laboriose.	And the sign of restoration is, that the leg joins the hip with ease, not with effort.
Deinde emplastra ipsum, et adhaerere fac crus cum coxa.	Then plaster the sick person, and adhere to the leg with the hip.
Deinde liga ea simul cum uitta tribus diebus, aut quatuor.	Then bind them together at the same time for three or four days.
Deinde solue ea.	Then dissolve them.
Et non utatur infirmus ambulatione aliquot diebus, donec sanetur.	And do not let the sick person walk a little in several days, until he is healed.
Si autem recusatur tibi reductio eius, tunc administra extensionem fortem cum ligamentis, quorum praecessit narratio in curatione anchae, donec redeat.	If, however, you refuse to let him be reduced, then administer a strong extension with the ligaments, of which the precedent was told in the cure of ankylosis, until he recovers.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Calcanei.	On the Treatment of Dislocation of the Calcaneus.
Caput XXXIIII.	Head XXXIV.
Calcaneus quandoque remouetur remotione parua, et quandoque dislocatur secundum complementum.	Calcaneus sometimes is dislocated with a small displacement, and sometimes is dislocated with a second displacement.
Et dislocatio eius fit, aut ad interiora, aut ad exteriora.	And this displacement of the Calcaneus takes place, either towards the inside, or towards the outside.
Et signum dislocationis eius est, quod uides Calcaneum inflatum, procedentem ad partem ad quam dislocatur.	And the sign of this displacement is that you see the Calcaneus swollen, protruding towards the side to which it is displaced.
Curatio autem remotionis eius, est facilis reditionis: et est, ut extendatur cum facilitate cum manibus, et aequetur, donec redeat.	The treatment for this displacement, however, is easy reduction: and it is done by extending it with ease with the hands, and making it stable, until it recovers.
In curatione autem eius quando dislocatur secundum complementum, oportet, ut facias sedere infirmum rectum: et teneat ipsum minister fortis ualde a posteriori parte dorsi eius, in medio ipsius.	In the treatment of this when it is displaced with a second displacement, it is necessary that you make the sick one sit upright: and hold him firmly from behind his back, in the middle of his back itself.
Deinde tene tu cum manu tua dextra pedem eius a superiori parte eius, et cum manu tua sinistra ab inferiori parte pedis eius loco cauillae.	Then hold with your right hand his foot from the upper part of it, and with your left hand from the lower part of the foot at the position of the claw.
Deinde trahe pedem ad tecum manu tua dextra.	Then pull the foot towards you with your right hand.
Deinde cum sinistra duabus uicibus.	Then with two fingers of your left hand.
Deinde extende cum sinistra, et impelle pectus pedis cum dextra uersus crus absque labore.	Then extend it with the left, and push the chest of the foot with the right towards the leg without effort.
Fac illud bis, sicut narrauimus.	Do this twice, as we have described.
Deinde impelle pectus pedis ad crus in uice tertia, et tu trahis cauillam.	Then push the chest of the foot towards the leg in a third force, and you pull the claw.
Si ergo redit in uice una, aut in duabus secundum hunc modum, et uides pedem aequatum, est bonum: et si non, tunc itera operationem super ipsum: quoniam ipse redit.	If then he returns in a single force, or in two forces according to this method, and you see the foot even, it is good: and if not, then repeat the operation over him: because he will return again.
Si autem prohibetur tibi reductio eius cum eo quod narrauimus: tunc fac iacere infirmum super dorsum suum super terram, et fige paxillum in terra firmatum ualde, ut cadat inter coxas eius: et tu iam inuoluisti super ipsum pannum, ut non laedat infirmum.	If, however, you refuse to let him be reduced with the method we have described: then let the sick one lie on his back on the ground, and fasten a blanket firmly to the ground so that it does not move under him: and you can now easily bend over him without hurting him.
Deinde accipiat minister coxam eius: postea extendat minister alter pedem, aut cum manibus suis, aut cum ligamento quod liget super collum pedis.	Then let the attendant take his staff; then afterward let the other foot be extended, or with his hands, or with a strap that binds above the neck of the foot.
Deinde extendat omnis minister contra extensionem comparis sui: et paxillus sit stans inter duas coxas infirmi retinens eum, ut non attrahatur corpus eius ad inferiora apud extensionem.	Then let all the attendants stand opposite to the extension of their own body; and let the nurse stand between the two thighs holding him back so that his body is not drawn down toward the lower part during the extension.
Deinde aequet medicus dislocationem manibus suis, et minister alter teneat crus sanum ad inferiora.	Then let the physician adjust his hands with respect to the dislocation and let the other attendant hold the leg below.
Nam dislocatio redit cum uelocitate.	For the dislocation returns with velocity.
Quando ergo redit dislocatio, et declaratur tibi sanitas reditionis eius: tunc pone emplastrum et stuppam, et stringe ipsam cum ligamentis firmiter, et liga pedem cum ligamento ad crus.	When therefore the dislocation returns, and you are told that the recovery is good: then place the poultice and the bandage, and tighten it with ligaments firmly, and bind the foot with a strap to the leg.
Et oportet, ut caueas uel timeas de neruis, qui sunt supra calcaneum posterius, ut non sit ligamentum super eos uehemens, et laedat eos.	And it is necessary that you should beware or be afraid of the nerves which are above the heel, so that the ligament does not press upon them and they are injured.
Deinde dimitte ipsum duobus diebus, aut tribus.	Then let him go free for two days, or three.
Quod si mollificatur ligamentum, stringe ipsum: deinde solue ipsum in die tertio, aut quarto: et prohibe infirmum ab ambulatione quadraginta diebus.	If the ligament softens, tighten him up; then solve him after one third or fourth day, and prohibit the sick from walking for forty days.
Si uero conatur ambulare ante illud spacium, non fit securitas quin dissoluatur super ipsum dislocatio, et corrumpatur, et non recipiat post illud curationem.	But if there is an attempt to walk before that space, it does not bring about security unless the dislocation is dissolved above him, and it corrupts, and does not receive after that cure.
Quod si accidat ei apostema calidum: tunc oportet, ut administres in sedatione eius illud, in quo praecessit narratio nostra in alio loco ex curatione, et embrocationem, donec remoueatur.	If there is a swelling of the foot which is warm: then let him be administered in a sedative which he has in which our narration before in another place concerning the cure, and a poultice, until it has decreased.
¶ De dislocatione Digitorum pedis, et cura.	Concerning dislocations of the toes of the foot, and cure.
Caput XXXV.	Chapter LXXXI.
Oportet, ut aequetur quod dislocatur ex eis cum extensione pauca absque labore: et illud quidem non est difficile, imo est facile.	It is necessary that the one who is dislocated should be extended a little without work; and this is not difficult, on the contrary, it is easy.
Si autem dislocatio est in quibusdam nodis dorsi pedis: tunc oportet, ut faciat sedere infirmus pedem suum super locum aequalem terrae, aut super tabulam: et est stans sicut ambulans.	But if the dislocation is in certain nodes of the back of the foot: then let him sit with his sick foot on an equal place of the ground, or on a board; and he stands as one who walks.
Deinde tu sta, et pone pedem tuum super illud quod eminet ex illis iuncturis.	Then sit down, and put your foot on that which protrudes from them with the bandage.
Deinde calca illud cum pede tuo cum uirtute, donec redeat, et uideas ipsum iam aequatum, et non appareat in loco eminentia.	Then with your foot firmly place that which protrudes from them with the bandage until it is returned to its proper place and no longer appears out of place.
Deinde pone sub uentre pedis eius tabulam quae capiat pedem totum, cui sint duo capita.	Then place under his foot a board that catches the entire sole, which has two ends.
Deinde stringe ipsum strictura decenti tribus diebus.	Then tie him up with ten strings to be used for lowering, for ten days.
Deinde solue ipsum, et fac quiescere eum ab ambulatione diebus multis, donec stringatur et securetur a reductione.	Then loosen him and let him rest from walking for many days, until he is loosed and made secure from the process of reduction.
¶ De speciebus dislocationis cum uulnere uel fractura.	The species of dislocation with a sprained or broken bone.
Caput XXXVI.	Chapter XXXVI.
Quando accidit aliquid ex illo, et conaris curationem eius, et ipsius restaurationem, multotiens succedit mors: et propter illud non oportet, ut praesumat super curationem eius, quod est huiusmodi, nisi qui est prudens in arte longi usus, misericors, pius, tardus, non audax, neque praesumptuosus: et ut utatur in incaeptionce medicinis quae sedant apostemata calida tantum: et dimittat infirmum diuino iudicio.	When any of these things happen, and he takes a long time to recover or restore himself, often death follows: and for this reason it is not proper that he should be too confident about his own recovery, which is of this nature, unless he is prudent in the art of using medicines for sitting down, merciful, gentle, tardy, not daring, and modest; and that he should use medicines which sit idly, and dismiss the sick with divine judgment.
Nisi uideas, aut speras salutem a perditione cum lenitate aegritudinis, et in quo apparet quiddam spei.	Unless you expect salvation from destruction with mildness of disease, and in which there seems to be some hope.
Conare ergo reductionem eius statim in principio rei, antequam accidat apostema calidum.	Consider then that the reduction should take place at once at the beginning of the illness, before a hot poultice has occurred.
Si ergo redit membrum, secundum quod uolumus, tunc administra regimen quod sedat apostema: et cura uulnus cum eo quod conuenit ei ex unguentis desiccatiuis.	If then the member returns, according to our wish, then administer the regime that sits down with a poultice: and take care of the sprain with it as it suits him from an ointment of dried herbs.
Quod si dislocatio est cum fractura, et accidunt in osse satagiae separatae, tunc conare ablationem earum, et fac in illo quod diximus in aegritudinibus simplicibus ex eo quod praecessit in locis earum.	If the dislocation is with a fracture, and they have occurred to the bones of the limbs that separate, then consider their removal, and do in him what we have said in simple illnesses from that which preceded in those places.
Et caue secundum tuam uirtutem, et custodi teipsum ab introitu in uiam timoris: secundum quod praecessit praedicatio mea tibi.	And do according to your own strength, and guard yourself from the entrance into a state of fear: according to my previous statement to you.
Nam illud est melius tibi apud Creatorem tuum, et magis permanens ad gloriam tuam, et magis saluum tuo corpori apud illos in tuo tempore.	It is better for you to be with your Creator, and remain firm for your glory, and keep your body safe from them at that time.
