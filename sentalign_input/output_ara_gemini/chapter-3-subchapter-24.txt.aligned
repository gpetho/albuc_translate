Chapter Twenty-Four on the Treatment of Dislocation of the Lower Jaw	CHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR. On the treatment of a dislocation of the lower jaw.	0.8559406
Rarely do the jaws dislocate except in rare cases.	It is rare indeed for the jawbones to be dislocated.	0.74202293
And their dislocation occurs in one of two ways: Either they shift from their places slightly, so they relax a little, or they dislocate completely, so they relax towards the chest until the patient's saliva flows and he cannot hold it back, nor can he close his jaw, and his tongue stammers when speaking.	Their dislocation may be in one of two ways: either they may shift slightly from their place and be a little relaxed; or they may be completely and utterly dislocated so as to be relaxed down toward the breast so that the patient's saliva runs out and he cannot control it; nor is he able to close his mouth, and he stutters in speaking.	0.9195732
So if the dislocation is slight, it may return to its place on its own in most cases with minimal effort.	If it be only a slight displacement it will go back in most cases spontaneously without much trouble.	0.69074535
But if the dislocation is complete, it is necessary to hasten its reduction quickly and not delay it at all.	But if the dislocation be complete and total it is necessary to set about the reduction of it at once without any delay.	0.883137
This is done by having an assistant hold the patient's head, and the physician inserts the thumb of one hand into the base of the jaw inside his mouth if the jaw is dislocated on one side, or inserts both thumbs if the jaw is dislocated on both sides, and with the rest of his fingers on the outside, he adjusts it and orders the patient to relax his jaw and let it go in every direction, and the physician adjusts and pushes the jaw until it returns to its place.	This is done thus: an assistant holds the patient's head and the doctor introduces into his mouth the thumb of one hand at the root of the jaw, if it be a dislocation on one side, or both thumbs if it be a bilateral dislocation, with the rest of the fingers outside to keep it straight. Then let him bid the patient relax his jaws and allow them to move in any direction; while the doctor sets the dislocation, thrusting the jaw until it return to its proper place.	0.94610065
If its reduction is difficult, especially if both jaws are dislocated, use a compress with hot water and oil until their reduction is easy, and do not delay their reduction at all, as we said.	If the reduction be difficult, especially if it be a bilateral dislocation, administer a fomentation with hot water and oil, so that the reduction of both sides may be facilitated. And on no account delay the reduction, as we have said.	0.8405335
So when they have returned and straightened and the patient's mouth has closed and they do not relax, then place on them pads of cloth with cerate made from wax and rose oil, then tie them gently with a loose bandage.	When the reduction and straightening have been done and the patient's mouth closes and is not relaxed, then apply to both sides dressings steeped in wax prepared from wax and oil of roses. Then bind it up gently, with a loose bandage.	0.77124405
And the patient should sleep on his back with his head supported between two pillows so that he does not move it right or left and does not strain to chew anything, but makes his food a soft soup. Until the pain is gone and the jaw is firm, let him eat what he pleases.	The patient should sleep lying on his back with his head held between two pillows so that he does not move it either to right or to left; nor should he burden himself with chewing but should be on a diet of broth of corn starch until the pain is gone and the jaw is firm; then he may eat whatever he wishes.	0.8765513
And let him do that gently and not strain to open his mouth when eating, drinking, and yawning until the jaw is firm and healed.	Let him use it gently; let him not work his mouth heavily in eating or drinking or yawning until the jaw is firmly knit and healed.	0.804108
If the reduction of the jaws is difficult when they dislocate at some point and do not return to their places, fevers and persistent headaches often occur from that, and perhaps the patient's bowels loosen, and perhaps he vomits pure bile.	If the reduction of both sides is hard when it is a simultaneous bilateral dislocation, and there is no return to the proper position, then thereby in many cases fevers and perpetual headaches occur; sometimes the patient's belly is loosened and he vomits actual bile.	0.80640876
So if you see that, know that he is damaged, and often one who experiences that dies within ten days.	When you see this you will know that he is doomed; in most cases in which this happens death follows in ten days.	0.7537908
