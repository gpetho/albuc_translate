 CHAPTER FIFTY-THREE.
On the cauterization of corns, inverted and otherwise.
 This disease, which is something hard paining the foot, very often occurs in the soles of the feet.
The cauterization in this case is twofold, actual or caustic.
The actual cautery is to heat a hollow cautery like a vulture's quill, made of iron, narrow of edge, of such a size as to surround the corn all round.
Then put it, hot, on the corn and rotate it till the cautery reaches the root of the corn; and let be for three days to draw the pus; then apply a plaster of wild mallows ground up with salt, and leave the plaster on one night; then it may be drawn out with its root.
Then treat the site of the wound with stimulating salve till it heals.
If the corns are not inverted, which usually happens on the surface of the body and particularly on the hands and feet, you should take a cannula made of bronze or iron or made of a vulture's quill, and place it on the corn or wart; then pour into the cannula a small quantity of caustic solution; keep your hand on it and rotate it, keeping up a slight pressure so that the edge of the cannula impresses a mark at the root of the corn and the caustic makes its way to the root of the corn.
Let the patient endure the action of the caustic for a while, then remove it; for the corn may be drawn out with its root.
Treat them in this manner one after another till you have accounted for all of them.
Then treat the site of them, after eradication, with stimulating ointments.
