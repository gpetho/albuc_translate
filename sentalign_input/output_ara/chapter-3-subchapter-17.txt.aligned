On fractures of the bones of the foot and toes.	On fracture of bones of the foot and of the toes.	0.9916968
As for the heel, it is not subject to fracture at all. As for the bones of the foot, they may be fractured, and the toes also are rarely fractured, but rather are subject to contusion in most cases.	The heel is never fractured; but the bones of the foot sometimes are. The toes too are rarely fractured; but mostly they get crushed.	0.8271696
If a fracture of the bones of the foot occurs and you see that those bones are overlapping, let the patient place his foot on the ground upright as if walking, then you stand and place your foot on the raised part of those bones, then tread on it and straighten it.	If a fracture occurs to the bones of the foot, and you see the bones riding over one another, let the patient plant his foot flat on the ground as if walking. Then stand and put the sole of your foot on the prominent bones and with your foot put pressure upon them and level them to their proper place.	0.9064626
Until they return to their places, then apply the dressing and the splint from above, and place a small board under the sole of the foot that has two flat ends, then tighten the foot tightly after wrapping it with bandages and everything else you need.	Then apply a bandage and some tow on top, and put under the inner part of the sole of the foot a small board with two flat heads. After you have wrapped them in material and so on, bind them tightly to the sole of the foot.	0.7320105
When three or four days have passed, loosen the bandage, and you will find the bones straightened whether they were fractured or dislocated, so the procedure is as you see.  As for if some of the toes are fractured, set them and straighten them according to what I described to you regarding setting the fingers of the hand.	When three days or four have passed, loosen the binding and you will find the bones in position; whether they have been fractured or dislocated, the operation is (the same,) as you see.	0.856643
Then make a splint for the broken toe the length of the toe and slightly wider than it, then place this board I described to you under the foot and tighten it firmly. If two, three, or more bones are broken,	If one of the toes be broken, reposition and straighten it in the way that I described for the fingers; then apply to the broken toe a splint of a length corresponding to the toe and a little wider than it. Then under the sole of the foot put the board that I have just described, and bandage it on firmly.	0.79944
then put a splint on each toe according to its size, wrapped in a soft cloth, and tighten the board on the bottom of the foot, and let each end of the board rest outside the sole of the foot to secure it well.	If the broken bones number two, three, or more, then apply over each toe a single splint measured to it, wrapped in soft material, and bind the board on the sole and let the flat portion of each of the two heads extend beyond the end of the sole of the foot, so that it may be held firmly.	0.6591139
And you should not forget to attend to all that we have mentioned to you regarding all the other fractures, of the symptoms that we have mentioned, and address each symptom as appropriate.	And you must not forget to pay attention to all those contingencies that we have mentioned to you in other fractures; meet each contingency with the means proper to it.	0.81310946
