Oh, sons, since I have completed this book for you, which is the last of the science of medicine, with its completion comes its end. Through the exposition and explanation of it, it has become clear to me that I must complete it for you with this treatise, which is a part of surgical operations, known as surgery.
For the operation with hands is greatly neglected in our region and in our time, to such an extent that it has fallen into disuse and its traces have been lost; nothing remains of it except a few slight descriptions in the books of the Ancients, which are mostly changed and lead astray by error and ignorance, until their meanings are obscured and the strength and skill of the art are weakened.
And it has become clear to me that I should revive this art with the arrangement of this treatise according to the way of exposition and declaration and abbreviation; and so that it comes with the forms of the cautery tools and other instruments of the work, as will be added in the explanation, and for its preparation, which is necessary.
But the reason why a good artisan with his hand is not found in this our time is that the art of medicine is long, and its practitioner must first be exercised in the science of anatomy, which counts Galen among those who knew the arrangement of the members and their forms, and their connection and separation; and had knowledge of the bones, nerves and ligaments, their number and position; and of the pulsating veins and the still ones, and the places of their emergence. >".
And for this reason Ipocras says that with the name there is nothing, but in the action a little, and especially in the art of hand.
But we have already said about that at the beginning of this book; for whoever is not knowledgeable about what we have said regarding anatomy will fall into error by which men will die, as I have seen happen to many, because some are trained in this science and yet they neglect it without knowledge or experience.
For I saw a foolish and inexperienced doctor cut into a scrofulous abscess on the neck of a woman, and he cut some arteries in the neck so that much blood flowed out until the woman fell dead in his hands.
And I saw another doctor who thought he would remove a stone from a man who had suffered for a long time, and the stone was large. He tried to pull it out and removed part of the bladder with it, so that on the third day the man died.
And I was called to remove it, and I saw that because of the size of the stone and the condition of the patient, I knew that he would die under my care.
Here's the translation of your given sentence:
Here's the translation of the given sentence:
And I was called to him, and prepared to loosen the bandage, and as a result, there was tranquility and also an alleviation of his pains.
However, the corruption had already taken hold in the member, so it could not be stopped and continued to spread through the member until the patient died.
And I saw another doctor who pierced an abscess with cancer, and it was ulcerated after several days, until the illness of the patient became very severe.
The reason is that the cancerous abscess is full of melancholy humors; therefore, it should not be touched with iron, but rather cauterized on the affected member so that it can be healed completely.
And for this reason, my sons, it is necessary that the operation with the hand be carried out in two ways: one is an operation associated with health, and the other is a work associated with the greatest dangers.
And I have already stated this throughout this book in every place where there is an operation that involves error and fear; therefore, it is necessary for you to guard against this and leave it alone, so that the pages do not find a way to speak and dishonor you.
And therefore, take up your weapons with diligence and under the protection of God, and your patients with happiness and determination.
And use the best way for the grace of God to find salvation and praiseworthy success, and leave behind the terrible sicknesses of difficult healing, and remove your weapons from that which makes you fear, so that trust in your faith and in your name does not evade you: for it is more honorable to your glory, and after this life, everlasting to your sanctity.
Gaul has already discussed some of these matters: "Do not treat sicknesses badly, lest you be called bad doctors.
And I have already divided this book into three chapters.
This begins the division of the book, and first of the first part. The first chapter is ordered about the head and feet, in the forms of instruments and the tools of cauteries, and what is necessary for the operation.
The division of the second part. The second chapter is about cupping and puncturing, and about cupping glasses, and about plasters, and about the extraction of arrows and similar things, all arranged according to the forms of the instruments.
The third chapter, on restoration and dislocation, and on the treatment of twists and similar conditions; a chapter organized by the head to the feet, including the forms of instruments.
I should tell you the qualities of the instruments used for this type of cautery and their uses, as well as in which complexion it is prohibited to use cautery.
Therefore, I say that the discourse on the quality of the cautery instrument and its uses is long and complex, subtle in knowledge, and secretly hidden; many wise men have spoken about it, and they have disagreed, and for me it suffices to touch upon a small part of their discourses, fearing prolixity.
And therefore I say that you can apply cautery to any complexion universally, whether it has matter or not, with the exception of two complexions, which are cold complexions without matter.
In the cold and dry complexion with matter, I will express disagreement; because some say that cautery is beneficial for it, while others say the opposite, that cautery is not suitable for an illness caused by quality and dryness, since the nature of fire is quality and dryness, and it is inappropriate to treat a cold and dry illness with something hot and dry.
And say to him who says the contrary of that, which by cauterization is done helpfully in all dry and cold maladies that appear in the bodies of men, for when you compare the body of a man and its humidity to the composition of fire, you find the body of a man cold.
And I say by the words of that person, which experiment I have already tried several times to discover.
But nevertheless, it does not matter that this person who is already experienced and practiced in the chapter of cauterization by recent practice, has known the diversity of the composition of men and the disposition of diseases within them, and the causes of those [diseases], and their accidents, and the duration of time for those.
But in other compositions [of the body], there is no fear for you, especially in cold and humid diseases, because all doctors have agreed upon these, and they do not disagree on the help with cauterization in those [diseases].
And know, sons, that of the secret of curing with cautery by fire and its goodness, there is agreement on cauterization with medicinal powders because fire is simple, whose action does not reach any member except the one being cauterized, and it does not harm the neighboring members except with a small injury.
"But the medical action reaches that part of the body which is connected to it, and quickly brings about healing in the diseased member of difficult cure.
"But fire, due to its sublimity and the goodness of its substance, does nothing but surpass; and it is known to us through experiment and long service in the study of the art on the truth of causes; and for this I am excused from the length of speech. And if it were not that it is not read in my book, I would pause here and reveal a secret about fire, its qualities, and its operation in the body and its expulsion by which diseases are expelled, with a philosophical demonstrative discourse, which would be sharpened in your understanding.
"And know, sons, that those who disagree about the time in which it is appropriate to make cautery pause at the best time of spring.
"And I say that cautery is appropriate at all times, for the harm from accidental circumstances is overcome by the benefit of what is drawn out by cautery; and especially if the cautery is for pains or necessary pains, which cannot tolerate delay for fear that they may worsen, which is greater than a minor harm caused by time.
And this is not considered in your opinions, or, my sons, only the common people and foolish doctors think so. It's because with that illness which is healed by cautery, there is no relapse, and they put an end to that consequence.
And the cause is not as they think because of that, for cautery is nothing more than a medicine that changes the complexion and dries up the humors which are the cause of the pains.
However, cautery excels over medicine due to the swiftness of its effect and the power of its operation, and the greatness of its master.
And it is possible that his illness may return at some point in time, according to the complexion of the patient and the location of his illness, and his strength, and what has been prepared in his body from an accumulation of excesses in him, and what he has acquired in his eating habits and similar causes; unless the illness in which cautery is administered is a subtle illness with few superfluities and humors, such as cautery for tooth pain and the like. In this case, it is possible that the pain will not return to him, but this occurs in small cases.
And it is more commonly said that the cautery is the last remedy in medicine, and this is rightly so because I understand that there is nothing else that can be done with medicine or for any other reason except by cautery.
And the reason is the opposite of this; and the intention that the cautery is the last remedy in medicine is only when the ways of cure are administered in some illnesses, and those medicines do not work, and then at the end of the cause one administers the cautery, and it is beneficial for that. Therefore, from this point onward, let us acknowledge that the cautery is not the last remedy in medicine, contrary to what many ignorant and foolish doctors think.
And the ancients said that cautery with gold is better than cautery with iron, and they did not say this except for the malleability of gold and the nobility of its substance.
And it is said that the place of cautery does not produce scarring, as this is not absolutely true, for I have proven and found that it does so in certain bodies but not others, and cautery with gold is good and better than with iron, as they say; however, when you perform cautery with fire using gold, it is not specified to you, because it ignites according to the quantity you want due to the thinness of the gold, and because it prepares to receive heat. And if you place a flame on it, the gold will melt from the heat, and some leaves fall into the fire for the workman to catch them during that operation.
And for that reason, you should make cautery with iron, doing so as gently and precisely as possible for the correct execution of the operation.
And I have already arranged this chapter on cautery according to the chapters, and I have arranged those from the head down to the feet, so that the one asking will know what is required of him.
The first chapter.
This cauterization is effective against cold and dampness, two causes of which are the accident and cause of both sodium and many types of rheumatic flux, called rhinitis, running from the head to the areas around the eyes and ears, as well as abundant sleep, toothache, and sore throat. In general, it is effective for all ailments that come from coldness, such as paralysis, sodium, apoplexy, and similar ailments in those conditions.
The method for this cauterization is as follows: first, you must instruct the patient to take a purgative medicine that cleanses the head, for three or four nights, according to the strength of the patient, their age, and their habits.
And then command the patient to shave their head with a razor. Then make that servant sit between your hands on a low bench, and have them place their hands on the patient's feet.
And then press the sharp edge of your palm close to the pupil, near the bridge of the nose between their eyes. However, when your hand has reached the middle of the head, mark that spot with a needle, and then ignite the olive-shaped cautery, which looks like this:
And then place that cautery over the marked spot with a needle, in such a way that it descends, while your other hand is gradually tightened, and you turn that [cautery].
And then gently lift your hand and look at the spot, and if you see any amount of bone from the skull, even as small as a grain of barley, then lift your hand, but if not, return your hand with that iron, or another one like it, if it is cooled, until you see what I have told you.
And then take a little salt and dissolve it over the spot, and leave it there for three days.
And then place on him a compress soaked in vinegar, and leave it on him until the scab of the burn is destroyed. And then treat the area with Tetrapharmacum ointment until it is healed.
And they said that as long as the wound remains open, the better for the arm, because it is better and more beneficial.
And some of them said that the tendon should be cauterized up to the bone, and the cautery should be held until a part of the bone's shape is dried out.
And then it should be shaved down to where it is adjacent to the bone, and then it should be treated. ⟩
And others said that with the cautery one should reach the back until it strongly presses on the bone, to the point where the bone cracks, and this is the method of small alphecati. And they believe that from that place, the vapors of the head are released.
And let the wound be kept open for a long time, and then it should be treated until it is healed.
However, I have not seen these two types of cautery in all cases, but only in some men due to fear; and let that one go, because it is better for him with health as he is. For the head is relieved by the solution of its continuity, just as we have shown in other members, and especially when the patient's head is of a fragile nature.
And the first type of cautery is considered safer and more effective, as it both heals and brings about health.
Chapter two.
Of the cautery on the head.
When there is chronic and prolonged pain throughout the head of a patient, who has used helmets, hair tonics, bloodletting, poultices, washes, bandages, ointments, and similar remedies, and especially if he has already been cauterized with a cautery that does not help him at all, then consider whether the head of the patient is of strong constitution in its nature; it is not weak and finds great cold. Then cauterize him with another cautery after that one, but only a little. And then cauterize it on the crown of his head with a cautery until the scab is removed. After removing the scab and exposing the bone in the amount we have mentioned, cauterize that area with a cautery in the back of the head, specifically in the place called "vas," which is where a cup is placed for cupping therapy. And be careful in doing so, and do not expose the bone, because the patient may experience very great pain, different from the pain of all other head cauteries.
Here is a possible translation of the sentence:
It looks like there is some confusion with the first line of text you provided for translation. "Capitol ters" does not appear to be in the same language as the previous sentences, and it seems more like a mix of Latin and English rather than the medieval medical treatise style. If this was intended to be part of the same text, please provide additional context or clarify.
"On the Cauterization of Migraine (Non-Chronic).
"When pain occurs in the head, or if there is pain within the eye, it should be treated with purging medicines for the head and other remedies as I have mentioned in the sections on illnesses; and if that does not help, then cauterization can be done in two ways: either by cauterizing with a sharp instrument or with iron.
"But to cauterize with a sharp instrument is done by taking a needle of aloe, and scraping it and binding the ends of it on both sides. "And then you should incise the painful area on the temple with a heated lance, until it reaches the bone, but not too deep.
"And then press on it with a stopper to keep the pressure, and leave it for the space of three hours; and then remove it and apply aloe, and let the wound remain for two or three days, and then place a wet cloth over it until the area becomes numb.
"And then treat it with an ointment until it is healed.
"And if you wish, do this with some other burning medicines that I have written about in the twelfth treatise on burning medicines.
But the cauterization with iron is done in this manner: the cautery's shape is as follows:
and it is called a nail-head because its tip resembles the shape of a nail, with some curvature, and in the middle there is a small protuberance.
Then place [the cautery] on the painful spot, and hold your hand — to prevent the bow from being burnt — and rotate the iron slowly with speed.
And if the amount that is burnt by the tip of the cord reaches half [of it], then lift your hand to ensure that the artery beneath it is not burnt, so that blood flow does not occur.
Then immediately dip cotton in salt water and place it on the spot, leaving it there for three days; then place a clean pad with a border, and then treat with ointment until it is healed.
And if you wish, cauterize with the tip of the scalpel according to the method of cautery, and be careful not to cut an artery in this recent wound.
Chapter Four.
On Cauterization of Old Wounds.
When you treat migraine with the water we mentioned in the previous treatment, and as described in the divisions of diseases, and if the treatment does not work, sometimes due to the disease being resistant to what was said about the first cautery with medicine or with fire, then it is necessary for you to heat the surgical cautery until it turns white. Place it on the area of pain along a line as long as most of your finger, or that one; and press your hand once and strongly so that you cut through the skin and reach the bone.
However, it is necessary for you to be careful about the continuation of the jaw, which is moved by chewing, and that the ligament is not torn and the nerves that affect it are not damaged, so that a spasm does not occur.
And if it is concerning the care and caution of blood flow from the artery that is cut, because there is fear in its cutting, and especially for those who do not know what they are doing and are not skilled or experienced; leave the operation to those who have experience at the beginning.
And I come to remind you of the regulation of blood flow from an incision according to its method, in its place in this book.
"And if the patient's illness is not alleviated by this cautery and the body of the patient is tolerable, then cauterize the middle part of the head in the same way as we have described, and treat the wound until it is healed.
"And if you see, administer the cautery that we have described in the chapter on arrow wounds with two-pronged cautery, and this is the best cauterization and more beneficial.
"Chapter V.
"On cauterizing earache pain.
"When there is pain in the ear from cold and it is treated with purgative medicines and other cures that I have mentioned earlier, and the pain does not subside, then heat the cautery, and this one is called 'point.' Its form is as follows:
"And then bring the point close to the heat, and apply it all around the entire ear like a wheel that is turned, or along the edge of each part if the pain is in each one. "Approach with the cautery from the root of the ear little by little, after you have felt the spot with your finger.
"And if the cautery of those points is applied to the entire ear and it stops [the pain], then treat the spots until they are healed.
**Capítulo VI** (Chapter VI)
**On Cauterizing Warts.**
**Warts that are healed by cauterization are only those caused by the phlegm humour, as we have said in the divisions of illnesses.**
**Avoid cauterizing warts caused by dryness or nerve spasms.**
**When you cure that type of wart with herbs, purgatives, and gargles, and the treatment is not working, then you must cauterize the patient in three places: the first on the edge of the ear, the second a little below the temple, and the third at the junction of the two lips.**
**And place your cautery in the opposite direction of the affected area, because softening only occurs in the part that appears healthy.**
**The method of cauterization is to cauterize it with the cautery on the right edge of the extremity of the ear, and a little higher over the corner of the head, and in the temple another one, whose length should be according to the length of the thumb, and hold your hand with the cautery until half the size of a hazelnut is burned.**
And this is the form of the cautery, and it is a species of the knife, the form of which is in front of the table. However, it is more subtle than that one a little bit like glass; and it should have the excess thickness reduced somewhat.
Then care for the area with water that has been processed beforehand until it is healed.
Chapter VII.
On the Cautery of Old Apoplexy.
When apoplexy is old and you care for it with the water we mentioned and the patient does not have a fever, then cauterize them with four cauteries: on both temples of their head; and with a cautery in the middle of the head, as we said; and with a cautery in the nape. And the manner of the cautery is done as was said above.
And it has been cauterized on the mouth of the stomach, and this is more behind; and then it should be cared for with processed water.
Chapter VIII. 😊
On Cautery for Forgetfulness Caused by Flame.
It is necessary that at the beginning large jars and purifying pills be given to the patient. 😊
And then shave the entire head of the patient and apply onto the crown of their head the plaster of wax as described in the treatise on plasters.
Apply it several times, because this is a method of cauterization. And do this according to the aforementioned order that I have already mentioned.
And if by that he is healed, well and good; but if not, then make three cauteries on the back of his head, which should descend from the highest part of the head towards the lower part of the neck. And place between each cautery the thickness of the finger, and then treat the cautery with water that has been boiled.
However, if you see swelling and the patient tolerates it well, then make a cautery in the middle of the head; but if there is more swelling, then cauterize on both temples.
Then treat it until he is healed; and let the cauteries be olive-sized according to the form given above.
Chapter IX
On the cauterization of the testicles and on softening the entire body.
Note that you should proceed in softening the head with jars and with the water we have mentioned; and then shave the head of the patient, and then cauterize it with a pointed instrument in the middle of the head, and with pointed instruments on all the temples of the head, and with pointed instruments on the back of the head, and with three pointed instruments on the spine of the neck.
And if it is necessary in the illness of softening of the body due to excess and the patient's endurance is low and the illness is strong, then cauterize with four cauteries on the spine of the back, and subsequently cauterize until the voice of the patient is lost, and lift the hand. And care for him until he is cured, and this should be a cautery of olive oil.
Chapter X
Of the Cauterization of Epilepsy
Do not cauterize an epileptic unless that epilepsy is caused by phlegm.
Therefore, it is necessary to cleanse the brain of the patient at its beginning with years and with the other treatment that we have said in the division when the illness is great and the patient can tolerate the exception of the medicines.
And if it is a child who cannot tolerate the medicines, then administer electuaries and masticatory servels that cleanse, before this for many days, with the improvement of the food.
Then shave the head of the patient, and then cauterize him with one cautery in the middle of the head according to the aforementioned method, and with another cautery on his occiput, and over each corner of the head. And if the patient is strong and tolerant, then use the cautery on them with the cauteries that have been mentioned, while ensuring they are paralyzed and softened on the vertebrae of the neck and the vertebrae of the back.
And let the olive cautery be applied according to what has been said previously.
But if the patient is a child, then apply a subtle cautery in this manner.
Chapter XI
About cauterization for melancholy.
When the causes of melancholy are corrupt humidity and thick flame, then use the cauteries that we have mentioned, while ensuring they are paralyzed.
And if the cause of melancholy is excess fluid inclined towards melancholy, and the patient's body is moist, then give them water to cleanse their brain, as mentioned before in the division.
Then shave the patient's head, and then make a moderate pigeon on them in the circle [of hair], and then place that on the middle of the head.
And let the patient be seated in a chair, and be held from all sides.
Then apply an ointment, and it is more appropriate to use old sheep's grease for this purpose. And warm that over the fire for a tempered heat by measure, which is said to have suffered when it is most in him. And then place that in the middle of his head in a circle, and let him in so that he is cooled off.
And do this with the patient once a week, along with his other good regimen until he is healed; or if you prefer, cauterize that making small points according to his strength, provided you have your hand with a cautery arranged in this manner: this is a kind of cautery which moistens the brain with equality.
And then place that cloth soaked in hot water or goose fat over it.
Chapter 12
On the cauterization of water descending into the eye.
When you have determined the onset of water in the eye according to the signs I mentioned in the division, then begin and give the patient something to drink that purifies his head, and keep him away from all moisture.
And have him bathe in warm water for several days.
And then order him to shave his head, and cauterize that with a cautery in the middle of the head; and then cauterize that with two cauteries on both temples if it is the beginning of water issuing from both eyes, or with one stroke if it is the beginning of water from one eye.
Incideys am cauteri totas las venas e arcerias las quals so dejos la codena; e sian les cauteris en aquela lonh en la latitut de las templas.
And beware of blood flows when it is cauterized; and if you see blood flows from him, stop it with some medicine that is available to you.
And I will come with wisdom in the extraction of arrows and in their removal, and in preventing blood flow.
And sometimes it is cauterized on the neck under two bones with two very sharp cauteries.
Chapter .13.
On the Cautery of Old Tears.
When the tears of the eyes are old and constant, and through the veins and arteries that are in the prominent part of the head outside, and it is verified that this is a superfluous phlegmatic humor, then cauterize with a cautery as we have mentioned at the beginning of the chapter on water flowing into the eyes, and with a cautery in the middle of the head, and with two cauteries in the neck under the temples, and with two cauteries in the neck under the bones. And if you need to add more, then cauterize that on all the side of the tail of the eye above the end of the eyebrow with a small cautery.
Chapter .14.
"On the cauterization of nasal odor.
When you treat a patient with the remedy mentioned in the division and your treatment does not work, then prepare and give the patient to drink the cochias for three nights; and then shave their head, and cauterize it with a hot iron or an olive-oil burner. Then cauterize that area with a hot iron, specifically a rosemary iron, and use two cauteries on both eyebrows just below the hairline.
And be careful not to burn too deeply in that area.
And this is how you make the rosemary cautery:
Chapter XV.
"On the use of the cautery for softening the eyelids.
"When the eyelid of the eye is softened by illness or moisture, then cauterize that eyelid with an iron made with this moon-shaped iron; and this is its form:
"And if you wish, cauterize that area on both eyebrows a little with two cauteries throughout the entire area, and let them be long from the temples. "And let the length of each cautery be according to the size of the eyebrow.
"And do not press too hard with your hand holding the cautery, but according to the amount that one-third of the eyelid is burned.
It seems like you've provided the title of a chapter in the medieval medical treatise. "Capitol .xvi." means "Chapter XVI" or "Chapter 16". This indicates that the text you're translating is part of a structured document, likely divided into various sections or chapters for easier reference.
When performing cautery on the eyelid due to hair turning inward and damaging the eye.
When the eyelashes turn inward and puncture the eye, there are two methods for performing cautery: one is by using heat, the other by using a burning medicine.
If you are using cautery with fire, instruct the patient beforehand to pluck out their eyelashes as if they were being groomed, until they are long and smooth; and if they cause damage, then you should strengthen his eyes with a bandage so that he is not harmed until the eyelashes regrow.
Therefore, when they have regrown and become smooth, then place the patient's head in your lap, and approach the eyelid of his eye with a pin, holding it in the manner of a maple leaf, and begin the mark at the base near the lashes.
And then place a cotton swab soaked in egg white or in a mixture of flour on the eye.
And then ignite the cautery which has this form.
And then cauterize on the figure which has been marked, little by little, in small parts, until the surface of the cord is burnt as if it were a myrtle leaf, clearly visible.
The sign of a successful operation is that you will see the eyelid already contracted and the hairs raised above the point of the eye.
Therefore, raise your hand and leave it there for three days, then place a cushion with a border on it until the scar is healed. And then treat that wound with ointment until it is healed.
But if the hairs return for any reason and the eyelid is softened, then make the cautery on that spot again just as you did before.
But if the hairs remain on the eyelid, then cauterize that area until it is raised to its natural place and healed, and so that the hairs do not touch the eye.
But the cautery with medicine burns this is what you should instruct the patient to do: pluck out the hairs until they are elongated and healed, and then make a piece of fabric in the shape of a myrtle leaf.
Here's a line-by-line translation of the given text:
And place the medicine on the sore and press it slightly, without letting go until the patient feels the bite of the medicine, for the bite is in them like fire.
And when you perceive that they have felt the bite, then release the medicine and moisten it again with your finger; when the bite ceases, then reapply the medicine and wash the wound with water; and then consider if you see the eyelid already lifted as if washed away by the constriction of fire or incision, for then it is good; and if not, repeat the application of the medicine on the spot where you did not previously apply it, and do not stop until your operation is completed and the wound is contracted.
Then apply a bandage around the joint until the swelling of the inflammation is removed, and then cure it with a healing ointment or another one until it is healed.
And it is necessary for you to perform your operation with vigilant diligence so that none of the medicine falls into the wound, and if after several days the eyelid is softened and some hairs grow in the wound, then repeat your medicine on the spot where the eyelid is softened, and precisely as you did at the beginning, and then envelop it until it is healed.
And this is the form of myrtle leaf.
And know that the soles of men are differentiated according to their size and smallness, and therefore your treatment is made accordingly.
And do not hide the path of righteousness from those who study this art.
Chapter XVII.
About the cauterization of a fistula in the tear duct of the eye.
When you cure a fistula with the water that we have mentioned in the division of diseases and your treatment does not work, then you must cauterize it in this manner: command the patient to place his head on your knee, and let some servant hold the patient's head between your hands so that it is not moved or shaken by the patient's head.
Then place cotton dipped in egg white or in pigeon droppings over his eye.
And then ignite the cautery, which looks like this:
It should be hollow, in the shape of a reed or a vulture's feather, with one end made into the cautery.
And if you wish, it may also penetrate to the other end. "And if you wish it to be sorted in this way, attempt.
"But nonetheless, that which is hollow is better for the healing work.
"Then press on the fistula if it is open, and draw from it sanity and dryness. "And if it is not open, then open it and extract the putrefaction from it.
"Then place over it the cautery which should be well-lit, and with that the healing hand a little below the cautery of the heel towards the parting of the nose, so that your hand does not err or the patient is disturbed, and then place the cautery on the bones of the heel and burn them.
"And thus, if at the beginning of your cautery you enter into the bones, it is good; and if not, then repeat the cautery once or twice, if necessary; and leave it like this for three days, and then place over that spot a bandage and surround it with drying ointment until it is healed.
"But if eleven days have passed and it is not healed, then place over it a sharp, corrosive medicine until the bone is exposed and scrape it according to what is appropriate in this chapter.
Here's a line-by-line translation of the provided text:
And if the fistula is healed with the water we mentioned from the cautery and treatment, it is good; but if not, then it is necessary to administer a tracheotomy through the nose and reduce the fistula to the cavity of the nose according to its proper place.
Chapter XVIII
On the Cautery of the Anal Fissure
Often these fissures occur in the lips, and more commonly in the lips of children.
Therefore, if you treat these fissures with the water we mentioned in the previous sections and your treatment is not effective, then apply the small-bladed cautery as follows:
And let its concavity be according to the subtlety of the blade.
Then carefully place that [cautery] in those fissures until it reaches the bottom of the fissures.
And then treat that with plasters until it is healed.

On the Cautery of a Fistula in the Mouth
When an abscess forms on the root of the uvula or the palate or between the teeth, and it swells, and then bursts, and becomes chronic, and a fistula is formed, and if you treat that and your treatment is not effective, then you should heat the cautery according to how much of it is received in the fistula, and then place the heated [cautery] into the hole of the fistula, and hold your hand until the hot iron reaches its bottom, and do this one or two times; then treat that with the water we mentioned for treatment until it is healed.
And so if the wound is cut and healed, it is good; otherwise, it is necessary to uncover the area and remove the decaying bones according to the chapter that will follow.
Chapter XX
On the cauterization of teeth and the softening of gums.
When the gums are softened by moisture and the teeth are rotten, and you cure them with medicines but they do not improve, then place the patient's head in your lap. And quickly light the cautery of the shape which will be shown below, so that you place the tip on the tooth and immediately insert the heated cautery into it, holding your hand a little in front of the patient so that he feels the heat of the fire reaching the root of the tooth.
Then raise your hand, and repeat the cauterization several times as needed.
And then the patient rinses his mouth with salt water and keeps it for an hour, and then stops it, because the rotten tooth is healed and the softened gum is strengthened and the corrupt moisture is dried out.
Chapter XXI
On the Cauterization of Toothache.
When tooth pain is due to coldness, or if there is a swelling or worm in it, and you do not heal it with medicine, then you must cauterize that area in two ways: either by cauterizing with cowhage, or by cauterizing with fire.
To cauterize with cowhage: take cowhage and grind it in an iron mortar, then take a piece of cloth and wrap it around the end of the tent (probe), next dip that into the ground cowhage, and place it on the painful tooth quickly until it is cauterized.
And repeat that process several times until the virtue of the fire reaches the root of the tooth.
And if you wish, dip wool or cloth in the aforementioned cowhage, and place it on the painful tooth, and then place heated iron on top until the iron reaches the marrow of the tooth's cavity.
However, the cauterization with fire is that you take care of the needle of brass or iron, and that in its center there be some thickness so that the sharpness of the fire does not reach the mouth of the patient.
And then heat the cautery in the shape it will take, and place it on the tooth, holding your hand until the cautery is cold; repeat this several times, for the pain will be lessened either that day or the next.
And it is necessary that the patient fills their mouth with good bedding and holds the cautery there for one hour, then spits it out; and this is the method of using the cautery.
And cauterize with whatever extremity you see fit according to your ability.
And this is the form of the cannula:
Chapter XXII
On the Cauterization of Hernias.
When hernias are caused by phlegm and cold humors and do not respond to digestive medicines, and you see that their digestion is slightly weakened, then you should ignite the cautery with the following shape, which has two openings: one for smoke to escape and the other for applying the cautery. Place the burning cautery on the hernia once, or twice if necessary, until it reaches the root of the hernia.
And if the hernia is small, then place the cautery according to the size of the hernia. Leave it for three days and then apply a cotton cloth soaked in bedding until what the fire has burned is removed.
And then treat it with ointments, poultices, and bandages until it is healed.

On cauterization for hoarseness of voice and constriction of the throat.
When moisture comes upon the channel of the lung, and especially when it is accompanied by coldness of constitution, then the patient should be evacuated at first with purgative medicines, and after that you must cauterize him in the depression of the throat.
And be careful not to go too deep with the cautery in the throat, nor burn more than a little of its cord.
And you should cauterize him again with another cautery at the joint of the neck in his last vertebra. And his cautery should be small according to the aforementioned manner.
And then care for him with the aforementioned water until he is cured.
Chapter 24.
On Cauterization for Lung Ailments and Cough.
When cough and lung ailment are due to cold moisture, and the patient has neither fever nor consumption, and it is an old ailment, then cauterize him with two cauteries on the furcula in the depressed places, slender and high; and with another cautery in the middle of the foot between two papillae; and let the cauteries be small according to the aforementioned form.
And if you wish, use the point of the cautery called "puncta" for your cauterization; the form of which precedes in the cauterization of ear pain.
And place points into those; and then treat that area with ointment as has been previously stated until it is healed.
And the cautery has three prongs, for cauterization with that; in one motion you can make three cauteries following this form:
**Chapter .25**
**On the Cautery of the Tympanum, Which is the Head of the Ear.**
When the head of the ear (tympanum) is dislocated due to slippery humidity and does not set back in its proper place during its return, you must first reduce the dislocation before it returns to normal, and then with a small movement it will be displaced as it should. As we have seen, the patient should first be placed on their back or side; then lift the handle located at the inner part of the tympanum to the outer parts with your left hand, if the joint is dislocated inward.
And then heat the cautery, which has two ends; this is its form:
And then cauterize the cord until it penetrates into the other side; and the figure of cautery will have four points.
And sometimes it is adjusted according to this count, and because there are eight cauteries.
And then place powdered salt on the cautery, and then make the patient rest quietly, and let the limb not be moved for any time until it is healed.
And if the dislocation is in the upper parts and it is done late, then cauterize the muscle with a pointed cautery or with small cauteries pricked, because the joint is confirmed and the moisture is removed and the patient is cured.
Chapter XXVI.
On the Cautery of the Stomach
When there is cold and excessive moisture in the stomach to the point that it forces the stomach from its place and multiplies raumas within it, and if you continue with the usual ways of care without success, then it is necessary for the patient to lie on their back, extend their hands and feet, and then cauterize them with three cauteries: one cautery below the feet, the size of a finger, with a pointed cautery, and with two cauteries below each side of the first cautery, so that the figure of the cautery is triangular; and it should be extended so that they are not too close together, for they will cause blistering.
And if the depth of the cautery is equal to two-thirds the thickness of a rope.
And let the figure of the cautery be according to this shape without addition. If you wish, cauterize with a large cautery in the middle of the stomach according to this shape; and this should be a circular cautery according to this shape:
And the stomach should be cauterized by piercing it at the point where this cautery is directed: and that you know how to place points on the stomach according to the amount you wish with a probe, and then cauterize those points; and then cure them with the preceding treatment until they are healed.
Chapter 27
On the hot cauterization of the foot.
When there is pain in the foot due to cold, humidity, or excessive flatulence that has disrupted its normal function and caused an overflow, and the patient is treated with the water we mentioned without any food, then it is necessary for the patient to be laid on their back with their head raised, and place three cauteries according to this shape and amount under the foot, below the hypochondria, where the man lies.
And let the space between each point be according to the thickness of the finger, and let the points be along the length of the body, straight.
And do not press too hard with the points.
And if the amount of water is less than half the width of a string, it should not be adjusted. If the patient is standing on their feet; and if they are not standing, then let them sit, who has already spread out their clothes, and raise their arms.
And to you it is possible to perform these points with a surgical knife, when you are skillful and careful in the art.
And be careful not to press too hard during cauterization, and let the width of the string be reduced so that the entire body is reduced and it enters into the intestines, because the string here is thin; and know this.
Chapter XXVIII.
On the Perforation of an Abscess in the Foot with a Cautery.
When you want to drain or incise an abscess in the foot and wish to know whether this abscess is in the flesh of the foot or in its membrane, then if it is in the flesh of the foot, the patient will experience heaviness and pain without sharpness.
And if it is in the tissue of the liver, with great and often painful acuteness, it can tire doctors of its care.
Therefore, it is necessary that the patient be turned onto their back; and then mark the location of the abscess with a pin; and then ignite the cautery which resembles a rag, the shape of which has been described on the previous page. And cauterize with that and the cautery until all the skin is burnt, until it reaches the bone, until there is a flow of pus.
And then treat him in the same way for other abscesses until he is cured.
And it is not necessary to use this type of cautery except for the one that has been studied in the art of medicine and with which many sick people have been cured; but this, having been tried a few times, has shown itself competent for this operation, nevertheless, leave that to us, it is better.
Chapter 29.
On the Cautery of Pleurisy.
The ancients said that the cautery of pleurisy should be done in this manner: take a long, dry rush, thin and about the size of a finger.
This text appears to be describing a process involving the use of heated instruments (cauteries) on various parts of the body. Here's a line-by-line translation:
And it is not necessary that you hold the cautery with your hand, but rather let it be in the open part of the cord in action.
And some ancient authors say that there are some men who use a cautery similar to a ray and an iron instrument, and they place it in the area between the ribs until it reaches the abscess and the pus is expelled, as we have said in the case of the foot abscess.
But in this perforation with the cautery, there is danger, for one could die immediately if it happens to puncture a fistula that has not healed.
Chapter 30.
On the Cauterization of the Spleen.
When you treat spleen disease with the methods we have mentioned for treatment in the division, and your treatment does not help, then cauterize it in three ways, all of which are correct. One way is to make three or four cauteries along the length of the spleen according to the figure of the cauteries of the foot, the figures of which have preceded.
And let there be a space between each cautery the size of a finger or slightly more, and the method of cauterization should be the same as we have said for foot cauteries.
And do not press your hand with the cautery; let the patient be awake on his back.
And another way to cauterize is that you heat the cautery having two openings, which we have called in the chapter on dislocation of the muscle, and raise the chain that is at the level of the spleen to where the left patient lies.
And let your elevation with which you raise the chain be according to the length of the body, so that the cauteries are made according to the size of the body.
And then introduce the two openings, burning well, into that one through which you will pass the chain from the other side.
And then withdraw the cautery; and thus four cauteries are made.
And if you wish, cauterize with a cautery having three openings.
And then care for the cautery since it has stopped throwing sparks after too many days, because it is more convenient than the other previously mentioned causes in the treatment.
Chapter .31
On the Cauterization of Dropsy Patients
Do not perform cauteries on dropsey patients, but rather on those with swelling specifically.
When you are treating a patient with dropsy using the healing methods we have mentioned in the section and your treatment is not effective, then it is necessary to cauterize with four cauteries around the navel, one cautery on the stomach, another on the groin, another on the spleen, two cauteries between the shoulder blades of the back, one cautery on the right foot, and another on the stomach. And the depth of the cauterization should be appropriate to the thickness of the skin.
And immediately after the cautery is opened, so that it may release heat for a long time.
And you should not evacuate the patient of treatment immediately after the cautery with water, because two intentions must be added to it, and healing will be hastened for him with the help of healing.
The shape of the cautery with which the abdomen is cauterized should be nail-shaped, as its form was previously stated, and it is that one with which the back is cauterized that should be olive-shaped, according to its form.
Chapter .xxxii
Of Cauterization of Feet and Thighs.
When the feet are swollen with dropsy and filled with water, it is necessary to cauterize the soles of the feet in the space between the fourth and little toes, and raise your hand with the cautery and do not turn it; and immediately raise your hand, and do not return it completely, because the water will reappear.
Here's my translation of the given sentence: And place the cautery according to the length of the cushion: one at the top and another in the middle of the cushion; and on each cushion two cauteries.
And leave the wound open without treatment for a long time so that no water comes out of it.
And treat them with those causes which we have mentioned.
Chapter 33.
On the Cautery of the Abdomen.
When the abdomen is affected by cold and humidity, which weaken the strengths, particularly the digestive and retentive strengths located in the stomach and intestines, it is treated with various methods of care and avoidance. Sometimes the patient may need a cautery to manifest their strength; then cauterize them with a large cautery on their own stomach, as previously mentioned for stomach cautery, with circular cautery and four subtle cauteries around the navel, and a subtle needle-like cautery; and a cautery on the bladder, either one large or two.
And if the humidities are excessive and the patient can tolerate it, then cauterize them on the navel and on the intestines, and place two cauteries very close together on the stomach near the groin, for this is a perfect cure from which there will be no error.

"On the Cauterization of Ancient Hemorrhoids.
When hemorrhoids are caused by nature due to thick humors or corrupted humidity, and they are treated with the water we mentioned in the division but do not provide the desired cure, then cauterize with three cauteries on the pus below the small of the back and with a triangular, small, and thin cautery above the navel for two times.
And if you suspect that his stomach is chilled and his food is not properly cooked, and his face often appears pale, then cauterize him with a large cautery on the stomach as previously mentioned; and with one cautery on the spleen, and with another cautery on his gallbladder with a nail-shaped cautery. Leave the cautery open for some time, and then treat him internally until he is healed.

"On Cauterization of Atheyl Near Their Incision.
When you cut atheyl, then heat the cautery that resembles a ray. Then introduce that heated [cautery] into the cut atheyl and complete your work until the cautery reaches the opening of the vein from which the blood comes.
And do this once or twice, because if the veins are too full, then cauterize each of them as we have described, and then treat them with water that you will apply to them from the ointments until they are healed.
And if you cauterize with a large cautery on the skin, it is more effective in helping.

About the cauterization of fistulas that are made by nature in the divisions of it.
When nature does not obey the work which we have recounted in its place, and the patient is frightened by this, let him be healed with a cautery. ‌
Therefore, when there is any vein fistula in nature that is old and corrupt blood and humors come out of it, then the most worthy thing to do is to probe it with a fine needle, and then know the quantity of its depth with the aforementioned needle.
Then heat the cautery that resembles a ray. And then place this heated cautery into this fistula, according to the quantity in which it intersects the needle.
And repeat with the cautery on that place until all the corrupt flesh is burned once or twice or three times, according to your need.
And beware of burning the nerves or veins; or if there is a fistula (abnormal connection) going to the bladder or intestines, then beware of all those places; and do not do this unless the fistula is in a fleshy area where you think it will not penetrate.
Then heal the place so that it may be healed.
And if the place is sealed and the materials removed from it remain thus for a long time, then know that it has been entirely healed.
And if the materials are not removed from it, then know that it is penetrating or in the presence of corrupt bones, or this comes from those causes which will be recalled in their place.

On Cauterization of the Nose.
When there is pain in the nose due to cold or excessive windiness, and for this reason the patient's sense of smell is dulled, then it is necessary to cauterize the nose with a cautery on each nostril with a small needle of which the memory is requested.
And carefully perform the second cautery with a small needle after that, so that there will be three lines of cauteries, and thus they will be more effective in healing.

About the Cauterization of the Bladder.
When there is debility and softening in the bladder due to coldness and moisture, such that the patient cannot hold urine, then cauterize the area just below the bladder, where the pubic hair begins. Do this with a pointed cautery, first on the right side, and then on the left side of the patient.
The length of each cautery should be according to the depth of the pubic bone; and then cauterize with a pointed cautery in the area just below the back, or with two cauteries if necessary.
And let the cautery be light as needed.

About the Cauterization of the Womb.
When there is coldness and moisture in the womb, which prohibits conception, and the menses are corrupt and delayed, and there is pain during menstruation, then it is necessary to cauterize that area with three cauteries around the navel, as we have said about the cautery of the bladder; and also cauterize below the back, or with two cauteries, and let the cautery be light. getElementById( "answer_4" ).innerHTML = "About the Cauterization of the Womb.

About the cautery for the dislocation of the ankle.
When moist humors are infused into the ankle area, causing it to move from its proper place, and the sign of this is that the bone appears elongated when compared to the other one. And the place of dislocation is found where there is swelling.
Therefore, you should cauterize the patient on the ankle area with a circular-shaped cautery, and you will have made sure to test within the circumference of that area as it is rounded, so that the ankle bone falls in the middle of the circle.
And let the cautery used be of the same shape as that used for stomach cautery. ờ Capitol .xlj.
And if this cautery is not available to you, then cauterize with three cauteries using a large olive-shaped cautery.
And the cautery should be done according to the size of the entire swelling; and then take care that it is healed within.
Chapter 41
About the cautery for the sciatic vein.
When pain occurs in the ankle area and is caused by cold and moisture, the patient is treated with the water we have mentioned, but if it does not work and is chronic, then you should rid the patient of thick humors using foul pills or artificial pills; and then cauterize them.
And the manner of the cautery in this case is according to two methods: a cautery with burning medicines, or a cautery with fire.
According to two known methods, one of which is to cauterize the patient on the wide part with three triangular cauteries in this manner; and do so to a good depth. And let the space between each cautery be the width of the thumb, whether the cauteries are small or large.
However, sometimes place two cauteries in the middle on top of the previous ones because there are four cauteries.
And if you wish, cauterize with the circle which is used in the cautery of ankle dislocation, which should be a continuous circle and burn the tip of the entire heel.
And this is the manner of cautery in gout when pain is attached to the ankle and not extended into the thigh.
But if it is extended into the thigh, then cauterize that with two cauteries on the thigh in the place where the patient feels pain; and with one cautery on the knee four fingers below the navel.
And if you are using a surgical knife as a cautery tool, then the depth of the incision should be according to the thickness of the tendon.
And if the patient indicates that the pain is spreading to another area of the foot, then cauterize that area as well with a cautery tool in three points, or four, or more if necessary.
And if the patient indicates that the pain is extending to the side of the bone towards the thigh, then cauterize that area with a surgical knife.
And be careful during all cauterizations that you do not go too deep with the cautery, to avoid burning nerves or large blood vessels, which could cause harm or complications for the patient.
And I have seen some who cauterized on the ankle and went too deep during the cauterization, causing the flesh to swell until the tumor reached the foot, which then became perforated and completely rotten. And soon after, they suffered severe abdominal pain, and then death followed.
And if the pain is present in two different parts at the same time, cauterize each one according to this manner.
And the wise have said about the cauterization of water: make it resemble a circle of iron, of which the circumference is half the size of a palm; and let its holes be according to the thickness of a fingertip or less.
Certainly! Let's break down the translation of this passage line by line.
Approach the fire and be heated within it until you turn red and emit sparks. Then place [the heated object] on the affected area of the ankle, with the patient lying on their back. Therefore, cauterize it three times in a row with a round cautery in one session.
And then let it be for three days; and then cover it with a poultice, leaving the wound open for too many days; and then treat it with ointments until it is healed.
Says Al-Zahrawi: O sons, we have used this type of cautery little because of the fear of its aftercare, and because few people are found who know how to care for it.
But from these other cauteries, he who has suffered them, and finds the place affected by them.
But cauterize with adherent medicines, making two circles having a perforated thimble in which the tip of an iron nail should go; let the length of the wall be two nuts or whatever you want them to be.
And if the space which is between each of them is equal to the thickness of a finger; and let them be opened below and above, and let them contain themselves between them according to this form:
Here's a line-by-line translation of the given text:
And then raise your hand with the instrument and wipe away the hot water from all the wounds with cool water.
And then let it remain for three days and place a border on top until the blackness of the burn is removed, and let it remain like this for several more days, and afterward the scar will form; this is done in treatment.
And then treat it with ointment until it heals.
And if the pain is spread throughout the thigh or leg, make for him a statue containing water, just as it is done in the wound equally.
And this is the manner of hot water, and I have already written about it in the treatise on the preparation of medicines. Recipe for alkali and lime, one part each of both, grind them together and place in a new clay pot, the bottom of which has been pierced by a small hole, according to the amount that enters into it.
And place under the bottom of this pot another pot filled with water, and pour over that alkali and lime cold water which covers them by about an inch, and after compressing them well with your hand, let the water that drips from it descend into the lower clay pot.
And then adjust all that water, and pour it over another live coal and another renewed alkali, because at this time it will have very strong acidity, which is administered in many medical operations and in the cauterization of other limbs, because the operation involves fire.
And among the medicines with which one is cauterized, such as terebinth and honeyed wine, there should also be alkali mixed with soap.
And Gaul tells of an ancient man's operation and treatment with which pain in the anus and sciatica is cured, and he greatly praises it, saying that no other treatment is necessary, and because it is cured once as he reports, for he takes a bath and is free from that immediately.
And it is that a green willow branch be taken, and if a green one is not found, a fresh fig branch should be taken; let it be crushed with a little salt and placed on the anus where there is pain, or on the hip, or on the thigh, and bound.
And it should be left in place for three hours or as long as the patient feels relief from the pain.
And then put that person in a bath, and when their body is reddened, take them out of the water and place them on the ground, because the pain ceases and they are healed.
And know that one should not use cautery with these remedies except when evacuating the body.
However, Escorides said that when the string vein in a goat's cut is cauterized, it benefits greatly; and let the cautery be done in this manner: let wool be taken and soaked in old oil, and placed between the toes of the foot and between the bones.
And then take a dry goat's cut and burn it with fire until it turns into charcoal; and then place it on the wool, and let it sit there until it is spread out. And then repeat this process, and do not stop doing so until the feeling of the bite reaches the water and the pain subsides.
And this manner of cautery is called "cautery of cows.

On the cauterization of back pain.
Sometimes pain occurs in the back due to various reasons, such as a fall or a blow, or excessive evacuation, and for similar reasons, due to the influx of cold, damp matter.
And burn with a cautery only in this specific type of injury, which is caused by an outpouring of cold matter.
Therefore, proceed to evacuate the patient with pills of bitter herbs and similar ones, made on the back where the pain is located in three lines according to his size. After that, cauterize each line ten times or more, depending on the patient's tolerance and the power of the medicine.
And the cauterization should be done with a pointed cautery.
And if you wish, cauterize with three or four needle-like cauteries in the middle of the line like this:

And so when you see this and want to prevent it, then cauterize that area with a circular cautery like this: That he take the cautery over all parts of the spine equally.
And if you wish, cauterize around the spine with a pointed cautery two or three lines. And let the points be close together.
And then heal the place until it is healed with that which we have said.
But beware that the cautery not be administered in a swelling caused by a nerve spasm.

Of the Cauterization of Gout and Joint Pain
When joint pain is caused by cold humors that infiltrate each part of the body, and when pains occur in the feet, it is customary for doctors to call this gout specifically.
And therefore when gout caused by cold is cured with the method of care and the pains are not removed, then burn with cautery.
And it is that you cauterize there an appropriate evacuation around the joint of the foot with many cauteries.
And let it be cauterized olive-shaped, and this is its form:
And if it is necessary to make points on the surface of the foot, then do so with a pointed cautery.  :) And if the pains rise into the teeth or other joints, and this often happens, then cauterize that area with three or four cauteries of all parts using this olive-shaped cautery.
And if it is necessary to use these cauteries, then cauterize the area and do not press too hard with your hand on the cautery beforehand; only place the tip of the chain.
And if the pains rise into the tooth and the back, then administer the cautery that we mentioned in its chapter.
And if the pains are only in the hands, and it is called "suagra," then prick around the fingernails as they turn, pricking along those two lines.
And if pains remain in the fingers, then prick around the fingernails on each finger and at the base of the hand.
And if the pains rise to the shoulders or the arms within a few days, then cauterize each of those areas from all sides with helpers.
And do not evacuate the patient with good management and reception of medicine, for if good management is done and phlegm is evacuated with this cautery, he will be healed, God helping him.
Chapter 45
On Cauterizing Wounds
When there is a wound in the entrails and the intestines come out before the navel, it should be treated as follows: Firstly, order the patient to fast on that day and use lenitive remedies to prevent the opening from becoming larger.
Then follow the patient between your hands on his back, and command him to remain still until he is fully healed or the intestine or hernia appears.
Then return to the patient with your instruments and try to close the wound on the pubic bone, using as a sign the extremity which is similar to half a circle at the upper parts of the body.
Then heat the cautery, which has this shape:
until it is very red and throws off sparks. Then return the intestine or hernia to its cavity, and place your hand over the area to prevent the intestine from coming out.
You have already opened the space between the patient's thighs, placed a cushion under them, another servant on their legs, and another on their chest, holding their hands.
And then place the cautery on that sign with your hand holding the cautery straight, and go in such a way that you can reach the bones of the penis to the middle of the groin; and do it again with the other side if you haven't reached the bone in the first attempt.
And observe carefully the movement of the intestine during your cauterization, to avoid burning it and causing death or other great harm to the patient.
And know that when you use the cautery, do not touch the bones, lest you render your operation ineffective.
And it is desirable for the cautery of children to be delicate according to their size and measure.
Then care for the area of cauterization for three days with bandages until the scab of the fire is removed.
Then care for him with other ointments until he is healed.
And let the patient lie on his back for forty days, until the site and the wound are sealed.
And it is necessary that you provide him with nourishment according to the length of time of his cure, so that his stomach does not swell and his intestines do not come out due to the effort of healing.
And when he wishes to rise after forty days, then administer gently made liniment, and let him have that for another forty days.
And let him be spared from work and excessive eating and drinking, and loud voices, for when he follows this entire regime of healing, he will surely be healed.
Here's the translation of your sentence:
And already some have said that the rupture should be cauterized with a triangular cautery according to this shape, because it is indicated with a probe.
And a line is placed that goes through the latitude in the back above the rupture, and another line above it; and place your hand with a pointed cautery, but the first cautery is lighter and better.
Chapter XLVI.
On the Cauterization of Hernia.
When in some members pain occurs due to injury or impact and that pain persists for a long time and you cannot cure it with medicine, then you should cauterize with a pointed cautery.
And the cautery for every member should be according to its size and smallness, its strength and weakness, the location of the hernia and its pain.
Therefore, if it is healed by the first cautery, that is good; but if not, then repeat the cautery on it; for it is customary for those pains to be punctured from one member to another adjacent to it, so you must catch them with the cautery until the patient is cured.
Chapter XLVII.
"On the Cautery of Leprosy.
"Some lepers are treated with cautery to great benefit, especially if the type of leprosy is caused by the putrefaction of black bile and melancholy.
"Therefore, when you want to cauterize this, consider if the leprosy is common and has been treated with the water we mentioned in the division, and do not delay, lest it spreads throughout the patient's body and all his complexion. Then cauterize that spot on the head with five cauteries: one in the middle of the head, and the second below it, even to the hairline; and two on the temples; and one at the back, either on the nape or on the neck.
"Finish with your hand by pressing the cauteries a little into the bone, making a slight impression, and from this the scabs should be displaced, so that the expiration of gross vapors is relieved in him; and cauterize on the spleen as needed.
"And if the leprosy has already spread over the patient and appears manifestly, then you should cauterize with those cauteries that we have mentioned for the head; and on the tip of the nose with one cautery; and on each cheek with two cauteries; and on each shoulder of the neck with two cauteries; and on six cauteries on each shoulder blade of the back, and one large one near the spine, and one on the spine, and two on the ankles, and one on each ankle, and two on the wrists, and one on each wrist, and two on the elbows, and two on the shoulders, and two on the biceps, and two on the forearms; and cauterize that on all the joints of the fingers of the hands and feet, and on each heel of his feet, and on the soles of his feet.
And be careful of the nerves that are on the sole of the foot so that you do not burn them.
And sometimes it is cauterized with a cautery on the bone of the heel and with another on the mouth of the stomach, and with another on the foot.
And know that the more closely you apply the cautery, the more it is helpful and beneficial; and know that the patient does not feel pain from the cautery itself, as they do with their servants, because their body has already been numbed.
And it is necessary that the cauteries be large or small according to the members and the joints, as previously specified in the tools' descriptions.
And then cure the cautery with wheat flour mixed with honey and with another remedy until it is healed.
Chapter 48.
On the Cauterization of Coma.
When a limb is numbed or asleep and is treated with medicines, oils, and plasters, and it does not heal, then you cauterize that numb limb with a cautery according to the size of the limb, whether large or small.
And let your cautery enter the depth of the tendon slightly. And then cure that with an ointment until it is healed.
And in some cases, some numbness which should be at the hands and feet, at the vertebrae of the back, and by the exit points of the nerves that move that limb, and the numbness is removed.
But do not presume to do this unless one is knowledgeable in the anatomy of the limbs and the paths of the nerves moving throughout the body.
Chapter 49.
On cauterizing carbuncles that form.
When a carbuncle is old and you do not apply any of the ointments of medicine to it, then cauterize that with a pointed cautery for a short time according to the size of the codon until its whiteness and color are removed and its color has changed.
And then cure that with a mixture of vetch flour and lentils with rose oil and arnica leaves, and with pigeon blood or sparrow blood, each should be one part and all mixed together, and then a cloth should be soaked in it and placed on the area until it is healed.
Chapter 50.
"About the cauterization of crabs.
When cancer begins and you want to stop it, then cauterize the area with a circular cautery along its circumference as it turns.
And the wise have said that it should be cauterized with the last cautery in the middle of the spot; but I have not seen this, because I fear that it will become ulcerated, and I have already seen this happen some times.
And it is more proper to cauterize the circumference with a circle as we have said, or with many cauteries.
Chapter 2.
About the cauterization of abscesses.
When an abscess is delayed in maturing, and this happens because of the superfluity that causes it, or due to the patient's condition, as they are old and infirm, with little blood, or because of the time, and you want to hasten the maturation of the abscess; then cauterize around it with many small puncturing cauteries; and let it rest so that it will mature faster.
But if you want to perforate it with a cautery, then heat the cautery whose shape matches that of the abscess; and place it in the middle of the abscess until it penetrates the cord.
And if you cauterize in that place which is lower, it is to relieve the arm's body; then attend to the inside that it may be healed.
Chapter 52.
On the Cautery of Ulcers.
An ulcer is a corruption that moves through the limb, consuming it like fire consuming dry wood.
Therefore, if you see that ulcer in a place where you can apply cautery with fire, then heat the iron cautery until it is very hot, and make it large or small according to what is appropriate for the place of the ulcer.
Then cauterize the entire area until you have completely eradicated all the corruption and nothing remains of it.
Then let it rest for three days, and place on the cauterized areas a salve made of oil mixed with sulfur until all the scabs have been completely removed and all the corruption has healed.
Then treat it with flesh-regenerating ointment.
But if after three days you see that the flesh has grown healthy and there is no corruption, that is good. However, if not, then reapply the cautery to the areas where the corruption remains.
And it is often treated with sharp medicine, because that is similar to cauterization. But nevertheless, cautery with fire is a more effective remedy.
And I have already said the treatment of it with sharp medicine in the division, and therefore take that when you will begin the procedure.
Chapter .53
On Cautery for Wounds and Similar Conditions
Often it is noticed that under the affected part of the foot called a nail, there is a large, deep lesion which injures the foot; and these are treated in two ways: with fire cautery and with hot water cautery.
However, fire cautery is performed by heating the concave end of the cautery tool, similar to a vulture's beak, which should be made of iron according to the size of the entire lesion from all sides, and should have fine edges.
Then place that heat on the lesion, and then move your hand with the cautery around the edge of the lesion until the cautery reaches the depth of the lesion. And let it sit for three days until it begins to form a scab. "And then apply a plaster made of crushed wild mallow and salt to the area, and leave the plaster on for one night, because this will remove it from its roots.
"And then cure the area with an ointment made from fresh meat until it is healed.
"And if it does not convert, and similar things often happen on the surface of the body, especially in the hands and feet, then you should apply cautery with water to those areas. You should take a small tube made of tin, iron, or crow's feather, and place it on the nail; then pour a small amount of hot water into the tube, hold your hand over it, and rotate the tube with the pressure of your hand. Press the edge of the tube against the root of the nail, and find that the hot water will reach the core of the root; wait for the patient to feel the burn of the hot water for about an hour, then remove it, because the nail with its roots will be removed.
"And do the same for all other similar conditions until you have addressed all of them on their bodies.
And now treat those abscesses whose causes are eradicated by the water of ointments that generate in the flesh.
Chapter 34.
On the Cautery of Tremors.
When someone has a tremor due to cold in the nerves or fever of a cold cause, or for any similar reason, then you should cauterize them with four cauteries or five on the vertebrae of the back, one cautery between each vertebra; and with a cautery on their feet, and on their stomach, with an olive-shaped cautery.
And the tremor will subside and hasten the healing of the cold disease.
Chapter 50.
On the Cautery for Accidental Whiteness in the Body
When there are white spots on the body and pustules that are made of thick, corrupt material, then at the beginning, when it appears, it should be cauterized over the top of the fistula with a fine cautery, the tip of which is extended with fire; or with long eristology rays; or with a lenticular cautery.
And sometimes it is cauterized at the beginning of its eruption in this manner; and they are not considered serious, and the superfluity that causes them is broken up, and heals from them.
However, it is necessary that this be done after an evacuation with phlebotomy.
Chapter 56.
Of the Cautery for Flux of Blood by Artery Incision.
Tropes seen indicate a flux of blood from an artery that has been cut, or from the incision of an abscess or a cautery on the member, and similar appearances. And it is difficult for this to remain unnoticed.
Therefore, when this happens to someone, you should immediately cover the orifice of the artery with your hand and press strongly on it until the flow of blood stops beneath your finger, so that nothing comes out.
Then place in the fire some olive-sized and large cauteries, by the count of twelve, and blow on them until they are very hot.
Then take one of these, either small or large, according to the place and wound in which the artery is cut; place it quickly on that vein as soon as you have removed your finger, and hold the cautery until the blood is sealed and restricted.
And if the blood continues to be expelled from the orifice of the artery when you remove your finger and extract the cautery, then immediately take another cautery from those which are prepared in the fire, and do not cease doing this one after another until the bleeding is stopped.
"And be careful not to burn the nerves that are here, so that another illness does not come upon the patient.
"And know that when blood flows from an artery, it is not possible to stop the bleeding directly, especially if the artery is large, except by one of these four methods: with a pointed cautery as mentioned before, or by extraction if it has not been extracted yet; for if it has been extracted, the extremities are better burned and the blood flow is reduced. Or it can be tied with thread or a ligature with strong tension, or medications that have the virtue of stopping the blood flow can be applied; and they should be tightened with a cushion and decent pressure.
"But he who administers a ligature and binds it with cloth or by the position of heating causes and similar things, should do so only later.
"But if this must be done for someone and neither the physician nor medicine is present, then press with the thumb over the opening of that vein as we have said, and ensure that there is great pressure on it to stop the blood from the main part of the wound, and do not remove the thumb from the artery; and pour cold water over the artery until the blood is congealed and thickened; and be sure to seek a cautery or necessary medicine.
"De incisio e perforacio e ventozas e de fleubotomia e de plaguas e de lor semblants" translates to "Of incisions and perforations, veins, bloodletting, wounds, and their similarities.
"Ja havem dit en le primier capitol tota malautia en la qual cauteri am foc es convenient e am medicina comburent, e las occasios e las causas de lu, e les instrumentz en aquels necessaris am las formas dels cauteris; e he ordenatz les capitols de la subiranetat del cap entro als pes" translates to "We have already discussed in the first chapter all ailments for which cautery with fire is suitable and beneficial, along with their causes and occasions, as well as the necessary instruments and forms of cauterization. I have arranged the chapters according to the body's hierarchy from the head down to the feet.
"E yeu procesire en aquest capitol per aquela meteysa guisa, per que sia alliujat lo querent aquo, lahoras sobre aquo que aura demandat" translates to "And I will proceed in this chapter in the same manner, so that the seeker may be relieved of what he has asked about.
"E denant que yeu comence aquo, cove, fils, que aprenguatz que en aquest capitol es per terror aquo que es en le capitol primier de cauterizacio" translates to "And before I begin this, it is necessary, my son, that you learn that in this chapter there are errors similar to those in the first chapter on cautery.
And because great caution is required, for in the operation described in this chapter there are many things to be careful of, such as evacuation with blood, in which life resides; you should perform aspiration of the vein or incision over the abscess, opening of the fistula or purification of the wound, or extraction of an arrow or removal of a stone and their similar procedures. And for all these you are accompanied by fear and trembling, and in the worst cases death.
And I warn you that nothing of which there is doubt should fall upon you, because in some cases you must handle the sick with many different diseases. And among them there are some who will go away with their illness and it will be easy for you to let him die, this because of the violence with which he finds his illness, and because of the length of his illness, and with the illness comes fear that signifies death.
And among those is one who gives you his goods and property, expecting health from you; but his illness is fatal.
Therefore, you should not consent to that which comes to you in this way; and your caution should be greater than your need and greed; and do not presume any cause except for certain knowledge that verifies what is right for you, and at which a successful outcome will follow.
Here's the translation of the given sentence:
"O children, may God breathe His understanding into you and never take away your direction and protection, for that is in His hands.
"And I have arranged this chapter, divided into chapters as previously stated in the chapter on cautery, about caring for the head down to the feet, so that you may be relieved of what you ask and require.
"First Chapter.
"On the treatment of water that is contained in the head of children.
"Know that this illness, which is often seen in children, comes from childbirth and when the nurse tightly binds the infant's head without proper space.
"And sometimes it occurs due to a hidden cause that is not known.
"However, I have only seen this illness in children; and all those whom I saw died from it, and thus I have seen a useless task in them.
"And I have seen that a child whose head was full of water had his head always swollen in such a way that he could not put anything on it due to the size of his head, and the moisture increased until he died.
And this humidity is either added between the skin and the bone, or it is added below the bone on the joint.
Because if the operation in that case is where the humidity is between the skin and the bone and the abscess is small, then you should cut into the middle of the head with a fissure in the length, and the length of the fissure should be two nights long so that the humidity can flow out. And this is how to make the spatula:
Therefore, if the humidity is greatly increased and the abscess is large, then there are two incisions in this manner:
And if the humidity is below the bone, the sign of it is that you see the fontanel open on all sides and the water is squeezed out when you press there with your strong hand from within, and nothing is hidden from you. You must cut into the middle of the head with three incisions in this manner:
Then extract all the humidity through the incision; and strengthen the incisions with cloths and poultices; and bind it above with vinegar and oil for five days, then remove the bandages and treat the wound with compresses and ointments, strengthening the head equally; and feed the patient with dry food of little humidity until the member is comforted and healed.
This sentence seems to be discussing another method of incision in medical procedures, likely related to draining or treating abscesses. Let's break it down:
And observe that you do not cut the artery, lest blood flows out and the patient dies due to this bleeding along with a loss of bodily fluids.
Chapter Two.
When there is an ancient cataract or tumor in the eyes or feet, and it is not suitable to use medical treatments, then the last recourse for this condition is the cutting of those two arteries.
Therefore, when you want to cut those arteries, have the patient raise their head, and then rub the area with a rough cloth so that the arteries are visible; and then strengthen the patient's neck with some cloth; and then consider where the vein pulses; and press on both sides of the areas near the ears until they disappear in some cases.
Then sign the area with an X over the artery, and then cut each one with a scalpel that has been divided into sharp points for incision, reaching as far as the bone, and let it be in this manner along the length of the head.
And if you wish, insert the speculum below the artery and then cut through it at its partitions above.
And let the length of the incision be two fingerbreadths long, because when a vein is cut, blood exits with a pulsating flow, which jumps out frequently.
But if the artery does not appear immediately, then you must measure from the ear the amount of space equal to three fingerbreadths, and then make a probe with a sounding instrument, and find the bone.
And the amount of blood that should be released is one-sixth of a pint, and it should be drawn out gently, neither more nor less, and all this depends on the strength of the patient and the fullness of his artery.
And then consider the wound, and therefore if there remains any cause for inflammation on the bone, then cut it open so that a hot abscess does not form.
And then strengthen the wound with soft cloths and linen bandages, and then treat it with ointments until it is healed.
Chapter III
On the removal of arteries located in the temples.
When someone has an ancient migraine or acute headache due to humid and bitter qualities in the temples, or a vehement and similar ancient sore, and if it is treated with medical remedies but does not improve, then we have recourse to these extraneous illnesses: cauterization of the temples, as we have shown.
And the method of this operation and extraction is that the patient should shave the hair from their temples; they should see the apparent artery in the temple as it has been shown to you by its pulsation, for it is hidden except in a few people due to the intensity of coldness.
And if it is hidden from you, then have the patient's neck strengthened with some cloth; and then rub the area with a rough cloth or evaporate the area with hot water until the artery appears clearly to you. And then take the spatula, the shape of which is like this: Then you should scrape the artery with that [spatula] easily until you reach the artery; and then pour onto it oil or extract it into a small part of the superior area, until you remove it from the skin and reveal it from all the tunics that are beneath it.
Here's a translation of the given text:
And then evacuate some of the blood, approximately one to three pints.
And if the wound is large, then it is necessary for you to bind it in two places with a double-strong thread or rope, and do not allow it to become infected before the wound heals, and thus prevent blood loss.
And then cut away the excess that is between the two ligaments; do this at that time or shortly thereafter.
And if you wish, cauterize it with a cautery to the bone using a lancet until the edges are fully incised, and it will remain in place as if the same work was done.
And it is better work if the patient has a fever or is suffering from inflammation; because cautery helps to eliminate dampness, and therefore it is more beneficial for healing.
And it is necessary to quickly clean the wound by filling the cavity with cotton wool and placing well-prepared powders on it, and then cure it with dry medications that promote the growth of flesh and bandages until it heals.
And if during the operation bleeding from the wound occurs again, then you should hasten to stop that blood, either with a cautery or by filling the cavity with cotton wool and pressing firmly until the bleeding stops. Sure, let's translate this sentence step by step:
This text appears to describe a procedure involving bloodletting using a technique called cautery. Here's a line-by-line translation:
And this is how the cautery is made:
And it should be as sharp as two needles. However, if it is less sharp than two needles, it is better because if they are as sharp as two needles, they cut the flesh too quickly.
Therefore, since there is some thickness to them, the heat of the fire remains in them and the flesh is cut more gently.
And this method is better for all procedures and gentler.
And the space between the two needles should be as thick as a finger.
Chapter Four.
On the care of bodies affected by sharp and acrid tears from the eyes.
When tears are acidic and the body's veins are affected, especially those on the forehead, and no medical treatment has been applied, sometimes the patient's face turns red and they feel as if ants are crawling on their forehead. The eyes of such patients are weakened, so wet that even their eyelashes are dissolved, and the eyelids are scarred by the sharpness of the tears. In treating these conditions, ancient physicians used this operation and called it "passa".
And it is that you command the patient to shave the hair that is on their forehead, and then incise three equally spaced cuts on the forehead according to the length of the forehead. And if the length of the cut is two digits: let one cut be equally distant from the length of the nose in the middle of the forehead, and the second according to the length a little below the eyebrows that are on the tear ducts, and the third on the other side.
And beware of the incision of the arteries that are on both sides, and extend your hand from the continuation of both jaws. And if the space between each cut is three digits long.
And if you have a sponge or clean dry cloths with which to dry the blood.
Then insert the spatula with two sharp points, of which this is the form of the incision for it: that begins from the temples to the second cut. With it, remove all the skin that is between two cuts and the bone that is above it, and then do this from the middle cut to the second cut. And then stretch yourself into this space and insert through the first incision another time an additional instrument which is called a scalpel, sharp on one side and not sharp on the other.
And place the sharp edge of that blade against the flesh adjacent to the tendon, and the flat side against the bone. Insert it until it reaches the middle fissure, and cut with it all the vessels that descend from the head to the heels.
But let the incision be continued so that it appears at the tendon's end, and then make another incision in the middle fissure to enter into the other fissure.
And when a sufficient quantity of blood has flowed out, press on the places where the clots are found.
And then place in each fissure a piece of old cloth, and place on top of those poultices soaked in wine and oil and vinegar, and ensure that no putrid abscess develops.
And on the third day remove the bandage and administer a large enema of hot water or tea, and then treat it with an ointment made from basil, rose oil, and other ingredients until the wounds are healed.
Certainly! Please provide me with the text for "Capitol .v." that you would like translated into English.
Here's a possible translation of "De la cura de lagramas per catartz e als huels descendentz de las partidades edintz del cap":
When some sudden and continuous diarrhea occurs, and sometimes the patient's feet are weakened to the point of being small, and their gaze is debilitated, and their eyelids have ulcers with fallen hairs, and there is acute pain in the crown of the head with consequent protrusion, then know by these signs that the diarrhea does not come from the stomach, but rather from blocked veins proceeding from within.
And the best treatment for this is as follows: command the patient to shave their forehead, and then make a small incision in the middle of the forehead (and begin with the left temple incision toward the right temple; and let the incision be within the bone; and extend your hand from the temples' tendons which are good for chewing), until the bone is exposed.
Dry all the blood with a sponge or dry cloth and then fill between the two lips of the incision with old cotton or linen cloths. And then cover it with powder moistened in wine and oil to prevent a bad abscess from forming.
And when you remove this and see that the abscess has already diminished, then it is necessary to rub the bone until new flesh begins to grow on it, and then treat it with a drying regimen that promotes the growth of flesh, as if you take two parts of wheat flour and four parts of colophony and mix them together, and from these make a plaster and apply it to these wounds for the generation of new flesh.
**Chapter VI.**
**On the treatment of what falls into the ears.**
**Anything that falls into the ears is of one of four kinds: it may be a mineral stone or something similar to stone, such as iron and glass; it may be plant-based, like seeds or beans; it may be fluid, such as water or vinegar and their likenesses; or it may be an animal.**
**So when a stone falls into the ear or another similar cause that does not fit or grow in the ear, place the ear towards the sun, and if you see the stone, then administer some drops of olive oil or sesame oil to it, and then induce sneezing with conditions, and keep the nostrils open during the act of sneezing.** **And then place some weights of cloth or wool around the circumference of the ear, and stretch the ear outwards with those weights, because small objects are often expelled using these methods.**
**And if it is not expelled, then administer the extraction of it with an instrument called a fine-tipped ear spoon, which looks like this:**
Here's a line-by-line translation of the provided sentence:
"And therefore, if it is not forgotten due to this, then make a reed tube and insert the end of the tube into the ear hole, closing around the tube with wax and softened oil so that only the tube remains open. "Then draw out with your breath forcefully, for often we find that with this method we achieve success.
"But if it is not forgotten in this manner, then take a piece of linen cloth or a clean cloth, with which birds are caught, and place a small amount on the tip of the ray (tube), and then wrap it around that part decently placed. "Then insert that into the ear hole with ease, and then wick away the moisture from the ear.
"And therefore, if it is not forgotten with all the reasons mentioned, then you should cut that before it becomes an abscess, boil or spasm.
"And the method of cutting it is that you first bleed the patient from the saphenous vein according to their strength, and then make an incision between your fingers and turn the ear back towards its divided parts on top, and make a small cut in the skin of the ear where it is most swollen. And if the incision is in the shape of a crescent moon until it reaches the stone, and once the stone is found, remove it with appropriate instruments; then close the incision quickly at that moment, and care for it until it heals.
And if the cause falling into the ear is one of the fats that grows and swells, then administer the treatment and extraction of it; but if it does not obey you in exiting, then take a thin spatula according to this form: and administer with that the extraction of that fat which has fallen into the ear.
And do not do this when you think that it has already been softened by the vapor of the ear, and place it under heavy weights, and then extract from there with tweezers or a thin probe, or with a small incision as we have said, because it makes the extraction of it easier.
But in the case of water that has entered the ear, it is necessary for the patient to use sneezing with this condition at the beginning, and fill their ear with some old cloth, and pour hot water over that ear where the water is. And if it comes out with this, good; but if not, then take thin pebbles and lemons according to the length of the finger, and heat them a little in the fire, and the patient introduces one of these into the hole of their ear and jumps on one foot of that side and strikes with another pebble on the pebble which is inside the ear. Based on the context provided and the similarity to Latin, Italian, Spanish, and French, I'll attempt a translation of the given sentence:
Based on the context provided and the similarity to Latin, Italian, Spanish, and French, I'll attempt a translation of the given sentence: Sure, let's translate the given text into English:
And then place another cushion and do this so many times that all the water is expelled, and pierce it with a cannula as mentioned above about the stone-extracting peyra.
However, in the case of an animal entering that ear, if it is a small creature, push it out and treat it as mentioned earlier in the division. But if it is a large creature causing distress in the head, then administer the removal of it with tweezers and scissors, and its cause will be lighter than all other causes that enter the ear.
But in the case of a worm born in the ear, when you treat it with the water mentioned earlier in the division and in the treatise on distillations, and your treatment does not work, then you should look at the ear in the sunlight.
And therefore, if there appears here any cause of the worms, then extract it with tweezers or fine scissors. But if no cause appears, then take a cannula that is narrow at the tip and wide at the base, as follows: And insert the fine tip into the ear according to the amount that the patient can tolerate; then suck out with it strongly by suction, and do this many times until all the worms are expelled.
It seems like the text is discussing a medical procedure involving a cannula (a thin tube used for inserting or removing fluids) and some sort of treatment for worms. Here's a line-by-line translation:
And let your effusion be with which you infuse the medicinal oils into the ear using this instrument, the shape of which is as follows. And make it of silver or copper, narrow in diameter, with a small hole at the end and flat on top.
And thus it should be made so that it fits neatly into the cavity of the hollow instrument where it will be necessary to insert it. And if you wish, take the ray and wrap it around the end of the hollow instrument with a cotton stopper, then put oil or juice from some herb, or any liquid medication you desire into the cavity of the funnel — which is in the ear —, and then insert the ray with the stopper on top and press it gently with your hand so that the oil is expelled into the cavity of the funnel and the patient feels the oil inside.
And let what has been infused into the ear be warmed slightly by fire. And take care that what you distill into the ear is not too cold, for ear medications do not tolerate this.
Chapter VII.
On the treatment of ear blockages.
Here's my attempt to translate the given sentence:
And that which occurs in his abdomen, which does not contain the viscera, is among the most difficult conditions to heal.
And in that which contains the viscera, you should place the ear of the patient towards the sun and observe it. And thus if you see an apparent swelling, open it with a thin spatula that has this form:
If the end of it, in which there is a small opening, has one part that is sharp and the other not; and let the spatula be two palms long, so that it does not cause injury to the ear.
And thus if the swelling is due to flesh born in the ear or its canal, then take that with subtle scissors and cut it off vigorously until all the flesh is removed.
And if the swelling is in the cavity of the ear, then take a thin reed and warm it with fire for a little while, and then insert that into the canal of the ear.
And thus if you notice swelling with water that the patient easily expels due to gravity, forcefully press out the swelling of it; and be careful not to damage the nerves of the ear.
Here's the line-by-line translation of your text:
If there is a flow of blood, then submerge a sponge or cloth in cold water and place it on the ear, and use other remedies that restrict the flow of blood, which are described in the treatise on distillation.
Chapter VIII
About the treatment for styes that appear on the eyelids.
Styes that occur on the eyelids of the eyes can sometimes be wet, and other times they are dry.
Therefore, it is necessary that you have them with pinchers or tweezers, and incise them with the tip of a knife, and then place (something) on the areas as needed.
But if there is pain with blood flow, then you should cauterize them with a subtle, almond-shaped cautery.
And the best way to cauterize is near the incisions, and often they return if there remains some cause of their origin; and when they are cauterized with fire, those causes are burned and do not return.
Chapter IX
Treatment for inflammation that occurs on the eyelids of the eyes.
Often there is on the eyelids of the eyes some cause that resembles inflammation in its intensity and hardness, and for this reason it is called inflammation.
And it is an accumulation of thick humidity in the eyelids, both above and below.
Therefore, the operation on them is to consider if the swelling is spreading from the eyelid and affecting the entire area; the cause of this is light.
Therefore, cut through that with an incision along the length, and then carefully drain all the areas until it is emptied, and then suspend it with a thread and remove it.
And if the figure is large, then you should adjust it with stitches; and cure it until it is healed.
And if it is small, you will not suffer harm from it, because the ointment of it restores and heals it.
And if the swelling is extending towards the inner parts of the eyelid, you should check the inner surface. If the eyelid is full, then suspend the swelling with a thread, another than the one used for the incision, and press it on all sides; and if the eyelid is elongated by the incision, this will not cause any harm.
And at the beginning, wash the wound with salt water; and care for the place with water that heals until it is cured.
Chapter .10
Of the treatment of conjunctivitis on the eyelid above the eye.
Conjunctivitis is an inflammation that occurs in the membranes of the upper eyelid, and it mainly affects children, making their eyes worse and causing severe eye discharge; and they cannot look at the brightness of the sun because tears are constantly coming to them.
Therefore, you see these people squinting all the time, and while sleeping on their faces; and thus, the skin of their lower eyelids is wet, which has already covered swelling, and there is a visible inflammation in the eye; and when you press the area with your fingers, you can feel inflammation inside it.
And another way to operate is to have the patient place his head on your lap, and then you place a cloth under him and make a circle around the affected area according to its size, and then you place that over the affected area and press with your fingers all around so that inflammation accumulates in the center of the circle. Then make an incision in the center of the swelling with a scalpel, making a slit along its length, but the slit should not be larger than the one made in bloodletting.
Here's a line-by-line translation of the provided sentence:
Based on the context and the similarity to Latin, Italian, Spanish, and French, let's translate this line by line:
And be careful not to place it in the opening, so that with the tongue you do not reach the hole and displace it.
But if it does not appear to you immediately at the beginning of the opening, then place something small and easy to handle into the opening until it appears; and then extract it as we have said; and then submerge cloths in water mixed with vinegar and place them over the area, securing them with weights.
And thus call for salt and place it in the cavity of the opening, so that any remaining moisture is absorbed.
And then care for the area until it is healed.
But if an abscess forms in that place, then treat it with poultices until it is healed.
Chapter XI
On the manner of touching the eye.
When pustules are formed under the eyelashes, below the natural hairs and become inflamed, they afflict the eye and cause various ailments such as persistent tears, softening of the eyelids, and opacity, which if left untreated can lead to the destruction of the eye. This is known as touching the eye, and it is treated in four ways: either with a cautery using fire; or with a sharp medicine, as was mentioned earlier in the chapter on cauterization; or by removing the pustule through incision and suturing; or with cannulas, as I will now explain.
Based on the pattern of the text and the context of medieval medicine, here is my best attempt at translating the given sentence line by line:
Here's my attempt to translate the provided sentence into English:
Certainly! Let's break down the sentence and translate it line by line:
And then proceed with the spatula over both lines that you have marked, starting from the greater lacrimal and entering into the lesser lacrimal. And if your tear is close to the natural hairs, as it is with the king's size.
Then place the scissors in one of the two corners of the wound, and then excise it completely. And then attach both lips with glue or thin wool thread, and cleanse the blood, and make adhere whatever excess remains from the threads over two eyebrows with some adhesive substance, if you want to do this, and if not, do not worry about it.
Then remove the stitches within three or four days, and then cure that.
And if you want, leave the wound without stitches and cure it with something that dries and constricts, because the eyelid is lifted due to the healing of the wound and its union; but stitching is better, and thus said the ancients in their treatments.
But nevertheless, be careful with the patient, for it is a good operation and there should be no fear of it.
And there is another way to treat it, which is to mark on the eyelid a figure like a myrtle leaf, and then lift the eyelid with three separated and gathered stitches in this form:
Here's the translation of the given text:
And then adjust the two lips of the wound with stitches, and cure what is inside so that it may be healed.
But if an abscess occurs, you must make an incision or a cut into it, and then seal the abscess with wax or something similar, and with ointments.
And sometimes it happens to the eyelid that its hairs are affected, then you must use on it what we have said about making an incision; but stitches in this case are more artificial.
To treat with cannabis, follow this method: And you must turn the eyelid inside out and cut the shape that is within, as I have described; then, by art, make two cannas or two thin splints whose length should be according to the length of the eyelid, and their width should be less than the width of a reed. And you have already cut at the ends of each part where you have the threads.
Then apply each one with thinness over the excess of the eyelid's skin, and tighten the cannas of each part with strong tension, and leave it for a few days, because the thread through the tension will die and become denatured and will fall off by itself until it falls out.
Certainly! Let's break down the text and provide a translation line by line.
Sure, here is my guess for what this means:
This translates to: "And this is the way to make two reeds according to this form: "and there should be neither more nor less than the required length and width.
Chapter XII
When the hair is hard, raise it with a needle on the tip.
When the hairs are unnatural, hard, rough and pointed on the lips, then the operation is that you take a fine needle and place it in that thread of fine silk and flax, and then you adjust its ends very finely and knot each one in this manner: "And let the length of the threads be about a palm.
And then you compose another fine thread under it in brief, and knot the ends of that one if you wish.
And then have the patient place his head in your lap, and let it be near the window so that your work may be seen clearly, for it is a subtle and minute operation.
Then insert the needle into the root of the adjusted hair that needs to be removed, and make it penetrate quickly into the eyelid until you extract it above the natural hair.
Then pull the hair out and insert it in wax, and let there be one, two or three hairs, but not more.
And then remove your hand with that instrument so that the hair is pulled out, plucking it with tweezers from the eyelid with its natural root.
But if the tweezers are pulled and the hair is not removed, you will pull the tweezers down along with the thread you have prepared, until the hair comes out from above.
And look at it with the eye's vision, for when you pull out the tweezers and the thread, each time close the eye and leave it closed for two or three days, until the hair sticks to its place and good flesh grows over it.
And if the hair is too short, then you should attach a long hair from the natural ones, and raise it with that, or leave it until it has lengthened somewhat, and then you can raise it.
Chapter XIII
On the care of removing the growth that appears on the eyelid.
When it appears on the eyelid and is a contraction of the eyelid when it contracts upward, to the right or to the left part, due to poor healing of a wound or incision or from cauterization, and it is called a trichiasis, this trichiasis may be natural or accidental, caused by poor healing of wounds or incisions or cauterization, or resembling their unfortunate condition.
Sure, I'll translate the provided sentence into English:
And it is not advisable that you use a cure for him from the causes that dry out and tighten, because if you do this, it will return even worse than before.
Use in that case causes that soften, such as fenugreek, and soak it with water in which there are also seeds of lily, or use an ointment made of diacilon, which should be liquefied with some oil, and dip the cotton wool in it, and treat with it.
And the treasure of your cure is that you penetrate everything with all your skill so that nothing remains solid, as it was at the beginning.
And this operation which we have mentioned is nothing more than a rectification of the alixacratir, so that it does not return to its previous form.
Chapter XIV.
On the cure of alixacratir which is made in the lower eyelid.
This alixacratir which is made in the lower eyelid, which is truly called alixacratir, and it is either natural or accidental for him.
But an accidental one is caused by a blow, or by a cut, or by a cautery, or by other similar things.
And the method of operation for this is that you should take a needle with a double thread, and insert it into the flesh, causing it to pass from the left tear duct to the right tear duct until the thread reaches both ends of the flesh.
And then extend the flesh at the divided areas with the needle and sew it with the needle, and cut it with a wide scalpel. And then if the shape of the eyelid returns to what is appropriate, that's good; but if not, take the reed and place it on the divided figure, and with it turn the eyelid, and make two incisions in the side of the eyelid below.
And let the ends of the two incisions be at two corners of the cut you have made until they meet, and let there be an angle between them such that when they come together a figure is formed from them.
And this figure is the Greek letter: lambda.
And then remove that flesh by an amount equal to the length of the sharp edge below it, so that it is the eyelid.
And then adjust the separated parts and sew them together with wool thread; and then treat them with those softening medications and bandages until they are healed.
And if the eyebrow needs to be lifted by incision or suture or cautery, then you should make a flat incision over the hairs of the eyelid as previously described. And then separate with the scalpel between the two lips as we have said.
In summary, when treating eyebrow lifts that are above or below, the operation should proceed according to the preparation of the eyebrow shape, and this is in various forms.
And the skilled craftsman always prepares his ingenuity in every way possible to bring back the figure to its natural form, or as close to it as possible, and that patient, according to their need for the operation and the instruments in the best position.
Chapter XV.
Of the adhesion of the eyelid to the conjunctiva or to the cornea.
When this adhesion occurs to many people in such a way that the eyelid is attached above the white of the eye and is impeded from its natural movement and function, then you must insert the extremity of the needle underneath the eyelid and lift it up with that, or extend it with oil.
And then you should cut the adhesion with a fine scalpel that is not too sharp, having it somewhat blunt so that the patient is not disturbed during the operation. Leave the scalpel so it does not hurt the eye with its sharpness.
And let your incision be such that it easily cuts away that adhesion until the eyelid is returned to its natural shape and all of the adhesion is healed.
And then you should put salt water in the eye with which you wash it, or pour into it a decoction of juniper berries dissolved in water.
And then separate the eyelid from the eye with oil, and place wool soaked in egg white over the eye. On the third day, use healing poultices until it is healed.
Chapter XVI.
On the incision of a nail and of a caruncle of the eye.
Know that a nail is of two kinds: either it is nervous, resembling a delicate, hard bone; or it is not nervous, resembling congealed white humidity. When it strikes the touchstone, it is broken and the touchstone is not inserted into it.
And both species start only from the larger tear duct, which gradually covers the vision and inhibits light and eye movement.
But the way to perform the operation at its beginning is for the patient to place their head in your lap, then open their eyes, and lift their eyelid with your hand. Then collect the nail with pincers of little more than double strength, and extend that towards the divided parts above. Then take a needle and insert into it a horsehair or cow hair or calf hair, or similar strong thread, or double the tip of the needle little by little and place it in the middle of the nail, and penetrate it with the needle, and tie the nail with the thread; then extend that towards the divided parts above, and scrape off the side of the nail which is the pupil with the hair. And thus you follow it with the hair to its end.
Then you incise the remaining part of the tear duct with a fine spatula or small scissors, and clear away the flesh of the natural tear duct, so that by this incision there will not be a continuous flow of tears.
And at other times the nail is extended or swollen with pus, as we have said, and it should be extracted with a lancet of this form.
And be careful not to touch the corneal membrane with the lancet, as this could cause a rupture and damage the pupil.
Then place a little crushed salt or sieved ashes in the wound, and let it sit until the next day; then clean it with water until it is healed.
And if the nail is not painful and you cannot insert the needle, or it is not raised in the pus, then this type of nail can be treated with medicines and healed as I have described earlier in the division.
And if you want to incise it, then open the wound of the patient and take a sharp lancet of this form: with finesse. And if the pus is thick and congealed and obstructs the opening, then pour into the wound from your hand some powdered ash or fine sand or crushed salt, and close the wound until the next day.
Here's a line-by-line translation of the given text:
And continue your operation on that limb with reason until it is healed.
The abundance of flesh around the tear duct, if it is noticed in the eye due to great damage, should be cut with scissors; and incise one side of it, and do not finish the incision so that tears do not flow out.
And then apply to the tear duct's head a poultice made of rosemary and fennel until it is healed.
Chapter XVII.
Of the incision of a sty and that which is born of flesh bound in the eye.
Sometimes in the eyes of some, flesh has grown which is red and swollen until it covers the pupil, or almost or tightly against the eyelids, and strongly presses the eyelids to the outer parts, and resembles a row of balusters.
But the operation in it is that the patient places his head on your lap; and then open the eyelids of that one and collect all that flesh with suitable scissors, and take it with forceps or tweezers; and then incise the flesh at the beginning until all is finished with the scissors, and be careful not to damage the eye during your operation.
And let your incision be with the tool with which you cut those or with a spatula that we have recommended in the incision of the nail, or with small forceps with which you collect shavings according to what will come later in this chapter.
When your incision is completed and all that flesh has been removed, then fill the wound with crushed salt, or pour into it powdered alum and other corrosive substances similar to those medicines, and place a bandage of egg white over the wound until it is secured against pus.
And if there remains any guardian or is lorded by cautious blood, and you fear pus, then let the wound be and treat that cautious pus with water that will cause that pus to cease, and then proceed again with the operation until it is healed, and similarly do for the flesh affected in the wound of this kind.
However, you must avoid all treatment of the fresh wound through a natural or accidental pathway, work with iron, and do not put your hand in any of these operations until you see that the member is tolerating that operation.
Chapter XVIII
"From the collection of wisdom in the wheel.
Certainly! Let's break down the text and attempt to translate it:
Based on the context and the pattern of the previous translations, here's a line-by-line translation:
And it is that you command the patient to place their head in your lap, and then suspend those veins with an ounce or two, according to your judgment; let that ounce be of subtle duplication according to this form:
or so two onces gradually in one body according to this form:
And then those veins should be tied with subtle forces, with care, and you should cleanse the blood little by little until you see that the veins are drawn from the mouth and they are rolled up.
And be careful that you do not touch the mouth with the ends of the spatula; and if your operation is at noon before the sun, and you are firm in your operation so that you only cut those veins.
And when you have completed [the operation], then you should drip clear vinegar or wine into the mouth so that with its sharpness it may dissolve what was drawn from the gallbladder.
But if it is not possible to collect everything at that time, then you should apply a plaster with something that relieves his pain, and leave him for a few days until the pain subsides and he is safe from abscess formation.
And then repeat the procedure on the patient in the same manner until they are healed.
Here is the shape of the scissors:
Chapter XIX
On the reduction of hernias in the nose.
When you treat hernias with cautery or sharp medicine according to the previously mentioned method and it does not heal, then do not cut into it but make incisions over the abscess until it reaches maturity, and extract all the moisture in it, and insert powder until the bone is exposed.
And when the bone is exposed and you see corruption or blackness, then scrape it with an instrument of this shape:
And it is named a sharp point, and let it be made of iron or steel, and the head should be round like this, which should be pointed by filing or sharpening with fine points (as shown in the following figure).
Place that (the instrument) on the corrupt area of the bone, and then turn it between your fingers, and press with your hand little by little until you know that the corruption is scraped away.
And this should be done several times, and then restore the area with drying and astringent substances.
When the wound has healed and good flesh has grown in it, and the body has been cleansed of pus, and it remains for forty days without being renewed or becoming inflamed, then you know that it is healed.
And if not, then you must reduce the fracture to the shape of the nose, and in this manner: you should expose using either iron or sharp medicine. Once the bone is exposed, take three needles shaped like this:
The tip of the iron should be triangular, and its shaft should be first thinned towards the tip in this manner as you see here.
Then place that (the needle) on the bone, specifically near the lacrimal bone. With your hand a little below the eye, then rotate your hand with the needles until they penetrate completely through the bone. The patient will feel this and exhale as you do so.
Then restore the area with astringent medicines to dry it out, as you have been taught.
Therefore, when the flesh and place have hardened, the material that had spread to the surrounding areas returns to the nose, so this becomes lighter on the patient.
Sure, let's try to decipher and translate this line by line. Given the context of a medieval medical treatise, the language appears to be Old French or Occitan with some Latin influence.
"On the reduction of the protrusion of the eye.
When the eye protrudes in its entirety and no harm or diminution occurs in vision, it is necessary to let the patient rest, and then follow them, and then place cupping glasses on the neck without scarification and with good suction; and then place a liniment over the eye that is made of acatra (a type of plant), aloe, enses (a type of herb), and sarcocolla (a type of resin), and then strengthen the plaster over the eye with many powders.
And the manner of the powders is to take many sheets of linen, and each sheet should be folded into four layers; and make many of these.
Then place them one on top of the other according to the amount which the eye needs. And then strengthen on top of these with a hard cloth with strong compression; and repeat the cupping glasses with suction without scarification; and then remove the cupping glasses and let the eye be tight day and night.
But if during this time the ligament becomes softened, then it must be very tight.
Then remove the bandage day and night as we have said.
And if you see that the swelling has already been reduced, it is good. Otherwise, then repeat the application of the plaster with powders and constriction and cupping until it is healed.
Chapter 21.
On the protrusion of the uveal tract.
When there is a protrusion in the uveal tract and it protrudes out of the eyelids like a seed of rye, and it resembles a man's face due to this, and you wish to incise it, then perform the operation as we have mentioned, that is, insert one needle into the root of the uvea from below, and then insert another needle on the opposite side where there is double threading, and make the first needle penetrate and leave it according to its position; then incise the place of the double thread and lift with it the part of the uveal tract surrounding the needle, and pull it strongly.
Then remove the needle and place cotton wool soaked in egg white on the eye, and leave it until the thread falls out with the uvea.
And then treat the eye with comforting water until the wound is healed.
Here's my translation of the given sentence:
And then strengthen until it is healed.
**Capítulo 22.**
**Sobre el tratamiento de los ojos.**
Esta dolencia, llamada "ojos", no es más que una inflamación que se localiza en el ojo y parece agua descendente, pero no es exactamente así.
Pero el método para tratarlo es hacer que el paciente se siente sobre una silla preparada y derecha. Luego toma su cabeza entre tus manos de dos lados y mira hacia adentro hasta que veas la inflamación llegar a las partes bajas. Entonces sécala para que no descienda, bloquea la luz y el paciente verá las causas de esta manera. ¡Continúa con el siguiente párrafo cuando estés listo!
Y si no desciende, sabrás que es agua.
Pero si no está preparado para el descenso de la inflamación con agua como hemos dicho, entonces haz que el paciente se siente entre tus manos y luego toma una espátula fina y colócala sobre la piel a lo largo de la conjuntiva continua con la córnea en la corona (en este lugar), hasta que la inflamación sea expulsada.
When it is forgotten, then you should distill into the nose hot water in which you have mixed honey or water in which you have previously boiled fenugreek and honey.
And let him be treated with the other remedies until he is cured.
Chapter 22.
On the treatment of water flowing from the nose.
We have already mentioned the types of water in the division and which one needs to be pierced according to what has been declared, namely the second type, based on health.
Then you should make the patient sit between your hands on a chair and bind their nose tightly with a bandage.
And then place your left hand near the eyelid of their nose if the affected nostril is the left one, or with your right hand if it is the right nostril.
And then with your right hand take a lancet if the nostril is the left one, or with your left hand if it is the right nostril.
Then place the tip of the lancet near the corner of the eye in the part closest to the smaller tear duct, and then sharply draw out the lancet with strength and turn your hand with it.
And then penetrate into the eye's whiteness and feel that the blood has already arrived due to seeing.
And it should be the measure of the blood's path from the arm to the palm, which is the same as the distance between the pupil and the edge of the black part, which is the eye's crown; because you will see with that pupil through the clarity of the corneal tunic.
And then you should stop the blood in the place where it is watery, and then you pull it down once, and then again another time, and if the water descends quickly, then you can see the patient clearly on what he sees immediately, and the blood in his eye.
And then wait a moment; if the water has descended, then you should stop that other time before the blood is poured out.
And thus, when it is dry and does not descend, then you can easily extract the blood and roll it with your hand a little at a time, and then dissolve a little clear salt in water and with that wash the inside of the eye; and then place outside the eye a cotton ball or swab soaked in olive oil and egg white, and rinse the eye with water.
Here is a line-by-line translation of your medieval medical text into English:
And if you do not obey your master when blowing into the mouth due to its hardness — for it is some men whose mouth is very hard — then you must take the spatula which is called albard, and this is its form.
And therefore pierce with it that joint, and do not put your hand into the hole, and it is necessary that you make a subtle path for the master's finger.
Then promptly insert the master's finger as we have said.
And you must complete the task of your work, with the patient prepared for sleep in a quiet room where he sleeps on his back in a darkened house, and he is prohibited from all movements.
And place on his nature something that will straighten his nature, and do not move his head to the right or left at all.
And let the bandage be according to its disposition until the third day.
Then unbind it in that darkened room and try a faint light, and let him see some objects, then immediately rebind the bandage until the seventh day.
And it is not necessary to do this at the time of the baths or immediately after the infusion. They have a need for you to remove that because water can easily and greatly affect it due to the severity of the condition.
But if a post-operative abscess occurs, it is necessary to open the wound before seven days and treat it with water that reduces swelling.
Then you should cover his eyes and place a cloth over his mouth so that he may be guided in his breathing until he recovers, keeping him in the darkest place for several days.
And then he should gradually be taken out of that darkness and conversed with about his condition.
And know that a student should not be exempt from vision some times, and then you must be confident about the operation.
And it has come to our attention from some of those who are in Artech, and one said that he made a fire in the Ayrac magdam, which was pierced with which water was drawn.
But nevertheless I have not seen anyone in our land who has done this perfectly, nor have I read about it in any of the books of the ancients; and it is possible that this is a new method.
And these are the forms of the species of magdana for those who do not know them:
Based on the context and the similarities to Latin, Italian, Spanish, and French, here's my attempt at translating the sentence:
Chapter 24.
About the treatment of flesh eaten away in the nose.
When in the nose various fleshy growths arise, one of which is caused by something similar to the sting of a scorpion or a fish called polyp; this illness is called polyp because it resembles that fish. And if the flesh is cancerous, pale, and dark in color, this is a lion's flesh, not dark in color.
Therefore, for this condition in which the flesh is not fraudulent or cancerous, you should have the patient sit between your hands and place him in the sun, and you should cauterize his nose with a needle in those fleshy areas. Then draw out that which has been divided into parts outside, and then cut away what you have encompassed with a sharp, subtle spatula from one part to the other until you know that all the flesh has been removed; for if any of it remains due to which division is possible, then scrape it off with one of the subtle instruments with ease until nothing remains. But if it bleeds or forms an abscess, then you should apply what is necessary; or if it is a malignant abscess, then you should cut and cauterize until blood and all the cavities are removed.
And then put a drop into the nostril near the opening of wine and water or wine. But if the nose is open and moisture comes out onto the palate, then you know that it has already been healed.
But if the moisture does not enter as it should, then you know that there is flesh swollen with pus in the upper nasal bones, which has not been opened.
Therefore, it is necessary to introduce a thread with some thickness, and insert needles in the patient's nose, placing one needle between each nostril the size of a finger or hand, and have the patient lean forward and insert one end of the thread into the nostrils with a hook or another tool that is available to them. ️
And after this has been done, have the patient blow their nose so that it reaches the nasal passages and comes out through the mouth, because many times this action is performed by children in schools, and it is an easy task for those who want to do it.
And then hold the two ends of the thread, one end protruding from the nose and the other remaining in the nose, and then administer a piece of meat to the needles that are on the thread, and do this until you know that the flesh is already adhered to the needles of the thread. ️
And immediately extract the bile, and place in the nose near the blood vessel a funnel, and do this for three days or more until the corrosive ointment dissolves all that is rotten from the flesh.
And immediately at the end of the process, place in the nose a lead tube for several days until it is healed.
But if you decide to use a dry treatment method, use this one instead.
And here is the form of the instrument used for caput purges that with which oils and medications are distilled in the nostrils:
And make it of silver or iron, which should be similar to a small open lamp, also like a small jug, and the nozzle similarly.
And if you wish, make a closed tube like a reed, and let the nozzle of the caput purge instrument be flat and open; to which there should be a handle at its end, with which you can hold it when you drip oil or water that you want from the juices and absorbent causes.
Chapter 25.
Of warts that are born in the extremities of the nose.
When a wart appears on the extremities of the nose, it is considered and mentioned in some days, until it becomes necessary to take care of it.
And for this reason, you should investigate its appearance at the beginning and extract everything from it. Then apply a pointed cautery or burning medicine to the affected area where the wart is located.
But if its investigation is delayed until it becomes magnified, then consider whether it has become hardened, dark in color and with little feeling; do not touch it with iron as it is a malignant abscess; for warts of this nature, which are investigated, bring great malice upon the one on whom they had grown.
And if the abscess is from a blow and is not dark in color, and it is possible to investigate everything in it, then evacuate the patient and investigate it without fear, and cure the area with something that dries and constricts until it is healed.
Chapter 26.
Of the stitching of the nose and lips and ear when continuity is broken by injury or similar cause.
You should know that when there is a rupture of continuity in one of these tendons, it matters little in this operation except for some men.
Therefore, when someone has some reason for that, consider if it is a fresh wound with its blood, and then adjust the two lips of the wound with stitches, and then cure what is inside so that it may be healed.
And if the lips of the rupture are already separated and each is healed, then you should scrape away each part of its visible cord until blood comes out. Then join the two lips with stitches and strengthen them, and on top of them sprinkle dragon's blood powder mixed with thyme, and place on the powder a thin compress of emplastrum diafinicon, or any other of the consolidating plasters, and leave it in place for two days or three, then remove it and replace it with another plaster and leave it until the threads have dissolved by themselves, then cure with ointment until it is healed.
But the method of suturing is that you join the rupture with needles as we have mentioned in the suturing of the belly, or join the rupture with thread as has been taught to you.
Chapter 27.
"On the removal of that cause which occurs in both lips on the inside.
"Many times it happens to many men in the inner parts of their lips some hard swellings similar to pork fat, and some are smaller while others are larger.
"So it is necessary that you turn the lips and folds each of those hardnesses from all sides, and then absorb the pus with clean wool until the blood is stopped, and then wash the area with vinegar and treat the place with water that has been made astringent until it is healed.
Chapter 28.
"On the incision of flesh attached to the gums.
"Great are the times when flesh attached to the gum appears, which the ancients called albulus. Therefore, it is necessary that you suspend that with a hook or what you have that hook with the scissors and cut that along its root, and let the pus run or the blood.
"And then place clean wool or other astringent or drying powders on the area.
"And if that flesh returns, then cut it secondarily and cauterize it, for the cautery will not return.
Chapter 29.
Of the reason for toothache.
When on the surface of the teeth, both inside and outside, and between the gums, there are rough, sharp scales, and sometimes they are blackened and yellowed or greenish until the gum is affected by corruption, then the teeth become loose.
Therefore, it is necessary for you to make the patient sit between your hands and place his head in your lap, then brush the teeth where those scales appear until not a single cause remains, like sand, and this will remove the blackness, yellowing, and other discolorations until they are cleansed.
So if this is done as described at the beginning of the cause, it is good; but if not, then you must repeat the procedure on those teeth for another day and a second and a third time until you reach the desired outcome.
Know that teeth require many types of brushes with different shapes and sizes, according to what you have prepared for your operation. And because the brushes with which the inside of the tooth is brushed are different from those used between teeth according to other shapes, these shapes of brushes must be prepared by you as you will see shortly:

"On the extraction of teeth.
"Make sure to heal the tooth from its pain with all your skill and delay the extraction as much as possible, because there is no reason that should hasten its removal once it has been extracted, since it is a precious substance until its removal.
"However, when the patient insists on having that tooth extracted, make sure you are absolutely certain which tooth is causing the pain, because many times the pain deceives the patient and he thinks it is in a healthy tooth, and then you extract that one and the pain does not cease until the diseased and painful tooth has been extracted. We have already seen this happen due to the actions of barbers.
"Therefore, in order to be certain which tooth is painful and to know it well, you should scrape around the circumference of the tooth with a spatula that contains some virtue, until the gum detaches from all parts of the tooth. Then soften it with your words or with fine forceps little by little until you reach it.
Here's the translation of the given text:
And therefore, if it is not forgotten, then take one of those instruments and place it under the patient so that you can easily and forcefully remove them in the same way as at the beginning.
But if the tooth is loose or rotten, then you must wrap it with cloth and tightly bind it with a thin thread to prevent it from breaking during your gripping with tongs.
And it is necessary that you work carefully with scarification around the entire gum and be mindful of your strength so as not to break it and leave part of it behind, and then return to the patient for the pain will be greater than before.
And beware that you do not do what some ignorant barbers do in their rashness and arrogance over the removal of teeth, without first administering what we have recommended; for many times they cause great injuries to ailing men which are more difficult to repair, and the reasons for their complications are all or some of the following: that you extract it along with some bones of the jaw, as has happened many times.
And after the extraction, rinse the mouth with hot water or vinegar mixed with salt.
And if there is blood flow through this, just as it should be expected with numerous views, then cut some amount of silk and sprinkle it over the wound. And if that silk does not help, cauterize it.
The shape of the forceps and fine pincers with which the tooth is grasped at the beginning should have a long handle, a short shaft and be thick, so that they are not bent when you must work with them.
And thus, the thick handles should be such that when using them they are not bent, but have short ends.
And they should be made of Indian steel with straight handles, and on the ends of those there should be teeth that interlock with each other and hold tightly by constriction, and sometimes the ends of those should have the shape of the beak of a bird called a stork, which is hooked, and are of strong constriction.
Chapter 31.
Of the removal of teeth and the extraction of broken jawbones.
When you need to remove a tooth that has been broken, there is a reason for this. Therefore, you should place cotton with a border over the area for one day or two until the area becomes softened; and then insert tweezers or pincers whose ends resemble the beak of a bird called a stork or heron, similar to the shape of forceps:
The sentence "Las extramitatz de lor sian faytas dedintz ayssi cum lima o alfagi" can be translated into English as:
And if the patient does not obey you with these forceps or pincers, then it is necessary for you to cut into the skin and remove all the flesh, and insert the instrument which is called atali, this is a small hook whose shape is as follows:
And it should have a short handle, not too thick, so that it does not get stuck.
Therefore, if the skin is thus pierced, it is good; and if not, help yourself with these other instruments whose shapes are as follows: the shape of the first instrument is a triangular handle with some thickness in it:
The shape of the second instrument should be triangular and with a thinner handle.
And thus having been helped with this instrument, which has two hooks, their form is approximately as follows: And with other instruments which will be used for the extraction of teeth; because it is usually done with this instrument which resembles a large onion, and this is its shape:
With a twisted or short triangular handle which should have some thickness but not be too thick to avoid getting stuck.
And know that the instruments for extracting teeth are similar and likewise other instruments.
The sentence is from a medieval medical treatise and discusses the role of skilled artisans in creating instruments for various diseases that ancient physicians did not describe or use specific instruments for due to the diverse nature of these illnesses. Here's the line-by-line translation:
"But if the bone of the jaw or any other bones in the mouth are broken, or if you can, then it should be treated in its place with water and appropriate instruments and forceps that we have mentioned for the extraction of tooth roots. And assist with gestures, the form of which is as follows:
"And if there is any swelling, reduce it gradually, and hold or press with the mouth so that it does not burst or escape until the bone is completely healed; then restore the area with appropriate medications.
"But if there is a small fracture in the bone, then scrape away that fracture and its darkness, and treat it until it is healed.
"Chapter 32
"On the treatment of prominent teeth over others.
"When teeth are prominently protruding and not according to their natural form, especially in women and particularly in old venerable ladies; therefore, you should consider: if the tooth is next to another tooth and cannot be extracted or filed down, then cut it down with this instrument, which looks like a pig's snout and is made of very sharp Indian steel.
And let your incision be with the one you've been cutting for many days due to the hardness of the tooth, and ensure that none of the other teeth are affected.
And if it is an exposed tooth in need of filing, then file that tooth with an iron file from India, which looks like this:
And let the whole thing be of Indian iron and the margin equally; and let it have many small points like a file with which needles are made, with which the tooth should be filed little by little over several days gently, so that no other tooth is affected or lost. Then smooth it at the end and scrape it with a sharp razor.
And if it is a tooth of which a part is broken and the tongue hits it, then you should file that tooth from within until the roughness of that piece is removed and smoothed, and it is filled so that the tongue does not strike it nor does the speech become corrupted.
Chapter 33.
On the restoration of missing teeth with a gold or silver filling.
When the front teeth are damaged and removed by blows or falls, and the patient cannot chew food, and you have treated them with astringent medicines, and your treatment has not worked, then so that they do not become loose, fill those (teeth) which are strengthened with gold filling and not silver, because silver turns green and soon decays within a few days, but gold never changes.
Here's the translation of the provided sentence: And next, iterate the stitching into the starting point of the incision, and strengthen your hand with skill and precision until it is not disturbed.
And let your suture be the one that you strengthen with thread; you must control the ends of the needle so they do not become tangled.
And next, cut the excess thread with scissors or forceps, and gather those ends in each place carefully, then turn them over and hide them between the healthy tooth and the affected tooth, so as not to cause injury to the tongue. And next, leave that (suture) as tight as possible.
But if it becomes loose or broken, strengthen that or those with another thread in such a manner at all times.
And this is the way of the teeth and the figure of the extraction of two healthy teeth and two affected teeth, as you see these tied together.
And when it is done that one tooth or two return to their places, next the closure of each in its place, and they must heal as we have said.
And do not do this unless you are a skilled craftsman and wise.
And sometimes the cause is attributed to cow bones, which are shaped like teeth and placed in the location where the tooth fails, then strengthened as we have said, remaining and serving with that for a long time.
It seems like you're ready to translate the next sentence from the medieval medical treatise. Please provide the source sentence you'd like me to translate into English, following the same line-by-line format as before. I'm here to help!
Of the swelling that comes in the tongue and inhibits speech.
This swelling that comes under the tongue sometimes is natural with which one is born, or accidental and occurs due to a wound that has already healed.
And the operation on it is that you open the mouth of the patient, their head being towards you; and elevate their tongue, and then carefully cut that nervous swelling according to the width until the tongue is released from its stiffness.
But if there is some hardness or knot in it, and this has been caused by the consolidation of a wound, then you pour oil and cut that [hardness] along its width until you have completely cut through the swelling and the knot has dissolved.
And be careful that there is not made a fissure in the flesh, and that you cut only the skin, and there comes a flow of blood.
And then wash the incision marks with vinegar or cold water; and then place a clean cloth under the tongue. This is the custom, which means that the patient must keep their tongue clean every night to prevent any consolidation in the future.
But if there is a flow of blood, place crushed vitriol on the area; but if the blood comes out, then cauterize the area with an old cautery that has been dipped in water. And then treat the patient with other remedies until they are healed.
Chapter 35.
On the removal of a cyst under the tongue.
Sometimes, there occurs under the tongue an abscess resembling a small pebble that prevents the tongue from performing its natural function, and it grows rapidly until it fills the mouth.
The operation is to open the patient's mouth widely in front of a light source and examine the abscess.
And if you see it is of dark or black color, hard, and the patient feels no pain, then do not touch it because it is cancerous.
And if it has turned white and contains moisture, then insert a scalpel into it and make a thin incision with a fine spatula, cutting through all parts; and if blood comes out during the operation, then place crushed eggshells (which contain vitriol) on top to stop the bleeding.
Based on the context and the similarities with Latin, Italian, Spanish, and French, here's a line-by-line translation:
Chapter 36
Of the removal of an abscess from both ears and that which is formed in the gullet, and other abscesses.
When a swelling occurs in the throat, there are glands that resemble cotton wool, which come out and are called tonsils. If you treat them with the water we mentioned in the section and they do not heal, then consider if the abscess is hard, dark-colored, and has little sensation; if so, do not touch it with iron.
And if it is red in color and the root is large, then do not touch it with iron because of the flow of blood; instead let it ripen on its own, and then either you will draw it out or it will burst by itself.
And if it is white in color, tender, and its root is delicate, then that one is the kind that should be cut into.
And the operation on it is such that before your operation, consider if the abscess of the patient has already rested with complete rest or if it has diminished somewhat; and then make the patient sit facing the sun, and his head be in your hand, open his mouth, and the servant taking between his hands presses the tongue downwards with a very noble instrument, of which this is the form:
And let it be made of silver or steel, and let it be thin like a knife.
And so when you press with it onto the tongue and an abscess is revealed to you, then cut above that with your instrument, and then take tweezers and insert it into the abscess, and pull it out as much as you can. Another thing that you may draw out some cause of the tunic, and then incise that with an instrument of this shape:
Another thing that you may draw out some cause of the tunic, and then incise that with an instrument of this shape: and it resembles forceps, but the ends of it are curved, so that the opening of each is in the middle of the other, very sharp, which should be made of iron well-tempered.
But if this instrument is not available to you, then incise it with a probe of this shape: and let one end be sharp, the other blunt.
And after you have incised one boil, incise the other in the same manner, and then the patient will heal from cold water.
But if there is a flow of blood, let the patient heal with water from a decoction of pomegranate peels or myrtle leaves, similar to other hemostatic causes, until the bleeding is stopped, and then care for it until it is healed.
Certainly! Let's translate the sentence step by step:
Certainly! Here is the line-by-line translation of the provided text:
And the abscess had grown so much that two months passed before it burst through two holes.
So I cautiously made an incision and inserted one of the hooks into it, then I pulled it out, and a large piece came out with it. Then I cut along that hole until I reached the other opening, and I closed his mouth, compressed his tongue, and then I inserted the hook into that abscess.
And then I made a large incision in him, but only a little blood flowed from it. Therefore it is clear that the woman's intestine was ruptured, and she began to drink water immediately, and then she ate food. And I did not stop cutting into that abscess many times over a long period, and another abscess formed in its place, which I cut open until it extended as far as that one.
Therefore I made an incision and cauterized the wound, and after that he recovered; and then I traveled and did not know what happened to him next.
Chapter 37.
On incising a navel when it is swollen with an abscess.
When a tumor appears on the uvula and it is attached and long, then it is called a perpendicular; and if it is in the area below and thick and round, then it is called a buccal tumor.
But when it is treated with the water we mentioned in the division, and you do not complete your treatment, likewise if the aposteme is already removed from him but remains subtle, then it is necessary that you incise that which is attached and round; and if it is of that length, and is bleeding, dark red or black, and not to his liking, then it is necessary that you attempt its incision, for in this case there is concern for the patient.
And when you see it according to the manner I have mentioned regarding its whiteness and length, you should make the patient sit up and press their tongue with an instrument that fits its shape, and then place a knife in the new [incision], and pull it down and incise it with one of the two instruments called for the incision of the lips.
And you should not incise it unless what is adjusted to the natural limit without addition, for if you incise more of it, you will damage his speech.
And at that moment, use of this remedy, which we recommend for the incision of two mills (or wounds), and take care that it heals well.
But if the patient is frightened by the incision, it is necessary to use cunning in the cauterization without fear. The manner of cautery is only with sharp water, and you should place the patient's head on your lap. Then press the patient's tongue with the instrument mentioned earlier, and then take some of the water that has been described in the chapter on cauterization, and make a live coal with it. Place this neither too thick nor too thin, and fill the cavity of the instrument, which is shaped like this:
Let the tip of the cavity in which the medicine is placed be like the cavity of a spoon, and place the instrument with the medicine on the lips. The patient should move his tongue over his palate so that the saliva or mucus from the mouth mixes with the intrinsic medicine, so that no part of it falls onto the throat and irritates him.
Then take your hand with the medicine, and squeeze it onto the uvula for about half an hour until you see it become darkened and soothed by the bite of the medicine.
Sure, here's the translation of the provided sentence:
And if you are in need of repeating the medicine, repeat it, and then after cauterization, clean the surrounding area of the wound with a cloth soaked in wine, and rinse it with water to remove any remaining residue from the medicine, and then wash it with cold water, and heal the outside with embrocation, and the inside with wound dressings until it is healed.
And this type of treatment is more reliable and lasts longer.
Sometimes the wound is healed with something more subtle than cautery or incision, because it is cured by subfumigation in this manner: Take calamus, hyssop, origanum, rue, dried Arabic herbs, chamomile, and similar to those of the herbs, and mix all these ingredients, or some of them, in a pot, and soak them in vinegar; then they should boil; and the pot should be well sealed with clay, and in the middle of the pot there should be an opening, over which should be placed a concave instrument made of iron, in this manner; it should be made of silver or iron.
And the end of this should be inserted into the patient's mouth until the steam reaches the wound, over which it should be placed until the wound is sufficiently covered with vapor.
And immediately apply on those visible wounds until they are dry, and be careful not to perform this treatment at the beginning of an abscess's appearance, because it will be too early for the abscess, and you should not do this unless you have permission from the patient's doctor.
But if this instrument is not available to you, then take a reed and make a closed end on its tip with an egg shell, so that the patient's mouth may be covered, because the eggshell prevents the vapors from burning the mouth.
And this treatment is good for health.
Chapter .xxxviii.
Of the removal of thorns and water that stick in the throat, and other causes.
Visible wounds adhere in the throat or a thorn from fish bones or any other cause.
Then it is necessary for you to remove the water that is visible from those wounds, on which your sight falls, because after you press the tongue forward with an instrument, what is in the throat will be revealed to you.
And what is hidden in the throat and not visible to you, it is necessary that you make the patient vomit before the food has dissolved in the stomach, because quickly the cause attached to the throat will be expelled by vomiting; or let the patient swallow a piece of soap or a root of lettuce or a mouthful of dry bread; or take a piece of dried sea sponge and soak it strongly with oil, then make the patient swallow it, for when it reaches the place where the thorns are, they will be expelled. And then take an eel and have it bound in a cloth, and place it inside the mouth, and let it be extracted after some time; or take a leek and put it into the mouth, and afterwards remove it.
And if you are not forgetful of those causes which we have mentioned, then use a lead instrument according to this form:
And let it be thicker than a little ray [fish], and at the end of it let there be a cavity which you can insert into his mouth with ease.
And let him have his head raised up, and be careful that the touch of his bone in his throat does not cause it to enter his body or remove a bone or spine, or that which the physician holds with his hand.
However, since the patient who introduces it is better, due to his knowledge of the location of the attached cause, let him remove it downwards and draw his hand with the instrument upwards, all this according to the quantity that has been prepared inside until it is forgotten.
Chapter .xxxix.
On the extraction of a bloodsucking leech attached to the throat.
When a bloodsucking leech is treated with the water that we mentioned in the division of care with medicines and not with cautery, look then at the throat of the patient on the right side, after you have pressed the tongue of him with an instrument which we have recommended to you.
Therefore, if you see a leech, remove it with a small knife or fine tweezers gently.
And if you cannot remove it with that, then take a hollow canula and insert it into the patient's throat, and place a hot iron in the hollow part of the canula. Do this until the leech is dead and comes out of the throat, and let the patient abstain from water for the entire day.
Then take a full glass of cold water and open the patient's mouth with it, and wash the mouth with it; and do not let any of it go down the throat, and hold the water in your hand for about an hour, because the leech will soon feel the water and fall off.
But if it is not removed with the water we have recommended, then fumigate the patient with sulfur or asafoetida through the instrument which we have recommended for the fumigation of the uvula.
Do this until it falls off.
And there is another method of operation in the fumigation of that, which is that you take a basin with burning coals in it and cover the basin with a cover on which there is a hole, and place the end of the instrument through that hole; then put the fumigation on top. And have the patient place his mouth at the end of the canula, and close his mouth so that the fumigation is not lost until you know that the fumigation has reached the leech, because the leech will soon fall off.
"And if there is no improvement, then you should repeat the fumigation many times, and keep the patient from drinking, and have them eat salty and dry foods, and not drink water, and it is necessary that with this treatment the condition be avoided.
"And this is the shape of the instrument with which bloodletting from the goiter is performed when it is visible; and it resembles forceps as you see, except that in it there is some curvature. "The end of which is placed on the goiter, and its tip resembles the beak of a stork, which is blunt, and in it there are rough edges made with a file, so that when we press on any point, it does not slip.
"Chapter Forty.
"In which is the summary of the discourse on abscesses and their incision.
"Abscesses are many things, of many kinds, according to how they are remembered, each one being described in this book.
"And they are different in their incision and section according to two ways: the first way is based on the type of abscess itself, and the second way depends on the nature of the humors.
Here's the line-by-line translation of your provided text:
And there are certain abscesses that should not be perforated until near the end of the illness or their maturation.
Other abscesses should be opened when they are acute and have not yet matured according to their nature, such as those near the joints. When an abscess is near a joint, its being is prolonged until what is around it can escape. And the ligaments or nerves of that joint are easily corrupted, which causes contraction of that member; or it is near a main member, and if you delay opening it until it has matured into pus in the main member; or it is near the anus, so open it when it is not yet ripe. And do not open it crude, with undigested food, except for those near the anus, to prevent the excrement from coming out and being elongated into the inner parts of the anus, and becoming a fistula, or that which is made at its edge may not heal. However, you should know the time for opening an abscess, and this is when it has matured.
And know that it is mature when there is the ceasing of pain and fever, and also the diminution of heat and pulse, and the acuity of the abscess head, and the other signs.
And because you need to know that the perforation should occur in the lowest part below the abscess and pus, which comes from treating the swelling.
And the perforation should always be made along the length of the flesh or body, if the abscesses are in the parts of the hands or feet, and in places of the arms, of the cords of the nerves, of the arteries; and finally, in all those places which do not reflect; because in those that are reflected, use perforation according to that member.
But when the abscess is in a fleshy place, it is better to leave the perforation of it until its digestion has been confirmed according to what we have said; because if you perforate before that, the body of the pus and much filth will be prolonged, and it will be difficult to heal the edges of it which are hardened and the depth of it.
However, some abscesses must be perforated according to the thickness of the flesh or body due to necessity, or according to what the member requires.
And it is necessary that you administer a small perforation in small abscesses, and in large ones a great and wide perforation or many incisions according to the diversity of the size of the abscesses.
And others are of the apostemes in which it is necessary for the cup to be concave and cut, when done this way, it is as if a slice of bread, and it is done on time so that it does not scar, just like what happens with dropsy and buboes.
And of those that are cut with a section having three angles; and of those is the one which is cut like the figure of a myrtle leaf, just as the apostemes of the groins.
And there are those in which a round section and a lunar section are administered, similar to the previous ones.
However, that in which there is no such end as in the case of superficial apostemes, it is necessary that you pierce it with a superficial or flat perforation only.
And it is necessary that when the aposteme is large and has already collected much pus, you pierce it and do not hesitate to extract all the pus at that moment; having extracted from it a portion, and then close the aposteme until the next day, and then extract a larger portion, and then repeat this many times according to progression until it is fully healed.
Especially if the patient is of weak constitution, or a pregnant woman, or a small child, or an elderly person in decrepitude; because the vital spirit many times is resolved with the expulsion of pus, and it is very easy for the patient to die, and you open them.
Here is a line-by-line translation of the given medieval medical treatise:
Based on the pattern and language used in the provided text, here's a line-by-line translation of the new sentence:
"But if bleeding occurs during your operation, then you should administer cold water and vinegar mixed together on a cloth of linen, and place that over the site of the bleeding for many times.
"But if the bleeding persists, then you must administer treatment and care with powders that have been recommended in many places of this our book and division.
"But if it is in the time of winter and the location of the abscess is a place with many nerves, then you should soak powders in vinegar and hot oil and place them on the area.
"And if it is in the summer and the areas are fleshy, then you should place powders soaked in water and oil or vinegar and oil on them, ensuring everything remains cold until the third day, as we have said. Then you should open the abscess and clean it, administering to its treatment what is suitable for it until it heals.
"And this is what is necessary for the understanding of the treatment of abscesses in general, but according to the method of distinction I have already explained how each type of abscess should be treated specifically by chapters.
It seems like you are starting a new chapter or section with "Capitol .xli." This is likely an old-fashioned way of writing "Chapter 41" in Latin script. In modern English, it would simply be "Chapter 41." If there is more context or subsequent lines, please provide them so I can help you translate the entire passage.
"On the incision of abscesses that appear on the nape of the neck.
"On the nape of the neck are small abscesses, and they are a type of nodule that contains membranes around them; and their species are red.
"They have pustules, and these contain moisture similar to lime. "And these are the ones that contain moisture similar to dust, resembling them; and these are stony, hard.
"And in the incision of all of them, and in the removal of these, there is no fear, because their removal does not cause resistance.
"And the operation in the incision of these is that you should probe them with an instrument whose shape is similar to this one, which is called a trocar, until you know what they contain.
"Because if what it contains is moisture, then you should cut it open with a longitudinal incision according to its length for a superficial incision in this manner:
Based on the provided translation style and the sentence:
And then submerge the cloth in Egyptian ointment, if it is available, and if not, in water with salt; fill that wound with it and let it sit until the next day, because with water you will corrode everything that remains of that scab.
And then apply Egyptian ointment on that cloth repeatedly and continuously if you need it, until you are confident that there is no trace left of that scab; then heal the wound with ointment until it is healed.
And if an abscess contains thick pus, then you should incise it as follows: with an incision in the shape of a cross, and make an incision between the two lips of the incision and push it out from all sides, and exert your strength in extracting the membrane that contains it.
But if you encounter resistance while arching, then do what I have told you initially.
Similarly, do the same for an incised and healed abscess in terms of incision and treatment as we have told you; and incising on a healed abscess is lighter, because it has little blood and little moisture.
And sometimes there are some of these apostemas which are in the head of certain men with whom there is no moisture at all; the cause of this is that I once made an incision over an apostema in the head of an old woman and found the apostema to be like a hard, rough, white stone, which could not be pierced, and if someone were struck by it, they would suffer.
"But in other types of swellings that occur on the head, this chapter does not apply. For instance, swellings that appear on the heads of children are due to issues with the ears, but all these must be treated with a superficial section.
"And make the puncture in the lower part of them, so that the body is relieved of the illness in the lower parts.
And then treat those with water that is suitable for treatment.
"Chapter XLII
"On the incision of scrofula which occurs in the neck.
"Many times these swellings occur in the neck, in the armpits, and in the groin area; and sometimes they also occur in other parts of the body.
"And those that occur in the neck are of this kind, and many of them are generated between them, and all scrofula of these is within their own proper tunic, just as in the nodes and swellings of the head, as we have mentioned.
"And there are many types of these scrofula, for some of them are stony, and some contain moisture, and some are malignant and do not respond to treatment.
Based on the provided text and context, here's a line-by-line translation of the given sentence:
And it is of utmost importance that the vein or nerve not be cut.
And let the spatula not be too sharp, so that it does not cut into your hand during incision, or disturb the patient, and do not cut anything that is not necessary to cut; for if you were to cut a vein or artery and prohibit yourself from continuing the operation, then place on the wound powdered vitriol or other powders that stop blood flow, and compress the wound, and let it rest until the sharpness of the abscess subsides and the wound becomes soft and begins to suppurate. When the bleeding has stopped.
Therefore, return to your operation until you have completed it.
And then inquire with the patient's own words if there is any cause of other small scrofulous abscesses; therefore, incise and cleanse those as well.
And if there is a large vein near the scrofula, it is then necessary not to incise that scrofula from its root. Before that, it is necessary that you bind that [scrofula] with a strong folded cloth and leave it until it falls off by itself without harming anything.
And then fill the wound with old cloth that you have already soaked in Egyptian ointment, and then treat it.
And if you cut out that scrofula completely, then it is necessary that you join the two lips of the wound and suture it immediately so that no superfluity remains.
But if you see that there is still superfluity due to the size of the scrofula, it is necessary for you to understand how to cut the root of that, and then you will extract it and apply a stitch, as has been said.
And for those scrofulas that contain humidity, pierce them with a superficial puncture where you see the area of maturation, and place the puncture so that the pus can drain from the body, as we have said.
And then apply a puncture, clean with ointment and similarly to those, so that it corrodes what remains of the corruption. And then when you see the wound has been cleaned, treat it with ointment of flesh-generating until it is healed.
Chapter 43
On the section of the head of the abscess that occurs in the throat.
This text appears to be discussing a surgical procedure related to "epilhot," which is likely a misspelling or archaic term for a medical condition. The sentence suggests that while ancient authorities wrote about this procedure, it has not been witnessed or performed by anyone in their region. A possible translation could be:
And this is the written account of those words.
But in men with genitals, it is necessary to avoid removing the pubic hair, because if done so by water, it will not be helpful since all the veins and major organs of the patient are here.
But in those who have abscesses cauterized on the mouth or gullet or ears, when the illness is not in the throat, it is necessary to use the section of pubic hair to avoid loss which is done by suffocation.
Therefore, when we want to do this, it is necessary to incise the pubic hair leaving three circles of the circles of the pubic hair, or four with small section by width in that which is between two circles for quantity, so that the section be on the cartilage and not on the skin, and this place is convenient for section because it is devoid of flesh and its blood vessels are loose.
And if the physician is timid, it is necessary then that he stretch the neck of the gullet with an ounce, and afterwards tear the neck until it reaches the channel, but avoid the blood vessels if you see any of those causes.
Then incise the lips as we have described, and it is indicated on the section of the channel by the flame which is from that exiting with water which is disrupted in him and by the interruption of speech.
And leave the wound open for some time.
So when the time has passed during which perforation is feared, add two lips of the sheath of the wound and stitch only that without the skin.
Then administer medicines that promote the growth of flesh until it is healed.
And Albucasis says that the main point of what we have discussed is not to say that some of these tumors have already taken the throat of the patient and the patient has come close to death, and his breath has stopped, and some people go to cut the uvula so that the patient can breathe over the wound for some breathing, and he is saved from death.
And for this reason he orders the wound to be left open until the evil of the illness is consumed; and it lasts three days; and then he orders the wound to be sutured, and care for it until it is healed.
And what I myself have seen is that a servant took a knife and stuck it in his throat and cut off a part of the neck of the lung with it, and I was called to care for him, and I found the woman as one dies, and I discovered the wound and found blood coming out of the wound little by little.
"Therefore, I was told that there had been neither incision of a vein nor use of a catheter, and the wind came out of the wound, and I treated it until it healed.
"And do not hit the maid unless she coughs up blood, and then wait several days for her condition to improve.
"And now I say that there is no fear in the incision of the epileptic patient.
Chapter .44
"On the incision of an abscess that occurs on the throat externally, and is called a hernia of the throat.
"This abscess named hernia of the throat is a large abscess according to the body's complexion and is common in women.
"And it occurs in two ways: either naturally or accidentally.
"And in the natural case, it is not difficult to cure.
"And the accidental case occurs in two ways: one is similar to severe nodes, and the other way is similar to an abscess caused by the blockage of an artery, and in that case there is danger. "And it should not be assumed for anyone except those who are small. "And you should investigate that one with the said instrument, and if you find it similar to severe nodes and not connected to any veins, then you should incise it like nodes and extract it with water from the parchment or bladder; but if not, then its entire being is investigated thoroughly, and afterwards treat the area with healing water until it is healed.
The translation of "Capitol .xlv." is:
Based on the context provided, it appears that "De seccio" means "About cutting," "las specias" likely refers to a specific type of growth or nodule, and "nodes" is possibly related to swellings or knots in the body. A reasonable translation for this sentence could be:
Here's a line-by-line translation of your text:
And it is necessary that I explain the difference between nodes and exits when there is doubt.
Therefore, I say that with exits there is heat, fever, and violent pain until the excess of fluid is settled; and when putrefaction is complete, then the fever, pain, and heat cease.
But with nodes, there is no heat, fever, or pain; and this is what I call the lion's head that is in its own bag.
And it is according to the color of the body; its beginning is like a hailstone and it is made thus as a bubble, whether large or small, and there are two types of them because they are fatty and contain humidity, and the colors of the humidity are changeable, as I said in the division.
Therefore, when you arrive at the treatment of nodes, it is necessary to express this and inquire about its beginning with an instrument called an introme, as will be explained in the following chapter.
And this is the way to investigate apostemes and all nodes: take this instrument and insert it into the most humid part of the apostema, and turn the aforementioned slowly until you know that the instrument has already penetrated the cord.
And next, close your hand according to the size of the abscess, and then remove the bandages and observe what has emerged from it.
And if the discharge is forgotten, regardless of its color, then you should incise it with a superficial section as mentioned for other abscesses.
And if there is no discharge from the place of the bandages, then know that it is dry (or: in a state of dryness).
Make an incision on it in the form of a cross like this: as you have been taught, and hang it upside down, and peel off the skin from all parts easily, and preserve the hair or bag, if possible, on top of that, and remove the putrefaction with a needle.
But if it breaks during the operation, it is not possible to remove that putrefaction, and many times this happens, and then you must extract it piece by piece until nothing remains of it.
Because if any cause, little or much, remains, the needle will return according to the greatest amount.
And if you see that any small part remains, then fill the wound with some sharp and corrosive powders and press on the wound, and place a hot compress over it as an abscess plaster, and treat it with other remedies until it is healed.
And if it is a large wound, then you sew up both lips of the wound and treat it with carnation water.
But if there is an artery (pulsatile) or non-pulsatile vein, then you cauterize and fill the place of the incision with trisated glass (vitriol) and let it stay for two days or three until the wound improves and the blood boil subsides; then you return to cut what is firm of the node.
### Chapter 46
About the forms of necessary instruments for sectioning and perforation.
Of these are the forms of the instruments, and there are three types: one is large, another medium, and another small.
The form of the large instrument is as follows:
The form of the small instrument is as follows:
They are made of iron, with tapered ends that fit appropriately into the openings.
And these are the forms of the instruments, and they are called lancets, one of which is specifically called a bistoury.
And there are three types: one large, one medium, and one small.
Sure, I'd be happy to help with that! Let’s break it down line by line.
The form of an experienced physician, his form:
The form of an experienced few, his form.
Therefore, they should be for those who have abscesses, fissures, fistulas, and boils due to bone issues or other causes.
And they should be made as rings, large, round, like large needles with which the saddles are sewn, and they are made of bronze or iron or silver, and the best ones are when they are made of bronze.
And they are made by experienced physicians with black feathers, which are arranged in such a way that the fistulas are opened in their concavity, that they may be reflected with their lightness onto those reflections.
And there are three types of them: some are long, others medium, and others short, according to the width of the fistula and its constriction.
The form of a great experienced physician:
The form of a moderate experienced physician of lead.
The form of a small experienced physician of lead.
The forms of the hooks are of many types, for there are some simple ones, which have only one curve, and they are of three types: large, small, and medium.
And of them are made ointments, and they are from three species.
And of those that have two curves, they are made from three species.
And of them having three curves, they are made from three species.
And all these are necessary in their place.
Form of a small simple ointment, its form is:
Form of a large ointment having two curves: Form of a medium-sized ointment having two curves Form of a small ointment having two curves
Form of a large ointment having three curves
Form of a medium-sized ointment having three curves
And these are the forms of the scalpels with which nodes and apostemas are cut and scraped, and they are of three species: large, medium, and small.
"Form of large scalpel:
"Form of medium-sized scalpel:
"Form of small scalpel:
Here's the translation for the given text:
And these are the forms of bandages, and there are three types: large, medium, and small, as you will see.
They are made of linen and resemble a ray with which alcoff is made.
And at the tip it is pointed with a hidden spatula and on that one runs to the parts inside and outside, when you want, as you see.
The forms of the hidden needles, which are used between the said veins for the perforation of the apostems and are not felt by the patients, there are three types: large, medium, and small. And these are the forms of those [needles]:
The forms of the cups with which the flow of blood is stopped, and there are three types: large, medium, and small. Their forms are as follows:
They are made of citrus cloth, round with some length, and they are subtle.
And it is necessary that these types of cups should be ready for you, large, medium, and small, in order to stop the flow of blood quickly when needed, and then what was first medicine for you.
"However, do not use these to draw blood from all parts of the body, and use them only on fleshy areas, such as the calves of the thighs and hips, and the arms, breasts, belly, and ankles, similar to their fleshier counterparts.
"At other times, these instruments are made smaller like razors for physicians; through which blood is drawn when done by phlebotomy, or the incision of a vein or an artery.
"And at other times they are made round like this:

"About the care of men's breasts that resemble those of women.
"Sometimes the breasts of some men swell due to lack of sleep as they begin to grow, and then the breasts swell and resemble those of women, becoming firm and smooth.
"And for this, one should incise that area with a lunar section like this, from the line of .B. to the line of .G., and then drain all the pus, and then fill the wound with a red medicament, and then close the two lips of the wound with stitches, and care for it until it is healed.
Here is a line-by-line translation of the provided text:
Here is the first source sentence translated line by line into English:
It appears that the text provided is in a form of medieval Romance language, possibly an early form of Italian or Spanish, with some Latin influences. The provided sentence "Capitol .xlviii." seems to be a chapter heading indicating the 48th chapter of a medical treatise. A possible translation could be:
"About the treatment of abscesses that appear beneath the skin.
"These abscesses that appear beneath the skin are of the species of scrofula, hard, and contain a membrane called 'sac'.
"And of these abscesses, some contain moisture; and those that contain moisture should be incised with a lunar section according to this figure: from the line of G to the line of B. And when all of the liquid is evacuated from the abscess, then you fill it with cotton wool and wash it again on the following day.
"And then the cotton should be removed and the wound treated with an appropriate ointment until it is healed.
"And if the abscess is of the species that form knots and scrofula, then you should cut it open in the same way as we said in the section on scrofula.
"But if the wound is so extensive that it may cause gangrene, then administer to them cautery as we mentioned earlier.
"Chapter XLIX.
"On the incision of abscesses that occur from shooting or a vein.
When a bowstring is broken and the tendon that is above it becomes solidified, then swellings called abscesses often occur. And the signs by which inflammation or abscess are known to be from an artery or vein: because when an abscess is from an artery, it grows long in the chest; and when you try to remove the abscess with these words, you feel in it a hissing sound.
And that which is from a vein appears round on the surface of the body.
Cutting into this abscess is a mistake, especially for those below the armpits, in the groin, on the neck, and in many parts of the body; and it is large, so its treatment with iron should be avoided, and that which is in the extremities or on the head should be avoided.
However, for those caused by the inflammation of the orifice of the artery, make an incision in the tendon lengthwise; and then widen the incision with a hook towards the artery, and deliver the tunics until it is exposed.
Then place a needle over it and make it penetrate to the other side, and tighten the artery with double thread in two places—which I have seen you perform in the extraction of two arteries that are in the temples.
And then punch the spot that is between two ligaments with a spatula until all the blood comes out and the abscess has been dissolved.
And then administer care to the place where the pus has been generated, until the ligaments fall off; and then cure that with suitable ointments until it is healed.
And if the abscess is due to the dryness of a vein, then you should hold water as close as possible to the abscess with a cord, and then insert the needle under the place where you have held the water, and make it penetrate; and let there be a double thread until you extract that from the other side, and then bind the abscess with a good ligature as I have told you in the uva4 ligature of two parts with two ends of the thread.
But if you fear that the thread will be extracted, then insert the silk with that needle throughout all of the abscess from the first incision of the needle, and strengthen your threads in four places.
Then dry the abscess in its middle part until when it has been released from what is inside it, then you should incise the excess of the cord, and let what is tied to it go.
And then place on the patient's pillow, which you have soaked in wine and oil, and then administer the treatment that is made with leeches and ointments until they are healed.
Chapter 1 on the abscess that occurs due to a twist in the nerves.
Similarly, an abscess can occur in the tendon and in the vein, and likewise, an abscess can occur in the nerves when there is a blow to them or excessive labor, and similarly.
And it is most commonly found in the areas of the heels or the sole, or in any place where the joints are painful.
And it is a serious abscess, and its color resembles that of the rest of the body, and it is most commonly found in places without fatty tissue. When it is tight with intensity, the patient feels as if they are in a state of shock.
And it is not an abscess that is added to the front of the body, and for this reason the cord is left out, and he is distressed in all parts and does not go to the front or back parts.
Therefore, of those that are in the joints, it is not necessary for them to be filled with iron, because soon afterward it will cause a contracture.

"But if it is large, then suspend it with hooks, and remove the pus, and then close it; and adjust the wound with stitches, and cure it until it is healed.
"Chapter II.
"On the incision of an abscess that occurs in the region of the intestines that occur in the stomach.
"It happens to some people that warts are seen in the stomachs of those and in other parts of their bodies, which are called fungus-like due to their similarity to mushrooms, whose roots are subtle and the head of it is large; and already the lips of those are turned outward, and it is of those that are small, and it is of those that are very prominent.
"And I have already seen one, and in his stomach there were two such things which were more like mushrooms, and there was no difference between those whites, of small roots.
"And already the lips of those were turned outward and split open, and moisture ran from it all the time.
"Therefore I incised those and found in one eighteen inches, and in the other six inches.

And then carefully adjust in the constriction of the lead thread; thus, do not cease strengthening the large amount of lead until it is cut and falls by itself without effort.
But if it is of considerable size, then there is some cause for fear and dread, especially when it is located in the abdomen.
But perhaps you can cut most of it out, and then cauterize the area to prevent its return.
And then care for them until the wound is healed.
And be sure not to cut out that which is of dark color, causes little pain, and grows slowly, for it is also cancerous.

Chapter 52.
On the treatment of a protruding navel.
A protruding navel can be caused by several things: either by a fissure in the skin over the abdomen, from which fat or intestines may protrude as in other ruptures; or by blood that flows from a vein or artery as previously mentioned; or by trapped wind.
If the cause is a rupture of the cyst and the release of its contents, then the color of the abscess will be similar to that of the body; it swells without pain, and various things may appear from it. And if it is due to the protrusion of the intestine, then that situation will have a more intense variety compared to what we have mentioned before. When you press on it with your hands as described, it will be hidden, and then it will return; it is strongly attached in this way, and the entrance of baths and severe work are greatly praised.
But if it is due to moisture, then it will swell and not be hidden when pressed with your hand, nor will it be constricted or drawn in.
And if it is due to blood, then you will recognize the abscess by its dark color.
But if it is due to flesh rot, then the abscess will be heavy, large and hard, and it will resemble a fig in size.
But if it is due to gas, then touching it will cause swelling.
And the treatment of it is that you should consider whether the prominence of the navel is due to blood from an arrow or vein, or gas; in such cases, you should refrain from treating it, for there is danger and fear as has been taught to you in the chapter where I spoke about abscesses caused by arrows and veins.
Here's the line-by-line translation of the provided text:
And then lift the membrane of the swollen area above the intestine and insert your finger into that opening; and if you have found and secured the intestine, then extract it slowly and push the intestine back to its original place inside the abdomen.
And if you have found the membrane, then take it with a hook; and incise its excess parts.
But if it is contrary to your archery or vein, then encircle that spot with thread, and return to your operation; and take two needles and put in them two strong threads, and insert two needles into the circle you have made around the swollen area in the manner of a cross, causing them to penetrate; and then strengthen the swelling in four parts over the needles.
And if you wish, remove the needles and leave the spot open until the extended flesh shrinks and falls off by itself; or incise it when it is softened and swollen, and then treat it with water from the appropriate ointments until it heals.
And if the swelling of the navel is only flesh or due to moisture, then you should treat the swollen area as we have said and remove the blood or moisture found within it, and then treat it with water that will solidify the spot.
"Chapter 33
"On the care of crabs.
"We have already said, in the division, about the type of crab and in what manner it is cured with medicines, and that it is avoided in its cure with iron so that it does not become ulcerated; and we have spoken about crabs generated in the mother and the caution of their care.
"And the ancients said that sometimes crabs are in places where their eradication is possible, such as on the head which is in the breasts or in the thigh and resembling the members to remove all of it, and especially when it begins small.
"But when it is old and large, one should not approach it, for I have not been able to heal anyone from that, nor have I seen anyone else do so, nor has it come to my attention.
"And the operation on it is when it is allocated as we have said, that you precede and let the patient purge with black bile some times, and then bleed them if there is found an evident congestion.
"And then prepare the patient with the preparation in which they are located for surgery, and then prescribe for them the incisions that are necessary for that; and then excavate from all sides with a good cauterizing iron until no cause of its roots remains. E let the blood run, and do not stop it lightly, and press on the areas, and clean the thick blood thoroughly with your hand or with an instrument that you have at hand among the instruments.
And if there is an obstruction of thick blood in the vein or artery, then cauterize that area until the flow of blood ceases, and then treat it with another treatment until it is healed.
Chapter .4
On the care of people with dropsy.
We have already recounted in the division the types of dropsy from water, and the signs of each type, and the treatment with medicines.
And the one that is treated with iron is only the type of altiths alone, and it is not suitable to treat the tympanite or hypochondriac type with iron, because this is fatal.
And when you have treated this type of tympanite dropsy with medicines and your medicine is not effective, then consider that if the patient has already become weakened or has another type of dropsy along with it, such as cough or abdominal pain, then beware not to treat him with iron, because danger lurks in this.  (In other words, be cautious when treating patients who have multiple symptoms or conditions, as treating one condition with iron could exacerbate the others.)
If you see that the patient is overflowing with virtue and has no other illness except for dropsy alone, neither young nor old, then the manner of the operation on them is that you lift the patient between your hands, and then minister to him by pressing his belly with his hand, and pull the water from below the navel, and then take a thorny spatula like this:
It should be of two sharp ends, similar to a thorn; however, it should have some slight curvature so that during the operation with this tool, you do not enter into the intestine and injure it.
Then consider if the cause of the dropsy is from the intestines, for then it is necessary that you make an incision near the navel by three times at the lower parts, on the right side below the navel.
But if the cause of dropsy is from a liver illness, then your incision should be on the left side of the navel by three times.
And if the cause is from the spleen, then your incision should be on the right side.
And it is not necessary that your incision be on the side where the patient wants to be, so that the superfluities do not run to that cold place.
And then, perforate with the instrument all along the cord, and then introduce into that section, and lift your hand with a spatula between the cord and the sigmoid, and you will extract it; if the amount is about the size of a fingernail or so.
And then perforate the sigmoid until the spatula reaches the empty place, which is the location of the water. And then extract it and insert an instrument that has this shape: and it is similar to a fine silver cannula; it is made of silver or iron or bronze. At the bottom end of it there is a small hole, and on its sides there are three holes: two on one side and one on the other. The tip of it is sharpened like a quill pen, as you see:
And at the very top of it there is a ring, because when the instrument reaches the water, then that will immediately close off the instrument, so that in the same moment it evacuates the water in the most appropriate quantity, because if you evacuate more than is necessary at that time, the patient may die from the resolution of his animal spirit, or it may happen to him that he approaches death.
"But evacuate according to the strength of the patient, and based on what the patient's pulse and condition indicate to you.
"Then take out the instrument, and hold the water which causes [the problem], for as soon as it is retained by the cord which holds the tube that is on the top of the container (which has been shown to you), pierce it according to that manner.
"Then repeat the procedure on another day if the patient tolerates it, and extract a small amount of water each time, doing this for several days in a row, and be careful not to leave much water remaining.
"But if you fear for the patient and leave a large amount of water, then treat that with burial in hot sand, followed by immersion in a bath, and expose it to the sun for a long time; and treat it with drying medicines until it is healed.
"And cauterize the stomach and the spleen near the site of water extraction, as I have previously recounted.
Chapter 51.
"On the care of infants born with imperforate urinary passages.
Some times one of the children exits from his mother's womb and his head is not perforated (or it is tightly closed or not in its place).
Therefore, it is necessary to pierce with a fine needle as soon as he is born, following this method:
And then place a thin lead pin in the hole and tie it there, and hold it for three days or four.
And when he wants to urinate, remove it and let him urinate; then put it back.
And if you do not place the lead, it is possible that the urine which goes over this place will not heal this hole.
But that one whose hole is narrow should be treated with a lead pin, as we have said, for many days until it is enlarged.
But those in whom the hole is not in its place are called hypospadias, which causes the following: that he who was born with this hole has the end of his penis at the bottom of the shaft, so that he cannot urinate straight ahead, but rather must lift his penis upwards; and it is not good for him because the semen cannot reach the mother as it should be, and it is a very serious condition.
Certainly! Let's break down the text and translate it line by line:
And be careful in your operation to stop the bleeding, for many times this happens; and press on the wound with something that stops the blood, and care for the injury until it is healed.
Chapter 56.
Of the foreskin which occurs in the glans of the penis, and of the corruption and blackness and adhesion of the foreskin to the glans of the penis.
Many times this condition occurs in the penis, and it is a prominent mass of flesh.
And one type is malignant and the other is not malignant.
The non-malignant type, you should suspend it with a thin hook and cut it off until it is all removed; then place a cotton swab soaked in Egyptian ointment on it; and after that, treat it with diaphanic ointment until it is healed.
And if the foreskin is malignant, of dark color, then you should apply cautery near its base and root.
But if the foreskin is in the uncircumcised glans of the penis, and one part of the mass is inside the foreskin and the other part is outside, then you should remove the part that is inside at first until it is solidified; and then you treat the one outside, because when you treat both together with the foreskin, it is not certain that it will not recur.
Here's the translation of your provided sentence:
And then care for him with another treatment until he is healthy.
But if there is a flow of blood, then administer a lunar cautery in this manner:
Because the cauterizing treatment is effective for two conditions at once: it stops the flow of blood and heals the wound when it is infected.
And if the head of the penis is rotten and completely destroyed in that moment, then you must insert a lead tube into the opening of the foreskin so that the patient can urinate through it.
In the case of adhesion between the foreskin and the head of the penis (and this adhesion does not occur except in those who have a healthy foreskin, and are not required to be circumcised; and when it occurs due to injury or abscess), it is necessary to carefully separate with a blunt spatula until the adhesion is dissolved and the head of the penis is completely freed.
And if it is difficult to separate them perfectly, then it is necessary to carefully cut off some of the head of the penis and the foreskin with a spatula. This is because the foreskin, being thin, is easily torn due to its slight thickness.
Here's the translation of the given sentence:
And then it should be treated with six styptic substances until it is healed.
Chapter 57.
Of the cleansing of infants and the care for what happens to those who are circumcised.
Circumcision is not like other diseases: since it is done by our own hand and will, and it concerns infants above all, we must prescribe the best method and easiest way for them to heal.
Therefore, I say that the ancients did not write about circumcision in any of their books, because they did not use it in their laws. And this is only because we have acquired this knowledge through experience. That is why I have found most craftsmen and barbers using a razor and towels for circumcision and cleansing; and they use a bandage with honey and cauterization with the nail.
And I have tried all these methods and found no better cleansing than with scissors, and a bandage with honey for cauterization instead of the nail, because many times the glans escapes above, because the prepuce has two tunics, and the deeper tunic remains, and it is very easy to have another infection and pain. And with cleansing, which is done with sponges and is finger-like, the kind that shoemakers use, the incision at the end of the male member is not guaranteed, because it can easily enter its hole.
However, during the operation with a nail, you should be careful and avoid iron or your operation will be ruined. And the child's foreskin is short by nature, and many times there is no need for cleansing, and I have seen that.
But the cleansing done with scissors and bandages with thread, its goodness has been discovered by my experience, because the scissors are of proportional incision, for this reason the sharpness that is above is like the sharpness that is below; and therefore when you press your hand so proportionally between the two sharp edges, and cut accordingly in one motion; and a compression of the thread with a figure containing the foreskin from all sides, with which nothing goes wrong.  />
And the manner of the first operation is that you make the child stand up straight if he is one of those who understand a little, and do not do anything other than tie the thread around his penis, and leave it like that until the next day.
"And then make that person cheerful in every possible way, so that they may regain their consciousness. And immediately make that being between your hands to be prepared and not at all clumsy; and hide the scissors in your hand or behind your foot, so that the child does not see those or any other of the instruments.
And immediately insert your hand into the patient's anus and blow into it, then pull out the scissors so that its handle comes out as well; and then clean away whatever filth has accumulated in it due to dirtiness.
The shape of the scissors for cleaning, this is what it looks like:
Here's a line-by-line translation of the given sentence:
But the mistake in cleansing is that if you quickly remove all or part of the inner membrane, you must make an incision.
Therefore, it is necessary for you to spread that area with your finger before the inflammation of the place and cut it equally.
And if you cannot hold it with your finger, then extract it with a hook and cut it.
But if three days have passed and there is still swelling beneath the inflamed area, then leave it alone until the inflammation subsides, and gently scrape away the dead tissue, and cut it as you see fit.
And be careful of the head of the vein, for it will not be good for him.
Therefore, treat it with something that consolidates the wound, such as the powders we have described in the treatise on powders.
And if the incision has been made too deeply and you follow the above instructions, it will not hurt him.
And continue to treat it with what we have said until it is healed.
Chapter LVIII
On the care of retained urine in the bladder.
Retention of urine in the bladder is caused by obstruction due to a stone or congealed blood, or by swelling or tumor, and similar to what we have said about the ways of treatment in the division.
And if the urine is not dissolved by the water we have mentioned and a strong cause is made on the patient, then it is necessary to administer extraction with an instrument called a syringe, of which this is the form: It should be of silver and very fine in its curvature, like a quill from a bird's wing with a thinness similar to a long ray, about half a palm in length, at the end of which there should be a fine tube.
Here's the translation of the provided text:
And make the patient lie on his back, and insert his bladder and penis with moistened oils, olive oil and rose water.
And then introduce the catheter easily until it reaches the tip of the penis; and then bend the penis down towards the navel; and then push the catheter into that; and then push it in until it reaches the bladder, and the patient will know when it has reached an empty space, and this is not done according to a specific order, but rather follows the curve of the passage.
And then gently draw out the catheter with the wool little by little, because the urine will soak the wool.
Then extract it and use this for treatment: use the catheter without stopping until the bladder is completely emptied and the patient finds relief.
Chapter .59
About the technique of bladder irrigation with the syringe and similar instruments that are suitable for this purpose.
When there is an ulcer or abscess in the bladder, or congealed blood, or a tightening of the skin, and you wish to instill water and medicines into it, this should be done with an instrument called a syringe, and its form is as follows:
"until there is numbness at the extremity of the patient, it is closed. And in this way there are three holes: two on one side, and thus you see.
At the beginning it is a hollow cavity, within which something is located that has been expelled, and this happens according to the quantity that is applied, without addition, until when some cause pulls from the humidities, then it is pulled out, and when it is expelled, then with this it is pulled out, and when it is expelled for a long time, like a grappling hook with which in naval battles naptha is thrown into the battle.
Therefore, when you want to prevent humidity in the bladder, insert the tip of the grappling hook into the humidity, and pull out with it the substance that is expelled towards the parts above, because the humidity is pulled into the cavity of the grappling hook.
And then insert the tip of the grappling hook into the penis as we have recommended in the surgery; and then expel the humidity with what you expel, because that humidity reaches the bladder immediately, and the patient feels it.
The shape of the subtle cystery with which the bladder is covered, and this is its form:
And it should be made of silver or lead, with the end resembling a small feather, and then insert it inside gently.
Then take the bladder of an animal, place in it the moisture that you want to congeal inside the bladder, and then tie it tightly with a double thread, and heat that moisture over the fire.
Then insert the end of the instrument into the wound.
Then press your hand against the bladder with the moisture until the patient feels that the moisture has reached the bladder.
But if you do not have a bladder, then take a piece of parchment and make a circle from it; and perforate it all around its circumference; and then insert strong thread through those holes, so that they are turned over; and then sew the circle as if it were sewn together, because you place in it whatever you want of the moistures, oils, and waters.
Then you tie that in the instrument and use it as you have done with the bladder, and press with your hand until the moisture reaches the bladder.
It seems like the text is in Occitan, a Romance language spoken in southern France during the Middle Ages. Based on the given translation and the pattern of the text, here's my best guess for "Capitol .lx.":
Of stone removal.
We have already mentioned in the division the types of stones and their treatment with medicine, as well as the difference between stones formed in the kidneys and those formed in the bladder, and the signs of this.
And we have described the stone for which surgery with the hand and cutting is performed.
And the stone formed in the bladder specifically is that which is lodged in the bladder.
And I will describe it with a clear explanation and summary.
Therefore, I say that stones formed in the bladder are most common in children. The signs of this are that the urine that comes out of the bladder is like water in its fineness, and sand appears in it; and the patient often touches his penis, and he often turns away from the genitals, and he often sits down with a bent posture, and with this, they make holes in their buttocks.
And the treatment of children from that [condition] is effective until they reach fourteen years old; and it is difficult to cure in the elderly. However, in youths it may be done with this because of what is between them.  (This line seems somewhat ambiguous or incomplete, so a more accurate translation might require additional context.)
And regarding the one for whom the stone is larger and the cure is easier; if it is small, it is contrary to that.
Therefore, when we come to the cure of that, it is necessary at the beginning of that for us to cleanse the patient with a clyster that extracts all the swelling that is in their intestines; because sometimes this swelling prevents the expulsion of the stone due to its search.
Then the patient should be taken by their feet and raised up so that the stone descends to the bottom of the bladder, or moves from its place sometimes.
Then make that incision between your prepared hands, and let the patient's hands be under their hips, so that the entire bladder leans towards the parts below.
And then search for it and remove all of it.
Therefore, if you feel the stone in the space, then quickly make an incision over it.
And if you do not catch all of it with your touch, then it is necessary that you anoint with oil the index finger of your left hand, whether the patient is a child or the middle finger if they are a mature youth, and insert that into their anus. "And examine the stone until it is below your tongue. "And turn that (the stone) little by little into the neck of the bladder.
"And then press on it with your finger, and expel it through the incision made in the appropriate location.
"And command the assistant to press on the bladder with their hand; and command another assistant to stretch the testicles with their right hand and, with their other hand, move aside the cord that is beneath the testicles, in the place where the incision is made.
"And then insert a spatula with an edge like this one: "And cut into it what is between the anus and the testicles, not in the middle but before the left hip bone; and let the incision be on that stone, and your finger should be in the anus, and the incision should be transverse, so that the incision outside is wide and inside narrow according to how much of the stone can be removed from it without difficulty, and no more, because when you press with your finger which is in the anus, the stone will come out without difficulty.
And know that there is a certain stone with angles and edges, making it difficult to extract from the body.
And of that kind, there is one resembling a grain, and it is round, making its extraction easy.
Therefore, if it has angles and edges, insert it into the crack.
And if it is not forcibly expelled in this way, then you should apply force on it or press on it gently with a tool whose tip is like a file, and do not let it escape; or insert a fine curved tool underneath it.
But if you cannot do this, then widen the hole a little bit, and if you see blood flowing, cut it off strongly with pulverized vitriol.
But if the stone is more than one, then at first you should press your hand against the mouth of the bladder, and then cut it open; and then press on it a little bit; and do the same thing if there are more than two stones.
And if the stone is very large, it is ignorant to cut it with a large incision, because this can cause one of two things to happen to the patient: either death or continuous dripping of urine, because the area is not fully healed.
Based on the pattern from the given translations and my knowledge of medieval medical treatises, I can provide a translation:
So when you have completed your operation, then fill the wound with aloe gel and dragon's blood, and secure it tightly. Then place a cloth infused in oil and wine, or in warm oil and cold water, on it to help the abscess heal.
Then place the patient on their back, and do not remove the bandage until the third day.
And when you have removed it, wash the area with water and a little oil, and then treat it with diaphanic ointment and diabolic ointment until it is healed.
But if in the wound an abscess forms, which is hot and corrosive, and it appears as if the blood is frozen in the bladder, and because of this urination is blocked (and this is known by the discharge of blood with urine), then insert your finger into the wound and extract that blood, for if it remains, it provokes the bladder to corrupt both the bladder and causes putrefaction in the patient.
Then wash the wound with vinegar, water, and salt, and apply a poultice of every kind, with what is appropriate for him in his healing until he is healed.
And it is necessary during all of the treatment that you lie both cushions and adjust the medicines which are placed on the area.
And if the stone is small and it is in the bladder, and it is fixed there, and holding back urine is forbidden, then cure that with water that I recommend before you reach dryness, because excessive use of this treatment has been accused of causing dryness; and I have tested this, and it is that you take an iron perforator, which looks like this:
A triangular tip, sharp, fitted into a handle.
Then take a thread, and tie the bladder with it below the stone to prevent it from returning to the bladder.
Then introduce the iron into the bladder, easily perforating until the perforator reaches that stone. And rotate the perforator with your hand little by little on that stone, and you will pierce its opening until it passes to the other side; for the urine will be released immediately.
Then press your hand on what is left of the stone outside the bladder, because it is broken and has been expelled with the urine, and the patient is cured.
If this treatment is not available to you for any reason that prevents you from using it, then tie a rope below the stone, and another rope above the stone. Then press down on the stone in that fork between two ligatures. Then extract that. Then untie the ligature and cleanse the congealed blood which has formed in the wound.
And it is not necessary to tie the rope below the stone unless it is to prevent it from returning to the bladder, and the other rope above unless, when the rope is untied near the edge of the stone, the cord returns to its place and covers the wound.
And for this reason it is necessary for you when you tie the rope above to lift the cord to the divided parts above, or you must return to your position and cover the wound as we have said.
Chapter LXI.
Of the Extraction of Stones in Women
Stones in women are rarely generated.  But when they do occur, they are often found in the bladder.
But if a stone is seen in any of them, then its cure is difficult and is forbidden by many ways.
Here is my attempt at translating this line:
The second reason is that you will not find a woman who is well-versed in medicine unless she herself becomes a doctor when chaste, or if she is among the women who have husbands.
The third reason is that you will not find a woman who is skilled in this art, especially in operations using the hand.
The fourth reason is that the location of the cut on a woman's foot is far from the location of the stone, requiring a deep cut, which is risky in this case.
However, if necessity compels you to do so, then it is necessary that you take a female doctor who is well-versed in this, and such women are rarely found.
But if you are without such a woman, then seek out a subtle and careful doctor, or present a well-educated midwife who is experienced in the ways of women, or a woman who has some knowledge of this art.
Therefore, present her and command her to do everything that you tell her, from the inquiry about the stone at the beginning; the reason for this is to check if the woman is a virgin, in which case the doctor should insert her finger into the woman's vagina and search for the stone.
Therefore, if she finds it, let her remove her finger and then command her to make an incision over that spot.
Here's a line-by-line translation of the given sentence:
Therefore, if it is found, then it should be gradually released from the orifice of the bladder to the divided parts with the utmost care until it reaches the level of the abdomen.
Then make an incision on that area of the abdomen at the level of the abdomen where the stone is located and place a weight on it, and let him not move away from the weight for any reason.
And the incision should be small at first; then introduce the hook into that incision. If you feel the stone, then widen the incision according to the size you know the stone will come out of it.
And be aware that the types of stones are many, for they can be few or many, smooth or rough, long or round, and have edges.
Therefore, you should know which type it is by what you feel about it.
And if you see blood flow, apply powdered vitriol to the area and let it sit for an hour until the bleeding stops, then return to your operation until the stone is expelled.
And prepare yourself with the instruments that are mentioned in the text on the removal of stones from men, so that you may be assisted by them during your operation.
If you see a flow of blood and know that the expulsion of the blood is from an artery that has been cut, then place powder on the area and compress it with cloths and bandages tightly to stop the bleeding, and do not repeat this; and leave the stone and do not remove it, because soon the patient will die. And then treat the wound.
So when the bleeding has subsided after some days and the area is dry, then you can return to your operation to remove the stone.
Chapter 62.
On section for incarcerated hernia.
A hydrocele is nothing but an accumulation of fluid in the white bag that is below the cord of the testicles containing the testicle, and it is called a bag.  (Hernia in this context likely refers to hydrocele, a type of hernia involving fluid buildup around a testicle)
And sometimes it is in the proper skin that nature has prepared for the testicle until another testicle descends; and it is the cord of the testicle between the white bag that we have mentioned, and this is not called hydrocele but tard.
And the origin of this hernia is due to weakness that occurs in the groin area, because this material is infused into those areas, and sometimes it happens due to a blow made on the groin.
And this humidity has various colors, for its color is either turning yellowish or reddish, or red, or it is black and foul-smelling, or it is watery white, and that is what is most common.
And the signs by which this accumulation of water is known are these: for if it is in the white cyphac which we have mentioned, then the abscess is round, leaning slightly to one side like a hen's egg, and it appears on the groin, because the humidity collects there from all parts.
And if the humidity is in the proper layer of fat, then the abscess is round like half an egg, and by this it is judged to be another type of egg.
And if the humidity is between the cord and the white cyphac, then leave it alone.
And when you wish to know the color of the humidity, then you test the color of the humidity in the abscess with a lancet, whose form is described before; and according to what appears on the track of the lancet, judge what is inside it.
When we come to the care of him with a fever, it is necessary to order the patient to be bloodletted if possible, and sometimes empty his body of its contents.
And then have him lie on his back with his head raised slightly on something, and place soft cloths underneath him.
And then sit on the left side of him, and command the assistant to sit on his right side, who should extend their arm to one of two sides at the level of the groin and the beginning of the belly button.
And then take a broad spatula, and split the groin of the genitals from the middle place to the length until almost the penis.
And let the section be made equally straight at a distance from the line that separates the skin of the genitals, until it reaches the white cord, which is enclosed.
And remove that, and observe, and take care not to cut into it; and your incision with which you cut should be made in such a way that it is suspended by the most and subtly examined with the incision according to the amount possible for you.
And then pierce the white cord full of water with a wide hole, and remove all the water.
And then separate between two lips of the section with a hook, and extend the thread to the parts above; and do not touch the skin where the genitals are located, and cut the thread in such a way as is possible for you. And cut it entirely or in pieces, and especially its thin part, because if you do not carefully examine the cutting of it, it is not certain that the water will not return.
But if the water proceeds from that outside of its skin during your operation, then when you have completed the cutting of the thread, return it inside, and then close the two lips of the genital skin with a suture, and then cure it as with the other wounds, until it is healed.
And if you find the water corrupted by another disease, then it is necessary for you to tie off the vessels which are above the suspenders, and extract the water, and then cure it with the water that we have mentioned.
But if the water is accumulated in two parts simultaneously, then know that there are two hernias; therefore cut that part in the same way as you have done with the other one; and if it seems to you that it is one operation, then do it.
And now you clean the blood, and insert into the incision wool soaked in oil or rose oil; and place another wool on top, which you have soaked in wine and oil, and spread it over the genitals and the pubis of the abdomen; and place a cloth folded and sprinkled with powder on top, and tie all this with a bandage according to this method:
And then take two cloths and dampen them with wool according to this manner; make the edges with which you press on cotton or dampened wool, and add strength in the groin of the undergarments, and one end takes from the anus inside to the back, and the second takes at the division of the thigh, and two ends below and two other ends above, and all the bandaging should be adjusted in the groin of the undergarments.
And sometimes this hernia is treated artificially with a cauterizing iron in place of a scalpel; and it is that you take a thin cauterizing knife and inscribe with it the cord of the testicles, and it is ignited as we have instructed until the white cyst containing water is revealed, and then you take a cautery in this manner: And it resembles Greek letters.
Then pierce with that cautery tool, and heat until all the moisture is expelled.
Then extend the cautery tool with tongs, and scrape with tongs, and cauterize with a fine-heated cautery; and cut that second part as much as possible until you completely remove it; and be careful so that the fire does not touch the bone.
And know that this operation is safer and longer-lasting in terms of blood flow, and better than an operation with incision.
But if you encounter an abscess during the incision or cautery, or if there is bleeding, then it is necessary for you to treat whatever opposition occurs to you accordingly, with the treatment that suits him as described.
But if the patient is fearful and does not expect the second operation because of its horribleness, then administer the perforation as we recommend this; and it is when you are certain, by what we have said about the signs, that that hernia is watery.
Then it is necessary for you to make the patient sit on some raised seat, then pierce the abscess in its lowest part with a wide lance, and hold the perforation according to the length of the body.
And it should be a wide opening so that all the water flows through.
And then press on the wound and tie it off with a cloth, allowing the remaining water to flow out. And then care for it until the wound is healed.
But if there is resistance to the drainage of water at that time, you should puncture it: and this is only done because the white fat in the orifice of the wound causes resistance and prevents the outflow of water, therefore you must insert into the wound a probe or an instrument with which water is extracted from blisters, as described above; or adjust a small tube to the pressure of the wound.
And know that the water will return, and it should be punctured again after six or seven months; and when it has returned, then it should be punctured in the same manner, because the patient will thus pass their days.
Chapter 63.
About cutting into a fleshy hernia and its treatment.
Know that in cutting into this fleshy hernia, the danger lies in the greatest measures; therefore, it is my experience that the dismissal of it and being saved by it is the best option.
And I am reminded of the procedure for that and the species of abscesses.
Therefore, I say that abscesses occur in the bodies of those whose humors are imbalanced and this happens for various reasons: either due to an acute bitter superfluity which is infused into the humors, or due to a strike.
And its color corresponds to that of the body, and if pain is found in it, then it is a serious abscess.
And when it is a hard abscess, which is known as lapificada, its color is dark, and one does not feel pain in it.
And sometimes it occurs due to the knotting of the arteries, and through such inflammation that its memory is already perceived, or through the inflation of veins.
However, what is caused by the inflation of arteries can be recognized by the dispersion of the abscess when it is pressed with the fingers mentioned earlier; and it should not be touched.
But that which is caused by the inflation of veins does not disperse at all, even with compression using the fingers mentioned earlier.
And it is possible that incision may be performed on this type of tissue as well as on other fleshy parts; and it is that you should cut the cord of the humors, and then spread the egg over the separated parts, and extract from it the white membrane, and deliver the suspenders of the vessels, and tie them off, and incise the suspenders after you have delivered those from all the parts of the egg.
Therefore, if the egg is already set with those meats, then you should extract the egg and place it [back?] there.
Therefore, if there is an adhesion between the bowels or between the intestines, then you should free all that adhesion and insert it through a round incision.
But if it is a growth of flesh at the site of the adhesion that is behind, then you should insert all that is from it, and extract the egg as we have said.
Therefore, when your operation is completed, then fill the wound with wool soaked in rose oil and wine; and then care for it with the other treatment until it is healed.
Chapter .64.
Of the treatment of a hernia that is in the bladder.
Aposteme is an inflammation enclosed by some membrane resembling a bud with the softening of the testicles, and it makes difficult movements and walking on the patient.
And in the treatment of this disease, care is taken due to that from which it is preceded by memory.
However, we must say operation on it according to what the first [doctors] did.
This passage is discussing a treatment for testicular pain or discomfort. Here's a line-by-line translation:
And then immediately cut with a sharp scalpel through a transverse section on the right side of the veins until the veins are exposed.
And then scrape everything as we have said in the removal of arrows that are in the temples.
And then insert into them a needle with a double thread, and tie the first one at the beginning of the place where the event occurred, and tie another time at their end. And then cut those in the middle by a straight section according to the length of the body, and extract what has been added from the fetid and corrupt humors.
And then treat the wound with the treatment of other wounds in which you want to generate healing so that the vessels that cause one of two kinds [of illness] may fall, for it is not bad because of this.
But if the injury affects all the vessels, then it is necessary that the testicles be removed or that the testicles be tied off with the vessels, so that they are deprived of all nourishment because of the cutting of the vessels, and that they become atrophied, or that they be tied off so that there is no connection with them.
I apologize, but without the actual text from "Capitol .lxv." I cannot proceed with a translation or guess its meaning. Please provide the specific text you'd like me to translate or interpret, and I'll be happy to help!
This sentence translates to:
The occurrence of this hernia is due to a section that extends on the belly from the sides of the navel, because the intestines, descending from that rupture, reach some intestines.
And this rupture is either of the navel or of its excavation, and these two types occur for many reasons: blows, jumps, loud noises, or significant elevations, or similar circumstances.
The sign of this, when it is an extension of the navel, is that it occurs gradually over a long time, and does not occur suddenly, because the navel presses on the intestine.
The sign of this is when it occurs as a result of a section of the navel, because at the beginning it causes sudden and intense pain; it appears as a diverse lump beneath the cord, and this is due to the protrusion of the intestine, with its body partly outside the navel.
Sometimes it is accompanied by the intestine, and this type of hernia is called an inguinal hernia.
Sometimes it is caused by gas, and sometimes a tear occurs in the intestine, which gets stuck there, causing great harm to the patient, and sometimes it causes severe pain, especially when pressed.
In the treatment of this disease with iron, there is fear, so it should be avoided in that case.
And the manner of performing this operation is to command the patient to return the intestine with their hand to its inner parts if it obeys the retraction, and then place your hand over their neck between your hands, and raise their thighs.
Then stretch the cord that is the cord of the testicles upward, and cut through the entire length of the cord of the testicles; then place two needles in the lips of the incision to hold open the incision with them.
And if the incision, according to its size, is such that from it the testicle can be removed.
Then scrape away that chaff which is left behind the cord of the testicles until the white hard substance from each side is exposed.
Then insert your finger into that which is the testicle, that is between the white substance and the cord of the testicle, and separate it from the adhesion that is behind the testicle.
And next, place your hand on the spermatic cord at its exit point, and with this, extend the white cloth in your left hand, and lift the testicle with the cloth to the incision site; command the assistant to extend the testicle further and you will dissolve the adhesion behind it with a complete solution.
And be sure, as you said, that there is no cause for the intestine to be wrapped in the white cloth tightly. But if you find any such cause, then peel it off from his belly.
And then cut into the area below the testicles so that blood and pus flow out, as we have recommended in what has been said.
And then administer wool soaked in oil and place it on the wound; and apply the ligature that we have recommended (and sometimes the white thread is cauterized, which we mentioned near the incision to prevent bleeding, because often this happens). And leave the ligature until it falls off by itself.
But if the scab formation is delayed, then soak it in hot water and place it on the wound until it falls off, as we have said.
And then treat the wound with the other remedy for wounds until it is healed.
Chapter 66
On Hernia Ventosa (Wind or Gas Hernia)
In this type of hernia, it has not been seen that anyone has been cured by using iron.
Here's the line-by-line translation of the provided text:
And treat the wound according to what we have said until it is healed.
Chapter .67  (This assumes "Capitol" refers to a section or chapter number, as in medieval texts.)
About the distortion that occurs in the ankles.
Sometimes there is a rupture in the ankles as we have said, and it protrudes from the area.
And do not give any cause to the testicles for the intestines; and if it is given, it is little; and it returns in all hours.
But if the time with this is prolonged, there is an appropriate cleft in the cavity until the intestine descends into the cavity; and this happens due to the extension of the cavity which is in the ankles as we have said, the cause of which is that the cavity is extended, and it becomes softened and the area is swollen and protrudes.
And its treatment is with a cautery as described in the previous account of it.
And sometimes it is treated with iron in this manner: and it is that the patient lies on his back between your hands, and then dry the area of the protruding rupture of the swellings with a section according to the width for the quantity of three fingers.
And then strengthen the white cloth that is below the pillow until it is uncovered.
And then take the reed and place it on the prominent part of the cloth, and press it against the stomach.
And then sew the two prominent places on the end of the cloth of the reed together with stitches.
And then remove the end of the reed, and do not sew all of the cloth together, nor should you extend the hole, or anything similar, as I will make you understand in the treatment of intestinal hernia.
And then treat it with the treatment for wounds, and when you have sewn the threads, clean it and restore the wound until it is healed; because the cloth is tight and the prominence of the rupture is not adjusted.
A cautery is better in this place, because it is closer to health.
Chapter 68
Of softening the testicles' scrotum
Often the scrotum of the testicles in some men is softened because the flesh within it is softened, and he is well cared for.
Therefore, it is necessary for the one who is skilled in his treatment to make the patient lie down according to his back, and sew up all of the softened scrotum on top of the natural scrotum; and then sew together two lips with stitches.
And if you wish, in the beginning, soften the swollen area with three or four cookings and with a firm stitching.
And then cut between the stitches; and then care for the other illnesses until he is healed and the threads fall out.
Chapter 69.
Of Castration.
Know that castration is forbidden in our law, but I have been informed of it because of two reasons: one is so that this will be known by the doctor when he is asked about it, so that he knows how to treat the person to whom this has happened; and the other reason is that we often have need of castrating other animals for our benefit from them, such as horses, oxen, pigs, and similarly with animals.
And so I say that castration is done in two ways: either by ligature, or by incision and excision.
But in the case where it is done by ligature, the way to do the operation is that we should make the animal fast until its testicles are softened and lengthened and hang down. And then take those with your hand until they are resolved and do not appear under the touch.
But in castration by incision and section, you must hold the animal and press its spermatic cord with your left hand.
Then tie off the suspensory ligament, and cut through each testicle with a single incision until both testicles are processed.
And then cut those pouches that you have skinned from each one. And do not leave any of the fat on them, except for a thin layer that is on the vessels.
And this method of castration is better when done by crushing, because crushing strongly removes any cause from the testicles so that the animal does not desire coitus.
Then care for the wound until it is healed.
Chapter .70.
On the treatment of hermaphroditism.
Hermaphroditism in men occurs in two ways: one is when there is a space between the spermatic cord of the testicles, in which a vagina appears like that of a woman with pubic hair.
E algunas vegadas de aquel corr urina le qual es en la codena dels testiculs.
In women, it is different: the vulva of the woman resembles two male testicles, except that they are somewhat smaller at the point where they protrude, similar to the penis and testicles in men.
And the treatment is of three types: two from men and one from women. And it is necessary that you place those tight muscles, until the swelling subsides, and then treat them with the cure for other diseases.
And in the second type of men, where there is urine in the head of the testicles, there is no cure or operation for it.
Chapter 21.
About swellings and prominent flesh due to women's causes.
A strong swelling is placed on natural causes until it is exhausted and the observation is made; sometimes it becomes prominent in some women to such an extent that it spreads like in men, and reaches up to the vagina.
Then you must hold the excess of swelling with your hand or oil and place it inside.
And do not proceed with insertion, especially at the beginning of the vagina, to avoid causing a blood flow.
And then care for it with remedies for plague until it is healed.
However, flesh born is flesh that is born in the horror of the mother until it fills up, and it is easily expelled to the parts outside according to its likeness (and for this reason some call it "malformed tail"); therefore, we must deal with it as we deal with lentils, and care for it until it is healed.
Chapter 72.
Of the treatment of arthritis.
Arthritis is when the woman's vagina is not perforated, or it is too small. And it can be either natural or accidental.
Accidental is due to a previous illness, and this can occur from either poorly fitting flesh or from thin or thick tissue.
And it can be found in the womb of the mother, or in her pelvic bones, or above them, or below them, and it prevents intercourse and conception and childbirth, and it also greatly prevents menstruation.
And knowledge of this is obtained by the midwife's observation, if the swelling is obvious, then it is easy to see; but if it is not obvious, then you should seek it with your fingers or a rod.
"But if the abscess is caused by a subtle wound and is close to both lips, then you cut and drain it.
"And you place on the two lips powders, and then place your said fingers of both hands together.
"And the woman should be on her back, with her legs spread apart, and then forcefully pull the two lips apart until that subtle wound is broken open and the abscess is drained.
"And then take wool and dip it in oil and place it on the area, and bandage it with a cloth for the day to prevent the incision from healing.
"But if the wound is large and thick, then you should cut it with a spatula or with a myrtle leaf.
"But if the abscess is caused by a splinter, then suspend it with tweezers and cut it open.
"And you should have with you the medicines that stop bleeding without biting, such as agrimony, dragon's blood, and dock leaves, mixed with egg white.
"And then administer a wide lead pipe so that the wound is not healed too quickly.
And have him hold it for several days and administer a dry substance to him.
And then let it be treated with another remedy for strengthening until it is healed.
And sometimes this occurs during the major growth of other flesh, and then one should proceed according to this manner. But if this is due to a cancerous tumor, the cancerous tumor which is in the major part should not be interfered with in any way.
Chapter 73
On the treatment of hemorrhoids, tail, and red boils which occur in the woman's vulva.
Hemorrhoids are called the openings of many veins, from which flows much continuous blood; and when hemorrhoids are old and swollen with fluid.
And I have already said in the division the species of those and their signs, and now I will say which ones receive treatment and which ones do not receive treatment.
Therefore, I say that hemorrhoids and swellings, when they are in the interior of the major part and do not appear to the touch, then on those no treatment should be done at all.
But those which are in the womb of the mother and on which sensation is felt, those are cured.
And it is necessary that you put the woman in greater cold and then extract with the scissors or with rough cloth, and cut those with the razors.
And then sprinkle over those the flows of blood from one of the slicing powders without bitterness, such as marshmallow and similar to those.
And then wrap her feet for an hour, and then put that in cold water.
And if the bleeding persists, then have her sit in a decoction of sumac and pomegranate peels, and of roses and similar things.
And then take barley flour and mix it with honey and vinegar, and make a poultice with water on the back of him.
And if the bleeding has stopped, it is good; and if not, then apply with two cupping glasses, and to the nipples without scarification.
And then take wool and soak it with coriander juice or with celery juice or with garlic juice with vinegar and apply to the place; and then treat the place with ointment until it is healed.
"And cure that which is inside so that it may be healed.
Chapter 74
"If a puncture occurs in the uterus.
"Many types of abscesses can occur in the uterus, such as cancer, lapindent abscesses, ulcers, herpes, fistulas, hemorrhoids, gout, typhus, and other abscesses. "And I have already described these illnesses and their types, and the signs of them, and their treatments in the previous sections.
"And it is fitting that I should speak in this treatise about a cold abscess that occurs in the uterus when it is one of the healing abscesses, and if you wish to know how its operation is performed with iron.
"Then you should consider if the pain of the abscess in its beginning is sharp with swelling and fever, and if there are redness and sensitivity over it, then do not cut it with a perforation, and cure it with something that helps with maturation until the acuteness of the symptoms ceases.
"Then you should make the woman lie on a small pillow that has two pillows; and let her lean back on her buttocks and adjust her feet to be lower than her belly, and her thighs should be spread apart, and place her arms below her elbows, and tie each one with a bandage of suitable water.
Here's the translation for the given sentence:
And it is necessary that when you want to administer this instrument, you insert it with the ray of the mother of the woman, and that which enters into the mother should not be more than the ray of the mother and leave the patient. But if the instrument is larger than the ray of the mother, then it is necessary that you place pulvils over the texture of the ray of the mother so that the intrusion of any instrument into the ray of the mother is prohibited.
And it is necessary that you place the edge that runs along the length of the instrument on top and that the one administering holds the instrument and turns the edge until the orifices of the mother are open.
And when the growth appears and is touched by hand and is soft and wet, then it is necessary that you dry that place with a broad spatula.
And when the wound is evacuated, then it is necessary that you place on the wound a cloth soaked in rose oil or green oil in which there is some astringent; and place a compress on the dry area in the ray of the mother.
And place outside the mother and on the pubic hair clean wool soaked in water in which are boiled mallows.
And it should be treated for about two days with an ointment that is suitable for this purpose until it is healed.
And sometimes the mother and the wound are washed in such a way that it is covered with water and honey, and then with water in which lily or long-leaved plantain is boiled, and then return to the ointment.
And if the wound is hidden within the flesh, then you should be forbidden from treating it with iron, but rather care for him with water, as we said in the division.
Chapter 75
To teach midwives how to treat pregnant women when they suffer from unnatural thirst, as is shown in the figure below.
It is necessary for the midwife to know in the beginning the figure of a natural birth by its signs, and it is that when you see a woman pushing from below and desiring to smell the air, and over this she is relieved because what is above her has come out, then hasten the ejection of the afterbirth. In this case, know that this birth is according to the natural figure, and it is the ejection of it on its head, and the second one either suspended or hanging from the navel.  (Note: "eyssiment" and "ombelic" have been interpreted as "ejection" and "navel," respectively)
When you see these signs, then it is necessary to press on the patient's abdomen so that the baby descends gently. When it has descended onto its head, give the patient the second stage of labor, and this will help remove those excesses with a good cleansing.
But that which is other than this part is unnatural and not praiseworthy, for when the baby exits feet first and the body follows after the head and the feet, or one hand before the other foot, or the head and the hand come out together, or the body turns strongly over its neck, and it resembles the figures of the unpraiseworthy.
Therefore, it is necessary for the midwife to be wise and discerning in all these matters, and to guard against error and disappointment.
And I am showing you every figure of those, and what kind of sign is in them, so that it may be indicated by this and it has been established accordingly.
When the baby exits headfirst by natural progression, and this causes great distress to the woman and makes it difficult for her, and sometimes her strength is already weakened, then do this: have the women hold her, and fumigate her vagina with a hot mixture of fenugreek and oils. 》
And then insert the catheter between her legs with its small spatula and open it with that, or cut it with your nail until the liquid inside comes out. And press on the woman's belly until the child is delivered.
But if it does not come out, then the woman must be anointed with chickpea flour and fenugreek flour mixed with vinegar.
And then command the midwife to anoint her, and press on her belly to make her sneeze with anise seeds; and cover her mouth and nose for one hour, because the child will soon be delivered.
And if both hands of the child have already come out at first, then you must return them little by little with gentleness. But if it does not obey the treatment, then place the woman on a stool and raise her feet up, and then turn the stool over onto the ground; and make sure the woman is held so that she does not fall because of the turning.
And if the hands are not turned inside and the child dies, then cut them off and extract the body of the child or tie its body to its hand with cloth and pull it out with evenness, because it will soon be delivered.
"When the child exits from its feet, you must then gently push it back in, and then turn the small child around, and then enclose it, and then take one of its feet and extend it little by little.
"But when it has entered the spaces, then you command him to push himself out, and make him cough with conditionals, because he will be born-dead if God so wills.
"And if it is not born dead with what we have recommended, then you return the child little by little until you place him according to his natural figure, because he will then be born alive with ease.
"And if it is obstructed with everything we have recommended, then take some althea and dissolved gum, and crush them together in the mortar with good pounding, and then anoint with water the woman's vulva, as low as possible on her belly. "And then make her sit in lukewarm water until she reaches the hips.
"And when you see that the parts of her have softened, then make a smoke bath for her with myrtle and place her under it. And when you have administered the sublimation fumigation for an hour, then make the patient sit on a stool, and make them sneeze by pinching their nose, and pull out that [substance], and press lightly on the lower part of their belly, because this will cause immediate evacuation.
Certainly! Let's break down this sentence: It seems like you're looking for a translation of this sentence into English. I'll do my best to provide a literal and accurate translation based on the pattern you've given:
If he cannot walk, then make him lie down on the bed, and shake his limbs vigorously with a violent shaking, and then administer liniments which I have recommended and compounded from mucilages.
If the delivery has begun, then make her sit on the chair, and then study about the hand's reduction, and align the fetus according to its natural figure, and make the woman sneeze and command her to breathe in until it is expelled.
Immediately after the delivery, extend his arms and place him on his mother's back. Let the midwife hold the baby’s hand and then gently turn it over little by little until it is face up.
And when the baby has been aligned properly and is facing downwards, then place on its navel that which we have recommended made from oil and mucilage.
Then command the mother to lean back little by little, and when you have done this, then make her sit on a chair and order her to lean on her right side, and then command her to breathe in deeply; and make her sneeze forcefully. Based on the context provided, "Exitus foetus praeparati super latus" likely means:
When the mother is in terrible pain according to this method, consider, and then you cut into the second uterus with your nail until it is drained of its moisture.
And if the fetus is suspended over the face and neck of the mother, then you cut into that part of the umbilical cord so that it is not restrained and dies.
Then you expel the fetus through its parts until you place it where it should be, and tell the woman to compress herself several times, and the child will come out gently with a little effort, if God wills it.
The birth of twins or multiple fetuses. Know that twins are born in many cases, and sometimes three or four [babies] are born at once, but this is strange and rare; there are five causes of this, [and they are] natural, not supernatural.
And [the causes] are these: whether they are multiplied in one uterus and separated by a membrane, or they are distinguished by ligaments in the umbilical cord of each one; sometimes they are born this way as if it were a single fetus through natural, easy birth, and sometimes they are born through an unnatural birth, as we have said.
And if some [symptoms] are difficult to deliver and they fall into what we have said about unnatural shapes, then cure them as we have explained.
And if the midwife is skilled and performs this with ease and skill, and with care, and is ingenious according to every figure as it has been prepared by her ingenuity bringing about health.
Recollection of what is formed in the womb from embryos and is aborted.
Sometimes in the mother one [fetus], two, three, four, five, six, seven, even up to ten are formed, and it has already been verified that one woman aborted six and another ten, all fully formed; this was done by the measure of the glorious wise men.
And all this should be in the knowledge of the midwife because she is well-acquainted with that appearance of such things, and therefore she should proceed in a way that is appropriate.
Chapter LXXVI.
On the extraction of the fetus when it is dead.
When you treat the dead fetus with what we have said in the division of the treatment and it has not yet emerged, and you are forced to use manual operation, then it is necessary for you to consider whether the woman is of sound constitution and not with any of the accidents by which loss of her is feared.
Certainly! Let's break down the text and translate it line by line:
And let the assistant hold it with both hands or tie it in place to prevent the body from spreading during the procedure.
And then you moisturize the mouth of the patient with oils, marjoram, althea, fenugreek, and linseed.
And then the midwife anoints her hands with these oils and lotions, and then she gently inserts her hand into the patient, and then she searches with her hand for the place where the fingers rest on the fetus.
In these cases: then consider if the fetus is prepared to descend headfirst. If so, place your fingers in its heels, neck, mouth, palate, under the chin, on the collarbone, or near the ribs or hipbones.
But if the descent is by the feet, then in the buttocks or the middle of the back.
And it is necessary that one has the fingers of the right hand, and places the curvature of the finger in the place which is between the tips of the left hand, and gently inserts the hand until the fingers reach some of these places, until one reaches the soft part.
Based on the provided context and similarity to medieval medical texts in languages like Latin, Italian, Spanish, and French, here's a line-by-line translation of the given sentence:
"And he should be moved entirely, so that his excrement is relieved as it is done during tooth extraction.
"And it is necessary that something which is between them softens the extension; and if any part of him is retained, then the midwife should anoint some of her fingers with oil and insert them expertly, and move them with the thing that is retained.
"Therefore, if the baby's head is stuck, then change the position of the woman so that she is more open; and continue to do this until the entire baby has come out.
"But if the hand is presented before the other and it is not possible to reduce it due to its size, then a cloth should be wrapped around it; and then pull on that until all of it has come out, and incise that either in the joint of the hand or in the elbow.
"And do the same for the other hand and both feet.
"But if the baby's head is large, or there is difficulty in delivery, or there is water in the baby's head, then insert between the fingers a thin, sharp spatula and cut open the head and extract the water, or use an instrument called 'alundat' to suction out the fluid. The shape of this instrument will be similar to that of other instruments described in the following chapter.
Here's the translation of the given sentence:
Based on the pattern and context of the previous sentences, here's a line-by-line translation attempt:
If it is not complicated and does not obey excrement, then you should cut off the head as soon as possible.
If the lower abdomen is swollen or has dropsy, then you should pierce that area to drain the fluid inside it.
But if the feces are in its feet, then the attraction of it is slight and the direction towards the mother's mouth is also slight.
But if the intestines and feet are constricted, then you should extract them with a cloth wrapped around your hand, and cut open the intestines and feet so that the water inside flows out.
But if the other members are removed and the head returns, then the midwife should insert her left hand; but if the mother's mouth is open, then she should insert her hand into the air, seek the head with it, and pull it towards the mother's mouth with those [members], and then insert one or two fingers into [the baby] and pull it with them.
And if the mother's mouth is constricted by swelling caused by a blow to the head, then it should not be enlarged with an instrument; instead, it is necessary at that time to administer a fomentation of moist, fatty substances. And administer plasters; and follow the patient with waters that soften and moisten.
And if the abscess is on the side, then if possible, it should be lanced; and it should be administered with what we have said for a live abscess.
And if that is not possible, then it should be cut into pieces and removed.
And make sure to leave no cause inside the abscess.
And when you have completed all your operations, then administer what we have said about the treatment for abscesses that happen due to childbirth.
And if a flow of blood occurs, then send [the patient] into water that is astringent and administer the other treatment.
And I have already seen a woman in whose womb there was a dead fetus, and then another pregnancy occurred on top of that one, and then the other fetus also died. A long time ago, an abscess occurred in her belly; and it became inflamed until it burst open, and then she began to give birth to arms.
And I was called to care for her, and treated her for a long time, but the wound did not heal.  (Note: "plagua" is a variant spelling of "plaga", meaning wound or sore)
Based on the context and the patterns observed in the provided lines, here's my attempt to translate the given text:
And then I thought that they were from the bones of the dead person.
So I examined the wound and extracted from it some bones, which were found in its depths, and the woman had lived that way for a long time; I cut off a small piece of her arm.
And I did not find this to be strange, because in this there is science and help for what the physician performs with his hands in administering treatment.
Of the shapes of the instruments that are necessary for removing the object.
The shape of a screw with which it is opened wider:
This is the shape of a stretcher in which the leaves are cut, with two screws at each end of the two legs. However, this screw should be more delicate than rigid, and it can be made either from ebony or boxwood.
And the thickness of each leg should be two fingers, and the width of each one also two fingers, and the length of each one is one palm and a half; and in the middle of the two legs there are two adjustments made from the same wood, which are already attached, whose length is half a palm and a little more, and the thickness of each is about two fingers, or a little more.
Based on the provided context and similarity to Romance languages, here's a line-by-line translation:
Forma autra semblant de aquela pus subtil e pus leugiera:
"It should be made of ebony wood or boxwood, similar in appearance to a pair of forceps. "However, at its end there are two appendages like teeth, and the length of these appendages is approximately one hand span, and the width of each is two fingers.
"And when you want to use these to open the womb, then have the woman lie down on her back with her legs hanging off, and open what is between her thighs. "And then open your hand with the instrument in the same way as you would do with forceps, according to the amount of dilation you want at the mouth of the womb until the midwife does what she wants.
"The type of dizziness that the ancients called:
"A form of pushing with which the baby is pushed out.
"A form of assistance with which the large head is turned
"And it resembles forceps, whose teeth are at the end, as seen. Sometimes it is made long like forceps according to this shape, as seen. At its end, there are teeth like saw teeth with which it cuts and turns. It seems like the text you provided is in an old form of Catalan or Occitan, given the similarities with Latin, Italian, Spanish, and French. Let's break down the sentence:
Certainly! Let's break down the text line by line and provide a translation into English:
This phrase translates to: "Form of an ointment having two needles.
"Form of a spoon having two ends with which the head is cut.
"Form of two wide spoons.
"All these instruments are practiced, and the more varied their types and prepared by craftsmen, the easier it is for them to perform their operation, and the more valuable they are to men for their quantity.
"And you should always be prepared with these instruments, wherever you go, because the need for them cannot be avoided.
"On the extraction of the placenta.
"When the placenta is retained after childbirth, then you should command the patient to hold her breath, and then make her sneeze with caution. Strengthen your hand over her mouth and nose, and if it comes out this way, it is good.
"And if not, then you take a cup and pierce a hole in its cover. Place in it herbs that burn the mother's mouth, such as calamint, rue, anise, chamomile, Arabic saffron, cassia wood, and centaury. Based on the provided context and pattern of translation, here's a line-by-line English translation:
And then place a straw of hemp in the mouth of the patient, and hold it there until the fume reaches the cavity of the patient's body.
Then make her sneeze as we have said, and on the second attempt, it will be expelled quickly.
But if this treatment persists and the second wind does not come out, then you should instruct the midwife to submerge her left hand in sesame oil or a mixture of altea, and then insert it into the womb, seeking the second wind with her hand, and when she finds it, grasp it and pull it out little by little. But if it is stuck in the uterus, then proceed as we have recommended, and once she has located the second wind, extract it gradually, ensuring that the patient does not suffer from the intense pulling. It is important that the right and left ribs be moved with ease.
And if the patient's mouth is closed, we have already recommended treatment with sneezing and a mixture of oil with herbs.
Based on the provided translation style and the context of medieval medical treatises, here's a line-by-line translation of the given sentence:
Here's a line-by-line translation of the given text:
"However, some of the ancients have already tested the fumigation with dry figs and burnt niter.
"The form of the instrument with which the woman is fumigated should be retained for menstruation and the second time:
"It should be made of glass or silver.
"And the narrow end should be placed in the vagina and the wide end over the fire, and the fumigation should be placed on the embers of the fire.
"And hold it there until that fumigation is consumed and then do another one.
"Of the treatment of an infant's non-perforated anus.
"Many infants are born and their anuses are not perforated, which is called a narrow and closed one. "Then it is fitting for the midwife to open it with her finger; and if not, she should open it with a sharp probe, taking care not to touch the skin.
"And then place on that wool soaked in wine and oil; and then treat it with ointment until it is healed.
"But if you fear that it may be closed again, then place a catheter in the opening for many days, and remove it when the infant wants to defecate.
And if an abscess occurs in the buttocks due to the formation of a wound or an abscess, then it is necessary to cut open that formation, and subsequently treat it with the water we have mentioned for treatment and cauterization.
Of the treatment of fistulas that occur below.
The fistulas that occur in the lower part of the body are nodules and thickenings that occur near the buttocks outside or in the space between the two cheeks.
And it is a fistula or many.
And when that nodule is old and exudes watery white pus or fine pustules, sometimes some of these fistulas are penetrating.
And those penetrating ones are known by what comes out of them by discharge and flatus; and sometimes the patient suffers from discharge, and often it is worms that come out of them.
And some of those fistulas, sometimes in the space, penetrate into the bladder, and into the urethral meatus; and some of those penetrating ones enter the joint of the hip, and into the nut of the coccyx.
And what is known for a penetrating and non-penetrating fistula in the buttocks is that you insert your finger inside the buttocks, and introduce a thin probe of iron or iron into the fistula when it is not obstructed.
"However, if there is a tumor in that area, then insert a subtle probe made of lead or horsehair until you feel the probe or the hair in your finger.
"But if you do not feel it at all or there is no discharge of any kind like bile, worms, or gas, as we have said, then know that it is non-penetrating, and thus proceed with the cure.
"And when the fistula penetrates into the bladder or into the urethra, then its indication is the issuing of urine from there and the prohibition of any medicine being applied to that area.
"However, if it penetrates into the hip joint or into a bone and there is an increase in pain around the area, then the sign of this is that the probe will pass through here if there is not a tumor in the bone, and there is an increase in pain around the part; and that pus comes out continually; and that no medicine is effective on it, nor is it healed with ointment.
"And in all these penetrating fistulas, there is no cure at all, and the treatment of them is labor and futility of foolish doctors who insist on them.
Here's the translation for the given sentence:
Here's the translation of the given sentence:
And if that makes the patient feel around the neck, then you should insert your finger into the neck.
And if you feel in your finger the tip already trying to penetrate by itself or if you feel something between your finger and it, then know for certain that it is penetrating; and then do not work on that, because there is no healing there, as we have said.
However, some say that in some men it heals late.
And for the medicine with which it is hoped to help him, you should use a subtle and thin cautery iron according to the size of the fistula, as was said before, and insert that heated iron into the fistula until it reaches around the neck; then repeat this two or three times until all the flesh that looks like a feather quill is firmly adhered.
And then cover that with cloths wrapped in linen until all the adhered flesh is dried out. Then treat it with medicines that promote flesh growth and consolidation. If it heals, good; if not, then it will never heal by any other treatment.
Based on the provided context and similarity to Latin, Italian, Spanish, and French, here's a line-by-line translation of the given text:
"And then cleanse those fleshy tubes which resemble the quill of a bird and let none of them break.
"But if blood flow sometimes occurs between you and your operation when you enter those fleshy tubes, then it is advisable to use the lightest instrument of pus, namely cauterization with fire or sharp medicine, because cauterization with fire has two good habits: it tightens those fleshy tubes and dries up the blood and humors.
"And then treat that [wound] wrapped in cloth or bandages until it heals, and then treat the wound with ointments that make flesh harden and heal.
"And such are the medications which have astringent and drying properties; when [the wound] is thus restored, it is considered healed and there is no fear of recurrence.
"But if the fistula has already penetrated into the depth of the anus and is elongated on the surface of the body, then insert your finger into the anus and examine it with that.
"And thus if you find the end and between it and yourself is only a thin layer of skin or flesh, and it is close to the surface, then do not operate on it immediately but rather through faith and hope.
The given text appears to be discussing the treatment of a medical condition, possibly related to an anal fistula or abscess. Here's a line-by-line translation: And sometimes the fistula is treated in this manner: when you insert the probe into the fistula, and it is located at the buttocks near the surface of the body with the string and on the edge of the buttocks, then take a probe with a pointed end, which is like a needle used for preparing the heart in this way.
And then insert that thread wrapped in five threads or around those; and then insert the probe with the thread into the fistula until it reaches its cavity.
But if it penetrates into the edge of the buttocks deeply inside, then you should extract the thread from that hole by inserting your finger into the anus; and pull out the end of the thread and tie the two ends together, tightening each one, and leave it like this for a day or two. And when the thread sinks more deeply into the flesh, tighten it well so that the flesh between the two ends of the thread falls off.
Then care for the wound until it is healed and cured.
But if the opening of the fistula is not penetrated, then make it penetrate, by whatever means you are prepared to do so, but be careful to avoid injury. And then treat it with that until it is healed.
The form of the pointed spatula with which the fistula is opened: its tip is very sharp and the other part is not sharp, so that it does not cause unnecessary injury, as is often the case.
About stitching hemorrhoids when they bleed during incision.
Hemorrhoids come in two types: either they are like coal and located between the anus, or they resemble a cluster of grapes. And these can be small or large, and blood may always flow from them, and they can be one or many, and they can be outside the anus or at its edges.
However, those outside the anus are due to very little humidity, from which flows yellowish water or a small amount of blood with continuous dung, and they vary according to the color of the feces.
And the treatment for those inside the anus is to order the patient to sit and squeeze until the anus protrudes and the hemorrhoids appear to you. Then take scissors and cut those [hemorrhoids] off with your nails, and immediately cauterize them in their roots.
Based on the context and similarity to Latin-based languages, here's a line-by-line translation of the provided text: "And then care for him with the other remedy until he is healed.
"And if the bowels do not obey an evacuation, then purge the patient with a mild purgative, and wash them with the water that causes a slight evacuation when the patient is squeezed.
"But if the hemorrhoids are outside the anus, then their cause is slight, and it is that you take them with your finger or that you take them with a hook, and insert them, and then care for them with the water we mentioned until they are healed.
"And that which you have inserted, it is necessary to administer a suture of them in this manner: take thread wrapped around and insert it into a needle, then pull the hemorrhoids toward each other, and make the thread penetrate with the needle into the surface of the other part, and wrap the two ends of the thread around the surface below the needle, and tie them transversely; and tighten the hemorrhoid with strong force, and then knot the thread and pull out the needle.
"And do this to all [hemorrhoids], and leave one of them and do not bind it, so that the excess blood can flow from that one.
And then place over the area a cloth soaked in oil or wax; and place that on the wound, and command the patient to rest. And then let it sit until it congeals; and when it has congealed, treat it with ointment or another remedy until it is healed.
And when they are old and that medicine is not effective, then you should scrape them with the point of a spatula or with your nail until they become moist, and remove the scab from on top which prevents their consolidation; and then treat them until they are healed.
Then you remove them with a vigorous scrub until they first bleed and are raw; and then treat them until they are healed.
Know that alamermar is a nail, and it is nothing other than a round wart resembling the head of a nail, and it occurs throughout the body but mostly in the parts under the feet and the hands, and for this reason you should treat them with care.
And then it is necessary to cut away what is around the nail, and hold it with pincers or tweezers, and remove it from its root; and then treat that area.
And if you wish, cauterize according to what is written in the previous chapter.
But a wart is a small, rough, round protrusion on the surface of the body, and many times they are seen in children's hands.
And its treatment is to spread and cut it, or to tighten it with wire or thread so that it can be removed. And if you wish, cauterize it as we have said, either with fire or with a sharp instrument.
But a mole is a small, hairy or large, rough protrusion on the surface of the body, often found in the forehead, and when the cold touches it, it is felt like a stinging bite of an ant, and it is found all over the body.
And its treatment is to take a quill from an eagle or vulture feather, which should be strong, and place it over the mole within the circle of the quill's circumference; then rotate your hand with the quill until you cut away what is around the mole, and press it into the flesh, and remove the mole from its root.
"And if you want, do this with a reed or iron needle according to this manner:
"Make sure the end of the needle is sharp and not perforated. Wrap it with thread to ensure a smooth grip and easy rotation.
"And if you wish, cauterize the ant according to what was previously stated in the chapter on cautery for athlete's foot.
"Regarding the shapes of the instruments used for incisions.
"Sometimes incisions are made with silver, bronze, or cast iron instruments; and sometimes these instruments come in different sizes according to their use. For example, those used for treating small children should be small, as well as those used for patients with painful or sensitive areas.
"The shape of a large incision tool is rare:
"The top of the needle, where the bag is tied, should be wide like this; and there should be space between where the bag is tied and the rest of the instrument as shown.
"And the lower end, which is inserted into the patient's body, should be blunt (not open) and thin, tapering to a point; on one side of the handle there should be two holes, and on the other side one hole, and the size of the hole should correspond to the thickness of the rays, but slightly larger.
And let there be a bag in which the medicines of animal bladder or sheep wool are placed, and its size should be one palm.
And let it be pierced with fine needles as if rolled up; and the space between the needles should be the thickness of a finger.
And then insert strong, crude fat into those needles, which should be from these fats, or wrap them around; and fasten the bag with it; and when the bag is placed on it, bind it tightly at the top of the cross with two strings and a strong knot, and then bandage each needle: But the way to bandage it is that you fill the bag with the medicine, which should be warmed according to the patient's tolerance; and make sure it is not too hot or too cold.
And then have the patient lie on their back, and raise their legs upwards, placing underneath them a board such as that on which men usually lie or a stretcher; and then grease the tip of the cautery with oil or egg white or fenugreek mucilage or similar; and then gently insert it into the anus; and then let the attendant take the bag and press it with two hands and at the same time forcefully until all that is in the bandage is evacuated from the intestine; and then remove the bandage and have the patient raise their legs to the wall.
And if medication forces him to evacuate, let it be as much as possible; and if he sleeps with it throughout the night, it is more beneficial for healing.
And if you treat him with the remedies for stomach ailments and to evacuate his bowels, then you should continue using the cautery until he is cured.
And if in the anus there are hemorrhoids or abscesses that are tender, then use a cautery that is very subtle and light, like those with which children are cauterized.
Of the treatment of wounds.
I have already said in the division of wound treatment what is appropriate for this chapter, and now I say that wound treatment should be done with both hands and medicines according to their nature.
Therefore, I say that wounds are classified based on how the wounds are inflicted and where they occur on the body.
And the causes for which many wounds are inflicted are as follows: a blow from a stone, an incision by a sword or knife, a thrust with a spear, or a hit with a club, arrow, or similar to these various causes.
Here's a translation of the given sentence:
And I am recommending the treatment of some diseases so that you may pause this reasoning and rule for other diseases.
And I will begin with simple head diseases, because the memory of compound ones will come at the beginning of the third chapter.
Therefore, I say that when a simple head wound occurs and it is not a fracture, consider: if it is caused by the impact of a stone or similar object, and only the scalp has been injured but it is a severe wound and you fear a dangerous accumulation of pus in the patient, then be swift and perform a bloodletting on the cephalic vein immediately, without delay; and extract from him as much blood as the strength of his body permits, unless some other reason prohibits bloodletting, especially if the amount of blood that has come out of the wound is little.
And let the bloodletting be on the opposite side of the wounded area; and keep the patient from becoming constipated, and from eating heavy foods.
But if some reason prevents fasting, then let him be reduced in food and not approach meat or wine.
And place on the wound, if an dangerous abscess forms, a cotton plug soaked in rose oil or wine that has been mixed with a styptic.
Certainly! Let's translate the given sentence step by step:
And if the air has already changed there, then place some ointment on it until it is healed.
But if the wound is large or caused by a sword and has similar appearances, and its lips are not well adjusted by bandages, then adjust those with stitches as I will explain to you about the stitching of them.
But if the wound is already exposed to bone and sinew, and there is no retention but only a small ligament, then cut it off and cure the wound with medicines and restore the flesh in its place with thread, and order the patient to be fed on foods that are thick: heads and tails and similar things, until it is healed.
And if you find putrefaction in the thread and it does not adhere to the bone, then cut off all that is rotten and throw it away, and then cure it.
But if in these wounds there is an artery or vein from which blood flows and it is not stopped by medicine, then inquire about the artery, and if you find it uncut, then cut it with a spatula or tie it; and if necessity compels you to do what we have said cannot be done, then cauterize until the bleeding stops.
And if these wounds are simple and small, then the cause is light; thus, you should sprinkle this powder over them because once it solidifies, it will protect them before the air changes.
And the manner of making the powder is as follows: take one part of sesame oil, two parts of dragon's blood, and three parts of unslaked lime; let all be very finely ground and sieved, and with it fill the wound, compressing it well with a good bandage until it adheres to it and coagulates with the blood.
And then bandage it with cloths and leave it alone, and do not unwrap it until it is healed, because the medicine has not been taken from it until it is cured.
And sometimes this alone is enough, when you do not have sesame oil and dragon's blood on hand.
And also perform this same operation on large wounds when it is necessary to cover them and they are closed, and fresh wounds with their blood, which the air has not altered.
And if the air has altered them, especially in summer, then it is not appropriate to apply this powder. Instead, care for those wounds with the water we mentioned, so that you place on them digestive ointments, or place on them a paste of wheat flour with water and honey until they form a crust; and then treat them with the other remedy until they are healed.
If it happens that there is a bone fracture from the wound and it is small, then you should extract it with forceps.
And I will describe the treatment for skull fractures when they occur.
For wounds of the neck.
However, if the wound occurs on the neck, there is no difference in treatment, just as with a simple head wound.
However, if the nerves of the neck are cut or an artery is injured, then if it is a nerve, there is no remedy for it except to avoid treating it with something that causes strong astringency, such as sumac and zegi, which are both caustic and harmful to nerves and constrict them. Do not place any cause of heat on the wound, because the substance of the nerves is cold and its continuation is with the brain, which is the coldest of all members.
And if it is treated with light medications, such as being washed with clean water, sometimes mixed with rose oil or plain olive oil, and then rinsed again when washed with clean water and the other ingredients reduced in this manner, and moist ointments.
"But if the wound is large, then administer stitches or close the lips of it, and afterwards treat it with powders until it is healed.
"But if the wound is deep or occurs in the lower part of the body and becomes gangrenous, then pierce it in the most depressed area.
"But if an artery has already been cut in the wound and blood flow is obtained, then separate it, dry it, or tie it off, or cauterize it if necessity requires it.
"But if the spondyls of the gullet or all have already been cut and the veins of the neck are saved, then you should adjust the lips of the wound with a suture over the cane of the gullet and do not touch it; first equalize it and reduce it to its natural shape, and afterwards strengthen it with a decent bandage, and leave it for several days; and afterwards treat it with ointments that contain astringents and stimulants until it is healed.
"But if the wound has penetrated into the bone, then you should probe it, and if there are bone fragments in it, extract all that you can; and what is not apparent to you, leave it until the wound becomes putrid, and is separated, and the irritation of it is alleviated.
And if the wound is recent, then sprinkle over it the powder that has been recommended to you. But if in the wound there is an ulcer, then cure it with water of which the memory will come to you shortly in its chapter.
If it is a stab wound from a lance or dagger, and you see its depth, then consider more whether there is air coming out when the patient exhales; if so, know that the wound is mortal.
And if there is no depth in it and the wound is recent with its blood, then in the first hour place on it powder, and do not strain it so that the blood is not retained in its depth and returns to the heart and makes the patient worse; but place on it an attractive ointment, and remove it two times a day.
And if the ointment is not at hand, then place on the opening of the wound old cloth so that it sucks up water from the humidity; and make the patient sleep on the wound so that the water in it runs out.
Here is the line-by-line translation of the provided sentence:
But if the healing of the patient is delayed and remains open over time, then know that a fistula has already formed; therefore, treat it according to its nature.
And if the wound is from a cut by a knife or sword and is simple on the surface of the foot or back, then treat it with water that has been prepared for sewing, if it is large, or with powder, if it is small.
But if it has penetrated into the bone and from there cut pieces off, then you should turn the wound and try to extract those pieces, if they are separated. But if they are not separated, then leave them inside so that the wound can heal, as their removal will be facilitated.
And for other wounds that occur in the other members, the treatment is the same as we have said above.
About wounds of the abdomen.
The disorder that occurs in the abdomen is either great, small, or mixed.
And a small rupture is difficult to repair in any other way, and I know that their reduction is even more difficult if you do not cut the entrance of them into their place immediately, because it opens up and swells, making the entry of them difficult.
Therefore, the best rupture is mild, because in that case, the reduction of the intestine is not difficult, as it is with the two types mentioned before.
And know that suture of the abdomen is according to four methods, but two sutures are common and suitable for suturing other diseases of the body as well.
And two other sutures are specific to other diseases, but nevertheless they are more specific for abdominal suture.
And I will explain each one to you with explanation and clarification.
Therefore, I say that when the wound is small and there is some reason for the intestine to be through it, and it is difficult to reduce it, then it is in one of two ways: either because of the smallness of the rupture as we have said, or when the intestine has become inflated due to the coldness of the air.
Here's a line-by-line translation of the given sentence:
And sometimes this is done in cases where there is constipation, and it is better than water alone for resolving the swelling.
And when you see the swelling has been resolved, then moisten the intestine with water in which altea and mallow have been boiled, because by this method it is relieved of its contents with little effort.
However, if the intestine's contents have not been expelled, then cut a small incision with an instrument used for cutting hemorrhoids.
And the first treatment is better, when it is appropriate, so that there is no need to cut and no cause for weakness or exhaustion.
Regarding the instrument, see its form:
One part of it is sharply curved, and the other part is not sharp, and its tip should be fine, but not as fine as a spatula, rather it should be somewhat blunt at the end.
And so when the wound has been widened and the intestine comes out, then it is necessary for its reduction to be according to the natural form, in its proper place, if possible over water, because that is better.
However, when the incision is large and is in the lower part of the abdomen, then you should make the patient lie on their back, and raise their legs higher than their head; and if it is in the upper part of the abdomen, then place the head and feet of the patient higher than the middle parts.
And similarly, if the rupture is in one of the two parts of the abdomen, then place your attention and consideration always on this, so that the part where the wound is may be higher than the other.
And thus it is necessary for you to administer this in both large and small wounds.
And in the small wounds, place that which is prepared for you, and then make sure that the person administering it is between your legs, holding the entire wound with their hand and aligning its edges, and then reveal this to another who knows how to sew.
And this is the common method of suturing: Take a needle, or count the number of needles according to the width of the wound; then let it out from the end of the little finger's disruption, and strengthen the needle with one thread, making sure you do not pass the thread through both ends of the cord. With two ends of the cord that are inside the parts, enter until you have penetrated that part; and having added two ends of the cord and two ends of the thread, there will be four rows.
Based on the provided lines and patterns, here's my attempt at translating the given sentence:
And let the needles be moderate between coarseness and fineness, for fine needles lightly cut into the flesh; and the coarse ones are difficult to insert into the vein, so therefore they should be moderate in fineness and coarseness.
It is not advisable that the needle be inserted into both ends of the vein too closely, so that the flesh is not lightly cut and the wound does not open before it has a chance to heal.
And do not extend the stitches excessively, lest the wound be hindered from healing.
Then cut off the ends of the needles so that they do not harm the patient during their sleep; and place over the stitches bandages that are spread out from all sides, which have the ends of the needles; and leave those in place until you know that the wound has healed.
And these types of stitches with needles are most suitable for small wounds, because for the closure of such wounds only one or two needles, or around that number, are needed.
But the second type of stitch is common: and it is that you use four ends with one stitch - two ends of the vein and two ends of the thread, at once, with a needle in which there is thread wrapped equally in fineness and coarseness.
And then when you have penetrated these four extremities with the needle, withdraw the needle from the same location from which it began, so that the thread can be pulled and draw out the pus from the affected area of the wound, ensuring that the stitch is secure like the stitch used to reinforce cloths.
And place between each stitch the quantity equivalent to the thickness of the little finger.
And this stitch is known to men.
And with this stitch, I sutured the wound that a man had on his belly, which he had been cut with a sword, and the opening of the wound was more than a palm wide, and two palms of the intestines protruded from the middle of the body, and the opening was in the middle of the limb; and then I returned that which had come out of the wound after twenty-four hours.
And the wound healed in about fifteen days or thereabouts, and I cared for him and he was cured; and then he lived many years, and continued in his usual habits.
And the other doctors had judged that he would not be cured; and it was by a miracle, for I did not cure him with ointment, because it was in a place where no ointment or any medicine could be applied, but I placed two clean cloths on the wound twice a day and washed it frequently with honey water until he was healed.
This is a challenging text due to its medieval origins and mix of languages. Here's my attempt at translating it:
And it is that you begin with the stitching of the scrotum, and insert the needle from outside to inside.
And then, with the needle having penetrated the scrotum and tied a thread according to its length and width along the entire body, leave the end of the thread where you inserted the needle; and make the needle penetrate the other end from inside to outside on the other side of the middle.
And when you have done that penetration, then you do it again in the same side of the middle from outside to inside; and leave the end of the thread on this side, and make the needle penetrate into the other end from inside to outside.
And make it penetrate with that your penetration with which you make it penetrate into the thread at its end, which is inside so that everything penetrates.
And then start from this same side and sew that with the end of the thread on the other side, and pull the needle out of the scrotum which penetrated, and then return it to that scrotum and sew the end of the thread which is on the other side with this end of the thread; and pull that out of the scrotum which is from his part. ›

Here's the line-by-line translation of your given sentence:
Based on the context and structure provided in the previous translations, here's an attempt to translate the given sentence:
And this manner of stitching is better than ordinary simple stitching, and it is the stitching that has been recommended beforehand.
This is the speech of Galen
And they said to some, the stitching of the belly is done with two needles, so that you insert a thread into each one, and begin by inserting the needle into the place where you should, and make it penetrate into the other side according to the stitching that those who sew hearts use.
And know that when the rupture is in the middle of the belly, then its stitching is more difficult than in other places of the belly.
But the judgment of treating a wound is the same as that for other wounds.
Because when you obtain the fresh wound with its blood before the air alters it, and return the intestine to its place and sew it up and prepare it decently, then put powdered incarnative on it.
And if the air has already altered the wound, then place on it some ointments that you have at hand until they form a hard stone and cover the threads, and let them consolidate well and be observed; and then treat it in this way as is the treatment of other wounds until it is healed.
Here's a line-by-line translation of the given text:
Here's the line-by-line translation of the provided text:
And if one feels pain or putrefaction in their intestines, because many times this happens, then treat them with six drops of black helebore tincture, and especially if the putrefaction has spread to the intestine and is made by a penetrating exit into its cavity.
And know that the one from the large intestine is of lighter healing than the one in the small intestines.
And it is difficult to heal because the intestine that is called "jejunum" does not receive healing from any wound that occurs in it; and this is due to the great multitude of veins within it, and the magnitude of them, and the subtlety of its body, and its proximity to the nature of nerves.
But if what comes out of the wound is the intestine, and you find it fresh, then reduce it in the same way as you would reduce the intestines themselves.
But if it has passed into the space and has already turned green or black, then you should strengthen that place with honey, so that there is a flow of blood, because in the intestine there are veins and arteries.
And immediately cut off what is below that ligament, and pause the two ends of the thread hanging from the part after the wound, so that the attraction of the patient towards you is relieved.
Remembering the wounds when they occur in the intestine.
When there is a disruption in the intestine and it is small, then it may be possible to restore it in some people. I have seen this happen to someone who was wounded in his belly with the strike of a lance, and the wound was on the right side of the stomach. The wound was old and had formed an abscess, and from him came pus and gas.
Therefore, I proceeded with his treatment, although he was not cured, but rather continued to heal that which is inside, so that the place may be consolidated.
And I, seeing that the place was already consolidated, told the patient to expect some evil in his belly; and no one expected any evil and he recovered by eating and drinking according to his own wishes, and then he entered a bath and was exercised in his saying.
And some experienced ones said that when a wound occurs in the intestine and it is small, then it should be tied in this manner: take ants with large heads; and immediately adjust the two lips of the wound and place one ant on top of the two lips of the wound; therefore, when it takes hold of those [lips] and strengthens its mouth, cut off its head, for it adheres and does not dissolve.
And then place another ant near the first one, and do not stop doing this with ants, placing one near another according to the extent of the entire wound.
And then reduce that swelling and close the wound, and let those attached heads remain in the intestine until the intestine is healed; and do not cause any harm to the patient.
And it is possible to suture the intestine with fine thread made from an animal's intestine attached to it, because it is more like a needle; and you should take the end of these intestinal threads, which should be very thin, and then tie the end of the thread around itself, wrapped, and then pass that thread through needles and close the intestine with it, reducing that opening.
And this method of suturing with ants is only done as a way of trust and hope.
But if the wound is large and wide, especially if it is in one of the small intestines, for then it is not possible to heal completely, and it will not be cured at all.
About the treatment of ulcers and fistulas.
Know that any wound or abscess that has become old and chronic and has turned into an ulcer, and is not healed and gets worse over time and is not cut open, wherever it may be in the body, is generally called a fistula and we call this an azuchema.
And fistula, according to the truth, is a knotty swelling, hard and white, with which there is no pain, and into which there is a cavity as if it were a bird's feather; and for this reason, that is called "alcus rizatz," that is, feather.
And in some men it is moist, which causes swelling; and very quickly the moisture is absorbed within a few hours. And sometimes this moisture moves, and it is small, and thick, and subtle.
I have already shown all those causes, and the signs of them, and their cure with medicines in the division.
And it is appropriate for me to make you know the treatment of fistula which is done by hand operation.
And know that fistulas occur in all the members of the body, for there are those which reach the large veins and arteries, or the nerves, or the belly, or the bladder, or some ribs, or some vertebrae of the back, or some joints composed as the hand and foot; and there are those that affect a part close to the principal member and resemble it.
Therefore, that among these fistulas which is according to this method is of the difficult-to-heal diseases and does not accept treatment or healing, and with it there is labor and ignorance.
And if there is any fistula whose depth does not reach these places that have been mentioned, and you expect and hope for its healing, and you wish to achieve knowledge of it, then take a probe of iron or steel, and if the fistula goes straight, search for it with it.
But if the fistula is twisted, then investigate it with a thin lead probe, because lead with its lightness of body is easily bent and follows the twist.
And if the fistula has horrible words, it is not within your power to interpret them over him with a tentacle.
Therefore, irrigate the orifices with syringes, for the moisture by which you irrigate that one will go to the other orifices and run out of them.
And then inquire carefully, according to the manner in which you are able to know whether there are bones or nerves here, and whether it is the cavity of a distant fistula or close at hand, or a fistula in which there are horrible words and this is all within your strength, with your interpretation, with which you interpret the patient, and the invention of pain should be your compression with your hand over the place, and similar to the significations and the causes that occur in the abscess.
And when you have stood over all those causes with true certainty, then proceed to the treatment with confidence: and consider if it is an apparent nearby fistula or in a salty place, distant from the joint, nerve, artery, vein, or one of the places that I have mentioned to you.
Then you dry the fistula according to what was said before about its description, and remove that which is in that filtration and of putrefied flesh, and whatever has been born in the orifice of the flesh, or like it, and cure it until it is healed.
Based on the given text and your previous translation, here's my attempt at translating the provided sentence:
And do this with some of those salves until the sharp medicine has completely dissolved everything that is soft in the cavity of the abscess.
And then restore it with ointments that promote healthy tissue growth until it is healed.
But if it does not heal from this, then cauterize it as we have recommended.
But if the cause of the fistula is bone and you are certain of this, then inquire about it and dry it out as we have recommended, provided that you do not block any vein or nerve or main member as we have said.
But if the bone is exposed and there is any corruption or blackness in it, then scrape it until all the corruption is removed; and then heal it with something that will make flesh grow until it is healed.
And if it does not heal and continues to discharge as before, then know that you have not completely eradicated the corruption; therefore, uncover it again with great care and make a very thorough scraping and cleansing of it with the strongest forceps you have, and then restore it.
And so if he is healed, it is good; and if not, then know that this corruption is in the deep depths of the body, which has not been reached, and therefore you cannot cure it but only relieve it.
And if the bone is slightly decayed, or if it is possible for you to extract it, then do so using fine forceps that are suitable for this purpose.
And if there are many bones, then very carefully extract all of them and leave none without your strength.
But if any of the humors cause you difficulty and there is no fear or mistake in their incision, then cut away those ligaments or flesh that are here and deliver the bones.
But if you are not prepared to remove the bones at that time, then place something on the wound that can help it heal, and leave it until those bones are surrounded by flesh and ligaments, and keep watch over the wound so that it does not become consolidated, and constrict the incision that you made during your operation.
Furthermore, if you are fearful, place on the wound a cloth soaked in oil or a cloth soaked in Egyptian ointment, or one of the vertz ointments, because when those ligaments have rotted and the bones have separated from them, the ablation and their attraction will be alleviated.
Based on the provided text and your translation style, here's my attempt at translating the given sentence:
"But if the rotten part is large and the corruption has reached the bone marrow, it is necessary to close that area completely and cut through everything into the place where the corruption has spread. Then cure that inside so that it may heal.
"And I recommend to you that if you find something in the patient's body, pause and consider it as an example and aid for your operation.
"A young man of about xxx years experienced pain in his chest, and among the internal parts, there was an excess of matter inside the body until it reached the chest, which is matter of abscess with a large abscess, and it was not caused by an external factor.
"And so the time was prolonged with that due to the error of the physicians until the abscess burst, and many materials were drawn out from him. His treatment was then paused until the thigh was fistulated, and in him were made orifices which completely drained pus and the humors of the body.
"And so a multitude of doctors treated him for about two years, and none among them was more skilled in the art than I.
And behold, there was a swelling in his leg and matter flowing from him through those openings of the body; and already the body of that man was completely distorted and his color was yellowish.
Then I inserted a probe into one of those openings and it reached the bone.
And then I explored all the openings and found that they extended to every part of the leg.
And then I cut and incised around one of those openings that I had discovered, and found an exposed part of the bone, which I found to be corrupt, already turned to earth and rotten; and already a part of the leg through which it had penetrated into the marrow was corrupted.
And then I sawed off what had been discovered and prepared from the exposed bone.
And I thought that it was not in the bone itself, but rather the corruption which I had cut away and sawed off, and I had already cauterized it.
And then I treated the wound with healing medicines for a long time, but it did not heal.
And then I dug and discovered further on the bone according to the first discovery, and found continuous corruption with the bone.
And it seems to me that this corruption has appeared in him, so I was ordered to perform his cure and restoration, but he has not been restored.
And then I discovered another vein on him and did not stop cutting the small bones one by one particularly, and performed his restoration, but he was not restored until I cut around a palm's width of him, from which I extracted his marrow. Then I restored that part with medicines, and it has healed slightly and is now healthy.
And there is no need for repetition in his operation and section, except for the condition of his weakness and the scarcity of his tolerance and fear of death, because he falls into a state at all times due to excessive evacuation.
And so he is healed completely, and there is nothing in place of bone but hard flesh; the arrangement of his body has been well done and his strength has returned to him; he walks according to his habits and no harm comes to him in any way.
But if the bone protrudes from the broken place in the body, then you must cut it in this manner: take a strong ligature and tie it tightly around the end of the protruding bone; command someone to pull on it; then place another ligature of thicker wool over the first one; next, tie it over the flesh that is beneath the bone, and extend the end of it so that you can pull the flesh apart from below, and thus expose the flesh in the place where you want to saw, so that the saw does not touch the flesh.
And place him on a table with his bones decently covered, for when you do this it is not forbidden to use a saw to cut the rotten flesh.
And it is necessary that the sawing be done on the corrupt place little by little, because if it is in the cavity of the bone corruption and does not appear to the touch, then forceful sawing will be needed again another time.
And if the bone is corrupt and does not protrude, but rather one part adjoins another continuously, and the corruption is in the middle or at a joining of them, then uncover all the flesh from every side entirely; and then place him on his back, and then saw that which is from the first part until the sawing reaches the other part.
And let the sawing be according to the place of the corruption a little, as we have said.
And if the corruption is in the joint, cut that corrupt joint, and saw the bone where it continues to the other part.
And if the corruption is in the continuation of two joints, then it is not reasonable but rather ingenious.
And if the corruption is in the palm of the hand or the sole of the foot, it is very difficult; however, you should seek to find the corruption in whatever manner appears to you, and cut that out, and clean it according to each possible condition, and with each ingenious method straighten it, as long as it does not go against a vein or nerve.
And know that the incisions and saws used to cut these bones are determined by the position of the bones, their preparation, size, delicacy, length, thickness, hardness, and rarity; therefore, it is necessary for you to prepare all sorts of suitable instruments for that operation.
And know that this operation requires you to choose the appropriate instrument; since you have great experience and knowledge in the methods of this art and are familiar with various diseases, you should use what is suitable for each instrument and for every disease.
And I, at the end of this chapter, will tell you the number of instruments that you should have as basics with which you will proceed to your practice, which you will try on others. Form of saw:
Another form of the saw:
A large form of another saw:
Form of file: The head of this file should be in the shape of a star-shaped screwdriver head, and its teeth should be similar to the teeth of an astrolabe.
"And it is not advisable that only with water are the heads of the joints rubbed when they are corrupted, or if the opening is very wide.
"A smaller form of razor:
"Lateen form of razor:
"Another well-made saw shape: it should be made in the form of an arch above it, with the blade of iron and the handle of wood well-made. "Shape of it:
"Form of a razor that has concavity:
"Another subtle form of razor:
"Form of another curved-edge razor:
"Small razor shape like a tongue:
"Another smaller cutting instrument:
"Shape of another cutting instrument; this one resembles a saw, with its end like a blade, and it is used in many places in the bones.
"Form of a saw suitable for cutting through bones:
"And its end is triangular with a sharp point.
"And it is made of Indian steel, and similarly, all the causes that we have said about razors and cutting instruments and saws.
"About the swelling of the extremities and the locking of the bones.
"The extremities may swell either due to an intrinsic cause or an extrinsic one. If you have treated that corruption with the appropriate medicines and the treatment does not work, sometimes the corruption goes away from the member without striking any cause. In such cases, it is necessary for you to cut off that member where the corruption has taken hold, so that the patient may escape death or a worse affliction of the member.
"And the sign of that which happens is that the member turns black, as if fire has already burned it, or the swelling increases until the swelling spreads throughout the body; and thus you should cut off that part.
"Similarly, if the cause of the corruption is a blow from some poisonous creature, such as a sea scorpion, viper, or asp, and similar things.
"And if the corruption or the blow is on the tip of the finger, then you should cut off the finger so that there is no space for the corruption to spread into the hand.
And similarly, if you access the hand, then incise it from the bottom of the wrist, and do not allow corruption until it takes hold in the arm's fireplace (wrist).
And if you remove that one, then incise the arm into the elbow at the joint.
And if the corruption passes and turns around the elbow, then in that case it is the death of the patient; and to administer another cause or cure is a matter of skill (or virtue).
And similarly, do for the foot when corruption turns around the toe of the foot; then incise that into one of the joints (of the toes).
And if it takes hold in the sole of the foot, then incise the entire foot. But if it rises into the shin, then incise the thigh at the knee joint.
And if the corruption has already reached the shin, then in that case there is nothing to do but give up and let the patient die.
And the manner of incising or sawing the member is that you place the ligature above the part where you want to incise, and place another ligature on the spot; and let the assistant extend a ligature between the parts below, and let the assistant extend another ligature above; and you separate the flesh which is between the two ligatures with a spatula until all the flesh is exposed; and then it should be incised or sawed.
Sure, I can help with that. Here's the translation of the given sentence:
Certainly! Let's translate the text line by line:
And then bind the affected limb with a bandage in the appropriate manner, and care for it until it is healed.
And I advise you that if something happens to a man in his foot, this accident which I and you are discussing, which is that darkness falls on his foot from the burning which resembles a fire.
And that corruption first happens in the aforementioned part, until it affects the entire foot.
And then that man prepares for himself the pus, because he sees that the cure is going to the limb with great violence and pain, and he cuts off that foot from the joint, and it heals.
A long time ago, the same corruption happened to him in the finger of his right hand.
And then he came to me, and I tried to draw out that excess with the water of medicines placed on his hand, for the cleansing of his body; but the excess was not drawn out, and it began to go to another finger in his hand.
And he asked me to cut off his hand, but I did not want to do that, hoping for the expulsion of that excess, and also because I feared that the amputation of his hand would cause his death, since the strength of the patient was weakened.
And since he recovered from me, he returned to his land and informed me that the man had cut off his entire hand, and he was cured.
I have not included this account except to serve as an aid in this affliction, and that it may be significant for understanding and properly treating the condition.
On the treatment of sinews and the properties of enemas with medications.
When an abscess occurs in any fleshy member and the space of the abscess is prolonged to the point where it collects pus, and then it breaks and perforates, and the pus exits from it, leaving the place empty as if it were a vessel, and the skin that is above it is also like a thin cloth, and it has not reached further corruption, and it does not press on the bone or nerve or ligament, it is called a sinew, and not a fistula.
However, if the space is prolonged to the point where corruption presses on any member, then it is called a fistula and not an ulcer.
And its treatment is that you should cut off all of that skin as it is rolled up, especially when it is thin and made like cloth, and ensure that it does not adhere to the place due to its corruption.
Sure, let's translate the given text line by line:
And it is that you consider the armpit, and if it is large, and the arm that hangs down has an unpleasant smell, then administer a cleansing enema to him with Egyptian medicine, which consists of oil, vinegar, and cinnamon divided into parts by mouth, and they should be mixed in a vessel, and they should be boiled over the fire until the medicine becomes thick and reaches the consistency of honey.
Then you take from him the necessary amount of water and dissolve it in water and honey; and administer an enema to him with that in his armpit, and strengthen his openings, and let the medicine stay in him for the duration of two hours.
Then extract that with a syringe; and do this for as many days until the armpit is cleansed and the odor is removed.
And sometimes it is administered with wood ash water, when this medicine is not available to you; and it is that you take the ash of wood, and put water on it; and then strain it through a cloth and enema him with it until you are sure that the armpit is cleansed.
And if the patient cannot tolerate the Egyptian medicine or the wood ash water, then enema him with water and honey mixed with ground cinnamon, and enema him also with vinegar and honey mixed together, for by the property of honey it cleanses and washes, and the vinegar adheres to the armpit, especially when there is an excess of astringency and dryness in the vinegar.
And when you do this several times and realize that the swelling has subsided, then administer an enema to him with water that promotes healing in him.
And take some of the compound ointment and dissolve it with rose oil and castor wax; or administer an enema to him with some medicines and other ointments that have the properties which I have already written in the treatise on ointments.
And if the orifice of the swelling is narrow and does not accept the canula for the enema, then you should gradually widen it with a small iron, and place in it a piece wrapped in Egyptian ointment or in Basilicum ointment until it is widened.
Similarly, if the orifice is wide, then you should gather its lips with a stitch and leave it in such quantity that the enema can enter without any problem.
And if the orifice from which the arm hangs is raised above the parts, then dry it in the lowest part of it so that the arm may hang below, because when the arm is constrained by the swelling, the flesh will be generated therein.
And if it is not possible for you to dry the sinus within the environment of the bone as much as you wish, then prepare the member with a preparation that allows the arm to move lightly according to your ability and ensure that there is no retained cause in the arm.
But what you place over the sinus opening, which you remove every hour, should remain in place as long as necessary for the arm to heal properly. And so that you may know if what comes out of the arm is too much or too little, or whether it is digested or undigested.
And with this, you should also consider the location of that sinus, whether the patient feels pain there or not, and if there is an abscess present.
And as you continue your treatment in this manner, and you see that the matter which has been placed over the orifice of the sinus adheres, or approaches a proper adhesion, then on the third day you should remove the material, and when you remove it, change the bandage for another one and renew the ointment.
But if from the sinus there comes out very subtle pus, do not despair of its adhesion, for its healing is near, because some people take a long time to generate flesh in their wounds, and others experience the opposite of this.
And if from the sinus for many days there comes out undigested blood, then know that the sinus does not adhere; and if the adhesion of the sinus is delayed and the cause is prolonged, then adjust in the drying of the medicines, and if the medicines are moist in their substance and in their virtue, they should be dried as well as ointment with diacritics when an excessive amount of honey is added to it.
Here's the translation of the given text:
Here's a line-by-line translation of the given text:
And at times, remedies are administered with long aristolochia, lily roots (specifically celestial lilies), and a mixture of errs flour and centaurea. Use these simple ingredients or adjust them as needed. Crush them, sift them, and reduce them to powder over honey that has been carefully measured; then use it.
And if the sinus is prolonged and does not heal with this treatment, know that the corruption is in his lung, and it has already spread to the bones or other hard members or ligaments; then treat him with a fistula cure, as mentioned above.
About the treatment of paronychia, nail bed injuries, and digit incisions and sections.
Paronychia is an abscess that forms under the nail of a finger or toe and can also occur in other fingers, and when it persists and its treatment is less valued, it becomes an abscess of abscesses or corrupts and throws pus into the root of the nail, and quickly corrodes that nail entirely, and soon its corruption reaches the bone, causing a fetid odor, and the tip of the finger is damaged, and its color turns black.
And so when you have that with water as we said in the division and do not perform your cure, then it is necessary for you to incise with iron all the superfluous that remains from the nail, and then cauterize the wound near this, because cautery is very useful in this case.
But if the bone is thin and the nail is healthy, and the additions of the nail already compress the flesh inside the parted places, and begin to prick and hurt that part, then it is necessary for you to place a thin ribbon under the corner of the nail that hurts the flesh, and push that upward, and cut that flesh easily, and place on that which remains of the flesh the burning corrosive medicines until everything is removed; and then heal that with ointments until it is healed.
But if the corruption has already reached the bone, then it is necessary for you to incise the bone there and remove it, because at no time will the bone be healed if it is corrupted in it.
And if you see the corruption and decay going towards the finger, then you should incise that at one of the joints according to how its memory is preserved, and then heal it until it is healed.
Here's my line-by-line translation of the given sentence:
"However, it should be noted that this affliction, which is born in the hands of some men, is very light and fleshy throughout, or very light in their bones, or very light in their nails.
"And some of them are born at the root of the joint, or it is their birthplace in certain knots of the aforementioned. "However, that which is born in certain knots of the finger does not hurt, and this one which is born in the joints hurts very much.
"And of those that are fleshy, the incision should be light, and it is that you should cut it out with a lancet.
"However, the care of that which is born in the root of the joint is difficult; therefore, beware of its incision.
"However, for that which is born in the knots of the finger, you should incise the flesh at its beginning with a round incision to the bone, and then saw it with one of those appropriate saws, and then care for that inside until it heals.
"However, the healing that occurs in the fingers between their visible joints is either due to the person's birth, or the healing of a wound, or the burning of fire, or similar causes. Therefore, you should cut away that healing until the fingers return to their natural shape.
And then place between their linens some oil-soaked cloths to prevent them from sticking together easily, and separate or place between them a thin lead sheet until they are properly joined together.
And similarly, if consolidation occurs in any of the said areas with the palm, then you should dry out that consolidation according to what is prepared and appropriate for the shape of the member.
Of the causes of ulcers, one is varicose veins.
Ulcers are varicose veins, which are large, twisted veins filled with melancholic excesses that appear on various parts of the body. They most commonly occur in the legs, especially among travelers, workers, and those who carry heavy loads.
Therefore, it is necessary that you administer purgative of the body with black hellebore several times, and then bleed the patient from the basilic vein.
However, their treatment with iron is according to two methods: one is that it be incised and the black blood drawn out, and the other method is that the vein be raised and all of it extracted.
The sectioning of the patient is done in this manner: first, immerse the leg in very hot water until the thick blood is dissolved, which is congealed in the leg, and then bind the patient's leg to the upper part of the thigh, below the groin, with a bandage. Then make an incision on one or two or three places on the vein with a broad cut, and then raise the black blood from below the leg upwards, first upwards and then downwards, until the amount of blood you want and need is drawn out, which will take away the patient's illness.
And then tie it up, and command the patient to abstain from foods that generate black bile.
And repeat the treatment with bloodletting when the veins are full and inform the patient of this.
But the elevation of them should be done in this manner: you who raise the patient's leg, if there are words on it, then dip it in water and place the leg in hot water until it turns red and the veins become prominent; or, if it is to be exercised by strong exercise, if bath is not available to you, until the limb is scratched.  (This sentence seems to describe two different methods for preparing a patient's leg before bloodletting or some other treatment.)
And then dry the string in the right side of the vein for incision in the length or the back of it you must remove, or in the lowest part of it you must cut the sole.
And then open the string with scissors and clean the vein from all sides until it appears to the touch, and you must watch for the sign of blackening that indicates the approach of death.
And thus, when you remove it and see that string white, it should be a good sign.
And then you place the reed underneath so that it is raised and separated from the string, and suspend it with a hook from above the bed.
And then make another incision near the first one for three times, and then remove the skin from the area above the vein until it appears.
And then lift that and cut it into another section behind the heel, and then remove it and lift it until it emerges from the second incision, and then remove it from the incision above it.
And do this until you have extracted it from the highest or deepest incision of all, so that everything is removed; and then cut into that.
And if you cannot extract and lift it, then insert a double-threaded needle with a strong thread and tie that; or put under it the reed and turn your hand in all directions until it is expelled. And be careful that it is not cut; because if it breaks, it will be difficult for you to lift it and it will have come upon the patient by that misfortune.
And when you have completely removed it, then place over the wound site wool soaked in oil and fat, both oiled and un-oiled, and treat that until it is healed.
Here's the translation of your sentence:
And you must be careful with your cut that you do not sever the vein and damage it, because it will be difficult for you to raise it; and use your wisdom in this matter.
The shape of the wound caused by the cut:
It is not acute like other wounds and it does not have a sharp edge to avoid damaging the vein; instead, it has a broad and flexible shape, because if it were thin, it would cut the vein due to its thinness; therefore, it must have some extra thickness as we have said.
Extraction of the calf vein.
This vein is generated in the thighs in hot, dry lands such as in Arabia and the hot, dry regions of India, where there is little tenderness and neither grass nor trees grow.
It is also generated in other parts of the body besides the thighs.
Its generation is due to putrefaction that comes from the intestines, like the poison of snakes and worms and scorpions and worms generated between the intestines and the flesh.
The sign of its onset is that this vein, when it occurs in the thigh, causes intense inflammation; and then the place swells; and then the vein begins to come out from the place of that swelling, as if cut by a knife.
And then, when the extremity appears from him/her, it is necessary that you wrap around it a lead weight which weighs between one and two pounds, and tighten it, leaving the lead hanging from the thigh.
And as many times as there is any cause for something to come out from him/her, wrap that in lead and tighten it. And if the object is prolonged, then cut off a part of it and wrap the rest; and do not cut it off immediately until it has come out, because if you cut it off prematurely, it will contract and enter into the flesh and cause an abscess and putrefaction in that place and a bad ulceration.
Therefore, it is necessary that it be treated gently and be extracted little by little until it has been expelled from the body and nothing remains within him/her.
And from this vein, it has come out in some men whose length was of five palms and ten fingers, and I have already heard that one came out of twenty palms.
And if it is cut during the time of its treatment, then insert the finger into his/her wound and pierce it with a long stick through the body until all of that which is in the material has been evacuated; and administer putrefaction of the place for several days with medicines; and afterward treat it according to the treatment of abscesses.
And this vein sometimes has many branches, especially when it appears at the joint of the foot or in the foot itself, and comes to him with many openings, and each opening has its own branch.
Therefore, treat it as we have said in the division, and with what was previously mentioned.
About the cutting of worms generated under the skin, and this disease is called cowpox.
This disease is named in some regions as cowpox, because it often afflicts cattle and there are few worms like this one which is born between the skin and flesh, and goes throughout the body ascending and descending, and shows its movement from member to member until it breaks through the skin and comes out.
And its generation is due to the putrefaction of certain humors, just as happens with worms, snakes, earthworms, and intestinal worms in the belly.
And it is feared for its malice, because when it goes into the body and rises to the head, and reaches the brain, then it quickly weakens it and enters and destroys the brain, and this happens frequently.
Therefore, when you want to cure it and extract it, this should not be done unless you observe its movement and appearance in the body, and then it is necessary for you to hold what is above it and what is below it tightly and strongly constricted, and immediately dry over it and extract it.
And if it is suspected in the flesh and you do not find it, then place a cautery with fire on the spot until it dies, and the main cause to be feared is corruption of it, which corrupts the spot as we have said.
And if you see that this [growth or infection] has reached the head near the eye, then press strongly on the eyelid with a tight bandage, and dry it out; and extract that [growth]; and it is important for the patient to use purgative medicines to cleanse their body of bad humors, and to avoid foods that cause putrefaction.
On cutting for pain in the nose.
This illness is called "nafir" in our land, and it is a pain that comes to certain members, and it often changes from one member to another.
And I have already seen [this illness] as I will now describe to you. I was called to attend a sick woman in a village, and when I uncovered her arm, I saw a small inflammation in the vein of her arm, and after it had been broken for an hour, I saw that inflammation move as if it were a worm going upwards, but lighter than a spider, as if it were live silver moving from place to place.  (This passage describes what is now known as a blood clot or embolism.)
And then they went away with the pain from that place and it settled in the muscle, and then they stayed here for one hour.
And then they ran to the other body until they reached the other arm.
And then he told me that it was turning over the entire body, just as I saw; and I was greatly amazed at its transformation and the speed with which it moved from one member to another. And I had seen something similar to this before in my dreams, however, I have never seen words that cause pain transforming from one member to another. But I did not see it in a dream as I saw it in the woman.
And I did not think it was because of that, but rather because the woman was old, and her body was dry and her veins exposed, so in this way the transformation of the wind appeared to be felt.
And it is necessary that this does not appear as a cure for those who are delicate and have bodies with moist veins.
And when you want to heal the patient and they feel that pain, then it does not appear to you in a dream as we have said. Then you strengthen yourself over that and lightly touch and prick them until that confined wind is released, and cauterize the spot.
Certainly! Here's a translation of the provided sentence:
From the removal of arrows.
Arrows vary according to their types and the places in the body where they strike, because their diversity is such that some have large tips, small ones, concave ones, and blunt ones; they are solid. And there are those with three angles, and those with tongues; and those with barbs.
And the signs of death are when an arrow strikes a person and passes through the bone and exits from the fontanelle which is on the skull, because there occurs through it a strong fever, blindness, dizziness, heat in the eyes, inflammation and heat of the tongue, spasms and confusion of the mind, vomiting of bile, and the speech becomes very weak and the voice is destroyed; and from the place of the wound white humidity similar to dust comes out, and his appearance is like the wateriness of the flesh.
And so, if these signs appear to you, then you must refrain from treatment and the removal of the arrow, unless it is necessary.
However, the signs of an arrow when it strikes the heart are such that it is close to the left nipple, and one feels that it has struck a hard object, not a hollow one; and the movement of the arrow is similar to the pulse's movement, and black blood flows from the wound, and there is coldness in the extremities, and a bad smell, and fainting; and so you should know that death will come without doubt.
And the signs when an arrow has struck the lung are that there is foamy blood coming from the wound, and the veins near the neck become engorged, and the patient's color changes, and they exhale a great deal of air, and they crave cold air.
And if the arrow strikes the peritoneum which is in the feet, and then the pain is near the small ribs, and there is a great deal of vehement pain and sighing, and all the limbs' muscles are not good.
And if the arrow strikes the stomach, then it is clear from the wound that some undigested food comes out.
Based on the provided text and the similarity to Latin, Italian, Spanish, and French, here's a line-by-line translation of the given sentence:
And if the arrow strikes the bladder and urine is expelled outside, and if any process causes the parts to protrude outside, and there is severe pain over the patient, then know that it is fatal.
But the other members, such as the face, neck, throat, shoulders and joints, backbones, collarbone, hip, thigh and their similar parts of the body are saved according to the major dispositions when the arrow does not find a vein or artery and is not poisoned.
And I recommend this to you because I have seen the nature of these arrows, so that you may recognize it for your treatment.
The cause of this is that in a man, an arrow struck him in the tear duct of his eye, and I extracted it from the other side, leaving its shaft in his ear, and he was healed, and nothing bad happened to his eye.
And I extracted another arrow from a Jew, which had struck him in the shaft of his eye, below the eyelid, and the arrow was hidden and could not be found except for a small tip attached to its shaft, and it was a large arrow among the sharp arrows of the Turks, with lion's iron on which there were no feathers.
Here's a line-by-line translation of your given text:
Sure, here is the translation of the given sentence:
And another arrow was extracted from a man who had it stuck in his belly, and it was thought that he would die because of it; therefore, since thirty days had passed without any change in his condition, an incision was made over the arrow and a hook was placed on it, and he was healed, and no other bad accident occurred to him.
And I saw another man in whom an arrow had struck his back, and the wound had healed over it; and after seven years, the arrow came out through the flesh of the cavity.
I saw a woman in whom an arrow had struck her belly, and the wound healed within her, and there was no change in her condition, and the woman did not suffer any injury to any of her natural functions.
I saw another man in whom an arrow had struck his face and the wound healed, and the arrow broke off, causing him little pain, and similar things happened to others.
The arrow was extracted from the man, one of the king's princes, who had it stuck in the middle of his nose and it had deviated slightly to the right side, with the entire arrow hidden.
And I was called to his care immediately after the arrow entered within three days.
And then I found the wound of the arrow to be very narrow; and then I searched for it with a fine probe, but did not feel it; however, he felt pain below the right ear, and then I suspected that this pain was caused by the tip of the arrow.
And I covered the area with a plaster containing attractive and digestive properties, hoping that the location of the arrow would become evident to me as it dried over it.
And no significant event occurred in that area indicating that the arrow had reached it; and I continued with the plaster over him for many days, but no event occurred; and during this time, the wound healed, and the patient improved from the extraction for a period of many days until one day he felt the arrow inside his nose and reported this to me.
And then I applied a sharp corrosive medicine to the wound for many days until it opened up, and with the probe I searched for it, and found the tip of the arrowhead, which was attached to the shaft.
And then I inserted the sharp medicine into the wound until I could clearly see the tip of the arrow, and I waited for four months with that.
And then, since the wound had expanded, and it was possible for me to insert the forceps into it, and they remained there without coming out, I did not stop trying and finding ways with various means until one day I began to take hold of it with finely made forceps, as will be shown in the end of this chapter, until I extracted it; and then I healed that wound.
And although many doctors thought that the cartilage of the nose could not be restored, I was able to restore it and the wound healed completely, and the patient was cured entirely, with no recurrence in any way.
And I will tell you the method of extracting some arrows, so that you may follow this rule and explanation on what has not been said, for the divisions of this art and its definitions are not understood through narrative alone, nor do books comprehend them.
And the wise craftsmen compare a little with words, and present things with absent things; and they find new operations and new instruments from the causes of strange accidents when they occur.
Here's the translation of the given sentence:
"And that which is thrown in the place where it enters, or is an arrow coming out of a fleshy part, and is pulled out and removed.
"And if it does not obey removal at the time it catches, then you must leave it for some days until the flesh around it becomes softened, and its attraction and exit are eased.
"And similarly, if it is stuck in the bone and does not obey your removal, then leave it there for some days and apply attraction and moisture to it each day, until it can be removed.
"And if it does not obey your removal after some days, then you should bore around the arrow in that bone from all sides with a fine trepan until the site is enlarged by the arrow, and then extract it.
Here's the translation of your sentence:
And if you cannot reach it because of the constriction caused by the wound and its depth, and there are no bones, nerves, or veins in the way, then you should incise the wound until it is wide enough to extract the arrow.
And if the arrow is lodged in the ears with which it is stuck, then you should free the flesh all around it on every side with all the skill you can muster; and devise a way to do this, if you cannot extract the arrow by pulling it through the flesh, fracturing the ears, or twisting them until they give way.
And when you perform the extraction of the arrow from any location, then use forceps with your hand on all sides until it complies; and be careful so that the arrow is not broken during this difficult procedure, both for the patient and the extraction itself.
And if you cannot extract it at that time, then leave it for some days until the surrounding areas have softened, and then attempt again when it has become more tolerable. But if there is a flow of blood from this, then you should administer what we said about treatment in its respective chapter.
And watch over your virtue in the incision of veins, or nerves, or cords, and administer genius in every possible way to avoid the arrow; do this with ease, tranquility, slowness, and firmness, as I have advised you and recommend for you.
And therefore do the opposite of the arrow so that the patient is according to the figure as you should place the shot of the arrow in him, for it is more beneficial. But if this is not possible for you, then administer what is possible according to the figures.
But arrows that have been shot from the opposite side of another part, or if any part has already protruded outside, or if there is a swelling at the tip of the arrow due to the presence of a more prominent part above the nearby bone; then press down on it; and the section should be according to the amount in which the forceps take hold; and then pull it out, because it will come out easily this way.
But if it is lodged in the bone, then you should twist the blade in the opposite direction until the arrow presses into the bone, and widen the opening as you insert it, and then extract the arrow.
And if not, leave it for some days, and then try again until it heals.
And if the shaft of the arrow is still in there, then you remove it with your hand.
But if the shaft has fallen out and you want to administer an injection, then you insert that instrument, which is hollow, into the wound so that it enters the cavity of the arrowhead and then you remove the arrowhead with your hand.
But if the arrow is barbed, then you remove it with a strong instrument entering the wound, for the arrow is relieved by that.
And if the arrow is poisoned, then it is necessary that you cut out all the flesh in which there is the poison, if this is possible for you, and then cure the wound with water that is suitable.
And if the arrow strikes the foot, or the belly, or the bladder, or the side, and it is close enough that you can touch it with your fingers, and it is possible to cut over it, then cut over it and beware of cutting a vein or nerve, and extract the arrowhead, and then close the wound if necessary, and cure it until it is healed.
"Form of forceps with which arrows are drawn:
"Their ends are like a bird's beak, made serrated, which grips the arrow so that it does not slip.
"And from these are made various types of arrows: large, few, and slender, according to the size of the arrow and its lightness, and the width of the wound, and the constriction thereof.
"like a ray, so that its entry into the hollow arrow is made easier and it is propelled by it.
"Of bloodletting from the veins.
"The veins from which it is customary to perform bloodletting are xxx, of which there are xvi in the head. These include two pulsatile veins near the ears, called auriculars; two veins on both temples; and two veins in the tear ducts of both eyes, known as lacrimals; a vein in the middle of the forehead, known as prephrontal; and a vein at the tip of the nose. There are also two jugular veins in the neck, two labial veins on the upper lip, and two labial veins on the lower lip — these are the veins known as angeli —; and there are two veins beneath the tongue. Here's a line-by-line translation of the provided text:
And in the foot and calf there are three veins; one of them is located below the curve of the wild boar's shinbone; the second is the saphenous vein, and its location is below the domestic pig's shinbone; the third is the sciatic vein, and its location is below the wild boar's shinbone; and in the calf there are other similar veins.
The treatment for the veins near the ears is for old catarrhs, migraines, headaches, and ancient wounds of the head.
And the method of bleeding those veins is as I have instructed you: it is to shave the patient's head, and to rub the patient's head in the occipital region where both veins are located with a broad cloth and good friction; then strengthen the patient's neck with a bandage until the two [veins] and their locations appear near the ears in two depressed areas of the head; and you will search for it with your finger, and if you feel the pulse of those [veins] with your finger, here is the sign and attempt.
Then you take the cutting lancet, and it is the one that is incising, and then you insert that below the vein in the neck until the bloodletting reaches the bone. And then lift your hand with the vein and the thread towards the divided parts, and incise the vein with an incising cut. And let the length of the incision be approximately two finger widths or around that; and make as much blood come out as you want.
Then strengthen with bandages and leave it until it is healed.
And already at the beginning of this book, the incision and their cauterization has been discussed.
But of the two arterial veins in the temples, the aid of phlebotomy is for migraine, ancient epilepsy and persistent headache and the bodies of acute, overflowing superfluities in the humors.
And the way to phlebotomize those [veins] is as I advise you: constrict the patient's neck with your hand until the two veins become evident by touch, and demonstrate their pulse under your finger; then proceed with caution.
Then raise the thread above the vein towards the divided parts with your index finger, and insert the phlebotomy knife underneath, and lift the vein upwards; and incise it as you have done with the two other veins; and let the blood flow according to your need.
Let's translate the sentence line by line:
Based on the provided text and context, here's a line-by-line translation of the given sentence:
And therefore, the incision for bloodletting from the vein of the forehead is appropriate for ancient diseases of the face, such as migraines and feverish infections.
And the quality of that bloodletting depends on what I tell you; it is as follows: have the patient strengthen their neck with a bandage until the vein appears; and then take the instrument which is called a "fossor," and this is its form.
Place the tip of the fossor atop that vein and strike it with a hammer or another heavy object, allowing the blood to flow according to the desired quantity; then remove the instrument from the patient and apply pressure until the wound is healed.
And sometimes it is opened with a lathe, but the lathe must not be as sharp as other bloodletting tools; rather, it should have a blunt end, and cut along the transverse direction because the bone there is very close and strong, and a sharp tool might break through to it.
But the incision of the two veins at the inner corners of the eyes is for scabies of the eyes due to fever and pustules in the eyes, and for diseases of the face.
And the quality of phlebotomy is that the patient should hold their neck with a bandage, and then you should perform phlebotomy, standing over their head.
And phlebotomy should be done according to the length of the transverse line by a little with small incisions, because in that place there is no flesh; and if the incision is too subtle, it may cause injury to its end.
Then let the blood flow as much as is necessary for you, and place a bandage over it, and hold that bandage for one night, and then remove it.
However, phlebotomy of the nasal vein is suitable for acute fever and severe sweating, as well as for facial ailments, migraines, and facial redness, especially when these conditions are chronic.
And the quality of that phlebotomy is that the patient should hold their neck and then take their nose with your left hand, and take a thin, long fleam, and place it in the middle of the top of the nose along its length, because the vein is not easily felt here, and because the blood begins to flow quickly.
So you should lift your hand with the fleam little by little and let the blood flow according to your need; and then bandage it for one night, because that place heals easily.
Mays le juvament de la fleubotomia de las doas guidegui a constriccio de ale e a comensament de lepra e a motas malautias e inpetige e malas ulceracios corrosivas ayssi cum herpotromeno.
And the nature of the phlebotomy for these [conditions] is such that the patient holds each one with his or her own hand; and the practitioners should be standing on the head of the patient, while the patient is seated on a stool.
Then perform phlebotomy on the long vein with a wide phlebotomy instrument, little by little; and extract blood according to an appropriate quantity or as many times as necessary for that; and do the same with the other vein.
Then unwrap the bandage and hold both veins with a moderate pressure to prevent the patient from becoming faint, and leave it until morning because the wound has healed.
And the benefit of phlebotomy on the varicose veins is that it cures small abscesses and pustules in the mouth, gum infection, bad ulcers and fissures, and bad ulcers that are on the nose and around it.
And the method of phlebotomy for these [conditions] is that you make the patient sit before you, and hold his neck with a bandage, and then turn back his lips and look at the two veins, one of which is on the right side of the lip and the other on the left; and the indication of each is by their blackness, and this is more so because around them there are small black veins; and then incise each with an incising incision.
If doubt remains for you and you don't know which one it is, then you should proceed with the incision of the larger one and the most evident among them.
And make an incision in both veins that are above the lips.
But of the two veins below the tongue, it is most appropriate to perform flebotomy on the cephalic vein for disorders related to the palate, as well as for disorders of the uvula and mouth.
And the method of flebotomizing those veins is as follows: place the patient between your hands in front of the sun, lift their tongue, and look underneath it; you will see on one side the cephalic vein and on the other side the jugular vein, and each of them has a color inclined toward blackness.
And then bleed each one; and be careful not to press too hard when bleeding these veins, because below them there are arteries.
And the veins that are bled in the elbow are those which are customary for all men. Their bleeding is performed in two ways: either by placing the flebotomy tool called milt or olive on the surface of the skin with a fine point; or by cutting with a scalpel, and it is called "alnessil". And this is how it's done:
You should use lances like these, and they are appropriate for opening the visible large veins that contain coarse blood and are not empty.
And this bloodletting is of lesser width and more subtle extremity, and it is appropriate for bloodletting of the fine veins that contain fine citrus blood.
But the benefit of bloodletting from the basilic vein, which is one of three veins, is that it draws blood from those who are ill in the area below the neck and the throat, and from that which affects the feet and the abdomen.
It is advisable for the person performing the bloodletting to be very careful when performing this bloodletting and to be above all cautious, because below it there is an artery, and if he errs or strikes in the puncture of the bloodletting, he will cut that artery and cause a flow of blood, so it is important not to perform this with a pointed bloodletting instrument before sectioning with a knife.
Here's the line-by-line translation of your provided sentence:
Here's the translation of the given sentence:
E when you see, as strengthening the bandage, swelling in the area that you have marked with a needle, then that swelling is swelling of the artery, and therefore avoid it.
E if you see the blood flowing in phlebotomy like an infant's urine, and the blood is thin and red, then know that it is from the artery; and then quickly cover and press your finger over it for a long time; and immediately remove your finger, and if the blood has been cut off, because many times it has been cut off, then strengthen the arm and let it be.
And keep the patient from his excrement, and he should be fearful of it and not touch it for several days until he is cured.
But if the blood has not been cut off, and you see that there is no medicine present for this, then you should cut the artery, if it appears to you; because its end is constricted, and the blood is cut off; or take a scorpion's tail, and make an incision with it, and take half of it and strengthen it over the vein's location with a tight bandage and with powders until the next day.
And then if the blood has been severed, it is good; and if not, then cure that (condition) with the same water as mentioned earlier, at the location of where the powder flows out from the blood.
And the severing of his blood is difficult in many ways due to the small location of the wound and the possibility of tearing the arm.
But with the dark vein, phlebotomy is helpful to extract blood from the higher part of the head and the lower part of the body; because it is composed of branches of the basilic vein and branches of the cephalic (vein), as we have said.
And it is necessary for the phlebotomist to be cautious in the phlebotomy of that person, because below it there is a nerve; and so if he hits the nerve with the puncture of the phlebotomy, then stupor will happen to him, and his healing will be difficult, and often he will not be completely healed. And this nerve often appears in feeling; and if it is hidden from some people and is subtle and not shown, then you should place the phlebotomy with which you are phlebotomizing with a section of alloy, and avoid the nerve with your strength.
And if the vein is between two nerves, then you cut the vein lengthwise.
The advantage of phlebotomy on the cephalic vein is that it draws blood from the head and heals eye diseases.
It is particularly relevant in this case if you want the phlebotomy to be performed with an olive-shaped lancet or a myrtle-shaped one; for it is the safest of all veins, as it does not adjoin any artery or nerve.
However, it is quite possible that there will be a swelling in some people if they are not phlebotomized on the first percussion, but do not touch that swelling.
The first is that you should know that phlebotomy is administered only for the preservation of health and hope for it, and as a precaution against illnesses, and that phlebotomy be performed on one of the veins in the arm, namely: cephalic, dark, and basilica; and that phlebotomy be done at the beginning of spring, fasting in spring and autumn, and in winter near a meal, when signs of repletion appear.
And let a phlebotomy be performed on the third day or as soon as possible after three hours have passed from the start of the day.
But phlebotomy that is administered, the more it provokes convenience and necessity for this, whether at night or during the day, at any hour and in all seasons.
And it is advisable that a child not be bled until he has reached fourteen years of age, and a pregnant woman should not be bled except between the fourth and seventh months, and the elderly who have already passed sixty years should not be bled.
And when someone wishes to be bled by any means, it is advisable that they cleanse their intestines before the phlebotomy with a laxative enema, if there is much retained feces, so that the veins do not draw the superfluidities of the purified intestines in the phlebotomy, which are putrid and harmful to the main members.
And patients suffering from definite nausea or drunkenness, or who are not yet recovered from illness or intoxication, should not be bled, nor should those with dropsy, and phlebotomy should especially be feared in cases of colic, vomiting, abdominal masses, increased coitus, labor, fasting, vigils, and any cause that dissolves the vital force, whether corporeal or animal.
And then consider in the subtleties of humors whether before this if the blood is thick, with foods and drinks, and with medicines if it is to their ability for this.
And then enter a bath if there is no obstacle preventing it, or exercise through some exercise to make the blood thin.
And perform phlebotomy on the patient in the morning, around the third hour of the day, as we have said.
And ensure that the patient's feet are protected from all animal mishaps on that day, such as distress, anger, fear, and all bodily accidents, such as hard work, unnecessary pain, cold, and similar things.
And for his seat, have the causes present with him in the form of things that are commonly used by men for fragrance and scent, and with balms and similar things according to their ability to provide relief.
And let the phlebotomist sit on a cushion that is higher than the cushion of the one who is to be bled.
Then extract the patient's arm and rub it with his hand two or three times, then tightly bind the ligature with a strap and wrap it two more times.
And let the tightness be moderate, for if the tightness is not equal, or if it is excessive, then it prevents the blood from flowing; or if it is too loose, then it allows the body to lose blood quickly.
Here's the translation for your sentence:
Based on the context and the similarities to medieval medical terminology in languages like Latin, Italian, Spanish, and French, here's a line-by-line translation of the given text into English:
And therefore, it is necessary that the phlebotomist be determined and attentive to all these causes.
And then remove the phlebotomy, but if the vein has been opened once, then it is good; and if not, you should try again in another place a little below that one, or on top of it hastily, if the area is not inflamed.
And if the area is inflamed or the patient is exhausted, then you should leave it for a day or two and not tighten the bandage, because forcefully pulling an abscess will cause it to burst, nor should they enter a bath.
And then attempt phlebotomy again if you wish.
And if the opening is small and blood flows subtly, and you fear that not enough blood will come out, then you should attempt phlebotomy again in that vein according to its straightness and adjust slightly in the opening, and do this hastily before the area becomes inflamed, because an inflamed area requires a small opening.
But if you see that it is already inflamed, then do not attempt [phlebotomy] again on it, because no cause excuses your action; and place on it some of the oil mixture, because it soothes the body of blood. And in this case, oil is better than any other remedy.
And similarly, apply oil to the incision in all bloodletting, with which you can draw off the prohibited humors of the body and create a tincture called alfadoc and sagzenea when placed on the wound, because the blood is thus thinned and turned liquid.
And if a large abscess is formed at the site of the bloodletting, which often happens, especially to those who have not been bled before this time or where the vein has opened slightly, then you should cut and place over the wound a sponge soaked in water and salt, pressed firmly for one hour, because it will be dissolved.
And you should do this close to the end of bleeding from that vein or another vein.
And if any blackness or greenish color remains in the area for several days, do not worry about it; and if you wish, place on it some powder of aloe and myrrh dissolved in water, or some juice of mint, or something similar to that.
And often such abscesses and swellings require bleeding from the basilic vein.
And so place your hand on it, and if you find softness, then apply pressure to it, for that swelling is harmful and bad; and therefore be careful not to press on it without a reason for doing so, because blood will flow heavily from the artery.
And make an emplastrum with water that has been made stiptic (astringent), so that the place may be hardened; and then care for it with another treatment until it is healed.
And it is necessary to draw blood from each person according to the quantity of their virtue and according to the dominant color in their blood, as it appears.
For if the blood is black, then let it flow until it becomes red; and similarly, if you see that it is thick, then let it flow until it becomes thin; and similarly, if it is sharp (acidic), then let it flow until its sharpness has been removed.
And it is necessary for one who is full and strong and has a need to have blood drawn in one time, that the phlebotomy of the vein be enlarged and that the phlebotomy be wide.
And in one who is weak, the opposite should be done, and it is necessary for that person to have blood drawn in several times, and that the incision be narrow.
"And the best method in phlebotomy of a vein is that it be a transverse cut, not a puncture.
"And this method of phlebotomy is safe from excessive bleeding and injury to nerves, and it is considered more praiseworthy and safer than phlebotomy according to width and length.
"And if syncope is likely to occur during phlebotomy, you should treat it beforehand with a small piece of bread soaked in vinegar or honey water, and draw out the blood in three or four portions.
"And if there is coldness of complexion, then before the phlebotomy take bread soaked in myrrh syrup or honey syrup flavored with spices such as pepper, cinnamon, ginger, and similar ones, or in strongly scented aromatic syrup.
"And if syncope occurs during phlebotomy due to excessive blood loss, then one should drink water infused with meat and strongly scented, subtle syrup; use aromatics such as rosewater, and anoint their feet with it.
"And for other causes of syncope mentioned in the chapter on syncope, use evacuation.
Certainly! Let's translate the text line by line:
"But if one wants to try their own arm and spill their blood for the second time, and their body is strong, then they should do this approximately seven or nine hours after the first phlebotomy.
"But if one wants to draw blood from the opposite side of the body where they lean, it is necessary that this be done on the second or third day.
"But when there is too much blood in the body and it becomes heated and causes fever, it is necessary to draw a large amount of blood from the patient all at once and widen the opening until fainting occurs, because you will have preserved all the conditions for phlebotomy; and you should place your hand on the pulse of the patient's wrist so that they do not die instead of fainting, because many times this happens when the bloodletter is ignorant and negligent.
"And it is not necessary when you want to release the arm and evacuate the blood a second time, as the orifice of the vein has already closed and the flow of blood has become difficult, that you press strongly on it; rather, bend it slightly, because this is too harsh.
Here's the translation of the given text:
And if the vein is infected, then leave it alone and do not touch it until the infection has subsided.
And if necessity forces you to bleed the patient accordingly, and there is no excuse, then bleed them at that spot or on the other arm in another vein.
And the vein called "funis del bras" is phlebotomized in place of the cephalic or basilic veins when they are not found or hidden, because it is composed of those.
And the quality of his phlebotomy is that the patient places their hand in hot water until the vein becomes reddened and clearly appears.
And then it should be constricted with a ligature in the middle of the limb; and then phlebotomize according to the small transverse vein, not longitudinally or according to the length.
And let the opening be wide and your phlebotomy be with which you phlebotomize that on the joint of the hand a little.
And if the flow of blood is blocked, then immerse the hand in hot water and let the blood run into the water until you achieve your goal.
Based on the context and the similarities to Latin, Italian, Spanish, and French, here's a line-by-line translation of the given text:
And the bloodletting of this vein is safer than that of all other veins because after it there is no pulse-bearing vein or nerve.
And the bloodletting from the little finger of the right hand is beneficial for liver diseases.
And the way to perform bloodletting on it is to firmly grasp the hand with a band or your hand, after you have placed it in hot water until the vein is swollen and clearly visible; then make a transverse incision; and if you do not succeed fully, it will not matter.
And be careful not to cut your hand during bloodletting, because after that the nerves of the aforementioned are exposed.
Then immerse the hand again in hot water and allow the blood to flow into it, because if you do not immerse it in hot water, the blood will clot at the opening of the vein, and it will be forbidden to flow.
And when the blood has been drawn according to the necessary amount, then place oil and salt on the vein so that it is not immediately closed; and similarly, you should do this for every narrow vessel.
Here's a translation of the given sentence into English:
And perform similarly in his bloodletting as you have done in the other case.
And the benefit of bloodletting from the saphenous vein is for diseases in the lower part of the body, such as women's diseases, retention of menses, and old leg ulcers and their similar diseases.
And the quality of his bloodletting is that the patient should place their foot in hot water and perform friction on it until the veins appear; then bind a band around the joint of the foot; the location of the vein, which is at the sole of the foot, should be poked with a needle, from which many small branches extend across the surface of the foot.  (This description seems to indicate that the bloodletting was done by pricking the veins on the sole of the foot, rather than using a lancet or other cutting instrument.)
Therefore, bleed the larger vein or below the thigh near the sole of the foot, as this is better and more healthful.
And if you bleed that vein on the surface of the foot, then beware of the nerves that are beneath it on the surface of the foot, and perform your bloodletting with that [needle] which you use to bleed by going through [the skin], as if you were trying to cut it.  (This caution may be due to the fact that the surface veins of the foot are close to nerves and tendons, and puncturing them could cause damage.)
It seems like you're trying to guess the meaning of a medieval medical text. I can help you translate it, but please note that without more context or a clearer understanding of the language, my translations might not be perfectly accurate. Here's my best attempt at translating "E sia le fleubotomi vosil":
If the bleeding is not permitted, then you should immerse the patient's foot in hot water and allow the blood to flow until it has been evacuated.
And if the bloodletter errs in the first attempt, then try again with the bloodletting instrument a little lower, for the spot is salty; and do not fear the evil, but beware of the nerves as we have said.
Likewise, do the same with the saphenous vein of the other foot.
And for the sciatic vein, the spot as we have said is at the heel below the protrusion of the wild part.
The benefit of bloodletting in this case is to alleviate hip pain when it is caused by excessive blood.
And the quality of this bloodletting is that the patient should enter a bath, and bathe and strengthen the area of his thigh from the side of the hip down to the heel in four days with a long, thin bandage, so that it does not appear otherwise.
And so when it appears, then you should bloodlet that according to each type that is possible for you and according to the transverse direction, which is better; or incise that with an incision or dry it with a dry procedure, for its spot is salty.
It seems like the text is discussing a medical condition involving pain in the feet and possibly other parts of the body. Let's break down the sentence:
And beware of the nerves, and make the blood flow in the desired quantity.
And then release the stricture and place a cotton pad on the location of the phlebotomy, and strengthen the area, for it heals easily.
Of cupping and of the qualities to use them.
Cups are made of horn, or of glass, or of crystal.
And cupping is done in two ways: one is with scarification and bloodletting, and the other is cupping without scarification.
And this cupping without scarification is done in two ways, for it is either with fire or without fire.
And there are fourteen places on the body where cups with scarification and bloodletting are applied: one of these is called alnocrati, and it is the last part of the head; another is in the middle of the two parts of the neck together; another is under the jawbone below the mouth; another is on the soles of the feet; another is on the big toe at the end of the foot; another is on the two wrists; another is on the two elbows; and another is on the two knees.  (The list seems to be incomplete, as it only mentions twelve locations instead of fourteen.)
Certainly, let's translate the given text line by line into English:
It seems like the text is describing a medical procedure or advice related to joint pain and possibly gout. Let's translate the provided sentence line by line:
And therefore when you encounter any of those causes, and especially if it is in the third or middle of the month, then command that cupping be done, since two or three hours have passed during the day.
And the benefit of cupping from the neck is that when you apply it to the head, it relieves heaviness and reduces swelling in the eyes; however, it is better if this treatment also results in an overall evacuation of the body.
And this cupping is done at the site of phlebotomy of the cephalic vein.
And it is not permitted to use this on someone who has a full bladder or who has a cold, because it can cause great harm to them.
And for this reason, it is not advisable to use this treatment on the elderly, especially those with weakened heads.
But for someone who is prone to forgetfulness due to this treatment, you should command the cupping practitioner to pause his hand briefly with the cup at the end of each session, out of fear of inducing forgetfulness.
But cupping from the alkehel is done at the site of phlebotomy of the black vein and the basilic vein: and for this reason it helps with asthma, constricted breath, cleft palate, cough, and fullness.
"And it is necessary that the ventouse be removed quickly, for if it is left in place, it causes weakness in the body and in the stomach.
"And the cupping treatment for headaches alleviates pains in the head, cataracts, migraines, and tooth root pains; it is used instead of phlebotomy on the vein.
"And it is necessary that you order the cupping practitioner not to press their hand with scarification, so as not to cut the artery and cause blood flow.
"And cupping on the chin relieves hiccups in the mouth, decay of the gums, and similar ailments present in the mouth; it is used instead of phlebotomy of the vein that runs between the two lips.
"But cupping done on both temples relieves catarrh, which is caused by an excess of heat.
"And cupping on both sides of the eyes relieves the need for phlebotomy of three veins—the basilic, saphenous and cephalic—since it draws blood from all smaller veins within the flesh, and from the smaller veins of other larger veins until the attraction reaches all three veins.
And command the ventozador that he should not proceed excessively in scarification, because the area is devoid of flesh, and only nerves and arteries remain beneath.
And use a cupping glass with which you cup over the hips and apply it to the hemorrhoids of the anus and the ulcerous sores beneath.
And it is important to command the ventozador that it should be a large cupping glass, and that it should be made of iron, because the area requires strong suction; and let the subtle, fine cupping glasses be discarded, and let there be scarification beforehand.
However, cupping of the hips is to be done in a more refined manner, for they draw blood from all parts of the body; and it helps with old pains of the loins and back, and of the bladder; and it stimulates menstruation, and helps with fatigue and weakness; and it can serve as an alternative to phlebotomy on both temples, and the neck, and on both ankles.
However, they greatly weaken the entire body and cause syncope in many people.
And for the cupping of the neck, the treatment is similar to that for the cupping of both hips.
And the quality of the positioning of the cupping glasses is that you should place the cup initially empty and then apply suction moderately, not prolonging the positioning of the cups, but rather place them lightly, and leave them for a short time, so that the humors come to the affected area gradually. And do not stop repeating this process and continuing until you see the area turn red and swollen, and the sign of blood appears.
And then you scarify [make small incisions] and repeat the suction gently, little by little, taking into account the condition of the patient's body.
Because a man with thin and delicate skin should only be scarified once, and not more, to prevent the area from becoming ulcerated.
And instruct the cupper to widen the scarification a little and prick it gently, and then apply suction easily.
And if the blood is thick, then you should scarify twice, because in the first instance, the pathway is opened for the subtilization of the blood and its moisture. But in the second [scarification], it is for the thorough investigation and removal of the thick blood.
And if the blood is very impure, then a scarification should be made for the third time to obtain the last.
And finally, when we want to extract the blood little by little or in small amounts, one scarification is enough for us.
And if we want to extract a lot of blood, we scarify with many scarifications; and if we know that the blood is thick, then it is necessary to scarify with a sharp cautery.
And the depth of the scarification should be only as deep as the tip of the knife.
And if the person whose knife is thick, hard, dark, and whose pores are narrow, it is necessary that the places for the cupping glasses be anointed with gentler, more open, and more resolving substances; in summertime, such as aloe oil or violet oil, or oil of wild thyme, or oil of celery seed; and in wintertime, then narcissus oil, or lily oil, or oil of chamomile, or henna oil, and similar ones.
And if the excess is thick and strong, then the oil should be of marigold, or of costmary, or of aloe, or of dill, and similar ones.
This appears to be a text discussing the treatment of gout or similar joint pain using ventouses (cupping therapy). Here's a line-by-line translation:
And that person whose blood is of excessive moisture, wash their temples with vinegar or with water of myrtle and sumac, similar to this.
And for that person whose superfluities are large, wash their temples with old vinegar, or with water of savory (which is marjoram), or decoction of dill, or chamomile, and similar to this.
And it is necessary that the washing of the temples be done before bathing; and it is necessary that it be administered immediately after bathing for one hour or two, and it is necessary that they sleep after the washing of the temples.
What should guide the regulation of bloodletting before washing the temples?
It is necessary to consider at the beginning: if the person who will wash the temples or who will be bled is choleric and has sharp and inflamed blood, then it is necessary that they take cooling agents, such as sour apples, endive with vinegar and lettuce, sow thistle, cucumber, and similar to this.
And let their food be such as polenta, and the flesh of small birds, and foods seasoned with sour, and similar to this.
And for the one whose condition is serious, it is necessary that they drink syrup of almonds or syrup of cumin seeds, sumac, and half a tablespoon of aromatic vinegar between meals; and that it be recommended to them to use moderation in drinking and eating, and to avoid dishes such as chicken, rabbit, fish, small birds, and pigeon.
And it is necessary that on the day of venesection or bloodletting, the drink should be greater than the food.
And it is necessary that some men be given to drink at certain hours before venesection or bloodletting a theriac alpharac, or musk-based medicine, such as nutmeg or mace, so that the main members are comforted and the blood is refined; and it is not necessary for them to take that remedy.
But the venesections that are without incision should be venesections placed on the liver, and on the spleen and gout, and on the navel, in the places of the kidneys, and the pubic region, because these members do not tolerate incision upon them.
And they are only sought for those purposes: to draw blood from the member, as when a venesection is placed on the breast in a disease of bloody nose; and it is used for this purpose, so that the serious and viscous swelling of the member may be dissolved, as when it is placed on the abdomen and navel; because that rarefies the member, heals it, and removes the pain by resolving the swelling.
And already placed on the temples when it happens in their opacity or darkness, because by virtue of strong attraction it easily removes opacity and eradicates the darkness from its place.
Similarly, it does when placed on the liver and spleen to dispel wind trapped in those areas.
And these treatments are administered only with suction; and some are administered with fire.
And some treatments are administered filled with warm water for ailments of the spleen.
And this is why the treatment container should be filled and made larger; it should contain only hot water or water with suitable herbs mixed in.
The form of the treatment administered with fire: the diameter of the orifice should be two fingers wide, according to how we have formed it; and the quantity of air should be half a palm's length; and it should be on the side of him, in the circular area, half of it, the hole should be small so that an needle can fit into it.
It should be made of red copper or citron wood, with thick, smooth, and polished edges so that it does not disturb the member on which it is placed.
And let there be in the middle of the iron or bronze rod, upon which a candle with fire is placed.
And this enema should be larger than the one we just described, and smaller according to the patient's condition and their state of health.
And enema treatments for infants and weakened individuals are different from those for the young and robust adults.
And the method of placing this heated enema on the limb is to extend a piece of linen with decently burning wood in front of a small wax candle, and place it in the middle of the cross-shaped rod in the center of the enema, so that the fire surrounds the opening and does not burn the patient's body.
Then it should be placed on the patient's limb, and the finger should be on the opening we mentioned, until when we have the enema ready and do not need to use the finger anymore, and steam escapes from that opening, then the enema will quickly melt away.
Then wet the cloth according to its method, and use more if necessary.  Translation:  Then moisten the cloth as needed, and add more if required.
However, in the case of an enema administered for pleurisy, it is done with water and does not require a cross-shaped rod or opening. It should only be placed on the affected limb after being filled with water.
And this is its form: And this cupping device, the larger it is, the better, because it can receive a greater quantity of water.
Chapter ninety-seven.
Leeches are not applied to all members but only to those in which the position of cupping is impossible due to their smallness, such as the feet and gums or similar parts; or to a member devoid of flesh, such as the finger and the nose and their similarities.
And regarding the quality of using these, if you find leeches that are in clean, stagnant waters.
And then they should be placed during the day and night in stagnant water until they are sluggish, and no cause remains in their belly; and then the body should be evacuated at the beginning with bloodletting and cupping; and then the member of the patient should be rubbed until it turns red; and then they should be placed on him.
And when they are full and drop off.
And if it is possible to suck the place with a cupping device, it is more beneficial for healing.
And if not, then wash the place with vinegar and afterwards with warm water; and it should be rubbed and squeezed.
And if the body's blood flow is prolonged near the bite of leeches and it bleeds, then you should dip a cloth in cold water and place it over the area until the bleeding stops.
If the blood has increased, then sprinkle upon it powdered vitriol or any other hemostatic substance until the bleeding stops; or place over the area cooked beans, and let them remain until they stick to the spot, and the bleeding is stopped.
And it may be necessary to use leeches again, changing them as often as possible.
If the leeches cannot be suspended, then wash the area with fresh blood or insert a needle into the spots until there is bleeding; and immediately place others (leeches), because those that sense any blood will quickly attach themselves.
And when you want them to fall off, sprinkle a little powdered aloe, or salt, or ash over them, and they will fall off immediately.
Thus begins the chapter of the third section: on healing. This chapter is very important in the art of medicine, and it deals with the healing of fractures and dislocations in bones.
"Oh, son, be aware that fools and common people, as well as those who at any time have not paid attention to the books of the Ancients or read a single letter from them, boast about this chapter.
"And for this reason, this method of the learned in our land has been kept secret; and I have not forgotten it at any time, but rather I have devoted myself to the long study of the books of the Ancients until I extracted the science from them.
"And then I directed my efforts and studies throughout my life.
"And I have already described in this chapter all that my knowledge contains and on which my experience has passed; since here I have shortened it for you others and relieved you of the burden of length; and I have shortened it to the end of brevity; and I have shown it to the end of clarification; and I have formed in it many forms of the instruments that are used in it, as is done by addition of clarification, just as I did in the two preceding chapters.
"First Chapter.
"A summary and gathering of the causes of bone fractures, from which premise is necessary before we begin to recall the members that are broken and their various types. Here's my attempt at translating the given sentence:
And so I say that when a fracture or dislocation or twisting or falling occurs, it is necessary for you to begin with phlebotomy or cupping therapy, or both at the same time, unless there is some impediment, such as weakness of virtue, if it happens to a child, or an old person in decline, or if it is during very hot weather, or very cold.
Then be content with a diet of fresh herbs and bird meat and crabs; avoid heavy meats and fill yourself with foods that do not clog the veins with blood, until you are sure to prevent pus formation, and if you do not fear the loss of material from the limb.
And then return the patient to their previous diet with which they were accustomed.
And so when the broken bone begins to heal, it is necessary for the patient to be fed with nutritious foods that are heavy and thick in consistency, such as foods made from wheat cooked in water, rice, caps, feet, stomachs of cows, eggs, fresh fish, fatty meat and similar things, and with this diet a fracture heals more lightly and better.
And know that brittle bones in men who are in their first youth or in the elderly cannot be continued and healed according to their nature due to the dryness of their members.
However, nature adjusts and attaches over the broken bone from all sides with a similar substance to glue, which adheres and strengthens it until they are completely joined together and bound, reaching the end of strength and firmness, like fire at its beginning, as long as no cause hinders it from its work.
And for this reason, it is necessary to place food on the patient's table that has weight, stickiness, and density, as we have said.
And know that the species of fractures are diverse according to the diversity of the members, for the fracture of the bone of the thigh is different from the fracture of the bone of the head; and the fracture of the bone of the foot is different from the fracture of the bone of the back; and similarly all the other members are diverse among themselves.
Here's a line-by-line translation of the provided text:
"Different types of fractures in themselves. Sure, let's translate this line by line:
"And for every type of person, it is either a natural or specific torment in the restoration of him, according to what will follow as a distinct memory in his places.
"A sign of bone fracture. "And for this reason, a bone fracture is known: it is the distortion of it, and the prominence and protrusion felt in it, as well as its compression when you press on that part with your hand.
"And therefore, when there is no visible distortion or pain felt upon your touch, and when you shake the bone with your hand and the patient does not experience great pain, then it is not a fracture here.
"However, it is possible that it is only a slight distortion or small crack, so you should not move or compress it; instead, apply appropriate medications to the area as needed, and use a fine, tight bandage.
"And know that when the place is arched and not split into two or another such thing happens in it without bleeding, as all parts of its companion are moved, then you should begin to straighten it, having taken care that no abscess occurs there.
And if to him an abscess happens, then leave it alone for some days until the abscess subsides; and then treat it according to each method that you can of lightness and of skill.
And know that the restoration and puncturing of him is lighter than of the bone in which the satiety occurs.
And then strengthen him according to how his memory returns to him.
But if in the bone there is satiety, then it is necessary to extend this broken member into two parts, whether it is the hand or the foot; with your hand if the member is small; or with two cords or with one cord and the hand.
And let your position be with which you place the member in its natural figure, while the parts are extended from the broken member, then make sure that you return those additions skillfully and according to each method that you can in their places.
And be careful according to your strength that nothing happens to the patient through your operation of pain or injury; and make sure as best you can that you apply one bone with its companion in their best forms.
And it is necessary that at that time you touch him with your hand, and if you see here any different cause, correct it and treat it according to the amount of your skill.
Based on the provided text and patterns, here's a line-by-line translation attempt:
And the quality of the stricture of the calm limb is as I recommend; so that you know that broken limbs are diverse in their smallness and greatness and in their form.
And for those that are small, such as the arm, the finger, and the foot, it is necessary that the binding be of a very fine cloth.
But for those that are large, such as the thigh or the leg, it is necessary that the binding be hard and strong, because a strong binding connects the large limb and strengthens it equally on all sides, so that there is no gap in it.
And then begin by appropriately placing a bandage on the location of the break with three or four wraps, depending on the size of the limb; and strengthen your hand slightly with the bandage.
And then come to the highest part of the location of the break, and strengthen it so that your bandage does not loosen from the place where you have strengthened the break. And then slightly lengthen yourself with the bandage of the location of the break, and gradually loosen the bandage until you take a larger part from that location.
And then take another bandage and wrap it again over the broken place with a bandage, and then come to the wraps at the lower part of the break; and your operation should be in the strengthening of the wrap and in loosening it according to what we have said above in the first wrap.
And then place between the wraps of linen or cloth a pad with which the twist of the break is enclosed, if there is a twist; and if not, do not place anything in it for any reason.
And then place another bandage on it, and then cover it with these wraps that are well made immediately, if there is no swelling or abscess in the place; and if so, place on it what cures the abscess and removes the swelling; and leave it like this for several days; and then strengthen over it with the wraps.
And let the bedposts of the patient's bed be made of strong reed, and well shaped; or of pine wood; or of palm leaves; and let each post be wide according to this shape and this figure.
However, it is necessary that the post placed on that fracture be slightly larger and stronger than the other posts, and the length of the post according to the size of the limb; and then strengthen over the posts with another bandage following your initial binding method; and then bind above decently according to what we have said about binding, and let your binding be closer to the site of the fracture, and the farther it is from the fracture, the less the binding should be.
And it is necessary that the threads be fine in thickness and delicacy, and let them be of silk; and if the threads are thick, as I have seen in the operation of some foolish people placing their threads of twisted cord, this is a great error, because the binding would not be even.
And likewise, very fine threads are not suitable, because you will not achieve with them the binding that you desire, and there should not be more than one finger's width between post and post.
"And if the patient is affected by the extremities of the stars near the narrow places of their body, then place underneath them a layer of thick wool or flannel until it causes no harm.
"Sometimes there is a break accompanied by bleeding, and it causes a rupture in the spine. I will remember this in the next chapter under specific cases.
"And know that not every broken limb is immediately bound with bandages on the first day; for the reason that if the member is large, it is better to leave it unbound for about five or seven days, or more, according to your caution against the possibility of a harmful abscess.
"And this is the manner of applying plasters which the Ancients used to treat fractures, dislocations, and twists.
"Method of applying a plaster for the healing of fractures, suitable for many complex cases and especially for women and children, because it does not allow heat or cold: you should take flour dust from a mill, which is the fine part of the flour that sticks to the walls of the mill.
"And make it thus: you should strain it with egg white and apply the mixture not too thick or too thin; then use this.
This text appears to be discussing another method for creating a plaster that can help with fractures, dislocations, and twists. Here's the line-by-line translation:
Here's the translation of the given sentence:
Here's a line-by-line translation of the given text:
Method for treating separated joints and bones, as well as the pain occurring in these areas, including cracks and fractures: Take clean wool and soak it in vinegar and cuddy oil, then apply it to the affected area.
But this treatment does not have the power of restoration; rather, it helps control inflammation and alleviates pain.
Another method for treating broken bones is to take leaves of wild fig and wild poppy, crush them together, and make a plaster from the mixture.
Method for a shortened plaster treatment to promote bone healing and resolve remaining inflammation: take equal parts of mallow root, chamomile flowers, violet flowers, and oat flour; crush them all together and mix with vinegar, if the limb is not cut.
But if it is cut, then make that mixture with water from a moistened cabbage leaf or with water and use it.
Another stronger plaster method for resolving tough inflammation to promote limb healing: take equal parts of mallow root, linseed, marshmallow root, melilot, majoram, violet flowers, and chamomile; crush them all together and mix with willow water, soft water, or vinegar, according to the condition of the limb and its color.
Based on the pattern you've provided, here's a translation of the given sentence:
Mays a Gualia es vist que sian pausatz sobre le membre trencat deves la restauracio de lu e las causas en las quals es exsiccacio am petit de caliditat so ayssi cum mirra, enses e semblantz a lor de aquelas causas que havem recomtadas.
Method for making a plaster for wounds and pain: Take half a measure of sesame seeds, peels of pomegranate, or feathers of a bird, and althea, and salt, all divided into equal parts; crush them, sift them, and mix them well to make a plaster.
But the amount of time during which the bandage should remain in place and be left undisturbed depends on whether there is pain or swelling, or if the bone is broken and has moved from its original position; in that case, you must not remove it for several days. And if there is severe pain, swelling or inflammation at the site, then you must cut or remove it immediately and take off the plaster from him.
And take a cloth and a marine sponge soaked in warm water, and with that wash the area until the swelling ceases and the pain is alleviated; then let the member rest for an hour; then place on it wool soaked in vinegar and oil or rosemary oil, and bind it overnight to be sure that the abscess is cautious, that the inflammation of the member subsides, and that its pain is removed.
Here's the translation of the given sentence:
And if you see that the abscess and redness and pain and swelling and all the symptoms have been removed entirely, and you are in need of a plaster or bandage, then repeat that process as you did at the beginning equally.
And if no cause of those that we have mentioned happens to the member, then do not release it but rather wait three days or four or five or seven; and sometimes all this is left for twenty days according to what you judge by the release of the member, as we have said, until the fracture adheres and approaches the coagulation of the flesh upon it.
Then tighten the bandage more than your first bandage, and adjust it according to the thickness of the patient's flesh, as previously remembered.
But if you see the place of the fracture is dry and atrophied more than necessary, know that nutrition is prohibited from reaching it; therefore, soak it with lukewarm water every time you unwrap it; and do this for three days in total; and slightly loosen the bandage, and through this operation, nourishment will reach the member, and it will heal easily.
Here is a line-by-line translation of the provided sentence:
And I have not seen anyone do this, which is why it is more reasonable that you should not do it.
Chapter two: On fractures when they occur in the head.
There are many kinds of fractures and their forms vary, as do the causes, for some fractures are caused by a blow from a blunt object, which drives all the bone inward to the skull, leaving only the skin, just as is done with wood, and for this reason this kind is called comminuted. Or the blunt object strikes only part of the bone, cutting the flesh of it but not penetrating through to the back; and this kind of fracture is called a simple depression.
And the wound of these two fractures may be large or small, and the fracture may be crushed or splintered; and the cause of it is a blow with a hammer or falling onto stone, or something similar to them.
And this fracture may be penetrating, approaching the skin that is beneath the bone; or it may be in the surface of the bone, and the wound of these two fractures may be large or small.
And this fracture is like a hairline crack in the bone, very fine, and for this reason this kind of fracture is called capillary.
Here's the translation of your provided text:
"And this is particularly done in the bodies of infants, such as infant skulls.
"And for all these types of fractures, they are like stars spread apart. "And I come to remind you of all this in its place.
"And know all these types of fractures by detection on them, and by investigation with tests and removal of decayed flesh that is on them.
"And the capillary type is recognized by this: it is exposed on the bone, and cleaned, and rubbed over with testa, because the fracture appears black.
"However, in the treatment of fractures, first consider the accidents of the patient, and then if you see through the accidents that they indicate fear by manifest signs such as vomiting of bile, extension, loss of consciousness, hoarseness of voice, syncope, acute fever, protrusion of the eyes and redness of those, and similar to them in the major dispositions, without doubt it will not be cured.
"And if you see non-serious accidents, you expect a cure, then you begin the treatment of him/her.
The text appears to be a medieval medical treatise discussing the treatment of joint pain, particularly gout, and other related conditions. Based on the given lines, here's an attempt at translating the first source sentence into English:
And if it is in the days of summer, then you should cauterize the bone before the seventh day, ensuring that what is underneath the bone has been corrupted by panniculus, and that the accidents we have mentioned occur.
And if the fracture has already reached the panniculus covering the brain, and it is with small fragments and gravel, then you should incise the comminuted and gritty fragment, as I will now relate to you.
And it is that you shave the head of the patient and discover over the bone according to custom and manner as possible for you according to the figure of the wound, and that it be light on the patient.
And if it happens to you that you detect the bone, flow of blood or pus cauterized, then you should oppose it with what is needed, and it is that you fill the place with cloths soaked in wine and rose oil, and make the wound rest until the pus is settled, and be sure of the blood flow; and then begin in the circumcision of the bone and its removal.
And this should be done according to one of two methods of operation.
And one method is that you incise the bone with a narrow chisel like this, and this is its shape: And then administer another chisel, slightly wider than the first; and this is its shape:
"And then administer more of the incision fluid than the second [amount].
"And you should have a different number of incision tools, some longer than others, and some narrower than the rest, and they should be sharp at their tips, made of iron or steel.
"And use them with ease when striking the incision tools, so that you do not cut off the head and hurt the patient.
"And if the bone is strong and hard, then you should pierce it beforehand with a circular motion before administering the incision tools with the trephines, which are called non-penetrating trephines.
"And they are not named this way just because those do not reach the end of the bone to that place which is near it; rather, the trephine has a round tip or edge on its end, similar to a small margin or circle, which prevents it from being submerged and passing through the thickness of the bone.
"And it is appropriate for you to take many of these trephines, each suitable for the thickness of each bone, so that in all skulls of the brain, the tip is sharp, and the quantity in length and width is according to the thickness of this bone.
Certainly! Here's the translation of your source sentence into English:
Here's the translation for the first sentence:
And it is crucial that you ensure with all caution that the incision does not touch any cause of infection.
And when you have drilled the bone and separated it from the abscess if they are connected, and you have extracted it, it is necessary to scrape and cleanse that area with a rough tool similar to an incision instrument, but more slender and more subtle than other incision instruments.
And if there remains any small or sharp fragment of bone, then take that out with ease using the appropriate instrument; and then cure the wound with linens and ointments as we have described.
And the other method of operation is easy and free from danger, which is praised by Gualia and lauded as great; and this is his saying: it is necessary for you at the beginning to begin to expose the broken part of the bone in the place where the fracture is most violent and most apparent. When you have exposed that part and placed under it the tip of a slow and gentle incision instrument, such is its form:
And the lenticular part is slow and does not cut anything, while the pointed part goes into it from two sides in length, as you see; so that the lenticular part is fitted to the abscess with its sharp cutting face on the bone.
Here's my attempt to translate the given sentence:
Here's a line-by-line translation of the given text:
Based on the context and the similarities to Latin, Italian, Spanish, and French, here is a possible translation of the text:
Here's the translation of your sentence:
In any of the other small capillary fractures or subtle fractures, it is necessary to administer care according to what has been lost for its correction.
And this is due to the fact that not all those who have studied in this art are alike. And we will now show what we have written about large fractures.
And if the skin is torn when you remove the bone, then take a cloth according to the size of the wound and soak it in rose oil, and place it on the opening of the wound; and then take another folded or tripled cloth and soak it in wine and rose oil and place it over the first cloth, and do this as lightly as possible so that you do not burden the hip; and then apply a linen bandage to it, and do not tighten it except for the amount that the wound has, only.
And leave it with this care for one day or two until you are sure of cauterizing the abscess; and then unbind it and then administer medicines that are superfluous dryness, such as linseed oil and erysimum flour, powdered sandalwood and arsenic, and similar ones.
And it is that you make of these medicines a powder which is sprinkled over the wound, in this way while they are dry; and generally, administer to him all medicine of the quality that it may cleanse and not sting.
And be careful according to your skill that the wound in your care is clean; and there should not be in it the foolishness of ointment or other things; nor let virulence increase in it; for when it is placed on the brain's skin, it corrupts it and then it poisons it, and this evil malice happens to the patient soon.
And it happens in the cavity of the head, especially when the bone is exposed and when its care is neglected, and there is blackness on its surface; and therefore consider if these accidents happen to the patient, you will know that it is pernicious without any doubt.
And if there is no blackness except from the medicine that is applied on it, and it is within the power of that medicine to make that blackness, then you should take of honey one part and of olive oil three parts, and with those liniments, wipe a cloth, and then place that over the cavity; and then treat it with the medicines of healing until it is healed.
De la natura de las enfermos e delas dolorosas febres.
Of the restoration of the nose when it is broken.
Know that the nose is not broken but rather two parts are separated at once, or one of them partially. This happens because there are two bones in the nose: the lower part is cartilaginous and does not break; instead, it suffers swelling, twisting, and bending.
However, if one of the two parts is broken, you must insert your little finger into the patient's nose and straighten the fracture from within with your index finger and press from outside with your thumb until the nose returns to its natural shape. And do this carefully so that you do not cause further pain to the patient through your operation.
And if the fracture is in the upper part of the nose and your finger cannot reach it, then it should be reduced with the end of a thin reed.
And if the fracture is in both parts, you will do something similar to this.
And proceed with the restoration on the first day of the fracture, if possible; otherwise, you must wait until the seventh or tenth day to remove the splint.
And immediately insert a wick of linen cloth into the tip of the nose if the break is in one part, or two wicks if the break is in two parts, and let it be in the thickest wick so that it fills the hole of the nose.
And so say some of the ancient restorers that the wicks should be wrapped in bandages and changed every day, but I have not seen this; it is necessary for the wick to be wrapped in egg white mixed with powdered myrrh; and then let the wick stay there until the bone is set and the cartilage is healed.
And sometimes it should be inserted into the nose in place of a wick, under the form of an ointment wrapped in linen cloth; and this is because the fracture of the nose is very severe and the patient is not prohibited from breathing.
And for this reason it is not necessary for you to do so; and if you wish, you can do that [apply the ointment], or if you wish, you can use wicks.
And if another time a hot abscess occurs, plaster the nose with wax or cotton infused in vinegar and rose oil, or with diachylon.
If you don't cause an abscess cautiously, then it is necessary to apply a plaster outside with sesame flour and powdered sandalwood mixed with egg albumin; and then place a lion stone over it, and do not lift the nose for any reason.
But if the bones of the nose are broken or crushed into small fragments, then it is necessary to make incisions over them and extract them with appropriate instruments; then close the incision, and heal it with water that promotes healing and strengthening, and with suitable plasters.
And if there is a wound inside the nose, then it is necessary to heal that with honey and administer lead cannulas until it is completely healed.
Chapter IV
Of the restoration of the jaw when it is broken.
When the jaw has been broken and the fracture is not caused by a wound, consider then if the fracture is only on the outside and not broken in two and curved inward at the parts inside, its recognition is easy.
Therefore, if the fracture is on the right side, you should insert your left index finger into the patient's mouth; and similarly, if the fracture is on the left jaw, then insert the aforementioned index finger of the right hand; and with that, push the protrusion of the fracture inward toward the parts outward, with your other hand from the outside of the bone; with that, gently reduce it.
And if the fracture of the jaw is already separated into two parts, then it is necessary to apply traction on both parts according to their natural alignment until they can be realigned.
If there is a dislodgement of teeth, then strengthen those that you expect will remain in place with gold or silver wire or silk thread; and place over the broken jaw a piece of waxed cloth, and another folded cloth, and a large cloth decently prepared, or a sole of leather equal to the length of the jaw; and bind it all together according to your skill and the appropriate application, until it is not displaced.
And command the patient to rest and be quiet, and give him only thin liquids to drink.
And if you believe that the shape has already been altered in some way, then you should wait until the third day before you remove it; and afterwards, correct what has been altered and plaster it with powder of mallow, egg white, or samole flour, after removing the wax from it, and place a piece of wool cloth over the plaster.
And when that plaster is firmly attached and the bone's position has not been altered, leave it in place, do not remove it until it has healed and strengthened the fracture; for many times this fracture is healed within three weeks.
And if in another case an abscess forms, then administer what we have said many times for the patient's sedation until it is healed, and the abscess is removed.
And if the fracture is with a wound, then consider whether it is a piece of bone separated or splinters. Then you should be skilled in removing those splinters with an instrument suitable for that purpose.
And if the opening of the wound is narrow, then you should enlarge it with a lancet according to the quantity of your need.
And after you have removed those splinters and nothing remains, then if the opening of the wound is wide, close it; but if not, place one of the suitable plasters on it, and let it heal.
Chapter .5
On the restoration of the collarbone when it is broken.
Many times the collarbone is broken from the front due to a muscle and that fracture occurs in one of three ways.
Because it is broken, separated, or divided into two parts without splinters; and this one is easy to restore; or it happens that there are splinters in it, and this is difficult to restore; or it happens that the fracture is with a wound.
And the operation in that case, when the fracture is without injury, is to have present two assistants: one should support the injured area and follow the broken collarbone, while the other extends the neck towards that side.
And then you should splint the fracture with the aforementioned materials until it takes the desired shape and is neither too prominent nor too concave.
And if you need more extension, then place a roll of cloth or wool under the patient's shoulder blade according to your needs; stretch and lift the collarbone, and shorten the roll with your hand until you splint the fracture as needed.
And if you cannot pull the end of the collarbone to the sides outside, because it has reached the lung, then it is necessary for the patient to be supine on his back, and place a half-meter cushion on his chest muscle.
And the assistant should press on the patient's chest muscles towards the sides until the collarbone bone is raised to its normal position, and then you should straighten the fracture and splint it with the aforementioned materials.
"But if you feel splinters from the wishbone and they are painful, then it is necessary to cut over that area and extract those splinters easily.
"And if it is retained in the bone, then you should devise an incision with one of the instruments that you have prepared for this purpose, after having placed below the wishbone the instrument that serves to extract; and this tool is made of wood or iron, and its shape is like this:
"And it resembles a spoon, whose shape is concave; and its width should be according to what you need from it, depending on the size of the bone or its smallness.
"But the length of it should be according to what is possible for you during the operation; that it has two ends as seen here, and one end should be wide and the other narrow.
"And if the opening of the wound which you have cut when you extracted the splinter from the bone is wide, and you are sure that there will be an abscess, then you should bring together the two lips of the wound with a stitch.
"And if the opening is small, or you fear that there will be an abscess, then you should fill the wound with cloth and wool according to the size of the wound's cut.
And if an abscess occurs, then dip a cloth in vinegar and rose oil mixed with wine, and place it on the affected area.
And ensure that the stick does not press too hard on the broken bone; and therefore it is necessary for you to see the patient every day, because when the bandage becomes soft or the stick is lifted up, then you must correct this and strengthen the bond.
And then place the pillow of the patient on their neck, and place a small cushion under their chin during the night to raise the helper's hands at that time, so that the fracture of the furcula is raised by the elevation of the muscle; or the patient's arms are tied to their neck.
And do not loosen the bandage unless there is an abscess or pustule in the area within twelve days.
And promptly renew the poultice if you see the face of the patient turn blue, adjust it in the constriction and restore it until the break in the collarbone is healed and clotted.
And strengthened and comforted according to the month in twenty-eight days, and sometimes in some men it is done in less time than that.
Chapter VI.
Of the restoration of a broken shoulder.
The spatula (scapula) is often broken in the outer part of it, and not broken from it but rather its edges.
And therefore when it is broken in the middle of it—and it is often broken in the middle part of it—and it is not known except by touch, then according to the figure of the fracture, force its preparation and reduce that according to the natural figure in every way you can possibly manage.
And promptly place on the area powder of flour with egg white and stop it with linen; and promptly place folded cloth over it; and promptly place on it a thin wooden splint according to the size of the entire scapula or slightly more.
"But if the blade is concave in some places of the spoon, then you fill that concavity with lard, and then place the blade according to its shape.
"And then strengthen it from above with a bandage, tightly and firmly, so that the blade is not displaced from its place.
"And observe the bandage every day; and whenever it is found to be loose, bind it again, tighten it, and straighten the blade if it has been displaced from its place.
"And inform the patient about his condition.
"And the spoon is restored in 20 days or 25.
"And so when that number of days is completed, then you remove the bandage, and be assured that this is one of the bones whose initial placement is not feared nor their dissolution.
"And if it proceeds from the place of the bone, press and place the rope underneath, then you cut over it, remove it, and act as we have said in the case of the breaking of the furcula of Sadacio with regard to the formation of pus, if this happens here.
"Chapter VII
"On the restoration of a broken foot.
Based on the context provided and the similarity to medieval Latin, Italian, Spanish, and French, let's translate this sentence:
And of the patient's accidents when the middle part is broken it declines towards the internal parts and great pain happens, and difficulty in breathing, cough, strong fever, and vomiting blood; and it is declared in the cavity of the broken bone and is not hidden from feeling.
And the restoration of the patient is that he be placed on his back, and a cushion be put under his shoulders; then press upon his muscles, and adjust his ribs with the hands of two assistants, and be careful in your operation and in making the joint conform to its proper shape by every means possible and necessary until the figure of the bone returns as it should.
And then place upon him a plaster and wool and put above it a thin board of willow or hazel or similar light material after you wrap that in cloth; and be careful to place that on the broken bone so that it is not displaced; and go with ligatures following the curvature of the spine several times, and strengthen that with proper tightness; and be attentive to the ligature at all times, and when it becomes softened strengthen it.
And if necessity provokes the loosening of that, you must look for swelling or suppuration, or pain, or an abscess that occurs in that place. Then cut and unravel it, remove the plaster and correct what happens by treating it appropriately; and then replace the plaster if you see the surface; and adjust the bandage until he is healed.
"Chapter 8.
"On the restoration of ribs when they are broken.
"You should know that the fracture of ribs does not occur except in large parts, like the back; and from their ends, on the front side, this injury does not happen unless it is caused by something because they are cartilaginous. "And the recognition of it is hidden to the senses; therefore, its investigation must be done with words.
"And the restoration should be done in such a way that it encloses the fracture with words as much as possible, until it is healed according to what is necessary. Then apply and strengthen the broken bones with linen bandages, if needed.
"And if the fracture of the ribs tends towards the inner parts, then there is severe pain and puncturing for the patient, just like the puncturing that occurs in those with pleurisy, because the bone punctures the membrane; and there will be difficulty in breathing, coughing, and vomiting of much blood; and this is difficult to cure.
"And the Ancients have ingeniously addressed this with very ingenious words.
"And of them it is said: it is necessary to place the patient's food that causes flatulence and wind, so that the belly becomes inflated and distended, and thus the fracture is pushed towards the outer parts.
"But we would advise this in order to avoid causing an abscess accidentally; and if it has already happened, then it is already too late to help.
And they say some of them should be placed over the bladder and then squeezed with force; this seems reasonable, but it is feared that squeezing the bladder may drive the excess fluids to the affected area due to weakness.
And they say some of them: the area should be covered with wool that has been soaked in hot oil, and cushions should be placed between the ribs until it is filled, making the padding equal when wrapped around according to its shape; and then treat the patient with a pleurisy diet and medicine.
And if the patient experiences intense constipation that they cannot bear, and the bones are pressing on the abdominal membrane with tooth-like points, we fear for the patient. Then it is necessary to make an incision in that area, expose the broken rib, and place over it the instrument that conserves the memory, whose shape has been described earlier. We should then cut the bone with ease and extract it.
And then we should join together the two lips of the wound, if it is large, using stitches, and treat it with poultices until it heals.
And if an abscess forms inside, then you should take and soak cushions in hot oil and place them on the area, and the patient should be treated with water suitable for internal use against the abscess.
And he should be laid on his back on a bed where he usually sleeps until he is healed.
Chapter .ix
Of the restoration of a fracture of the spine of the back and neck.
Sometimes there is a fracture in the bones of the neck, and later it spreads to the spine of the back. And if this happens to someone and you want to know whether they will be healed or not, consider: if you see their hands have become softened, numb, and lifeless, and cannot move, extend, or strengthen them, and when you constrict those [hands] with your words or prick them with a needle and there is no pain in them, then you know that they are not healed, and in this condition it is fatal.
And if they move and feel the constriction with words and puncture, then you know that the bone of the neck is saved and that the patient will be healed with care.
And if you see the spine of the neck in a similar state and want to know whether it will be healed or not, then consider the patient's feet.
Then if you see that they have become softened, something similar happens to them as happened to the hands: and then when they lie on their back, there is urination and defecation without their will, and sometimes they are laid on their back and want to urinate but cannot, then you know that it is fatal, and therefore do not bother with their care.
Sure, here's a translation attempt for that line:
And the treatment for it is that you should pierce through the abscess with a hot iron that you have placed on the anointed spine, with oil or alone, or with wool soaked in honey; place this on the area several times a day until the abscess has been drained.
And then place one of the comforting and strengthening plasters on it, securing it with a bandage; and instruct the patient to rest and stay calm, and not to sleep on the painful side until it is healed.
And if the detachment of the sciatic bone or any other cause has already occurred, then it is necessary to cut off the tip and remove that bone; and then close the two lips of the wound with a stitch if it is large; and then treat it with some healing ointment until it is healed.
But if the end of the bone has broken off and it is at the tip of the tail, then you should insert your left little finger into the rectum and push the broken bone back with the other hand as much as possible; and then place a plaster and bandage on it, if you have them, and secure it.
And if you feel broken bones in him, then cut open that area, remove the bone fragments, and treat the wound with the treatment that has been described until it is healed.
Chapter 10
On the restoration of the soul or mind.
The bones of the hips are often broken, and if they break, the fracture occurs only at the ends of these bones and extends along their length, declining towards the interior; and the patient experiences pain in that area and a puncture, and the thigh becomes numb when it is broken.
And the restoration of him is that you place your hand over that area until it reaches the break, which resembles his figure.
And if the break is only at the end of it, then you should enclose that part with an equal enclosure until it resembles its natural figure.
But if the break is in the long part that has already declined towards the interior, then you should make the patient lie on their back until you are ready to restore that break. And then when you have enclosed it, place a plaster on him, and then place on that a board of wood or leather, and tighten it by binding so that you do not fear the breakage of the fracture or the removal of the board.
And fill the cavity with water that reaches the point where it takes in the stricture according to equality, and command the patient to sleep on their back or side.
But if you encounter a hot abscess, then cease from extending it and from its restoration until the hot abscess is settled, and place water on it that settles it according to what has been said before; and then return to the restoration of it, and strengthen it as needed.
And if this occurs in the bone shards or they are broken, then you treat them.
Chapter XI
On the restoration of a fracture of the ankle.
The ankle is that which is between the heel and the head of the shoulder.
And if it is broken, then the restoration of it is in one of two ways, one of which is that you take a pole flat and of medium thickness according to this form:
And let there be tied at both ends of the poles two bands, and then let it be suspended from a high place.
And let the patient lie on a bench; and then let him throw out his broken arm onto the pole until it reaches the middle of it, where the curve of the pole is attached.
And immediately suspend that person over something heavy or let the servant extend them to the parts below; and then the physician should hold the fracture with their hands simultaneously until the fracture returns as needed.
And another method is for the patient to be laid on their back with their neck suspended by a ligament, and then order two servants: one to hold that which is above the fracture with their hands, and the other to hold their feet; and each of them should extend to their respective parts.
And if you want the extension to be stronger, then strengthen with a ligament on the fracture and another on that, and each of the two servants should extend to their two parts.
Therefore, if the fracture is near the end of the bone, then half of the ligament should be placed above the cartilage and the other below the fracture towards the elbow.
Similarly, if the fracture is near the elbow, then place the ligament on that spot and on that elbow.
Pull it together with ease and without difficulty, and then when it is pulled together as needed and has been applied properly, strengthen it if an abscess does not form.
Here's a line-by-line translation of the given sentence:
And the way to strengthen it is to place a plaster on the fracture, then wrap a bandage of new cloth over the plaster; then adjust the arm on that support, and keep your open hand on its own muscle.
And place the cloth and strengthen on the support the arm, so that the arm is in its proper place. If there is any cause that prevents this due to the broken bone, prohibit it.
And then use splints.
And it is that you should place on the fracture that splint which is thinnest and strongest among the other splints; and place between each splint the width of a finger, and let the length of the splints be according to the break with an addition of three fingers from both ends.
And then strengthen on the splints with the bandage that was mentioned at the beginning of the chapter.
And let your bandage over the place of the break be tighter. And the longer the break is, the looser the bandage should be.
And if you see that the position of the splints and the bandage is as we have said at the time when you restore the limb to its proper place, then do so.
And if you fear an abscess is forming, then you should leave the stricture and stitches in place for seven days as we have said.
And then consider the bandage in all parts for three days, so that swelling or inflammation does not occur in the area; or it is prohibited to allow food to reach the member by order of the excessiveness of the stricture; and therefore, rectify everything as we have said.
But if you are confident that nothing will happen due to this, then do not loosen the bandage until after three days or more.
And let the patient's sleep be on their back, and their hands should be on their stomach.
And place on the assistant a full bowl of wool equally, and consider at all hours of the night or day that the shape of the broken member is not disturbed nor dissolved, or that the bandage is softened; therefore, correct this with all your skill.
And give the patient's food according to the order which we mentioned before, so that the food is subtle at the beginning until it begins to strengthen; and then it is necessary to thicken the patient's food.
For it is customary for the assistant and the patient's thigh to be strengthened in forty days; and then it is necessary to loosen them and administer a bath, and let them be treated with ointments that correct this.
And if the fracture is recent, then do not remove from it the bandage and the splints for one day or two months.
### Chapter XII
**On the restoration of a broken arm.**
The arm is composed of two bones, which are called focils; one of them is small and is the bone that supports the thumb, and the other is large and is located below the small bone, on the lower side.
And very often, only the larger focil is broken, or the smaller one, and very often they are broken together.
And when the small focil is broken above, then its restoration is easy, and its healing is even easier.
And when it is broken below the fracture of it is severe, and its healing is difficult.
And even worse than that is when two bones are broken together.
Therefore, if the bone that is broken is the small focil above, then it is appropriate for the physician to make a slight extension with ease until it is equalized.
But if the large focil is what is broken, then he should make a more vigorous extension.
"And if both lips are tightly closed, then you should apply more pressure when writing.
"You should place the figure of the hand for the patient's restoration and extend it over a cushion, with the palm of the hand facing upwards, as all the others have said, and the auricular vein should be lower than the others, and let the patient sit on a low chair.
"And there should be a cushion in front of him at the height or right place, so that the patient does not encounter difficulty.
"And another minister should extend his arm from below with his hand or cord, and another minister should do the same above.
"And then the doctor should bring the bones together so that they are reduced in the best shape possible.
"And if there are splinters in the fracture, then you should remove all of them from their place with your skill.
"And if it appears that the splinter is separate and does not respond to restoration efforts, then you should make an incision over it and remove it according to the manner we mentioned earlier.
"But if the fracture is with a wound, I have already written about this in a separate chapter, so refer to that for its care.
Here is the translation of the provided sentence:
And know that the number of stars on the arm can be seen in the greatest arrangements, whether it is a break in one small bone or in two small bones simultaneously.
And then press your bandage firmly and vigorously onto the site of the fracture, and if the bandage extends above or below the fracture, moisten the bandage slightly according to what was said at the beginning of this chapter.
And the bandages wrapped around the fracture should be soft and moist, not hard or rough, and the thread used to secure them should be of moderate thickness, neither too fine nor too thick, as we have recommended.
And examine the limb and its binding after several days. And if something happens that requires correction, such as swelling of the limb, then you must soak the limb in hot water until the swelling subsides.
And allow the limb to rest without constraint until it recovers, and then reapply the bandage.
And if the bandage has softened and the bone has healed and appears as it should, then set everything right with your skill.
And consider if the nourishment is prohibited from reaching the member due to excessive stricture, for then it is necessary that you soften it a little and let it rest for some days until the nourishment reaches it, and then strengthen it.
But if the patient does not experience any of those causes that we have mentioned, then it is not necessary to keep them restricted for about twenty days or thereabouts.
And the patient's hand should be suspended by its power of agitated movements, and make them sleep on their back.
And know that this fracture is restored in thirty days or thirty-two days, or if it is slightly severe, it is restored in twenty-eight days, and all of this depends on the condition of the humors and the power of nature.
Chapter XIII
Of the restoration of a broken finger or toe.
Know that in the fingers of the hand and the toes of the feet, tardy or delayed fractures often occur, and nothing else happens to them.
And when the hand experiences a fracture or dislocation, then it is necessary for the patient to lie on their back and in front of them place one hundred bricks according to their size, and then place the patient's hand over it with the palm facing upwards.
And then the assistant should extend the broken bones, and the doctor should reduce them until they are properly realigned with a good reduction.
And then it is necessary to place a plaster and bandage, lest an abscess form; and then place a steel plate over the area according to its size, and you have already wrapped that in linen cloth.
But if the fracture is in the internal parts of the palm, you should then turn over the hand and make it look like a ball with cloth, and command the patient to squeeze that with their broken palm; then bind it tightly with long cloth.
And let there be a hole in the leather through which a strap can pass, so that the leather is applied to the palm; and tighten it as needed.
But if the fracture is in the external parts of the palm, then it is necessary to place a steel plate on top and another steel plate on the inside of the palm, so that the hand is open and straight; and then bind the splint, as the hand is turned to the side with bandages.
And if there is a fracture in any of the bones of the fingers, then if it is the tip of the finger, it should be reduced as needed and then bound to the palm, and if you wish, place a small straight splint so that the fracture is elevated and not displaced.
If the fracture is in the aforementioned fingers, such as the middle finger, index finger, ring finger, or little finger, then splint and bandage it with the said finger; or all can be bandaged together continuously, which is better; or place a small pad on it, as we have mentioned for toes.
And consider, in your treatment, to apply a poultice or compress — with the appropriate procedure — to what is necessary when any of these causes occur, according to the patient's specific condition.
Chapter XIV.
On the treatment of a fractured pelvic bone.
The prominent pubic bone is often broken and can be detected by touch as it shifts forward and upward.
The treatment is performed by securing a bandage over the fracture and another bandage under it, with the patient lying on their stomach and face down.
And then the attendant should extend all the bandages to their full length according to the quality of the fracture when it is in the middle of the bone.
But if the fracture is near the pelvic bone, then the bandage should be placed near the navel towards the groin, so that its extension reaches there, and the other bandage under the fracture.
And similarly, if the break is on the ankle, then the splint should be made near the ankle, and the extension should be towards the lower parts.
And then the physician should hold the bones with both hands until they are returned to their natural shape and the bone is firmly joined; at this point it is necessary to apply a plaster and bandage, otherwise an abscess may occur in the limb. But if an abscess occurs in him, then you should leave it alone for a few days until the abscess has matured, and then return to your treatment.
The bandage of him should be made as follows: it is necessary to wrap around the fracture a hard bandage, and fold it two or three times, removing any excess; then wrap the thigh until it reaches the ankle and the root of the knee.
And insert a long needle between the knee and the thigh near the ankle on the lower side, so that the ends of the needle come out from the higher part of both sides; then turn around the thigh and knee what is left over from the bandage.
And immediately place a pillow on the hip in the location of that fracture splint, and place one of those splints over the thigh bone.
And immediately fill the empty space between the thigh and the hip with soft cloths, so that the hernia may be coagulated.
And immediately begin with a strong binding in the middle over the location of the fracture with three or four wraps, and as you distance yourself from the location of the fracture, your bindings should be less tight and lighter and moister.
And immediately extend both ends of the thread to the parts below until it reaches the ankle of the foot, and strengthen both ends of the splints on the other side so that the binding is not displaced from its place.
And immediately loosen the binding on it, so that it does not cause corruption or an abscess in the limb, nor swelling and similar things; and if any of these occur, then be careful with him and correct what happens promptly, as we have said many times.
But if there is a piece of bone protruding, then you should try to push it back as much as possible; and if not, cover it with a cloth and leave it in place, and treat it with the same ointment mentioned earlier until it heals.
This is an interesting challenge! Let's try to translate this line by line:
"However, in the restoration of the patient in such a manner, do not cause a limp; and if it is restored alone, or if another thing is applied to the other leg, then it is necessary that the one who was always lame should limp.
"And know that the cushion is held in place for 40 days or a little more or less, and all of this depends on the variety of conditions and other dispositions.
"Chapter XV
"On the restoration of the fracture of the kneecap.
"Know that the fracture of the patella often occurs late, but it happens to those who have been seen many times before.
"But if a fracture occurs, then it is only a crack or hole in its parts, and this happens with or without blows, and everything depends on the feeling.
"And the restoration of it is such that what is broken from its parts should be covered with the said [substances] until it is joined and united as much as possible by equality, ease, and skill.
"And then place a plaster and place it on that round table, if necessary; and hold it in place with a bandage as needed.
And then consider all the dispositions that have been recommended for other fractures, similarly as it is in the case of abscesses and similar things, ensuring that everything appropriate is done for the patient until they are healed.
### Chapter XVI
### On the Restoration of a Fractured Thigh
Know that in the thigh there are two bones: one is large and is called the femur; the other is slender and is called the fibula.
And it can happen to either of the types of fractures that occur in both bones of the arm; and thus the restoration is done similarly as the restoration of the arm, and the procedure for them is the same.
And if two bones are crushed together, the thigh becomes completely fragmented.
And if the slender bone is crushed, the thigh becomes fragmented in the front part.
And if the larger bone is crushed, it causes a posterior displacement, which is one of those causes that you are not familiar with.
Then administer extension, reduction, and ligature of the bone fragments in the same manner as mentioned above.
However, if the thigh fracture is jagged with many splinters, the extension should be less and lighter, and ease it according to your skill.
And in the thigh there is some cause for an operation on the arm, and this occurs when you remove the bandages and complete the entire operation. Then you will take pieces of beech wood which are placed under the arches that are usually placed on the soles; these are made from palm branches. Choose those with small hardness, not from the hands, and let their length be according to the length of the thigh, and enter it up to the middle or below.
Then wrap each [piece of wood] in two layers of cloth according to its length, and place one on the edge of one side of the thigh and the other on the other side, and let them be from the middle to the bottom part of the foot.
And then tie the two bandages in three places: at both ends and in the middle, because with this structure the thigh is prevented from bending to either side, and it remains stable.
And a splint of wood has been administered according to the length of the thigh; and it is placed on it, the thigh, so that it retains its position.
And it is especially important that you do this in cases of fracture, and when there is a severe wound.
Certainly! Here's the line-by-line translation of your text:
"Chapter XVII.
"Of the fracture of the ankle and the bones of the foot and toes.
"In the ankle, not all fractures occur; but in the bones of the foot, fractures sometimes happen; and in the toes of the foot, fractures rarely occur, and they only suffer contusions on occasion.
"And if the bones of the foot seem to be fractured and sometimes those bones are raised above each other, then place the patient's foot on a flat surface prepared as though they were walking.
"Then place the other foot on top of the raised bones, step on them, press down and wedge them until they return to their proper places.
"Then place a bandage and stuffing on top, and underneath the sole of the foot, place a small board with two flat ends.
"Then secure it to the foot with a strong bandage wrapped around and with other means as needed.
"And after three or four days have passed, then you can remove the bandage, for you will find the bones wedged together, or they may be pinched or dislocated, and the procedure on them is as you know.
"But if some teeth are knocked out, then replace them and glue them back in the same way that I have shown you and recommended to you for the replacement of teeth in the hand. "Then place a splint on the fractured finger according to its length, and let it protrude a little beyond it; then lay the hand on this board that I have recommended to you, and tighten it with suitable force.
"But if that which is broken are two or three or more bones, then place on each finger a splint of its quantity wrapped in linen cloth, and strengthen the board at the lowest part of the foot, and let it stand on one end of the board through the belly of the foot so that it holds with good retention.
"And it is fitting for you to remember that you should not neglect any of the causes that have been mentioned to you in other accidents of the fractures that we have discussed; and prepare yourself for every accident with what is necessary.
"Chapter XVIII.
"On the fracture of the woman's pubic bone and the man's penis bone and scrotum.
"When the woman's pubic bone is broken, then cause her to sit in a warm bath, and then incline her slightly forward at the small of the back, and let it be supported from behind.
Here's the translation of the given sentence:
And then place cushions on their back, and when they want to urinate, carefully lift the edge [of the blanket or sheet] and quickly they will urinate. Then return [the patient] to their original position, and after that, you can return them to their first pillow.
And do this for seven days or around that time, because then he will be restored.
And if you wish, take the bladder of a sheep and strongly attach a reed cannula to its neck; then insert the entire bladder into his wound, and then blow air through the cannula with all your might until the bladder is inflated inside the wound, because the fracture will be healed.
And then it should be filled with cotton and left for some days as we have advised, until it is healed.
And when the bones of a man or woman are broken, then administer for their restoration and mending the remedy that we have recommended for the hip bone.
And that which is correct is not hidden in these nearby fractures and few happen, especially to one who has some learning and uses and understands this my book well; for that fracture indicates to you the main positions in the right way of restoration and tightening, so understand well.
Here's the translation of your sentence:
Chapter 19
On the restoration of broken bones when there is an injury.
It is convenient for one to whom a fracture with injury occurs, and especially if the bone is large such as the thighbone or shinbone, or similar to that, that you cauterize and phlebotomize it immediately if the conditions of phlebotomy are favorable for you or testify so, as we have said above.
And if the wound flows blood, then it is necessary that you cauterize it in order to stop the bleeding; and you should powder over it dry celery seed, unless there is another cause present.
Then begin restoring the fracture on the same day, and do not delay it, except if there is an abscess.
But if an abscess occurs, then leave the restoration until the ninth day, until the abscess has subsided; and do not approach it in the third day and the fourth, because you will cause bad accidents to occur.
But if the broken bone is prominent on the knee and exposed, then it is necessary that you pierce through to reduce it and make it level with your hands with ease and minimal extension.
Based on the provided context, here's a line-by-line translation of the given sentence:
And let there be a cloth, and let it have little thickness so that it is not folded; you must place the compress over it during the operation.
And let there be a sharp point with edges at its ends; and let it be placed above the patient, tending towards thickness, and half of it inside the divided parts.
And this is what it looks like:
And in Greek, it is called "labre volentz atelarem," which means "little spatula.
So that the sharp end should be placed raised over the protruding bone's tip.
And press it down with one swift motion until the bone returns to its original position and is covered by some kind of bandage.
And thus strive to cover the ends of the fracture between them. If the broken end is thin and does not accept the instrument well, then it is necessary for you to insert the end of that bone until the instrument has sufficient power over it.
But if you cannot reduce the bone completely with what we have mentioned, then cut it with one of the cutting instruments which we have spoken about; or saw it with one of the saws in whatever way is possible for you.
And then scrape off any remaining sharp edges or small splinters from the bone.
And when the bone is reduced, and if then the patient experiences a very strong toothache-like pain, know that the bone has not returned to its natural place; and in this case, do what you can to provide the patient with great relief.
When you have completed the bone's restoration, then submerge a cloth in black stiptic wine (especially if it is summer), and do not place wax or any other substance containing oil on the wound, so that putrefaction and corruption may not occur.
And then administer steel shavings at the time of your completion of the bone's restoration, and leave the wound uncovered so that pus may exit through incisions made with forceps, using dressings according to the size of the wound.
And be very careful not to strain the wound with the fracture, for many foolish doctors have done this and caused death or severe illness in their patients, which is a shame. And if there is slight swelling, soften it, different from the swelling of other fractures.
Here's a line-by-line translation of the given text:
And when the wound has started to heal for a day or two, and it is clear that a crust has formed on the patient, then remove the cloth you had placed over them with honey, and administer some cupping glasses, with ointments such as our customary medicines for treating wounds, such as tetrapharmacum and similar ointments.
And ensure that you loosen the bandage and examine the wound each day, morning and evening, until it is healed and closed, and it is important that the limb be prepared in such a way that the infection spreads to other parts with ease.
If many days have passed and the wound is not healed nor does a crust form on it, then know that here there are signs of small pustules, for which reason you must explore the wound with a probe. And of those signs, the ones that are separated and removed are good, but those that are not separated and putrefy the limb and cause pain, it is necessary for you to cut them open as much as possible in your opinion.
And if pus or yellow liquid comes out of the wound, indicating that it is suppurating or suffering from another type of corruption and putrefaction, then it is necessary to apply one of those [remedies] which are suitable for it, as is described in the previous chapter on its treatment.
Based on the provided context and the patterns observed in the original text, here is an attempt to translate the given sentence line by line:
I apologize for any confusion earlier. To provide an accurate translation, it would be helpful if you could clarify what specific text or passage from a medieval medical treatise you are referring to. This will allow me to give a more precise translation based on the content and context of the original document. If you have additional sentences from the same source, feel free to share them so I can assist you better.
The treatment of swelling that occurs following a break or fracture.
Many times this swelling occurs in the wake of the healing of a break or fracture, and especially when it is near the joints, and it takes on the form of the member; and it greatly prevents the member from performing its natural function.
Therefore, consider if the swelling is recent and administer those medicines which have astringent properties such as aloe, honeysuckle, mira, seracallo, acrassia, and similar substances; so that you take some or all of them, and mix them with astringent wine, or egg white, or vinegar, and place it on the swelling in cloth, and bind it tightly over it with good binding.
And leave the bandage in place for several days without removing it; and then remove it and apply another one until the swelling is reduced; or strengthen it with a lead plate placed on top, because lead has the property of reducing all inflammations in the limbs.
Based on the pattern and vocabulary from the provided text, here's a line-by-line translation of the given sentence:
It looks like you've provided a chapter or section title, "Capitol .xxi." This likely translates to "Chapter XXI" or "Chapter 21," indicating the beginning of a new section in the medical treatise. There isn't much more to translate here directly into English since it is simply a heading. If you have the content of Chapter XXI, feel free to share, and I can help translate that!
Here's a line-by-line translation of the provided text:
When a bone fracture is restored, and the limb remains subtle and weak, this happens due to several reasons: one of which is an excess of loosening or tying of the bandages, not done as needed; or due to excessive tightness of the bandages until nourishment is prevented from reaching the limb; or due to unnecessary application of poultices; or due to movement at the wrong time; or due to a lack of blood in the patient's body and their weakness.
The treatment for this is to feed the patient and make their heart tender until the blood increases in them; administer baths; and bring joy and happiness to them.
Then place a plaster on the limb, so that the plaster draws the necessary nourishment, or continue to apply warm water poultices until the nourishment reaches and the limb returns to its natural shape.
Chapter 22.
Of the treatment of fractured bones when they are restored crookedly and the operation that is needed for this is prohibited.
When a limb that has already been restored is afflicted with a crookedness and prominence of the broken bone and joint, which causes an unsightly shape of the limb, nevertheless, the limb is not prohibited from its natural operation; then it is not necessary for you to accept the word of someone who thinks that limb is newly broken.
Here's the translation of the first sentence:
Based on the context and similarities to medieval medical texts, here's a line-by-line translation of the given sentence:
And sometimes it is resolved with persistent light friction that should be done with wet hands, and the member's movement should be administered in all directions at all hours.
But if the twist has already progressed and is severe, turning into a stone, and requires surgical intervention with an iron instrument, then it is necessary to cut above the bone and dissolve the bone's continuity, and cut away what excessively protrudes from that joint with subtle incisions, and administer relief in that area with caution and care.
Chapter 23
On Dislocation
Dislocation is the displacement of one of the joints from its proper place, preventing movement and altering the shape of the limb, which causes great pain and injury in the patient.
Therefore, when a dislocation occurs, it is necessary to immediately pierce and reduce it, and not delay the reduction, because if it is delayed, the place becomes swollen and hard with water, making the reduction of the dislocation difficult.
And for this reason, it should not be massaged or stretched during the swelling, because many times it brings on spasms and intense pain.
When this happens, it is necessary for you to approach the patient's phlebotomy, and then a cloth should be placed inside so that the abscess can rest; and then the limb should be wrapped with hot water and oil, and then it should be reduced gently.
And let every limb be treated with that water of which the memory will come to its place.
And I have already ordered the chapters on dislocation according to what was stated previously in the section on fractures, from the highest part of the body down to the lowest part.
Chapter 24
Of the treatment for the dislocation of the lower jaw.
Both jaws are dislocated, and the dislocation of both is done in one of two ways: either they are moved slightly from their places and become softened a little, or they are completely dislocated until they are softened at the joint, to the point that saliva runs from the patient's mouth and he cannot hold it, nor can he close his mouth, and his tongue is wrapped in his throat.
But when the dislocation is slight, it usually returns to its proper place by itself with a little help.
But if the dislocation is complete and total, then it is necessary that a gentle reduction be administered immediately, without any delay.
And the attendant should hold the patient's head, while the physician inserts their thumb of one hand into the dislocated jaw from inside the mouth, if the dislocation is on one side; or if the dislocation is on both sides, they should insert both thumbs together. The other fingers of the same hand should be placed outside, with which to equalize; and command the patient to cease moving their jaws and allow them to go back to their proper place; and the physician should equalize the jaw and guide it back into its original position.
And if the reduction is difficult, especially if both jaws are dislocated at the same time, then administer steam with hot water and oil until a gentle reduction of both is achieved, and do not delay the reduction of both any further, as we have said.
And then when they have returned and are equalized, and the patient's mouth is closed but not softened, then place over those powdered cloth with wax, made of beeswax and rose oil, and then tie it gently with soft bandages.
And let the patient sleep on their back, with their head between two pillows, so that it does not turn to either side; and do not force them to eat anything. When the pain has subsided and the jaws are loosened, then let them eat what they want.
And let this be administered gently, and do not labor over the opening of the mouth for eating and drinking and speaking, until the jaw is loosened and healed.
And if it is difficult to reduce the two jaws when they are dislocated and do not return to their places, then let there be given to him cold compresses, frequent baths, and the stomach of the patient should be quickly emptied, and quickly he should vomit pure bile.
And when you see this, then know that it is fatal; and most often the one to whom this happens dies within ten days.
Chapter 25.
Of the reduction of the dislocation of the clavicle and the end of the collarbone.
The clavicle is not dislocated from within the chest because of its connection with the feet; and sometimes it is dislocated to the outer side, and this is evident by touch.
And the recovery of the patient is that he lies on his back and extends his arms. Then immediately press the area with your palm strongly, for it will return.
Then place on that plaster and powder and strengthen it.
But the end of that which is the shoulder and continues with it, is not dislocated on any day; therefore it must be reduced and put back according to what we have said and according to how you are equipped.
Then place on that plaster powder, and stricture, and command the patient to adhere to tranquility and rest until he is healed.
And with this same treatment the end of the muscle is reduced when it is separated from its place.
Chapter XXVI.  (This indicates a new section or topic in the treatise)
Of the reduction of the dislocation of the muscle.
Know that the muscle is not dislocated except in three ways, one of which is that it may be dislocated from the little finger to the thumb.
And the second is that it may be dislocated from above the muscle, and this is done late; and it is not dislocated to the back parts through the shoulder; and it is not dislocated to the front parts through the nerves.
Based on the given text and the similarities with Latin, Italian, Spanish, and French, here's a line-by-line translation of the provided sentence:
And when a strong blow or fall occurs to some men, and their muscle is swollen with acute inflammation, it is believed that the joint may be dislocated.
Therefore, you must first ensure that you are in control of the situation, and then proceed with his treatment.
And the dislocation is known when at the joints you find it tender; by which you can distinguish between the dislocated muscle and the sound muscle, for you will find a clear difference between them; and you will find in the head of the muscle a concavity, and when you touch the head of the muscle, it feels like an egg, and the patient cannot bring his hand to his ear, nor move it at all.
If it is dislocated, you must place your foot or knee on the area, and then you will find clear sensation, which is not hidden.
And from this dislocation, a slight reduction can be made when it is fresh and the patient is a child.
The reduction of it is that the attendant lifts his hand to the joints above; and then places his fingers below the tender area, and raises the joint with strength to its place, and the attendant lifts his hand, and extends it outward; and then places it below because it returns slightly.
If the remedy we've mentioned does not work and it is from the beginning that the dislocation occurred, then for many days the patient should be bathed in hot water and administered an embrocation that softens and soothes, such as a poultice made of althea, fenugreek, and melilot in water, and this should be administered.
Then the patient should be laid on their back and placed under a cushion of wool that is well-balanced between softness and firmness. The physician should place his heel on the cushion, raise the patient's head with all their strength, pull the patient's hand to prevent it from moving to one side or the other, and another assistant should hold the patient's head so that it does not move to one side or the other, for this will soon return to its place.
And if you wish, you can proceed in this manner: it is that you have present a man who is taller than the patient and stands on the side of the affected limb. He should insert his muscle under the patient's cushion and raise the patient's thigh until the patient is suspended in the air, and another assistant pulls the patient's hand away from the affected side of their belly. If the patient is light, then it is necessary that with them another cause be suspended, in order to make that [cause] heavier, because the dislocation returns immediately.
Based on the provided text and the pattern you've established, here's my line-by-line translation:
And if it is difficult to reduce (the intestine or hernia) due to all the causes mentioned above, then use this treatment. It involves taking a stick whose length is two spans and whose width is four fingers, with its thickness tapered towards one end according to this form.
Then over the rounded top of the stick, bind cloth strips so that the stick does not injure the patient.
Then place (the stick) under the patient's thigh, and extend your hand or arm over the stick within the partitions below, and bind the stick to the assistants, the arms, and the end of the hand.
Then place the arm on a step of the ladder according to its width, and extend your hand into the partitions below, and let the other side be suspended from the other side, because the joint will soon enter.
And when its entry is completed in any way possible for you, then it is necessary to place a wool pad under the patient's thigh of equal size; and then apply a poultice prepared from powdered oak bark with vinegar and egg white over all the muscle, so that it covers (the area), and then bind the thigh with a bandage below the thigh with proper tightness. The bandage should be wrapped around the poultice, and the patient's hand should be attached to their neck, and it should be left alone, and the patient's hand should not be moved for seven days.
And it is necessary that the food of the patient be given in small amounts until the member [limb] is comforted, because it is easier for their healing.
And thus the food should be given more frequently, about seven or five times, and exercise should be performed; and if it is immobile and not softened, then it is healed.
But if the joint is dislocated many times due to humidity that happens to him or for any other reason, then it is necessary that a cautery with three punctures be administered to it, as was said before in the chapter on cautery.
And if all this is done and after seven days the bandage and the joint are not set, and the plaster and constriction are reduced over it several times, and it is not set and the cat is unable to raise that arm above its parts, then know that his nerves, which are at the head of the muscle, have already been cut or extended or softened, and know that the joint will never be placed in its proper place.
For the dislocation that occurs in the feet and the ankles or the backs of the legs, the reduction is done with traction and extension by hand until it returns [to its proper place].
And let the other stricture be administered in that [area], and care for it until it is healed.
And if there is heaviness or slowness in the limb's recovery and movement, then let the patient use warm baths until that heaviness is relieved and they return to their original state.
Chapter 27.
On the care of shoulder dislocation.
Know that the shoulder joint is dislocated with difficulty and likewise returns with difficulty; it can be dislocated in any direction, but most commonly towards the front or towards the back. The dislocation of this joint is not hidden from you because it either falls out of place or changes position depending on how it was dislocated. And when you set the dislocated shoulder with a pole, it becomes clear to you, for the joint is concave and cannot bend the arm or touch its own muscle.
And it is necessary for you to cut [the skin], and reduce the dislocation immediately before the swelling comes on, because if the swelling has already come on, it will be difficult to reduce, and he will not heal completely; especially when [the dislocation] is towards the back, because it is the worst of all types of dislocations, with great pain, and many have died from this.
And the restoration of him, when it is that which is possible to reduce, is that his hand be extended with two hands, and his arm be spread out, and the hands of the doctor be on the elbow below him, and he pushes the joint with the thumbs of his hands together, or with the edge of his palm until it returns to its place.
But if the dislocation is at the front, then return it so that you bend his hand with your hand until you strike the elbow with the edge of your palm.
And if the dislocation does not obey reduction, then administer a very strong extension and great force.
And it is that two assistants extend the arm, and maintain that same position of the two assistants so that it is not moved away during the extension.
And then the arm should be turned towards every side, since it is wrapped in a long-folded cloth over his hand, or bandage.
And when the physician touches the joint with his hand, anoint that with some oil so that this helps in the lubrication of the joint and facilitates it; and then he pushes the joint strongly until it returns.
Based on the pattern and context from the provided lines, here's a possible translation of the given sentence:
And then it should be released; therefore, if the joint is formed in its place, then you release the ligaments of it and let them go.
And if you see that the joint is not strengthened, then you should reapply the plaster and the ligament, and let it be for some days until it is strengthened; and then release it.
But if there is a grave accident near the reduction of the joint, and the patient's condition is in movement, then apply moistening with a bath and subtle friction, and pressure until it is relieved; or place on the joint Aleliati, which is a heavy substance; and then bind it, and let it remain on the bones day and night. And then remove that, and put that in a bath; and when he comes out, then you should rub the joint with temperate friction, and then reapply on that Aleliati, which is round for motion, three times, the first time, and the second time, and the third time. in the manner of bathing, until it is finished.
And if you wish, place on that wet and scraped cowhide with border and strengthen over it; and do this several times, because that is wet and returns to its condition.
Based on the context provided, "Capitol .xxviii." likely means "Chapter 28" in English. Here's a breakdown:
About the treatment of dislocation of the shoulder, it is about the joint between the arm and the hand.
The shoulder of the hand is sometimes dislocated, and its reduction is easy, unlike other joints. However, speed is necessary in reducing it at the time of dislocation, before the place becomes swollen or a swelling occurs there.
The reduction of the dislocation is as follows: place the patient's hand joint on a table and have them extend their hand, then the doctor places his hand or palm on top of the joint and pushes it until it returns to its original position.
However, it is important to consider if the palm is already displaced towards the back of the hand. In this case, have the patient place the back of their hand on a table above the extension and reduction; and if the dislocation is behind the back of the hand, then the position of the patient's hand should be intrinsically on the table, so that the doctor's hand falls on top of the joint.
And thus, if it returns immediately, it is good; and if not, then strengthen it with a compress to reduce the swelling and leave it; and do not repeat this, for otherwise, you will not tolerate nor be able to endure the reduction of it more than three days.
Based on the provided text and my understanding of medieval medical language, here's a line-by-line translation:
Certainly! Let's translate the given sentence line by line:
If the patient's movement is hindered and some serious condition befalls him, then soothe it with hot water and friction several times until he is relieved.
Chapter 29.
Of the treatment of the aforementioned dislocations.
Sometimes these are dislocated at all parts.
And when one of these fingers is dislocated at the back of the palm or the fingertip, then straighten the finger and press the dislocation with your thumbs until it returns to its proper position.
And then support the end of the finger, and suspend that which is dislocated from its part for two days.
Then suspend it again and extend it until it is straightened in its own time that day.
And at night when it is dark, bind that according to the previous method, and do not stop unbinding it during the day and exercising with movement, and bind it at night; and do this for several days until it becomes straight.
And do the same with water if it is dislocated at the fingertip of the hand, and bind it to that part and do with water as in the first operation, until it is healed.
And similarly, do this with water when it is dislocated in other parts of the body.
Chapter XXX
On the treatment of spinal dislocation in the back.
When a complete dislocation occurs in any of the vertebrae of the back or neck, and many vertebrae are moved from their places, then there is no cure for it, because death comes to the patient.
And the sign of this is that the patient's excretion goes out involuntarily and cannot be retained; and often some members of his are paralyzed, or both legs, or both arms, or one of those; or a vertebra has been moved from its place, because often it is moved and often the removal of these to four parts (of the body) is done.
Therefore, when it is moved to the posterior parts, it is called paralysis.
But the cure for it is that then you must consider whether the paralysis occurs in childhood, because then there is no cure nor healing from it at all.
But in those cases that come from a fall or a blow or something similar to these, the ancients have spoken of the methods of cure at great length, of which the most effective is mentioned; but I have abbreviated this, so that little is missing from it, due to my proximity to my own meaning, with which I have expounded and formed this from various instruments, by means of which I will show and explain this.
And none of those can be cured except that which occurs on the back, as I will explain to you.
And the patient should be extended on his face, near a wall, and below him there should be a wet board to prevent his feet from slipping.
And a straight stick should be placed, stuck in the ground at the end of the foot near his head, and another stick on the other side of his feet at the other end of the foot.
And one attendant should hold the stick and not be fixed in a hole; and another attendant should hold the other similarly.
Then wrap around the head of the patient and below his chin tie a strong cord; extend the end of the cord to the stick that is in front of his head, and tie it there; then tighten another cord around his ankles at their backs, between his legs, and adjust all the cords and tie them to the other stick which is behind his feet.
And then the assistant extends each bandage to the base of the post, and the two posts and their bands are not moved from their places where they are fixed, but rather they are secured as we have said.
And the doctor places his palms on the spine with strength until he recovers, or he may place them on a table, and then he should adjust his feet on the table until he recovers.
But if he does not recover with this method, then take a table whose width or length is approximately three arms in measure, and dig into the wall near where the patient lies a hole into which the end of the table can fit. Then place the middle of the table on the spine, and the doctor places his feet on the other end, and he pulls strongly until the spine is straightened and returns to its place.
And if you wish, turn the patient on his side with his hand; and you should place beneath his head at the end of two posts, the length of which is one arm, and you should place his head at the end of two more posts; and let the distance between each post be a palm, and in each post make a hole through which the rope can pass, and let each be firmly fixed to the ground so that it cannot be moved.
And place a cylindrical stick in which there is a wheel, and it should be turned in the two holes of the two sticks.
And at the end of it is a hole in which the stick is formed, the length of which is one hand's breadth with which it is turned; and in the two other sticks there is something similar to that.
Then strengthen the bindings that you have tightened around the feet of the patient in the hole where his head should go, and the bindings that you have tied around his thighs on the wheel where his feet should go.
Then there should be a servant by each wheel to turn the wheel with his hand, and the physician should adjust the spine as we have said.
And after the spine has been returned and the place has been adjusted, then it is necessary to place a drying poultice with egg white and then wool; and then place over the poultice a board whose width is three fingers or thereabouts, and its length should be such that it covers the place of the swelling, and it should be placed on the parted spine.
And then it should be bound with the binding that we mentioned, and the patient should use refined food until they are healed.
And if any swelling remains in the area at the end of the healing process, then it is necessary to administer medicines that soften and cleanse with the administration of the table for a long time, which we recommend; and already in that place, a lead plate has been administered.
And sometimes swelling occurs at the end of the spine, and it is believed to be caused by this displacement; and it is that bone which has already swollen, so you should not approach it with this medicine, because it will cause your death very quickly.
Chapter 31.
Of the treatment for a dislocated hip.
Know that the joint of the hip and the joint of the muscle should only be treated for dislocation, and this does not happen to other joints with slight displacement and concavity.
And the hip joint can be dislocated in four ways: either towards the inside parts, or towards the outside parts, or towards the front parts, or towards the back parts.
And it is most commonly dislocated towards the inside parts, and rarely towards the front or the back parts.
The sign of its dislocation towards the inside is that, when you straighten the patient's healthy leg together with the sick one, the sick leg is longer and its knee is more prominent than the healthy one; the patient cannot bend their sick leg behind the other, and the place where it should bend is swollen with hard swelling, because the head of the thigh bone has already arrived here.
The signal of that person in whom dislocation occurs is in the parts outside, which is that their accidents are contrary to this accident.
The sign of that person in whom dislocation occurs in the front parts is that their leg is extended according to its natural position, but cannot bend without pain in the knee joint; and if they try to walk and cannot do so, this is a sign in the front parts; and their urine is retained, and their groin is swollen, and you should make them walk on their heel.
The sign of that person in whom dislocation occurs in the back parts is that they cannot extend the knee or bend it as much as the other one, and their leg is shorter than the other, and their groin is softened, and you should place the hip in that location.
However, the reduction of this type of dislocation is such that you should consider whether the dislocation is old and long-standing, which has already been established with him, then you should administer reduction to him and he will remain according to his constitution; in which case it is not entirely cured; and therefore, there is no need for any treatment.
Here's the translation for the given sentence:
Here's my best guess at translating this line:
"And if it is an extension of him or of the part inside the elbow to the part of the collarbone, or from the part behind to the part of the back.
"And if it is the extension of all these at once until the patient is lifted from the ground with his body and remains hanging.
And this type of extension is common to all four (limbs).
"And therefore if the dislocation returns with what we said, it will be good; and if not, then every kind of thing that is said about its own cure is necessary.
"In the reduction of itself, when it is dislocated, and the dislocation is in the inner parts, it is necessary that the patient be placed supine on their back; and then place the straps on the surface of the thigh in the area between the head of the thigh and the location below the elbow; and then extend the strap above the part of the elbow to the highest part of the collarbone.
"And then another strong assistant should take the patient's arms and firmly grasp the thickest part of the injured thigh, and extend it to the outer parts with great force, for that returns it to its proper place.
And this particular treatment is a lighter cure with which this member can be reduced compared to other treatments.
But if you do not follow this procedure and do not obey the entry with this type of cure completely, then it is necessary to bind both feet of the patient together strongly but lightly on both ankles and both heels.
And let the length of each be according to the quantity of four fingers, and let the leg of the patient be extended more than the other by the quantity of two fingers.
And then the patient should be suspended by the head from the top of the pole, and should be in a sitting position; and the distance from the ground to the patient's head should be two spans.
And then command a strong youth to decrease the height of the cushion, and let another youth be suspended with the patient, and the other youth should strongly push the cushion upward, because the joint returns to its place quickly.
But in the proper reduction, when it is a dislocation that has gone outward, the patient should be placed on his knees as we have recounted in having him kneel; and the bandage should be strengthened over the affected leg specifically and over his feet.
And then two sticks should be placed, one under the patient's feet and the other under their head; and then fitted sticks should be placed in the middle of the bed covered with damp cloths so that the patient is not harmed by the stick being between their thighs, because you need to extend the limbs below so that they are not pulled.
And then each attendant should stretch their respective part, and the doctor with his hand should guide the reduction according to the art.
And when the dislocation is in the front parts, then the leg should be slightly extended and placed on the bed; and the doctor should place the palm of his right hand on the patient's elbow, and then press down with the other hand, and with that pressure extend the leg below to the back.
And if the dislocation is in the back parts, then it is not necessary for the patient to be extended below, and he should be raised off the ground; it is also necessary that he be placed on a hard surface, just as we have said about the elevation if his shoulder is dislocated outwards, as we have said about placing him on two shoulders; and it is on his face with his limbs extended as we have said.
And it is necessary that a compression with a board be applied to the location where there is the joint.
Therefore, when the reduction is complete as needed — and the sign of the reduction of him is not hidden from you, and it is that you extend the patient's two thighs, and when you see those lips and the patient extends his leg and expands it without excuse, then you know that the member has returned as needed — at this point, you place two cushions and put a poultice on them and pull with a bandage so that the swelling is not increased in any of the parts; and keep the patient at rest for three days or four.
Then remove the bandage and the poultice, and compare one thigh with the other.
At this point, if you see those lips in their proper place, then you know that the dislocation is already fixed, and therefore let the patient go.
And if you see any sign of swelling, then return and apply a poultice to it, and extend it according to your first structure, and leave it for three days.
Then remove that, and have the patient delay walking on each [leg] for some days, until he is comfortable.
Capítulo 32
Sobre el tratamiento de la luxación del hombro.
El hombro se puede luxar de tres maneras: hacia adelante, hacia atrás y más hacia un lado que hacia el otro; pero no se luxa hacia adelante.
El signo de la luxación del hombro es que le ordene al paciente que coloque su brazo sobre su pierna; entonces sabrás que el hombro está luxado.
La restauración de todas las formas de luxación es la siguiente: coloque al paciente en posición vertical para que extienda su brazo si puede; luego, presione con sus dedos contra la cara del paciente y coloque el pie del paciente entre sus pies. Luego, presione el hombro del paciente con las palmas de sus manos y mantenga estas en los lados del hombro del paciente con fuerza; otro asistente extiende su pie hasta que el hombro vuelva a su lugar.
El signo de reducción del hombro es que el brazo adhiera a la pierna con una levitación sin esfuerzo.
Luego, vendarlo y hacer que el brazo adhiera a la pierna, luego atarlo juntos con un vendaje durante tres o cuatro días, y luego destaparlos.
And do not let the patient walk for several days until they are healed and strengthened.
But if the reduction of them to you is successful, then administer a strong extension with bandages as previously described in the treatment of the hip.
Chapter .xxxiii
Of the treatment for talus dislocation.
The talus is sometimes displaced by slight movement, and sometimes it is dislocated according to the location, and its dislocation occurs either inside or outside of the joint.
And the sign of its dislocation is that you see the talus protruding towards the location where it is dislocated.
But the treatment for its slight displacement is easy reduction, and it should be extended gently with the hands until it returns to its proper position.
But in the treatment for when it is dislocated according to location, you must make the patient lie flat on their back, and let that person have a strong and capable minister behind them, in the middle of their back.
And then you take with your right hand the upper part of the foot, and with your left hand the lower part of the foot at the ankle. ‌
And then pull the foot towards you with your right hand, and then two times with the left hand, and then extend with the left hand; and press the sole of the foot with the right hand behind the leg without working.
And do this twice as we have said.
And then press the sole of the foot to the leg the third time, and you are at the ankle.
Therefore, if it returns in one or two times according to this manner, and if you see the foot swollen, it is good; and if not, then on him repeat the operation, because that returns.
But if you are not able to reduce it with what we have recommended, then make the patient lie on their back on the ground, and tie a strong rope to the ground, and place it between his thighs, and you have already wrapped cloth around him so that the patient does not escape.
And then the assistant should hold his thighs, and another assistant should extend the foot with their hands or a bandage that lies on the neck of the foot; and then each assistant should stretch against the stretching of their partner, and the rope should be stretched between the patient's thighs holding him, so that his body is not pulled towards the sides beyond its extension.
And immediately the physician should reduce the dislocation with his hands, and another assistant should hold the healthy joint at the sides, because the dislocation returns easily.
And when the dislocation has returned and it is clear to you that the reduction was successful, then apply a plaster and secure it firmly with strong bandages, and bind the foot to the thigh with a bandage.
And you should be careful or guard against the nerves that are behind the ankle, so that the bandage on it is not too tight and does not press on them strongly.
And then leave it alone for two or three days; and if the bandage becomes softened, remove it.
And then unbind it on the third day or the fourth, and forbid the patient from walking for forty days. But if he is forced to walk during that time, it is not certain that the dislocation will not be dissolved and corrupted again, and then it will not receive cure.
And if an abscess forms as a result, then you should administer to the patient that which was previously mentioned in our narrative, concerning other treatments and applications, until it is removed.
Chapter XXXIV.
About the treatment of dislocation of the toes.
Note that the one who is dislocated should be wrapped with little tension without difficulty; and this is easier than difficult.
But if the dislocation is in some toes of the foot, then you should have the patient sit on a low place on the ground or on a table, and be standing as if walking.
Then you should stand on the toes, and place your foot over what you see of the joints, then step on it with your foot with all your strength until it returns to its original position, and you will see that it is wrapped and does not appear raised.
Then place under the sole of his foot a board that takes up the whole foot, which has two ends, and then strengthen it with a decent and firm bandage for three days; and then release it and make him rest from walking for many days, until it is healed and healing is assured.
Chapter XXXV.
About the types of dislocation that are made with a wound, or with a fracture, or with both together.
When any of these things happen, and you undertake the treatment and restoration of it, many times death results.
Here is the translation of the given text: And then immediately proceed to perform the reduction at the beginning of the cause, before it becomes a suppurating abscess.
And then if the member returns as desired, administer a remedy that will prevent it from becoming a suppurating abscess and treat the wound with water suitable for drying ointments.
And if the dislocation is accompanied by a fracture and the broken bones are separated, then you should perforate their ends and do as we have said in the case of simple injuries of this kind, in the places of those bones.
And beware and avoid according to your ability that which leads to sinful paths, as I have previously advised you; for this is better for you and more lasting for your glory, and more healthful for your true body in your time. Thus end the words of Albucasis, which may God bless. Amen.
