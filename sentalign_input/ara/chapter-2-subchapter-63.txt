On the Incision of a Fleshy Vein and its Treatment.
Know that incising this vein is one of the errors leading to death in most cases, therefore, we recommend leaving it alone for safety.  However, I will describe the procedure on it and the types of swelling.
I say that many swellings occur in the testicles, and this is due to many causes, either from a sharp humor flowing to the testicles or from a blow.  The color of the swelling is the same as the body's color and there is no fluid in it.
The swelling is hard, and sometimes the swelling is petrified, its color is dark, and it has no feeling.  It may be from a thickening and swelling of the arteries, as previously mentioned, or from swelling of the veins.  As for what comes from swelling of the arteries, this is known by the dissipation of the swelling.
When you press it with your fingers, it should not change at all. As for what results from swelling of the veins, nothing dissipates from it when pressing with the fingers.  This type can be incised, as well as other fleshy (swellings).
That is, you incise the skin of the testicle, then pull the testicle upwards and take it out of the white membrane, and free the spermatic cord from the vessels, tie the vessels, and cut the spermatic cord after you free it from every side of the testicle.  If the testicle has adhered to the proliferating tissue.
It is necessary to remove the testicle and cut it off.  And if the adhesion is between some of the membranes or between the vessels, it is necessary to free all of that adhesion and cut it with a circular cut.
If the fleshy growth is in the place of adhesion, which is from behind, it is necessary to cut all of it and remove the testicle, as we have said. When you have finished your work, pack the wound with wool soaked in rose oil and syrup, then treat it with the rest of the treatment until it heals.
