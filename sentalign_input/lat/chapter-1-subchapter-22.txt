Chapter 24.
When strophulae arise from phlegm and cold humors, and are not responsive to treatment with medicines, and you want their digestion to be quickened, then heat a concave cautery iron, in this shape.
Having two open ends so that smoke may escape from one end of the cautery iron, and place it, heated, upon the abscess once, and a second time, if needed, until it reaches the depth of the abscess.
If the abscess is small, then place the cautery iron according to the size of the abscess.
Then leave it for three days, and apply over it cotton soaked in butter, until what the fire has burned is removed.
Then treat it with dental ointment until it heals, forming a tube.
