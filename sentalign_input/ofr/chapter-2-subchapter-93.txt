of the pain that comes from flatulence
This disease is called in our land "wandering pain", and it is a pain that comes in some limbs, and then moves from limb to limb; and I saw what I tell you.
I was called to a sick woman, and she uncovered her arm, and I saw a small swelling in the vein of the arm; and a little after, I saw it rise like a worm to the shoulder, faster than anything, like quicksilver when it runs from one place to another; the pain left that place, and settled in the shoulder, and then a little later ran throughout the body, until it came to the other arm; then she told me that it always turned around the body, as I saw it.
I was very surprised how it moved thus from limb to limb, for I had never seen this disease in this manner.
However, I had often seen that pain could move from place to place, but I had not seen it like I saw it in the woman; and I thought that it was because the woman had a dry body, and the veins prominent, and because of this, this constrained flatulence appeared; and it does not appear in this way in those who are overweight and who have moist bodies and hidden veins.
And when you want to treat this disease, and the patient feels this pain, if it appears to you as we have said, then tie it above and below quickly, and then cut on it until this constrained flatulence comes out of the place; and cauterize the place; and if you do not see it with your eyes, then treat it with that which expels flatulence, such as fetid pills, and pills of sagapenum, and other similar things.
