This chapter is often necessary in the art of medicine, and is about the restoration of fractures and dislocations.	This third part of the book, too, is an essential necessity in the practice of medicine; it concerns the setting of the fracture or dislocation occurring in bones.	0.6405003
Know, dear son, that foolish doctors avoid this chapter, for they have never seen any of the ancient books nor read any text on this subject;	You should know, my sons, that ignorant practitioners and laymen and those who have never turned the pages of a single book of the Ancients about it, nor studied a single letter of it, arrogate this part of the art to themselves.	0.7065122
and for this reason, science is rare in our land, for I have never found anyone good in this field;	For this reason this section of the science has died out in our parts; I have myself found no one competent in it; and whatever skill I have, I have derived for myself by my long reading of the books of the Ancients and my thirst to understand them until I extracted the knowledge of it from them.	0.5780574
and I know nothing of it except through the science of ancient books, in which I have studied so much that I have drawn science from them, through experimentation, and by the practice of my life;	Then through the whole of my life I have adhered to experience and practice. So now I have described for you in this book all that my knowledge has encompassed on the subject and that my experience has encountered; I have made it accessible for you and rescued it from the abyss of prolixity; I have reduced it to a brief outline; and have explained it most clearly.	0.5925802
and I have already described to you in this chapter what is contained, and have summarized it at the end, and have clearly shown the forms of the instruments used, just as I have done in these two previous chapters.	I have made for you many drawings of the instruments that are used in it, which is an adjunct to explanation, as I did in the two previous books.	0.68795323
