Chapter twenty-eight on cutting excess flesh in the gums.
Often, excess flesh grows on the gums, which the ancients call epulis (a type of gingival swelling).
It is necessary to hook it with a fishing hook or grasp it with forceps and cut it at its base.
And you leave the wound to bleed (lit. and you leave the pus/matter or the blood to flow).
Then you apply powdered vitriol (hydrated ferrous sulfate) or one of the dried astringent peak substances to the area.
If that flesh returns after the treatment, it often does return.
So cut it again and cauterize it, for it will not return after cauterization.
