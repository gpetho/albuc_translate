On Cauterizing the Corrosive Ulcer.	On cauterization of gangrene.	0.6388871
The corrosive ulcer is a corruption that spreads in the limb, consuming it as fire consumes dry wood. If you see the corrosive ulcer in a place that can tolerate cauterization by fire, heat many nail-shaped cauteries, small and large, according to what is appropriate for the place where the corrosive ulcer is.	Gangrene is a creeping corruption of a limb, consuming it as fire consumes dry wood. If you see gangrene in a part which can tolerate the actual cautery, heat a number of claviform cauteries, small or large to suit the site of the gangrene.	0.797352
Then cauterize it from every side until all of the corruption is eradicated and nothing of it remains at all. Then leave it for three days and apply powdered sulfur with oil to the cauterized areas until all the eschar and all the corruption are removed.	Then cauterize it all over till the whole corruption is eradicated and none remains. Then let be for three days, applying to the cauterized site sulphur beaten up with oil, until the whole eschar comes away, and all the corruption.	0.92582977
Then treat it with ointments that promote flesh growth. If you see after three days that the flesh is growing healthily without corruption, then [stop]. Otherwise, repeat the cauterization on the remaining corrupt areas.  The corrosive ulcer can also be treated with a potent medication.	Then treat with stimulating ointments. If after three days you see the flesh growing healthily and no corruption in it, good. Otherwise repeat the cauterization over whatever corrupt parts are left.	0.82135427
It takes the place of fire, being faster-acting. I have mentioned its treatment with potent medication in the division, so take it from there when you need it.	Gangrene is also sometimes cured with caustic, for that takes the place of fire; but the actual cautery acts more speedily. I have already spoken of the treatment of it by caustic in its section, so take it from there when you have need of it.	0.7014566
