Having completed for you, my children, this book, which is the last of the medical sciences with its completion, and having reached its end in its expositions and its declarations, it seemed to me to complete it for you with this treatise, which is a part of the practice, that is, of surgery, with the hand.
Since manual practice has been neglected in our region and in our time, almost entirely: until perhaps its knowledge perished, and its trace was cut off; and there remained of it only small descriptions in the books of the ancients, which were altered by hands; and error and hesitation befell them, until its intent was closed, and its power was distanced.  It seemed to me that I might revive it with the order of this treatise, according to the manner of exposition, declaration, and abbreviation; and that I might come with the forms of cautery instruments and other instruments of the work: with the addition of declaration, and with the acceleration of what is necessary.
The reason, however, why a good practitioner is not found with his skill in our time, is: because the art of medicine is long, and its author must be trained beforehand in the science of anatomy, as described by Galen, so that he knows the aids of the limbs, and their shapes, and their connections and separations, and has knowledge of the bones, and nerves, and tendons, and their number, and their courses, and the pulsating and still veins, and the places from where they exit.
And because of that, Hippocrates said that a name with a name is much, and with a work is little, and especially in the art of the hand.
We have already spoken of that at the beginning of this book.
Since he who is not knowledgeable of what we have said about anatomy is not prevented from falling into error, by which men are killed; just as I have seen many of those who are trained in this science, and boast of it without knowledge and without experience.
That is, because I saw a foolish physician cut a scrofulous boil on a woman's neck, and cut some arteries in the neck: wherefore the woman's blood flowed until she fell dead in his hands.
And I saw another physician, who presumed to extract a stone from a man who had advanced in age, and the stone was large. So he reached it, and extracted it with a piece of the bladder. Therefore the man died on the third day.
And indeed I had already been called to extract it, and I saw from the size of the stone, and the disposition of the sick man, that he would die.
And I saw another physician who was receiving a stipend from a certain Duke of our land for medicine, and a black eunuch who was with him suffered a fracture in his leg near the heel. And the physician, in his ignorance, hurried and bound the fracture over the wound with pillows and splints with strong constriction, and did not allow the wound any release.
Then he discharged him according to his own desires. Afterwards, he dismissed him after a few days, and ordered him not to loosen the bandages.  And he remained like that until his leg and foot were filled with pus, and he came to destruction.
Therefore, I was called to him, and I hurried to loosen the bandages. And tranquility followed, and he escaped his pains.
However, the corruption had already become established in the limb, and I could not restrain it.
Therefore, the corruption ceased to spread in the limb until it perished.
And I saw another physician, who pierced the cancerous abscess.  And it ulcerated after days, until its malice increased greatly with its master.
That is, when cancer is pure from melancholy humor, then it is not necessary to reach it with iron at all, unless it be in a limb that can tolerate its being entirely cut off.
And because of that, my children, it is necessary for you to know that surgical operation is divided into two divisions: namely, an operation to which health is associated, and an operation with which there is danger in many dispositions.
And I have already aroused in every place of this book, in which operation comes, in which is terror and fear.
Therefore it is necessary for you to beware of that, and to diminish it, so that fools may not find a way to speak ill of and dishonor it.
Therefore, receive the measure with care and protection, and your sick with ease and firmness, and use the better way leading by God's grace to health and praiseworthy success; and leave the terrible sicknesses of difficult healing; and remove your souls from that which makes you fear, so that hesitation may enter upon your faith and your benefit.
For it is more remaining to your glory, and more lofty in this world, and finally to your quantities.
For Galen already said in some of his admonitions. Do not treat bad illness; lest you be called bad physicians.
Now, however, I have divided this Treatise into three Chapters.
First Chapter.
Concerning the cautery with fire, and the cautery with sharp medicine, discussed and ordered from head to foot, and concerning the forms of instruments, and the iron implements of the cautery: and everything that is necessary in the operation.
Second Chapter.
Concerning incision and perforation, bloodletting and cupping, and wounds: and the extraction of arrows, and similar things: and the entire discussion, ordered by the forms of instruments.
Third Chapter.
Concerning restoration, and dislocation, and the treatment of twisting, and similar things: discussed, ordered from head to foot, and concerning the forms of instruments.
But before I recount the operation with it, it is necessary that I speak of the quality of its benefits and harms, and in what complexion it should be applied.
I say therefore, that the discussion of the quality of the cautery's benefit and harm is a lengthy and subtle discussion, requiring knowledge and a hidden secret.
Many wise men have also spoken on it, and they disagreed on it; and for me, a little from their discussions suffices, fearing a prolongation.
I say therefore, that cautery benefits universally any complexion that is with matter, and without matter; except for the two complexions which are the hot complexion without matter and the dry complexion without matter.
However, in the hot and dry complexion with matter, they disagreed. For some said that cautery is beneficial in it. And others said the opposite, namely that cautery is not suitable in an illness that arises from heat and dryness, because the nature of fire is heat, and it is inappropriate that one is healed from a hot and dry illness with heat and dryness.
And he who says the opposite stated that through cautery benefit is achieved in every hot and dry illness that occurs in human bodies, because when you compare the human body and its humors to the complexion of fire, you find the human body to be cold.
And I indeed say through his words, because by experience it has repeatedly revealed that to me.
However, it should not be applied unless one is already proven and practiced in the final exercise of the cautery chapter, and has known the diversity of human complexions and the disposition of illnesses within themselves, and their causes, and their accidents, and their duration.
However, there is no fear from the remaining complexions, and especially in cold and moist illnesses. For all physicians have agreed upon them, and have not disagreed on their benefit with cautery in them.
And know, children, that the secret of curing by cautery with fire, and its goodness over cautery with burning medicine, is that fire is simple, whose action does not reach, except the limb which is cauterized: and it does not harm another limb joined with it, except with little harm.
However, the action of burning medicine reaches that which is distant from the limbs, and perhaps causes the limb to suffer from a difficult-to-heal illness, and perhaps kills it.
However, fire, because of its subtlety and the goodness of its substance, does not do that, unless it overflows.
Now, however, that has become known to us through experiment, due to the length of service and study with the art, and our standing on the truth of things; and because of that, I excuse myself from the length of speech.
And if it were not so, because it is not permitted to this book of mine, I would reveal to you the hidden secret in fire, and the quality of its operation on bodies from its expulsion, by which it expels illnesses, demonstrated in a philosophical and demonstrative manner, to be sharpened by your minds.
And know, children, that they disagree on the time when the cautery should be applied, and they posit a better time as the vernal season.
And I say that cautery is appropriate at all times, because the harm, being accidental, is submerged in the benefit attracted by the cautery. And especially if the cautery is for pains from necessary, strong, urgent pains, which do not tolerate slowness; because it is feared from these that a greater harm will occur than the slight harm entering due to time.
And do not let it enter your minds, O children, that which the common people and foolish physicians fear, namely that the illness cured by cautery does not always return; and they posit that as a consequence, and the matter is not as they suppose; for cautery is nothing but a substitute for medicine, which alters the complexion and dries out the humidities that are the cause why the pains occur.
However, cautery excels medicine in the swiftness of its effect, and the strength of its operation, and the intensity of its control; and it is possible that the illness may return at some time according to the patient's complexion, and the location of the illness, and its strength, and what is prepared in the body from the accumulation of superfluities in it, and what reaches it in its acquisition from foods, and similar causes, unless it is an illness to which cautery is administered.
A subtle illness in a limb with few superfluities and humidities, like the toothache, because of the pain, and similar to it, it is possible that that pain will not return to it. But that happens in few cases.
But truly the common people's talk, that cautery is the last resort of medicine, is correct speech; not in the way they intend it, because they believe that there is no cure to compare with medicine, nor anything after the cautery's application.
However, the matter is the opposite of that, and the intention that cautery is medicine's last resort is not, except that when we apply methods of treatment in some illnesses and those treatments do not succeed; then, at the end of the matter, we apply cautery, and it succeeds.  Then it follows that cautery is medicine's last resort, not according to the intention understood by the common people and many unskilled physicians.
The ancients said that cautery with gold is better than cautery with iron, and they did not say this except because of the equality of gold and the sublimity of its substance; and they said that the cautery site does not produce pus. But that is not absolutely so, because I have already tested it, and found that it does not do that in some bodies without others.
And cautery with it [gold] is good, and better than with iron, as they said. However, when you apply cautery with gold in fire, it is not clear to you when the heat reaches the desired intensity, because of the gold's redness; and when it rapidly cools, and if you add more heat to it, it melts in the fire and turns into thin sheets.
Therefore, the craftsman is deterred from using it [gold cautery]; and for that reason cautery with iron is faster and closer to us, by virtue of its suitability for the operation.
And I have indeed already arranged this chapter on cautery according to its chapters; and I have arranged them from head to foot, so that they will help the one seeking what he wants from it.
Chapter Two.
This cauterization is beneficial for controlling the excess of moisture and cold upon the brain; these two are the causes of headaches, and the excessive flow of humors from the head to the eyes and ears, and of excessive sleep, and toothache, and sore throat; and universally all sickness which arises from cold, such as paralysis, and headaches, epilepsy, and apoplexies, and similar illnesses.
The method of cauterization is that you should first instruct the sick person to be purged with a cleansing solution, cleaning the head for three or four nights, according to the strength of the sick person, and their age, and their habits.
Then instruct them to shave their head with a razor. Then make him sit between your hands squarely, so that he has already placed his hands upon his chest.
Then place the root of your palm upon the root of his nose between his eyes. Wherever therefore your middle finger reaches, mark that spot with the cautery.
Then apply the olive-shaped cautery to it: which has this shape.
Then place it upon the spot marked with the cautery, descending, so that your hand may gradually constrict it, and you shall turn it. Then lift your hand quickly, and look at the spot.
If you see now uncovered from the bone a quantity of alkiel, or a quantity of zeuherbi, then lift your hand. And if not, repeat the application of your hand with the iron itself, or with another from the same if it cools: until the bones which I have told you appear.
Then take some salt, and dissolve it in water, and soak the cloth in it, and place it over the spot: and leave it for three days.
Then place the soaked cloth in butter over it, and leave it over the spot until the scab of fire is destroyed. Then treat it with tetrapharmacon ointment, until it is healed.
They have said that the more a wound remains open, the more pus it emits: wherefore it is better and more helpful.
And some of them said that the skin should be cauterized down to the bone: and the cautery should be held until something the thickness of bone is burned.
Then that which is burned from the bone should be shaved off, then treated.
And others say that it is necessary to reach the utmost with the cautery, until it presses an impression in the bone, so that the bone falls, which is done like a kirate shape: or an instrument which women place on a small alphabetic infusion: and they suppose that vapors of the head are exhaled from this place, and the wound should be left open for a long time.
Then it should be treated until it is consolidated.
However, these two types of cautery do not seem to me to be suitable except in certain individuals, according to the way of fear.
And to leave it, in my opinion, is better with the health of the individual.
For the head is weakened by the disruption of its natural continuity, as we have testified in other limbs, and especially when the head of the infirm is naturally weak; and indeed the first type of cautery is more healthful and better in my opinion, and I use it; therefore operate with it for health.
Chapter III.
When chronic pain occurs in the entire head, and it is prolonged in the infirm person, and he/she uses leeches, and cupping, and head-cleansers, and oils, and plasters. And especially if it has already been cauterized with the single cautery, which we have described, and none of those things helps it, then consider. For if the head of the sick person is of strong natural constitution, and is not weak, and finds intense cold, then cauterize with another cautery slightly beneath the first. Then cauterize it above every horn of its head with a cautery, so that the skin is not pierced, and a quantity is uncovered from the bone, as we have described. And cauterize it with a single cautery on the back of its head, in the place called the vein: and it is the place where a cupping glass is placed: and raise your cautery here, and do not uncover the bone. For the sick person finds, because of that, a severe pain, and different from the pain of the other cauterizations of all the head.
And I shall say that this cautery is in its proper place: and it should be the cautery with which the horns of the head are cauterized, and the back of his head with a finer cautery, with which the middle of the head is cauterized.
Chapter IV.
When pain and throbbing occur in a part of the head, or the pain extends to the eye, and the head is cleansed with purifying medicines, and the rest of the treatment, which I described in the divisions of illnesses, is administered, and it does not benefit the whole condition: then cauterization is appropriate in it according to two methods: either cauterization with a burning, sharp medicine, or with iron.
The cautery with a burning, sharp medicine is as follows: take one clove of garlic, and peel it, and cut off its ends from both sides. Then, incise the painful area with a wide phlebotom knife, until a space is made under the skin where the clove can be placed.
Then introduce it into the space under the skin, until it is hidden; then bind over it with a bandage of suitable constriction, and leave it for fifteen hours. Then loosen it, and remove the garlic, and let the wound rest for two or three days. Afterwards, apply a poultice soaked in butter to it until the area produces pus. Then treat it with ointment until it heals.
And if you wish, do it with certain burning medicines, which I wrote in the twelfth treatise, on Burning Medicines.
The cauterization of it with iron, is according to this method. The cauterium of fire, whose form is this.
And it is called a Clavil, because the shape of its head is like the shape of a nail, in which there is some curvature, and in its middle there is a small prominence.
Then place it upon the area, and hold your hand; and you revolve the iron slowly with speed; and let the quantity that is burned be from the thickness of the skin, like half of it. And raise your hand, so that the artery, which is below, is not burned, and a flow of blood occurs.
Then soak the cloth in salt water, and place it over the area, and leave it for three days; then place the cloth with butter; afterwards treat with ointment until it heals.
And if you wish, cauterize this hemicrania with the second cautery's knife-like extremity. And beware of cutting the artery in this hemicrania, not properly ancient.
On the method of cauterizing in ancient hemicrania.
When treating hemicrania, along with what we have said from the preceding treatment, and what we have said in the divisions of diseases, and if treatment does not help: and if you see from the illness that what we have said from the first cautery with medicine, or with cautery with fire, is not sufficient, then it is necessary to heat the knife-like cautery until it turns white, after having marked the site of pain with a line, whose length is half a finger, or approximately that: and place your hand in turn, and press it until you cut the artery, and reach the bone.
However, it is necessary for you to beware of the continuation of the jaw, which moves during mastication, lest the side or the nerve that moves it be burned, whence spasm may result.
And be on guard, and careful of the flow of blood from the severed artery. For in its severing lies danger, and especially for him who does not know what he is doing, and is not studious nor experienced: and he abandons the operation with that in the first place.
And I will come with a reminder of the regimen for blood flow arising from an artery according to its manner and in the place of this book.
If you see from the illness that this cautery is not sufficient for him, and you see the body of the sick person tolerating a cautery in the middle of the head, as we have narrated, treat the wound until it heals.
And if you wish, administer the cautery, which we have said in the chapter on the extraction of the artery with a cautery having two knives. For cauterization is better than this and more beneficial.
Concerning the method of cauterization in earache.
When pain in the ear occurs from cold, and is treated with remedies, and with the remaining treatment that we have mentioned in the division, and the pain does not subside, then use fire with the cautery: and it is that which is called the Point, whose shape is this.
Then, after igniting it, apply the points in a circular motion around the entire ear, as it revolves, or in a circular motion around each ear, if the pain is in both at the same time. And move the cautery slightly away from the base of the ear, after you have marked the areas with the marking ink; and let the quantity of the cautery be ten points on each ear, and like that.
Then treat the areas until they are healed.
Concerning the method of cauterization in a twisting motion.
Chapter VII.
The twisting that is cured with cauterization is only from the types that occur from phlegm, according to what we said in the divisions of illnesses.
And avoid cauterization of the type that occurs from dryness and nerve spasm.
When you treat this type of twisting with leeches, and head-cleansings, and gargles, and your treatment does not help, then it is necessary to cauterize the afflicted with three cauteries: one at the root of the ear, and a second a little lower from its temporal location, and a third at the juncture of the two lips.
And place your cautery opposite the afflicted part. Because softening does not occur unless in the part that appears healthy.
And the form of cauterization is that you cauterize it with the cautery directly at the extremity of the upper ear, below the horn of the head a little; and another in the temporal region, whose length should be according to the length of a thumb. And hold your hand with the cautery until a quantity equal to half the thickness of the skin is burned.
And this is the form of the cautery, and it is a type of knife, whose form has been mentioned before; however, it is not less sharp by a little, as you see; and it is necessary for the knife to be somewhat free of superfluous thickness.
Then treat the places, with what has gone before, until they are healed.
Concerning the method of cauterization in old apoplexy.
When apoplexy becomes old, and you have treated it with what we said, and your treatment does not help, and the sick person does not have a fever, then cauterize him with four cauteries on each horn of his head, and with a cautery in the middle of the head, as we said, and with a cautery on the back of the head, according to what has gone before; and the method of the cautery shall be according to what has gone before.
Also, he is cauterized with a cautery on the mouth of the stomach; and this is more of a last resort.
Then, let him be treated with what has gone before.
Chapter IX.
It is necessary that in the drink, first be given to the sick large hyerae and pills that cleanse the brain.
Then shave the entire head of the sick person, and place on his occiput a plaster of mustard described in the treatise on plasters: and place it several times.
For that is the method of cautery, and do it according to the same order that I stated there.
If therefore he is cured by it, it is good. If not, then make three cauteries on the back part of his head, which shall descend from the upper part of the head down to the lower part of the eye: and place between each cautery the thickness of a finger.
Then treat the cautery, with what preceded it.
If however you wish an addition, and the sick person is unable to tolerate it, then make a cautery in the middle. If you wish an addition, then cauterize him above the two horns.
Then treat him until he is healed; and let the cautery be olive-shaped, according to the form that has been described.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in paralysis and softening.
Chapter X.
It is necessary to proceed in cleansing the head with hyeres, and with that which we have said.
Then shave the patient's head; afterwards cauterize it with a cautery in the middle of the head, and with a cautery on each horn of the head, and with a cautery on its posterior, and with three on the vertebrae of the neck.
If, however, in the sickness there is a need for the softening of the body by many cauteries, and the patient is unable to tolerate them, and the illness is severe, then cauterize him with four cauteries on the vertebrae of the back, and the last with a cautery until most of his skin is burnt, and lift your hand. Then treat him until he is healed; and thus the cautery is applied.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in Epilepsy.
An epileptic is not cauterized, unless that whose epilepsy is from phlegm.
Therefore, it is necessary that you first cleanse his brain with leeches, and with the rest of the treatment which we have mentioned in the division: when the sick person is strong, or is tolerant in accepting medicines.
However, if it is a child who does not tolerate medicines, then a gargle and chewing motions that cleanse the brain are administered, many days beforehand with an improvement in food.
Then shave his head, afterwards cauterize him with one cautery in the middle of the head, according to what preceded in the manner, and with another cautery on his occiput, and with a cautery on each horn of his head. If, however, the patient is strong and tolerant, then cauterize him with the cauteries that I have described in the case of paralysis, and for the softening of the body upon the vertebrae of the neck and vertebrae of the back: and let the cautery be olive-shaped according to the manner which has preceded.
If however the patient is a child, then apply a fine cautery, according to this method.
Concerning the method of cauterization in Melancholy.
When the cause of melancholy is corrupted humours and thick phlegm, then cauterize him with the cauteries that we have mentioned in the case of paralysis.
And if the cause of melancholy is a superfluity sloping towards melancholy, and the patient's body is moist, then give him a drink that will purify his brain, according to what was said previously in the division. Then shave the patient's head, and afterwards make a well-made linen roll, like a circle.
Then place it in the middle of the head, and let the patient sit upright, held fast on all sides.
Then apply the liniment. And it is better made from old sheep's butter. And heat it over a fire with a moderate heat, which a finger can tolerate when placed within it. Then apply it to the middle of his head in a circular motion, and leave it until it cools.
Do this to the sick person once a week, with the rest of his good regimen, until he is healed.
Or if you wish, cauterize it by making many small points on it, beyond which you should hold the cautery: indeed, let it be by smelling.
For this type of cautery moistens the brain with quality.
Then place on it a poultice soaked in butter, or chicken fat.
Concerning the method of cauterization in descending water to the eye.
Chapter XIII.
When you are shown the beginning of water in the eye, by the signs that I have mentioned in the division, then begin and let the infirm drink, with that which will cleanse his head.
And keep him from all dampness, and have him sit in a bath, fasting for several days.
Then order him to shave his head, and cauterize him in the middle of his head. Then cauterize him on the two temples with two cauteries, if the descent of water is beginning in both eyes simultaneously; or on one side, if the beginning is in one eye; and cut with the cautery all the veins and arteries that are under the skin; and let the cauteries be of the same length as the width of the temples; and beware of the flow of blood.
If you see something from it, then remove it immediately with whatever medicine is possible; and I will come with the knowledge that is in extracting arteries, and cutting them, and caution concerning the flow of blood.
And sometimes he is cauterized on the neck, beneath the two bones, with two cauteries finally produced.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in ancient lachrymal passages.
When the tears of the eyes are old, persistent; and they are above the veins and arteries that are in the obvious exterior of the head, it is verified that it is from cold, phlegmatic superfluities; then cauterize with the same cautery that I have narrated in the beginning of descending water, a cautery in the middle of the head, and two cauteries above the two temples, and two cauteries on the neck beneath the two bones. And if it needs an addition, then cauterize it on every side of the eye's cavity, above the end of the eyebrow with a small cautery.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in a foul odor of the nose.
When you treat it, with what we have said in the division, and the treatment does not help; then hurry, and give in a drink to the sick person cochlias three nights; afterwards shave his head, and cauterize it with a middle cautery, with an olive cautery. Then cauterize it with a clavicle cautery, two cauteries, above the two eyebrows beneath the hair a little.
And guard against the artery, lest you strike it.
And this is the form of the Clavulus cautery.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in softening the eyelid.
When the eyelid of the eye is softened by illness or moisture, then cauterize the eyelid with one cautery, using this lunate cautery.
And if you wish, cauterize it above the two eyebrows slightly with two cauteries on every side, and let them be distant from the two temples; and let the length of each cautery be according to the length of the eyebrow; and do not place your hand with the cautery to the end, but according to the amount that the third eyelid is burned.
Concerning the method of cauterizing the eyelid when the hairs are inverted, pricking the eye.
The cautery in it is according to two methods: either cautery with fire, or cautery with a burning medicine.
In cautery with fire, beforehand command the infirm person to remove his hairs, if he is of those who cleanse them, until they are extended and made equal. If however they prick him at their origin: then bind his eyes with a bandage, so that they do not move, until they are born.
When therefore they are born and made equal, then place the head of the infirm person in your bosom; then mark above the eyelid of his eyes with encaustic, a sign that is according to the shape of a myrtle leaf; and let the beginning of the sign be near the hairs.
Then place a cloth soaked in egg white, or in psyllium mucilage, upon the eye.
Then apply a cautery, whose shape is this.
Then cauterize over the shape you marked, gradually in many stages, until the surface of the skin, which is like the shape of a myrtle leaf, is entirely burnt away.
And the sign of the success of your work is: that if you see the eyelid of the eye already contracting, and the hairs rising at the puncture of the eye.
Therefore raise your hand then, and leave it for three days.
Then place upon it a cloth with butter, until the eschar is removed. Then treat it with ointment until it heals.
If any hair returns after an hour, and the eyelid softens: then again cauterize that place, as you did at first.
If, however, the hairs are in the lower part, then cauterize it until it is raised to its natural place and is even so that the hairs do not prick the eye.
You should instruct the sick person to let the hairs go, until they are lengthened and made even. Make a shape of a myrtle leaf from paper or cloth.
Then take one ounce, or almost that amount, of known soap and of unsoaked lime; then grind them together well, and do it quickly so that it does not get cold. Then spread some of it over the paper you made in the shape of a myrtle leaf, and put it over the eyelid of one or two eyes. And place under the eye a cloth soaked in egg white; and let the head of the sick person be in your bosom.
And place your index finger on the medicine, and press it for a short time. And you should move it whenever the sick person feels the medicine's biting, because its biting is like fire.
While therefore this biting which he finds persists, then leave the medicine, and move it with your finger. When therefore the biting ceases, then remove the medicine, and wash the eye with water.
And then consider, if you see the eyelid raised, as it is raised by contraction with fire, or with incision, it is well; and if not, then repeat the medicine on the area, where the medicine does not penetrate and does not darken, until your operation is equal to, and the eye is contracted.
Then place on it Cuta with butter, until the skin of the burn is eradicated. Then treat it with diaphinicon ointment, or another, until it is healed.
And it is necessary for you during the operation to observe the utmost care, so that nothing of the medicine falls into the eye.
If the eyelid softens after days, and some hair struggles into the eye, then repeat the medicine on the area that softens from the eyelid properly, as you did at first. Then treat it until it is healed.
And this is the form of the myrtle leaf.
And know that the eyes of men differ in size and smallness. Therefore, according to that, let your consideration be: and the path of righteousness is not hidden from him who has a diligent study of this art.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in a tear duct fistula.
When you treat a fistula, in accordance with what we have said in the divisions of diseases, and your treatment does not help, then it is necessary that you cauterize it according to this method.
Tell the sick person to place their head in your lap, and let the attendant hold their head in their hands in such a way that it does not move or tremble with their head.
Then place a cotton swab soaked in egg white, or in psyllium mucilage, over their eye; then apply the cautery, whose shape is this.
Let it be concave, like the shape of a vulture's wing feather from one end, with which the cautery is made; and if you wish to be penetrating to the other end, and if you wish to be held upward like this.
However, this concave shape is better for your work.
Then express the fistula, if it is open, and extract the pus from it, and dry it; and if it is not open, then open it, and extract its pus.
Then place the cautery, which is made very hot, upon it.
And hold your hand with the cautery for a short time near the cautery, from the eye to the side of the nose, so that your hand does not stray or disturb the sick person; and you shall place the cautery on the fat of the eye, and corrupt it.
If therefore you reach the opening of your cautery at the start, it will be well. And if not, then repeat the cautery once or twice, if you need it; and leave it for three days.
Then place a compress with butter, and treat it with a drying ointment, until it is healed.
If however forty days have passed, and it is not healed, then place on it a sharp, corrosive medicine, until the opening is revealed; and scrape it according to what is stated in its chapter.
And there is another method of cauterizing a fistula, which some of the first [practitioners] said. Aim at the location of the fistula and cut it open; then place in the opening a thin camahan, that is, a thin cannula, whose shape is this. And pour into it a drachm of liquefied lead, and hold your hand with a good retaining cannula, and let the patient not move at all, so that the liquefied lead does not run, or reach his eye.
And it is necessary that you place on the patient's eye a poultice soaked in egg white, or in water.
For lead burns the area of the fistula, and heals it with a remarkable cure.
If the fistula is healed by what we have said about cautery and treatment, it is good. And if not, then it is necessary to administer a nasal opening, and to reduce the fistula to the course of the nose, according to where it will come to its proper place.
Concerning the method of cauterization in lip fissures.
Often fissures occur in the lip, called hairs, and especially in the lips of children.
Therefore, when you treat these fissures, using what we have said in the division of diseases, and if the treatment is not effective, then cauterize with a small, knife-like cautery, according to this form.
And its concavity should be according to the sharpness of the knife.
Then place it [the cautery] ignited quickly on the fissures themselves, until the cautery reaches the depth of the fissures.
Then treat it with a cauterant, until it heals.
Concerning the method of cauterization in a fistula of the mouth.
When an abscess occurs at the root of the gum, or in the palate, or in the roots of the teeth; then it produces pus, and bursts; afterwards it becomes chronic, and pus runs, and a fistula forms; then you treat it, and treatment does not help it, then it is necessary that you cauterize the wound with a cautery according to the size that it occupies in the fistula. Then introduce the heated cautery into the opening of the fistula, and hold your hand until the heated iron reaches its depth and its end; do this once or twice.
Then treat it afterwards, with that which we said about treatment until it is healed.
If therefore the pus is cut away, and it heals, it will be good. And if not, then it is necessary to uncover the place, and remove the corrupted bone according to what comes upon its head.
Concerning the method of cauterizing softened gums and teeth.
When the gum softens due to moisture, and the teeth move, and you treat it with medicines, and it does not help: then place the head of the sick person in your lap.
Then take a cautery, whose shape will follow, so that you place the cannula on the tooth; and quickly insert the heated cautery into it; and hold your hand for a short time, until the sick person feels the heat of the fire already reaching the root of the tooth.
And raise your hand; then repeat the cautery several times, as desired.
Then let the sick person fill their mouth with salt water, and hold it for an hour, and spit it out.
For the moving tooth is strengthened, and the softened gum is tightened, and the corrupted moisture is dried.
Concerning the method of cauterizing dental pain.
When toothache is due to cold, or there is cold or a worm in it, and treatment with medicines does not help, then the cautery is applied to it in two ways: either cautery with butter, or cautery with fire.
However, its cautery with butter is to take milk butter and boil it in an iron spoon, or in a vessel. Then take a cotton swab and wrap it around the tip of the probe. Then immerse it in the boiled butter, and quickly place it on the aching tooth, and hold it until it cools; then repeat it several times, until the power of fire reaches the root of the tooth.
And if you wish, immerse wool or cotton in cold butter, and place it on the aching tooth, and place hot iron on it until fire reaches the deep cavity of the tooth.
Its cauterization with fire is to aim at a brass tube, or an iron tube. And let there be something of its thickness, so that the sharpness of the fire does not reach the sick person's mouth.
Then take the cautery, whose shape will come, and place it on that tooth, and hold your hand until the cautery cools.
Do it several times, for the pain will be removed, either on that same day, or on another day.
And it is necessary that, in the application of that cautery, the sick person should fill his mouth with good butter, and hold it for an hour; then spit it out.
And this is the shape of the cautery.
Cauterize with whichever extremity of force is possible: and this is the shape of the cannula.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in strophulus.
When strophulus are caused by phlegm and by cold humors, and are not yielding to digestion by medicines, and the force of digestion of them is slow, then with a concave cautery, whose form is this, cauterize with fire.
Having two open ends, so that smoke may issue forth at one end of the cautery, and place it heated upon the abscess once, and a second time, if that is insufficient, until it reaches the depth of the abscess.
If the abscess is small, then place the cautery according to the size of the abscess.
Then leave it for three days, and place upon it a poultice infused in butter, until that which the fire burned away is removed.
Then treat it with tooth ointment, until the form of the cannula is healed.
Concerning the method of cauterization for hoarseness of voice and constriction of breathing.
When humidities overcome the lung's passages, and especially when it is with a cold temperament, then it is necessary that the infirm person be evacuated primarily with dissolving medicines.
Then cauterize it in the nocrati near the root of the throat in the depressed place: and beware, lest you reach the throat with the cautery, nor the skin, unless something of it.
Then cauterize it with another cautery at the junction of the neck at the last vertebra thereof, and let the cautery be narrow in accordance with the manner that preceded.
Then treat it with what preceded, until it is healed.
Concerning the method of cauterization in diseases of the lungs and cough.
When cough and lung disease are from cold humors, and the sick person does not have a fever, nor consumption, and the illness is old, then cauterize him with two cauteries above the fork in depressed, smooth, empty places. And with another cautery in the middle of the chest between the two breasts: and let the cautery be of a tube according to the form that preceded.
And if you wish your cauterization to be by puncturing with a cautery, called *Punctum*, whose form preceded in the puncturing of the pain of the ears: and let the punctures be from thirty punctures to as if another.
Then treat him with what preceded, until he is healed.
And now let the cautery have three branches: according to this form. Therefore, the cauterization is alleviated when you do it with three cauteries at once.
Chapter XXVII.
When the head of the humerus is dislocated due to moisture, and does not return to its proper place after the dislocation, until it is accustomed to returning, then it is dislocated by a small movement, as we have already testified, then you must reduce the dislocation first. Then the sick person should be laid on their back, or on their healthy side. Then lift the skin that is on the inner Titillico upwards with your left hand, and if the joint is dislocated inward.
Then, having a cautery with two prongs. Whose form is this.
Then cauterize the skin until it penetrates it to the other side, and the figure of the cauterization will come with four cauteries.
And sometimes cauterization is done with a cautery having three prongs, why the figure of cauterization then is of six cauteries: and the prongs are according to the thinness of the thread.
And this is the form of the cautery having three prongs.
And sometimes one is added to this method, why there are eight cauteries.
Then place on the cautery, crushed leeks with salt. Then make the infirm adhere to tranquility, so that the limb does not move at any time, until it is strengthened.
And if the dislocation is upwards, and rarely does that happen, then cauterize it above the shoulder with a clavicle cautery, or with many cauteries by puncturing.
For the joint is strengthened, and moisture is removed: and the infirm is healed.
Concerning the method of cauterizing the stomach.
When there are cold and many moistures in the stomach, until they draw it from its complextion, and the phlegms multiply in it, and persistent modes of treatment do not help, then it is necessary that the sick person lie on his back, and extend his legs, and his hands. Then cauterize with three cauteries, one cautery under the spoon-shaped part of the breast to the size of one finger with a claviform cautery, and two cauteries lower down at the two sides of one cautery, until a triangular shape of cauteries is formed. And lengthen them apart so that they do not join, when they will produce pus.
And the depth of the cautery be the size of two-thirds the thickness of the skin.
And let the shape of the cauteries be according to this form without addition; and if you wish to cauterize with a large cautery in the middle of the stomach according to this form, and let the cautery by which this is done be one according to the form of a circle, according to this form.
And the stomach is cauterized by puncturing it with that which is terrified by this cautery; and it is that you mark upon the stomach a point according to the quantity that you wish with encaustic; then cauterize it with the cautery of the point; then treat it with the treatment that preceded until it is healed.
Of the method of cauterizing a cold liver.
When in the liver pain occurs from cold and moisture, or from thick wind, until it emerges from its natural complexion by a superfluity's departure, and the sick person is treated with what we have said, and it does not benefit him: then it is necessary that the sick person be laid supine upon their neck, and mark with encaustic three cauteries according to this figure, and this same quantity on the lower liver from the hypochondria, where the man's elbow reaches: and let the space between each cautery be according to the thickness of a finger; and let the cautery be according to the length of the body straight; and do not press your hand with the cautery much.
And let the quantity of that which is burned be, from the thickness of the skin, the quantity of its half, not added: and let the sick person be standing on their feet.
If however he is not standing, then let him be lying, having already extended his legs, and raised his arms.
This is the form of the cautery.
And it is possible for you, to cauterize these cauteries with a knife cautery, when you have subtlety and prudence in the art.
And guard yourself so that you do not proceed too far in the cauterization, and the thickness of the entire skin is burned, for then the whole body is burned, and it reaches the intestines: for the skin there is thin, therefore know that.
On the method of cauterizing abscesses of the liver.
When an exit occurs, and you wish to know if that abscess is in the flesh of the liver, or in its tunic: then if it is in the flesh of the liver, the sick person is afflicted with pain and heaviness without sharpness; and if it is in the tunic of the liver, there is intense sharpness with the pain: and you see already that the treatment has fatigued his physicians.
Therefore, the sick person must lie on their back. Then, mark the location of the abscess with ink; then apply a cautery heated like a ray. And this is its form. And cauterize with it a single cautery, until the entire skin is burned and reaches the pus, until all the pus exits; then treat it with the treatment for exits until it is healed.
And it is not appropriate for one to use this type of cautery, unless their study in the art of medicine is prolonged, and through whose hands these illnesses have met with experience several times; for only then may one dare to undertake such an operation.
But truly, to leave it be, is better for me.
Concerning the method of cauterization in Pleuritis.
The ancients said that cautery with the roots of aristolochia, for cold pleurisy, according to this method. And it is, that you receive from the dry long roots of aristolochia, one root longer than the others found, and let it be like the thickness of a finger. Then immerse it in oil; and ignite it in fire. Then cauterize with one cautery in that which is between the continuation of the fork with the neck, and with two small cauteries a little sloping downward to the part which is under the beard.
And with two cauteries also in that which is between the fifth and sixth rib, sloping slightly backwards; and with another cautery in the middle of the chest, and another above the stomach. And with three cauteries from behind: one in that which is between the two shoulder blades; and with two cauteries from the two sides of the chest, below the cautery which is between the two shoulder blades.
And you should not press your hand with the cautery, rather it should be in plain view, smelling the skin.
And some ancient ones have said that there are people who use a cautery made of iron, similar to a rod; and they burn, and they insert it into that which is between the ribs, until they reach the abscess itself, and pus comes out; just as we have said in the abscess of the liver.
But in this perforation with a cautery there is fear that either the weak person dies immediately, or a fistula occurs in the place, which has no cure.
Of the method of cauterizing the spleen, Chapter XXXII.
When you treat the illness of the spleen, with what we have said concerning treatment in the division of illnesses, and your treatment does not help, then the cautery is used on it in three ways, all of which are correct.
One of which is to make three cauteries, or four, by drawing lines along the length of the spleen, according to the shape of the liver cauteries, whose shape preceded.
And let there be between each cautery a quantity equal to the thickness of a finger, or a little more or less.
And let the method of the cautery be, as we said in the cautery of the liver, equally.
And do not press your hand with the cautery; and let the sick person lie weakly on his back.
And another method of cauterization is: that you heat the cautery having two prongs, which we mentioned in the chapter on the dislocation of the shoulder; and raise the skin, which is directly over the spleen, where the left elbow of the sick person reaches; and let your raising of the skin be according to the width of the body, so that the cauteries fall along the length of the body.
Then introduce the two very hot prongs until, with them, you penetrate the skin on the other side; then withdraw the cautery; therefore four cauteries are made.
And if you wish to cauterize with another cautery having three prongs.
Then treat the cautery after you let it emit pus for many days; for it is more beneficial than any of the previous treatments.
Of the method of cauterization in dropsy.
The cautery does not fall upon dropsy unless properly applied.
When you treat a dropsical patient with the methods of treatment that we have discussed in the division, and the treatment is not effective, then you should cauterize him with four cauteries around the navel, and one cautery above the stomach, and another cautery above the liver, and a cautery above the spleen, and two cauteries behind the back between the vertebrae, and one in the direct line of the chest, and another in the direct line of the stomach: and the depth of the cautery should be approximately the thickness of the skin.
Then leave the cautery open, so that it may emit pus for a long time.
And do not remove the infirm patient from the treatment after the cautery with him; for it is necessary that two intentions be aggregated in him; and healing will hasten to him with the help of God.
The shape of the cautery with which the belly is cauterized should be pointed, according to the shape that preceded it; and the shape of the cautery with which the back is cauterized should be olive-shaped, according to the shape that preceded it.
Concerning the method of cauterizing the Feet and Legs.
When abscesses occur in a hydrops patient, and they are filled with yellow water, it is necessary to cauterize on the back of the foot, in the nocrati, which is between the auricular and annular [areas]; and raise your hand with the cautery, and do not turn it; then raise your hand; and do not repeat it at all.
For the yellow water will sweat out, and the cautery should be of this form.
Then make two cauteries on each leg, and let the cautery be made with the knife-like extremity of the cautery; and let the cautery be made along the length of the leg, one below the knee, and the other below that, approximately in the middle of the leg; and on each thigh, make two cauteries; and leave the cautery open without treatment for a long time, so that some water may sweat from it; then treat it with the rest of what we have said.
Concerning the method of cauterization in abdominal distension.
Chapter XXXV.
When abdominal distension is due to cold and dampness, weakening the retentive and digestive powers in the stomach and intestines; and it is treated with methods of healing, but is not cured; and you see the patient tolerating a cautery of exuberant strength, then cauterize him with a large cautery on his stomach, according to what preceded in the cauterization of the stomach with a circular cautery, and four subtle cauteries around the navel, with a subtle spatula-like cautery; and a large cautery, or two cauteries, above the alcatin, above the alhosos.
And if you see excessive moisture, and the patient tolerates it, then cauterize him with a cautery on the breastbone, and a cautery on each hip; and perhaps add two small cauteries near the large one on the stomach.
For it is a beneficial treatment, whose aid does not err.
Concerning the method of cauterizing Hemorrhoids.
Chapter XXXVI.
When in the anus there are many old hemorrhoids, or one, and they are from thick, cold humors, or corrupted moisture, and they are treated with what we said in the division, and the treatment does not help: then cauterize with three cauteries on the lower spine of the back under the [or: by] the almeidati for a little while triangularly, and with a cautery under the navel by almost two fingers' width.
And if you think that his stomach is chilled, and his food is not digested, and you see his face becoming ulcerated, then cauterize him on the stomach with a large cautery, as was previously described; and cauterize him on his liver, and another on his spleen, with a sharp cautery; and leave the cautery open for a time; then treat him until he is healed.
Chapter XXXVII.
When you excise althelul, then heat the cautery that resembles a ray. Then introduce the heated cautery into the excised althelul: and with your hand, until the cautery reaches the opening of the vein, from which the blood flows: do this once, or twice.
If therefore the althelul are many, then cauterize each one with the cautery as we have described. Then treat them with what you apply of ointments, until they heal.
And if you cauterize it with a large cautery over the alcatin, it is more helpful.
Concerning the method of cauterizing a fistula in the anus.
Chapter Thirty-Eight.
When the sick person does not obey the incision and the work which we have described in its place, and is frightened by it, perhaps he is cured with a cautery.
Therefore, when a fistula occurs to someone, and becomes old, pus runs from it, and corrupted humors. Therefore, it is fitting that you probe it with a fine probe. Then ascertain the amount of its depth with the probe.
Then heat the cautery, which is similar to a ray. Then insert yourself the heated cautery into the fistula itself, and the amount in which the cautery entered.
And apply the cautery repeatedly to it, until all those corrupt bodies are burned, once, or twice, or thrice, according to your need.
And guard yourself from burning any nerve, if there be any there, or large vein; or if the fistula leads to the bladder, or to the body of the intestine, then guard yourself from all these places.
And do not do this, unless when the fistula is in a fleshy place; and you think, because it is not penetrating.
Then treat the place until it is healed.
If, however, the place is sealed, and the materials are cut away from it, and it remains like this for a long time, then know that it is now completely healed.
And if they do not cut away materials from it, then know that it is penetrating, or a corrupt bone is within its depth, or something similar to those things: whose description will come in its proper place.
On the method of cauterizing the Kidneys.
When pain in the kidneys occurs from cold or from heavy winds, and it diminishes because of the weakness of the sufferer, then it is necessary to cauterize it on the almethen, over the kidneys, cauterizing over each kidney with a clauili cautery, whose description preceded.
And perhaps we cauterize it a second time on the same almeidatu. Therefore, three lines will result. Therefore, the last will be more helpful.
Concerning the method of cauterizing the bladder.
When weakness and softening of the bladder occur due to cold and moisture, to the point that the patient cannot retain urine, then cauterize it on the lower part of the summit above the bladder, where the hairs of the pubic area begin.  Cauterize with one cautery from the right side of the summit, and another from the left: and let the length of each cautery be according to the size of a thumb's breadth.  And cauterize it with a cautery from the lower back, or with two cauteries if that one is insufficient. And let it be in accordance with the previous cautery closure.
Concerning the method of cauterizing the womb.
When cold and moisture occur in the womb, and it is thereby prevented from conception, and her menstrual flow is corrupted, and its expulsion is delayed, and pain occurs to her at their arrival, then it is necessary that it be cauterized with three cauteries in a circle around the navel, as we said in the cauterization of the bladder, and with a cautery above the hip, or with two cauteries below the back: and let the cautery be a closing cautery.
Concerning the method of cauterizing the anus in dislocation.
When mucous humors discharge into the anus, and become the cause of its exit from its place, and the sign of this is that the leg is extended over the other when they are compared to each other, and the place of the dislocation is found empty there.
Therefore, it is necessary that you cauterize the affected area above the anus itself with a cautery in a similar circle, after you have marked it with ink around the anus as it revolves, and that the anus itself falls in the middle of the circle.
If this cautery is not available to you, then cauterize it with three cauteries, using a large olive-shaped cautery, and let the cautery depth correspond to the thickness of the entire skin.
Then treat it until it is healed.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in Sciatica.
When pain occurs in the hip joint, and its cause is cold and dampness; and the patient is treated as we described in the division, and the treatment does not help, and it becomes longstanding; then it is necessary to free the patient from thick humors with foul pills, or with artificial pills, and similar ones. Then cauterize it.
And the method of cautery in it is according to two ways: either cautery with burning medicines, or cautery with fire.
Cautery with fire, is according to many ways.
One of which is to cauterize over the hip joint itself with three triangular cauteries, according to this shape. And make them a good or bad depth. And let the space that is between each cautery be the thickness of a finger: and let the cautery be olive-shaped.
Sometimes however, the cautery is made in the middle over the head of the hip itself. Therefore there are four cauteries.
And if you wish to cauterize with a circle, whose form preceded in the cauterization of the dislocation of the hip, one: so that the circle encompasses the entire hip.
And burn the thickness of the entire skin.
This is the method of cautery in sciatica, when the pain is adhering to the hip itself, and does not extend to the thigh and leg.
However, if it extends to the thigh and leg, then cauterize it with two cauteries on the thigh, over the place to which the sufferer there points, where the pain is, and with your cautery on the calf four fingers to the wild side for a little while: and let the cautery be a cutting one.
And let the depth of the cautery be according to the depth of the thickness of the skin.
If the patient indicates that the pain extends almost to the toes, then cauterize it there where he indicates with a puncturing cautery, three, or four, or more, if it needs it.
And if he indicates the pain to be below the knee towards the leg, then cauterize it there with one cutting cautery.
And beware in all your cauterizations, that you do not proceed with the cautery to the point of burning a nerve, or a large artery, and drawing thereby upon the patient a bad harm or contraction.
And indeed I have seen one or another, of those who have cauterized above the ankle, and have proceeded too far in the cauterization, and the leg has become swollen, until a tumor reached the foot, and the entire foot has been perforated and corrupted: then the belly's dissolution has occurred, and death after it.
If the pain is in two parts simultaneously, cauterize each according to this method.
And certain wise men have said concerning the cauterization of the buttock, of which this is the mode of cautery. Make a similar cautery of iron, whose diameter be half a palm: and let it be at its opening according to the thickness of a date-stone, or a little less: and within that cautery let there be a third cautery.
And let the space that is between each cautery be the amount of a thumb's knot: and let the cauteries be open on both sides: and let their height be like one knot, or two knots: and make for them a handle of iron fitting well into the cauteries.
Then let it be heated in the fire until it glows red and throws off sparks; then let it be placed upon the wound of the buttock of the sick person lying on his healthy side. Therefore cauterize him with three round cauteries in one turn.
Then let him be left alone for three days. Afterwards apply a plaster with butter; and leave the wound open for many days. Then treat it with ointment until it is healed.
Albucasis says, "By this kind of cautery, my children, we have used little, because of the terror of its appearance; and because we have found few who will await over it.
However, it is among the good cauteries for him who endures it and finds its place with him.
A cautery, however, is with burning medicines, so that you make two samia having a perforated armilla, into which the hinge of its gate descends, of bronze or iron, the length of the wall; of which in their height there shall be two knots, or as if themselves.
And let the space that is between both quantities be the thickness of a finger, and let them be open below and above; and let that which contains them to each other be according to this form.
Then place it upon a box of ashes, the sick person lying on the healthy side. And press your hand heavily upon the box of ashes. Then pour between the two circles some warm water, which has been heated a little while with fire, and hold it for the amount of an hour's time; and let the sick person tolerate its scorching and burning, for he finds the scorching as if fire, until the scorching subsides.
Then lift your hand with the instrument, and wash off the warm water from the entire ash with sweet water; then leave it for three days.
And place butter over it until the blackness of the burning is removed; and leave it for a few days, and pus will run from it. For it is the last in the aid.
Then treat it with ointments until it is healed.
If the pain extends to the hip or leg, make a poultice on it containing water, according to what you did for the ash equally.
And this is the method of hot water; and I have already written it in the treatise on the rectification of medicines. Take alkali and quicklime, each one part: grind both, and place them in a new pot, whose bottom has a small hole, according to the amount that the radius will enter; and place another glass pot under the bottom of the first pot; and pour over the alkali and lime from sweet water, so that both are submerged by a finger; after which, you press them with your hand with a good pressure; and leave the pot until the sharp water descends into the lower part of the glass pot.
Then collect all that water, and pour it over other lime; and strain it until it is renewed.
For it will then be very strong and sharp, which is administered in many medical operations, and in the cauterization of other members. Because it produces the operation of fire itself.
And among medicines, with which anchas are cauterized, are also things like tesisie, and honey of anacard, and lime with soap, so that both are mixed together.
And Galen, indeed, narrating, recounted the cure of a certain man from antiquity, by which the pain of the anca and the sciatic vein was cured: and he greatly magnified its efficacy. And he said, that he did not need any other treatment, and that he was healed in a single instance, until he recounted that, perhaps, he had entered a bath borne and emerged from it already healthy.
And it is to be taken from green seitaragi: and if green is not found, let dry, fresh one be taken: and it should be well rubbed with some fat, and placed over the anca, where there is pain, or the leg, or the thigh: and it should be bound and left for three hours, or for as long as the sick person feels relief from the burning. Then put him into a bath.
When, therefore, his body becomes damp, put him on a bed. For the pain recedes, and he is healed.
And know that one ought not to use a cautery with these medicines, unless after the evacuation of the body.
And Dioscorides, who said that the dung of goats, when a sciatic vein is cauterized with it, helps it: and the cautery is done in this way. Take wool, and soak it in old oil, and place it on the deep place, which is between the big toe and the heel, and is closer to the heel.
Then take the dry dung of goats, and inflame it in fire, until it becomes charcoal.
Then place it on the wool, and leave it until it is extinguished. Then do it again. Therefore do not cease to do this, until the feeling reaches the top through the middle to the ankle, and the pain ceases.
And this method of cautery is called cautery Vaccinum.
Concerning the cauterization of back pain.
Sometimes pain in the back occurs from many causes, either from an accident or a blow or an evacuation of excess, and similar things, from the infusion of cold and damp material; and cautery indeed does not apply, except in this sole species, which occurs from the infusion of cold material.
Therefore, after the patient's evacuation with foul pills, and similar things, let three lines be made on the back, where the pain is, according to the width of the affected area itself; after marking with ink five cauteries in each line, or more according to the amount that the patient's tolerance permits, and let the cauterization be done with a cautery-point.
And if you wish, cauterize with three or four cauteries with a medial cautery iron, according to this form.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in the beginning of a humpback.
This illness often happens to very young children.
And the sign of its beginning in children is: that a constriction occurs in their breathing upon raising, and movement; and you find, at the end of the dorsal spine and its vertebrae, that it has already begun to protrude above the other vertebrae.
Therefore, when you see this, and wish to treat it, then cauterize it with a cautery that is circular in this shape.
And let the cautery encompass the entire vertebral part equally; and if you wish to cauterize the circumference of the vertebra with a pointed cautery, make two or three lines, and let the points be close together.
Then treat the place, until it is healed with what we have said.
And beware, lest you apply the cautery to the hump that is formed in the spasm of the nerve.
Concerning the method of cauterization in gout, and pains in the joints.
When pains in the joints are from cold humors that are shed to any limb of the body, then when pains occur in the feet, it is customary for physicians to call it gout properly.
Therefore, when gout of a cold cause is treated with methods of cure, and the pains are not removed, then the cautery removes them.
And it is that one should cauterize it after evacuation, in the circumference of the joints of the feet, with many cauteries; and let the cautery be olive-shaped.
And if you need to puncture on the surface of the foot, then do it with a pointed cautery. If the pains ascend to the knees, or other joints, and that often happens, then cauterize it on each knee with three or four cauteries on every side, with this same claw-shaped cautery.
If, however, more cauterizations with this cautery are needed, then cauterize it. And do not immerse your hand with the cautery, rather let it be about the thickness of the skin only.
If, however, the pains ascend to the knees and back, then administer what we have said about cautery in its chapter.
If the pains are only in the hands, then prick the points around the foci, like two lines revolving.
If, however, pain remains in the fingers, then prick them, over each knot a prick, and over the palm of the hand.
If, however, the pains ascend after days to the elbows, or to the shoulders, then cauterize both from every side.
And do not evacuate the sick person from a good regimen, from the taking of medicines. For if a good regimen is made, and phlegm is evacuated, it will be healed with the help of God with this cautery.
Concerning the manner of cauterization in Ruptures.
When a rupture occurs in the groin, and the intestine, or the viscera, descend to the testicle, and it is a beginning proximate one: then it is necessary that you order the sick person to let go of eating on his day. And let him use laxatives, so that the stool descends from his belly.
Then let him sit between your hands on his back: and order him to hold his breath, until it emerges, or the viscera, or intestine, appears.
Then reduce it with your fingers, and mark with ink under the rupture, above the pubic bone, with a mark whose extremity is similar to half a circle towards the upper part of the body.
Then cauterize with a cautery, of which this is the form, until it becomes white, and throws off sparks. Then reduce the intestine, or viscus, to its concavity. Then let the attendant place his hand over the location, so that the intestine does not exit: and you now have opened between the legs of the sick person, and placed a cushion beneath him, and another attendant on his legs, and another on his chest, who holds his hands.
Then place the cautery upon that mark, with your hand holding the cautery upright. And hold it until you reach the mouth with it; or repeat with it another time, if you have not reached the mouth with it on the first attempt.
And prudently observe the exit of the intestine during your cauterization, lest you burn it, and cause death or great harm to the sick person through it.
And know that when you do not reach the mouth with the cautery, your operation is not effective.
And the cautery for infants should be fine, according to their size.
Then treat with the remaining ointments until it is healed.
And let the sick person lie on their back for forty days, until the wound is sealed.
And it is necessary that you provide nourishment for the duration of his treatment, that which will soothe his belly, so that his intestines do not exit during straining and expulsion.
Then, when he wishes to rise after forty days, then administer a properly made bandage, and let him keep it on for another forty days.
And lessen labor, and fullness of food and drink, and loud voices.
For when he uses this regimen, thus he is healed with complete healing.
And I will speak of the treatment of Ruptures with incision in his chapter.
However, when Ruptures occur in the remaining belly, and are incipient, and the force is such that they should not be added to, then cauterize the Rupture with a round cautery according to its size: and let that which is burned be from then on as its third part. Then treat him with what we have said: and it will not be added to.
And some of the first have already said that the Rupture should be cauterized with a triangular cautery, according to this shape.
After it is marked with ink, and a line is placed which is across the width on the upper side of the Rupture, and another line at the lower. And place your hand in the middle with the cautery forceps.
But the first cautery is easier and better.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in pains due to a fall or a blow.
Chapter XLVIII.
When pain occurs in certain limbs from a fall or blow, and that pain persists for a long time, and treatment with medicines does not help, then it is necessary to cauterize with a pointed cautery.
And let the cautery of each limb be a cautery according to its size, and its smallness, and its weakness, and its strength, and the location of the twisting, and the pain from it.
If therefore it is healed from the first cautery, it is well. If not, then repeat the cautery upon it.
Because it is customary for these pains to shift from one limb to another that is near it. Therefore it is necessary to pursue them with cautery until the infirmity is healed.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in Leprosy.
Leprous people are sometimes greatly helped by cauterization. And especially the type of leprosy that occurs due to the putrefaction of phlegm and melancholy: therefore, when you intend to cauterize it, consider this.
If the leprosy is spreading, and you have treated it with what we have stated in the division, and it does not descend nor remain stationary; and you fear that the corruption will spread to the entire constitution of the sick person, then cauterize him on the head with five cauteries: one in the middle of the head's mark, and a second below it toward the forehead at the end of the hair, and two above the two horns, and one behind above the base of the neck.
And with your cautery, hold your hand a little while, until a small impression is made on the bone, and the cortices are loosened from it: so that the expulsion of coarse vapors from it may be relieved, and cauterize also with the cautery on the spleen itself, according to what has preceded.
However, if the leprosy has already spread over the sick person, and is clearly visible, then it is necessary to cauterize with those cauteries that we have mentioned for the head, and with a cautery on the tip of the nose, and with two cauteries on the two cheekbones, and with two cauteries on the vertebrae of the neck, and with six on the vertebrae of the back, and with one large one on the haunches near the tail, and one on the haunch itself, in the haunch itself; and with two on the hips; namely, one on each hip, and two on the knees; one on each knee, and two on the shoulders, and two on the elbows, and two on the soft parts of his chest; and cauterize him on every joint, from the joints of his fingers of the hands and feet; and cauterize on every heel of his feet, and the joints of his hands.
And beware of the nerves that are above the heel's last part, so that you do not burn them.
And sometimes a cautery is applied to the breastbone, and another to the stomach bone, and another to the liver.
And know that the more you apply the cautery, the more help it is and the more beneficial it is.
And know that the sick person does not find pain in the cautery, as healthy people find it, because his body is already numbed.
And the cauteries should be of varying sizes, large and small, according to the limbs and joints, according to what has been previously stated regarding the types of instruments.
Then treat the cautery with herb flour and honey, and with the rest of the treatment, until it is healed.
On the method of cauterizing in a state of stupor.
When any limb is numb and is treated with medicines, oils, and plasters, and is not healed, then cauterize that numb limb with cauteries, according to the size of the limb, whether large or small.
And let your cautery enter the thickness of the skin a little. Then treat it with ointment until it is healed.
And sometimes it is cauterized for a numbness that happens to the hand and foot, in the spinal column of the back at the exit points of the nerves that move that limb, and the numbness is removed.
But let no one presume upon it unless he is knowledgeable in the anatomy of the limbs and the exit points of the nerves that move the body.
Chapter LI.
When Albaras is old and no medicinal remedy helps it, then cauterize over it with a deep cautery for a short time, according to the thickness of the skin, until the whiteness is removed and its color is changed.
Then treat it with flour of herbs, and lentils with rose oil, and arnogloss leaves, and pigeon's blood, and swallow's blood: let each be one part: mix these all, and spread them over a cloth, and apply to the area until it is healed.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in Cancer.
When Cancer is incipient and you wish to stop it, then cauterize it with a circular cautery around it, just as it revolves.
However, the wise said that it should be cauterized with the final cautery in the middle.
However, it does not seem to me, for I fear that it will ulcerate; and I have already seen it do so on several occasions.
And it is better that it be cauterized in a circle around it, as we said, or with many cauteries.
Concerning the manner of cauterizing in Adubelati.
When someone has an Adubelati, and it is delayed in maturing, whether due to excess that causes it, or due to the age of the infirm person, when they are decrepit with little blood, or due to time, and the need to hasten the maturation of the Adubelati, then cauterize in a circle around it with many small cauteries by puncturing. Then leave it. For it will hasten with maturation.
If however you want to perforate it with a cautery, then heat the cautery, of which this is the form.
And place it in the middle of the Adubelati until it penetrates the skin; and let the cautery be from that which follows the infirm person, so that the course of the purulent matter is alleviated.
Then treat it until it is healed.
Concerning the method of cauterizing a corroding evil.
Chapter LIII.
A corroding thing is nothing but a corruption that walks in a member, and corrodes it; just as fire consumes dry wood.
If therefore you see a corroding thing in a place that can tolerate a cauterization with fire, then cauterize it with many fires, with small and large cautery irons, according to what suits the place where the corroding thing is.
Then cauterize it from every side until you uproot the entire corruption, and nothing of it remains at all.
Then leave it for three days, and put powdered sulfur mixed with oil on the cauterized areas, until all scabs and all corruption are eradicated.
Then treat it with ointments that generate flesh.
If therefore you see that after three days healthy flesh is born, in which there is no corruption, it is good.
And if not, then again cauterize that which remained of the corrupted areas.
And it is sometimes cured by corrosive medicine. For it rises in place of the cautery.
However, cautery with fire is of quicker help; and I indeed have already said that its cauterization with corrosive medicine is in division; therefore take it there when you need it.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in warts and corns.
Chapter LV.
This ailment frequently occurs in the lower parts of the feet, and it is a thick, filtered substance that harms the foot.
And cautery in them is indeed in two ways: cautery with fire, and cautery with hot water.
As for cautery with fire, make a concave cautery like a bird of prey's wing, which is made of iron, according to the size of the wart to encompass it completely, and with thin edges.
Then place it, heated, upon the wart. Then revolve the hand with the cautery in a circular motion around the wart until the cautery reaches the depth of the wart, and leave it for three days until it begins to emit pus. Then plaster it with crushed wild herbs and salt, and leave the plaster on it overnight. For it will be eradicated from its roots.
Then treat the area with a flesh-generating ointment until it heals.
If they are not cured, and often occur on the surface of the body, especially on the hands and feet, then apply a cautery to them with hot water.  And you should take a cannula of bronze, or iron, or of a vulture's feather, and place it over the wart or corn. Then pour a small amount of hot water into the cannula; hold your hand, and revolve it with pressure of your hand for a short time, so that the edge of the cannula is pressed into the base of the corn, and the hot water finds its way to the depth, to the base of the corn; and let the patient wait for a while on the scorching of the hot water for an hour.
Then leave him, for the corn is eradicated with its roots.
Do this with each of them, one by one, until you have dealt with all that are on the body.
Then treat them after they are eradicated, with that which generates flesh from ointments.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in Tremore.
When tremor occurs in someone from cold in a nerve, or from quartan fever, or otherwise: then it is necessary that you cauterize it with four cauteries, or five over the spinal vertebrae, and between each vertebra with a cautery, and in his chest with a cautery, and over his stomach with a cautery.
For tremor ceases with the cautery of olive oil, and the health of cold illness is hastened.
Concerning the method of cauterizing Albathir.
Chapter LVII.
Sometimes foul Albathir, that is, pustules, are expelled in the body, which are made from corrupted gross matter.
Therefore, when they appear, it is necessary first to cauterize every pustule on the head with a fine cautery made from myrtle wood, whose tip is heated with fire. Or with the root of long aristolochia. Or with a lenticular cautery.
And sometimes they are cauterized at the beginning of their expulsion in this way: and they do not increase; and the superfluity that makes them is broken, and it is healed from them.
However, it is necessary that it be done after evacuation with phlebotomy.
Concerning the method of cauterization in a flow of blood from an artery in a wound.
Often a flow of blood occurs from an artery that has been cut in a wound, which occurs externally, or in the incision of an abscess, or cautery of a limb, and similar things: and it is difficult to cut it off.
Therefore, when this happens to someone, then quickly apply your index finger to the opening of the artery, and press it firmly until the blood is obstructed beneath your finger, and nothing escapes from it.
Then place small olive-shaped cauteries, and many large ones in number, into the fire, and blow over them until they become very hot.
Then take one of them, either small or large, according to the wound and the place where the artery is ruptured, and place the cautery upon the vein itself, after you have quickly removed your finger; and hold the cautery until the blood is cut off.
If it is expelled when you raise your finger from the opening of the artery, and you extinguish the cautery, then quickly take another cautery from the cauteries prepared in the fire.
Therefore do not cease to do this with one after another, until the blood is cut off.
And beware, lest you burn the nerve which is there, and another harm befall the sick person.
And know that when blood flows from the artery, then it is not possible to cut it off, especially when the artery is large, unless by one of four methods. Or with a cautery, as we have said. Or with extraction, when it is not extracted. For when it is extracted, its extremities contract, and the blood is cut off. Or it must be tied with a strong ligature. Or medicines of a nature to cut off the blood may be placed upon it, and it may be bound with a suitable constricting cushion.
However, whoever performs its excision with a ligature and constriction with a cloth, or by applying burning substances, and similar things, does not entirely benefit it, except rarely.
If, however, this should happen to someone, and a physician or medicine is not present, then let him begin with the application of the index finger over the opening of the vein itself, as we have described, and with its very firm constriction, until the blood is obstructed from the upper part of the wound, and above the artery. And the finger should not be removed, keeping it upon it with very cold water, until the blood is congealed and thickened, and cut off.
And meanwhile, let him consider what it needs, from a cautery or from medicine.
Concerning incision, perforation, and bloodletting in wounds, and similar matters.
We have already said in the First Chapter, that every illness in which cautery with fire and burning medicine is appropriate, and its occasions, its causes, and its instruments, and the forms of cauteries.
And I have placed there chapters from head to foot.
And I shall proceed in this chapter along the same path: so that the seeker may have his question relieved.
And before I begin that, it is necessary that you, children, learn that in this chapter there is something from the terror of what is in the first chapter on cauterization.
And because of that, it is necessary that there be more caution in it, because in the operation that is in this chapter, very often evacuation occurs with blood, with which life stands at the opening of a vein, or incision on an abscess, or opening of an exit, or the healing of a wound, or the extraction of an arrow, or an incision on a stone, and similar to these: from all of which tremor and fear are associated, and death occurs in many of them.
And I warn you, lest that in which there is hesitation fall upon you, for sometimes the ways of men with the ways of illnesses fall upon you in this art. For among them is he who is angry with his illness, and death is light to him; because of the severity he finds from his illness and its long malice. And with illness there is fear that signifies death.
And among them is he who gives his pipe and enriches you with it, hoping for health, and his illness is harmful.
Therefore, you should not consent to him who comes to you from among them, whose manner is such. And let your caution be more intense than your greed and your rapacity. And do not presume upon anything from it unless after certain knowledge, which verifies to you that to which praiseworthy succession has arrived.
And use in the treatment of all your sick persons, prognosis and indication of that to which health is suitably.
For in that is help for you in the acquisition of fame and glory, and of memory and praise.
May God inspire in you, O children, His understanding, and may He not remove from you direction and inspiration, for it is in His hand.
And I indeed have ordered this chapter, distinguishing by chapters, according to what preceded in the chapter on the cautery, from the neck to the feet: so that your quest for what you want from it, and what you need, may be alleviated.
On the treatment of Water that collects in the heads of children.
Chapter 1.
Know that this ailment frequently occurs to children at birth, or when the midwife tightly grasps the child's head without gentleness.
And sometimes it also occurs from a hidden cause that is not known.
And indeed I have not seen this illness in others than in children, and death has hastened to all whom I have seen afflicted by it; therefore, it seemed to me to omit an operation on it.
And indeed I saw one child of them whose head was filled with water, and the head increased in size every day, until he could not sit on himself, due to the size of his head; and the moisture increased until he died.
And this moisture indeed either collects between the skin and the bone, or collects under the bone above the sifac.
And if there is moisture between the skin and the bone, and the abscess is small, then it is necessary to make a single fissure in the middle of the head, in width; and let the length of the fissure be about two knots, until the moisture runs out.
And this is the form of a lancet.
If, therefore, the moisture is more increased, and the abscess is larger, then place those two fissures, according to this form.
And if the moisture is under the bone, and its sign is that you see the sutures of the head open on every side, and water is pressed out when you press it with your hand towards the interior, and that is not hidden from you, then it is necessary to make three fissures in the middle of the head, according to this method.
And after the incision, extract all the moisture. Then bind the fissures with cloths and poultices. Then apply a fomentation of wine and oil to it until the fifth day.
Then loosen the bandage, and treat the wound with tents and ointments.
And do not allow the head to be bound with equality. And feed the weak person with all dry food of little moisture, until the limb is strengthened and healed.
And another method of incision is that you should consider where the size of the abscess and the collection of water appear.
Because sometimes there is more in the back of the head, or in the forehead, or in the right, or in the left.
Therefore, ascend with the incision where the abscess and the filling of water appear to you: and cut it according to what is possible for you.
And observe, lest you cut an artery, and a flow of blood occur, and the weak person die from that flow with the evacuation of moisture.
Concerning the incision of arteries that are behind the ears.
Chapter II.
When catarrhs occur to someone in the eyes or in the chest, and it is prolonged, and treatment with medicines does not help, then the ultimate treatment for it is the incision of these two arteries.
Therefore, when you wish to cut them, it is necessary that the sick person shave their head. Then rub the area with a rough cloth, so that the arteries appear. Then let the sick person tighten their neck with any cloth they have. Then consider where the vein beats. And the places of both are the places that are depressed behind the ears: and rarely is it hidden, except in some people.
Then mark with ink on each: and cut each with a scalpel carefully on both sides, the incision reaching the bone: and let it be done across the width of the head.
And if you wish, insert the scalpel under the artery, and cut it upwards with the incision.
And let the length of the incision be like two joined fingers.
For when the vein is cut, blood flows out with a pulsating discharge, which leaps to the interior with frequent jumps.
If however the artery does not appear to the senses, then it is necessary that you measure from the ear the amount of space of three fingers. Then mark with ink, and cut until you reach the bone.
And that which it is necessary to emit of blood, is six ounces, and perhaps you emit from it more, or less. All of that according to the amount which appears to you from the strength of the sick person and the fullness of his artery.
Then consider the wound. Then if anything remains on the bone from the sifac, then cut it, so that a hot abscess does not occur: then bind the wound with strips of linen cloth.
Then treat it with ointment, until it is healed.
Concerning the extraction of arteries, which are in the temples.
Chapter III.
When a man suffers from chronic hemicrania, or acute catarrhs due to acrid humors, and heat in the temporal muscles, or a severe, chronic throbbing, and similar afflictions: and is treated with the methods of medical care, but it does not help: then we are skilled in these illnesses for the extraction of arteries from the temples, or their cauterization, as we have described.
And the method of operation in extracting them is, that the weak man should shave the hairs that are on the temples, and aim at the artery apparent in the temple. For it indeed shows itself to you by its pulse, and rarely hides itself except in a few people, or by intense cold.
If it hides itself from you, then the weak man shall bind his head with any cloth of his: then rub the place with a rough cloth. Or steam the place with warm water, until it appears to you by a clear appearance. Then take the spatula, which I formed a little before. Then scrape the skin with it easily, until you reach the artery. Then insert a hook into it, and pull it upwards, until you pull it out of the skin, and make it escape from the layers beneath it on every side.
If however the artery is slender: then wrap it with the tip of the hook. Then cut a portion from it according to the amount by which its ends will lengthen and contract, and so that no blood flow occurs. For if it is not cut, and if it is not severed, the blood will not ascend completely.
Then evacuate from the blood six ounces, down to three.
If the artery is large: then it is necessary to tie it in two places with a strong, double thread, of silk or of albohod cords, so that putrefaction does not quickly occur at the wound before its consolidation, and that blood flow does not occur.
Then cut away the excess that is between the two ligatures. Do that at that hour, or after another hour.
And if you wish, cauterize it with a cautery, up to the bone, with a knife cautery, until its ends are cut, and it will stand in place of the same work.
And it is a better work, unless the weak person has a fever, or is of a hot temperament. Because cautery is from among those things that help in ending moistnesses. Therefore it is a better help.
And after the extraction of the arteries, the place must be filled with old cotton, and well-made cushions placed upon it.
And after the solution, treat it with dry medicines that cause flesh to grow, and with bandages, until it is healed.
If meanwhile, during your work, a flow of blood from an artery occurs, then hasten to cut it off with a cautery, or to fill the place with zegi: and bind your hand tightly, until the blood is cut off. If none of those are present for you, then place your finger on the place, until the blood congeals. And apply the place with water of extreme cold, until the sharpness subsides, and it is bound as necessary.
And because what is lighter and easier to extract than an artery, is, to cauterize a vein with this cautery having two blades: and let the sharpness of the two blades be similar to an almond. However, they are much less sharp than two blades. Because if they are sharp, like two blades, the cold hurries both: and they do not cut the flesh with speed. Therefore, since there is some thickness in them, the heat of the fire is held in them, and the flesh is cut quickly: with this therefore the work is better than any other work, and lighter, and easier.
And this is the form of cautery.
And let the space between the two blades be the thickness of a finger, after you mark two places with ink: and lay both very hot until they reach the bone, and cut the vein in two places, so that what is between its extremities is lengthened. For they do not heal completely with this cautery.
Chapter IV.
Concerning the treatment of acute and persistent running of tears from the eyes.
When tears are persistent, and their flow is from veins that are on the outer surface of the head's skull; and no medicinal treatment with medications helps them, and you see the patient's face already red, and he feels a crawling sensation on his forehead, like the crawling of ants; and his eyes are weakened, moist, so that their hairs are already corroded with corrosion; and his eyelids are inflamed from the intensity of the tears: then the ancients needed this operation in their treatment, and they named that treatment, with the Knife.
And it is, that you should instruct the patient to shave the hairs that are on his forehead. Then make three equally spaced incisions along the length of the forehead; and let the length of each incision be about two fingers; and one incision should be equidistant from the length of the nose in the middle of the forehead, and the second slightly offset from the movement of the temples, and the third on the other side; and beware of cutting the arteries that are on both sides; and keep your hand away from the junction of the two jawbones, and let the space of each incision be the length of three fingers joined together; and have a piece of sponge prepared, or many dry cloths, with which you dry the blood.
Then introduce a probe with two sharp ends, whose following form is this. From the incision that is on the temple side, up to the second incision; and scrape with it all the skin that is between the two incisions, with the sifac, which is over the bone. Then do that also from the middle incision up to the second incision. Then remove this probe, and introduce into the first incision again another instrument, called a sharp knife, smooth on one side, not sharp on the other side. And this is its form.
And place its sharp side towards the flesh attached with the skin, and its smooth side towards the bone: and push it, until it reaches the middle fissure: and cut with it all the vessels, which descend from the head to the eyes: except that the incision continues up to that which appears of the skin.
Then do that in the middle fissure up to the other fissure.
And after an equal quantity of blood runs out, express the places from the clots of congealed blood.
Then place in every fissure a lint of old linen, and place on top of them pads soaked in wine, or oil, or vinegar. And see that a hot abscess does not occur.
And on the third day loosen the bandage, and administer much infusion with lukewarm water. Then treat it with basilicon ointment, and the other things with which wounds are treated: until it is healed.
Chapter V.
Concerning the treatment of acute tears and catarrhs to the eyes from the interior of the head.
When acute, sharp, persistent catarrhs befall someone, and you see his eyes weakened, small, and their appearance already impaired; and the eyelids ulcerated, and the hairs fall from them, and there is sharp, piercing pain deep within the head, accompanied by sneezing; then, from these occurrences, understand that these matters, and the catarrhs, do not arise except from many veins.
And the better treatment in them is this. And it is to command the sick person to shave his forehead. Then, make one incision in the middle of his forehead, or a little further along the breadth, and begin with the incision from the left temple to the right temple; and let the incision reach the bone; and move your hand away from the temple muscles, which move during mastication, until the bone is exposed; and you will dry up all the blood with a sponge.
Then separate the two lips of the incision with old cloth, or with flax strips. Then bind it above with pledgets; and soak the pledgets with wine and oil, so that a hot abscess may not occur.
And when you loosen it, and see that the hot abscess is already lessening, then it is necessary to rub the bone until flesh begins to grow on it.
Then treat it with a drying regimen that causes flesh to grow; as if you take two parts of wheat flour, and four parts of rosin; and prepare a plaster from them, and apply it to the growth of flesh in these wounds.
Chapter VI.
Concerning the treatment of that which falls into the Ear.
Whatever falls into the ear is one of four kinds: either a mineral stone, or something like a stone, such as iron and glass; or it is from a plant, such as a chickpea and bean; or it is a liquid substance, such as water, vinegar, and similar things; or some animal.
Therefore, when a stone, or a kind of stone, from those which do not adhere to, nor grow in, the ear, falls into the ear, expose the ear to the sun. If you then see the stone, then instill into the ear something of violet oil, or sesame oil. Then administer its extraction, and make it sneeze with a condiment, and close the nostrils at the time of sneezing, after you place in a circle around the ear scraps of cloth, or wool, and extend the ear upward.
For it often goes out with this treatment.
If however it does not go out, then administer its extraction with tweezers, that is, small pincers: whose form is this.
If therefore it goes out with the tweezers, it is good.
And if not, then administer its extraction with a thin single-hooked instrument of few folds.
If therefore it does not go out through that, then make a tube of bronze, and insert the end of the tube into the ear canal a long way, and fill that which is around the tube with softened wax mixed with oil, so that there is no way for wind except through the tube: then extract it with your wind by strong suction.
For often it goes out with that which we have recounted. If however it does not go out in this way, then take a small amount of birdlime, or glue, that is, prepared glue, with which birds are caught, and place it at the end of a stick after you have wrapped a suitable bit of cloth around it; then insert it into the ear canal with ease, after you have dried the ear from moisture.
If therefore it does not go out with all that we have recounted, then hurry to incision, before a hot abscess or spasm occurs.
And the method of incision is, that a phlebotomist should first open a vein in the head, and extract blood from him according to the measure of his strength. Then make the sick person sit between your hands, and turn his ear upwards, and make a small incision at the root of the ear near his fat in a low place of it; and let the incision be of a crescent shape, until you reach the stone; then remove it with whatever instruments you can.
Then suture the incision quickly, and treat it until it heals.
If the thing falling into the ear is one of the grains that grow and swell, then administer its extraction.
If, however, it does not yield to you for removal, then take a thin, slender spatula, according to this form.
And administer it with the removal of that type of grain that falls into the ear, and do not do it when you think the grain is already moistened by ear vapor, until you put many fragments; then extract them with hooks, or with a fine probe, or with suction, as we have said, for its extraction is made easier.
However, if water enters the ear, it is necessary for the patient to use sneezing, first of all; and already he has filled his ear with some old cotton; and he is lying on the ear in which the water is. If therefore it emerges through that, it is good.
And if not, then take many stones, according to the length of a finger, thin, smooth, and heat them with fire for a short time, and let the patient insert one of them into his ear's opening; and let him jump on one foot from that side, and strike with another stone on the stone that is in the ear. Therefore, he should not cease doing that with stone and stone until all the water emerges.
And now the water emerges in such a way that you take one from papyrus, or from reed, and insert one end of it into the ear; and ignite the other end with fire until most of it is burned. Then again another reed, and do that many times, until all the water emerges; and extract it with a cannula according to what was previously stated about the stone.
In extracting an animal that has entered it, if it is of small body, such as a flea, and similar to it, treat it as I said in the division.
But if it is of large body, which is apparent to the senses, then administer its extraction with forceps and hooks; and its removal is easier than all things that are held in the ear.
In extracting a worm that has been generated in the ear, when you treat it with what we said in the division, and in the treatise on distillations, and your treatment does not help: then it is necessary that you examine the ear in the sun. If therefore anything of the worms appears there, then extract it with forceps, or with fine hooks.
If however nothing appears there, then take a cannula, which has this form, narrow at the bottom, wide at the top; and introduce the narrow end into the ear according to the amount that the patient tolerates it; then suck with it by strong suction. Do this repeatedly, until all the worms come out.
If however they do not yield to you for removal, then coat the circumference of the cannula with wax, as I said in the stone [section].
If they do not come out with what we have said, then administer the distillations which the ancients have already experienced in killing worms, and you will find it in the treatise on distillations.
And let your pouring of oils and medicines into the ear be with this instrument, whose form is depicted here. As you see, make it itself from silver, or bronze, narrowed at the bottom, in which there is a small hole, wide above.
Let therefore the impelling part that is in the concavity of the cannula be made of bronze properly. And if you wish, take a ray, and wrap linen around its extremity with a suitable wrapping; then pour oil, or juice, or whatever medicine you wish from these into the cannula; and let it be in the ear; then insert the ray with the linen from above, and squeeze it with your hand with moderate pressure, until the oil is driven into the cavity of the ear, and the sick person feels it inwardly; and that which is poured into the ear should be warmed with fire for a short time, and beware lest the substance being distilled into it be very cold, for medicines do not tolerate that.
Chapter VII.
Concerning the treatment of sudden ear blockage.
Sometimes infants emerge from their mothers' wombs unperforated.
And sometimes blockage in the ear canal occurs in people due to a wound, or a growth of flesh in it.
And this blockage sometimes occurs deep within the ear cavity, and is not accompanied by visual signs; and sometimes it occurs close to the exterior of the cavity, and is accompanied by visual signs.
Therefore, that which occurs deep within the ear, and is not perceived by sight, is in most cases difficult to cure.
And in that which is accompanied by sight, it is necessary to place the patient's ear in the sun, and observe it; then, if you see an apparent blockage, open it with a thin spatula, the form of which is as follows: its end should have a small width, with one part being pointed; and the rest of the spatula should be of two smooth sides, so as not to injure the ear.
If therefore the blockage is from flesh grown in the ear canal, then grasp it with a fine hook and cut it away with considerable ease until all the flesh is removed.
If the blockage is deep within the ear, then take a thin, smooth rod, and warm it briefly with fire; then insert it into the ear canal.
If therefore you sense a blockage with the patient experiencing impaired hearing, attempt to open it with care, and be careful not to injure the ear nerves.
Then apply a bandage to the ear, according to the size of the opening you have created, wrapped in Egyptian ointment; do this for several days until you are certain of the wound's healing.
Or take a bandage and dip it in rose water, and sprinkle crushed zegi powder on it, and use it.
If you see that the ear has already become suppurating, then it is necessary to remove the bandage, and apply another bandage wrapped in a cloth made with rose oil, until the suppurating heat subsides; then treat it until it heals.
If, however, a flow of blood occurs, then immerse a sponge or cloth in cold water and place it on the ear; and use the remaining treatment, which stops the flow of blood described in the treatise on distillations.
Concerning the treatment of the eyelids.
Chapter VIII.
These inflammations that occur in the eyelids are sometimes moist and sometimes dry.
Therefore, you must grasp them with forceps or with a hook, and cut them with a scalpel from their roots. Then place powdered lead over the affected area.
If blood flows from them, then cauterize them with a fine, lens-shaped cautery.
And to cauterize them is better after incision. For they often return when something remains from their roots. And when they are cauterized with fire, those roots are burned, and they do not return.
Concerning the treatment of granulations of the eyelids of the eye.
Chapter IX.
Often something occurs in the eyelids that is similar to granulation in its strength and hardness, and on account of this it is called Granulation: and it is an aggregation of thick moisture in the upper eyelid and the lower eyelid.
Therefore the operation on them is that you should consider, then, if it is a granulation growing on that which appears on the eyelid, and it moves to every part, and its condition is easy.
Therefore make a slit over it by its width. Then scrape it away from every part with ease, until it is gone. Then suspend it with a hook and cut it off.
If however its excision is not prepared for you, unless after you pierce the eyelid with a small incision, then that harms the sick person in some way.
If however the slit is large, then gather it with stitches and care for it until it is healed.
And if it is small, no harm will come to you from it. For ointment restores it and causes it to flesh over.
And if the granulation is sloping towards the inner surface of the ear, then invert the eyelid, and suspend the granulation with a hook; besides which you need an incision, and press it from every side.
If the eyelid is extended by an incision, that will not harm it in any way.
Then wash the eye after the incision of the granulation with salt water, and treat the place with that which causes it to flesh over, until the sick person is healed.
Concerning the treatment of Axirnath of the eyelids.
Chapter X.
Axirnath is a fat that is generated in the tissues of the upper eyelid; it most often occurs in children. It burdens their eyes, and they suffer catarrhs in the mornings, and cannot look at the sunlight, because tears flow to them, and because of this you see them lying on their faces constantly, and they sleep on them. Their eyelids are damp under their eyebrows, which have now been covered with swelling.  The prominence of the Axirnath is visible to the eye, and when you press the area with your fingers, you feel the Axirnath between them.
And the method of its operation is that the sick person should place their head in your bosom.
Then take a linen cloth and prepare strings on it, and make a circle from that string according to the amount that contains the Axirnath on all sides. Then place it on that, and press it with your fingers on all sides, so that the Axirnath is collected in the middle of the circle.
Then find in the middle of that moisture, with a lancet, the fissures along its width, and let not the fissure be greater than that which is made in phlebotomy in depth.
Or it is necessary that you pierce the whole skin, until you reach the Axirnath, for in many dispositions the Axirnath proceeds from the fissure according to the shape of a white fatty fragment.
Therefore extract it with the cloth, which you have inserted between your fingers on the outside: and you turn your hand to the right and left, until it is dispersed; and beware, lest you add to the fissure, so that you do not reach the eye with the lancet and injure it.
If however the Axirnath does not appear to you at the beginning of the fissure, you shall add a little to the fissure with ease, until the Axirnath proceeds. Then extract it, as we have said.
Then immerse the cloths in vinegar and water, and place them upon the place, and bind it with bandages.
And there are men who grind salt and place it in the concavity of the fissure, so that what remains of that moisture liquefies.
Then treat it until it is healed.
If however a hot abscess occurs in the place, then treat it with soothing plasters until it is healed.
Concerning the methods for Ataxmir of the eye, that is, when the eyelid of the eye softens, whence it comes about that it wrinkles as it should not.
Chapter XI.
When superfluous hairs grow in the eyelids, beyond the natural hairs, and increase in number: then they harm the eye, and cause various illnesses such as constant weeping, and softening of the eyelids, and white discoloration, until it becomes the cause of the destruction of the eye.
And indeed Ataxmir of the eye is treated according to four methods. Or by cautery with fire. Or with a sharp medicine, according to what has been stated in the chapter on cautery. Or Ataxmir is treated by incision and suture. Or by tubes, according to what I will say.
You should place the patient's head in your bosom. Then turn the eyelid of the eye with your left hand.
If therefore it turns, it is good. And if not: insert a needle into it, on which there is thread from the lower part of the eyelid, and make the needle with the thread penetrate from above, and let it be near the hairs themselves, that is, near the edge of the eyelid where the hairs grow; and pull the thread upward with the eyelid, and turn it with a rod.
Then find in the inner part of the eyelid under the added hairs with a spatula sliding from the larger tear duct to the smaller tear duct.
Then pull out the thread, and place a small cushion of cotton, or cloth, under the eyelid; then mark on the eyelid with ink, that be like the shape of a myrtle leaf.
However, it is necessary that the shape be according to the size and elevation of the eyelid; for it is already diversified in humans.
For among them are those who need a large amount to be cut from the eyelid, according to the amount that softens from the eyelid.
Then with a spatula, find above the two lines you have marked, and begin from the larger tear duct to the smaller tear duct, and let the incision be one near the natural hairs, like the thickness of a ray.
Then insert the hook into one of the two angles of the skin. Then scrape off the entire thing. Then bring together the two edges of the wound with a needle and fine wool thread; and wipe away the blood, and make any excess thread adhere to the eyebrows with some kind of adhesive, if you wish to do so; and if not, do not worry.
Then leave the suture and threads until three or four days; afterward, treat it.
And if you wish, leave the wound without sutures, and treat it with something that dries and contracts it. For the eyelid is raised at the sealing and joining of the wound, but will be better.
The ancients taught this method of treatment.
However, there is care for the sick person in it, and it is from good operation, and there is no fear in it.
And another method is in Ataxmir also: and it is, that you mark on the eyelid a shape, which is like the shape of a myrtle leaf, as we have narrated.
Then raise the eyelid with three separate hooks, or joined together, according to this following shape, then cut what is superfluous with small scissors, according to this shape, with equal incision.
If however it is not possible for you to hold the hook, and it is not equal: then take a needle on which there is thread, and insert it in the middle of the shape; and insert another thread near the larger tear duct, and a second thread near the smaller tear duct; and gather the threads between your fingers with equality.
Then raise your hand with equal elevation; and raise the skin over which the cotum is marked, as we have narrated.
Then bring together the two lips of the wound with suture, and treat it until it heals.
If, however, an abscess occurs at your incision, or your fissure: soothe that abscess with caerot, and similar things, from soothing ointments.
And sometimes it happens to the eyelid, even that its hairs are turned.
Therefore, it is necessary that you use in it what we said about the incision: but suture is more artificial in both. Concerning the treatment of Ataxmir with reeds.
And it is, that you turn the eyelid, and cut the fissure that is within, according to what I have described. Then skillfully make two reeds, or two thin pieces of wood, whose length is according to the length of the eyelid, and their width is less than the width of the spatula; and you have already incised at the ends of each on both sides where you hold the threads.
Then carefully place each one upon that which is left over from the eyelid of the eye, and tightly bind the two reeds on both sides with a strong ligature, and leave it for a number of days. For the tightened skin will die, and turn black, and rot, until it falls off by itself.
If it is delayed, then cut it with scissors. Then care for it until it heals.
When it is consolidated, the eyelid will be lifted: and the hairs will not prick.
And this is the form of two canes, which you will make according to this figure, and quantity in length and width.
Chapter XII.
Concerning the lifting of pricking hairs in the eye with a needle.
The operation in this is that you take a thin needle, and introduce into it a fine, smooth silk thread. Then tie its ends, and each end with a very small knot: and let the length of the threads be one palm.
Then place a separate fine thread underneath it in the Alinxotati, and tie its ends if you wish.
Then let the sick person place their head in your lap, and be close to the sun so that the operation is clear, because it is a subtle or minute operation.
Then introduce the needle with the alinxotati into the root of the eyelid, and make it penetrate the eyelid quickly until you pull it out above the natural hair.
Then pull the hair out above the alinxotati, and insert that hair into the alinxotati; if it is one, or two, or three, not more.
Then draw your hand with it until the hair, along with the alinxotati, emerges from the eyelid with the natural hair.
However, if the alinxotati is pulled out and the hair does not emerge with it, you will pull the alinxotati downwards, with the thread which you have placed in it, until the alinxotati emerges from the upper opening, and you see it with the eye's vision.  Then you will pull the alinxotati and the thread, and remove both, and close the eye, and leave it closed for two days or three, until the hair adheres to its place, and flesh grows over it.
If the hair is short, then either associate a long hair from the natural hairs with it, and lift it with it, or leave it until it lengthens after a period, and then lift it.
Chapter XIII.
When this Alxatrati happens to the eye, it is called Leporina.
And this Alxatrati is either natural or accidental.
Accidental therefore it is made from the consolidation of a wound, or a section, or cautery, and things similar to those.
And the method of treatment in it is, that you find that consolidation, and that you separate its lips, and place in what is between them a linen bandage, and tie it, until it heals.
And it is not necessary that you use in its treatment things that dry and constrict: for if you do that, the Alxatrati returns worse than it was: indeed, use in it things that soften, such as mallow: and embrocate with water, in which cooked is marshmallow, flaxseed: and with dyaquilon ointment, which is liquefied with some of the oils: and wrap with it a linen bandage, and treat with it.
And the treasure of your treatment is, that you strive with all your ingenuity, that it does not consolidate, according to the form which was at first.
And this indeed operation which we have said, is not except a certain rectification of Alxatrati, that the form of the place does not return according to what it was entirely.
Concerning the treatment of Alxatrati which is done on the lower eyelid, and is a wrinkling or contraction upwards to the right and left.
Chapter XIV.
This Alxatrati, which occurs lower down, is that which is truly called Alxatrati. And it is natural, and it is accidental.
And the accidental kind results from a wound, or a fissure, or a cautery, and things similar to those.
And the method of operation in it is that you should take a needle, in which there is double thread, and dip it into the flesh, and make it penetrate from the left tear duct to the right tear duct, until the thread reaches the two extremities of the flesh.
Then extend the flesh upwards with the needle, and cut it with a broad spatula. If therefore the shape of the eyelid returns as it should, it is good.
And if not, take a probe, and place it in the fissure, and turn the eyelid with it: and split two fissures on the inner side of the eyelid, and let the ends of the two fissures be from the two angles of the incision, until they meet and a corner is made from them: until when they are gathered together their shape becomes this figure, and is the Greek letter lambda.
Then remove that flesh by the amount that is its sharp lower side, from that which follows the eyelid. Then bring together the separated parts; sew it with a thread of wool.
Then treat them with what we said, of softening medicines, and bandages, until they are healed.
And if a laceration occurs from a fissure, and suture, or cautery: then it is necessary that you split a flat fissure under the hairs of the eyelids, even according to what preceded. Then separate between the two lips with a bandage, according to what we said.
And the sum of the discourse on the treatment of Alxatrati, when it is above or below, is that the operation should proceed according to the preparation of the form of the Alxatrati.
For it itself has many varieties in form, and a prudent craftsman prepares the remedy in whatever way possible for it, until it returns the figure to the natural form, or near it, and the patient himself, according to what is suitable to him from the operation and instruments in many arrangements.
Chapter XV.
Concerning the adhesion of the eyelid to the conjunctiva, or cornea.
Sometimes this consolidation occurs in many people, so that the upper eyelid consolidates with the white of the eye and prevents it from its natural operations.
Therefore, you should insert the tip of the probe under the eyelid and lift it upwards; or extend it with a hook; then, cut the adhesion with a fine spatula, which should not have the sharpness of other spatulas, but be somewhat blunt, so that the patient is not disturbed during the operation, and the spatula is removed, and does not injure the eye with its sharpness.  Your incision should be such that you scrape off the adhesion easily, until the eyelid returns to its natural form, and the entire adhesion is healed.
Then, pour salty water into the eye, washing it with water; or distill into it from a sieve, a solution of ziniar in water.
Then, separate the eyelid and the eye with linen thread; and place over the eye wool soaked with egg white; and after three days, use the sieve and consolidants, until it is healed.
Concerning the incision of the toenail and the prominence of the tear-producing flesh.
Chapter XVI.
Know that the toenail is according to two ways. Or it is nervous: and it is similar to hard, fine sifac. Or it is not nervous, similar to frozen white moisture: which when it touches iron, or you try to grasp it with a hook, it is severed, and the hook does not stick to it.
And both species do not begin, unless from the larger tear duct, until it goes gradually, until it covers the sight, and obstructs the light, and the movement of the eye.
And the method of operating on it is: that the sick person should place his head in your lap. Then open his eyes, and raise the eyelid with your hand. Then collect the nail with a hook of few folds, and extend it upwards. Then take a needle, and insert into it a hair from a horse's hair, or an ox's, or a cow's: and let the thread be strong, and double the end of the needle a little, and fix it in the middle of the nail: and pierce it with the needle, and tie the nail with the thread, and extend it upwards: and scrape with the hair the side of the nail which follows the pupil, as if you were sawing it with the hair up to its end.
Then cut the remainder at the root of the tear duct with a thin spatula, or with small scissors: and leave the natural tear duct tissue so that a constant flow of tears does not occur from its incision.
And sometimes the nail is extended with only a hook, or with a thread, as we have said. Then it is scraped with a gentle spatula, of which this is the shape.
And be careful that the spatula does not touch the horny coat, and that a rupture occurs in it, and the pupil is pierced.
Then, after the incision, place some crushed salt, or a preparation made from ziniar, in the eye, and leave it until the next day. Then treat it with whatever is appropriate, until it is healed.
If the nail is not nervous and you cannot insert a needle into it, nor is a hook fixed in it, then this type of nail is often treated with medicines and heals as I have described in the division.
If you wish to cut it, then open the sick person's eye, and take a thin, gentle, weak-pointed spatula, according to this form. And scrape the nail from above with care. If you see that it thins and breaks, and the scraping has imprinted on it, then distil from your hour into the eye a sieve made from ziniar, or from a red sieve, or ground salt; and bandage the eye until the next day.
Then repeat the operation on it until the whole of it is removed. Unless there is a hot abscess in the eye; for then leave it alone, and treat the abscess until it heals.
Then repeat the operation on it with the scraping, until it heals.
If, however, the fleshy prominence of the tear duct causes a great injury to the eye, it should be suspended by a hook and a portion of it incised; and do not complete the incision, so that the flow of tears is not interrupted.
Then instill into the tear duct a red dye, or one made from ziniari, until it heals.
Concerning the incision of Alguardenic and the flesh grown in the eye.
Chapter XVII.
Sometimes in some people's eyes, a reddish flesh grows, either compounded or superimposed, until it covers the pupil, or approaches it, or presses against the eyelids, and perhaps turns the eyelids outward, and resembles a rose-hip.
And the treatment in it is also that the infirm person should place his head in your lap. Then open his eyes, and gather all that flesh with suitable hooks for it: and hold it with one forceps, or tweezers.
Then cut into the flesh first, until all of it is finished with a scalpel. And be careful of the eye, so that you do not injure it during the operation: and let your incision, with which you cut it, be either with a scalpel, or with a spatula, as we described in the incision of a hoof; or with small shears, with which a scab is gathered, as its form will appear after this chapter.
When therefore your incision is complete, and the whole of the alghardenici is removed, then fill the eye with crushed salt, or distill into it a red powder, and similar corrosives from medicines: and place over the eye externally a poultice of white of egg, so that it is protected from a hot abscess.
If anything of the alguardenici remains, and hot blood dominates you, and you fear a hot abscess, then leave the eye and treat it with that which calms the abscess.
Then repeat the operation on it again until it is healed.
And similarly do with the added flesh that occurs in the eye of this type.
However, it is necessary that you avoid the treatment of any weak eye by a natural or accidental way, by operating with iron, and do not put your hand in any of these operations, until you see that the limb is tolerant of that operation.
Concerning the collection of Sebel from the eye.
Chapter XVIII.
Sebel are red veins that are woven over the eye, and hinder the eye's function of sight; and they weaken the eye with the length of days.
Therefore, it is necessary for you first to consider whether the eye in which the Sebel is present is strong and has no illness other than the Sebel; then collect the Sebel from it.
And it is that you should instruct the ill person to place their head in your lap.
Then suspend those veins with one hook, or two according to your judgment; and let the hook be a thin, double hook, according to this form, or let there be two hooks graded into one body, according to this form.
Then collect those veins with fine scissors with care, and wipe away the blood hour after hour, until you see those veins removed from the eye and they are dissolved; and beware that you do not injure the eye with the tips of the forceps.
And let your operation be in the midday sun, and be very firm in your operation, so that you do not cut anything but those veins.
And when you have finished, then instill into the eye either green or red sief, so that its sharpness corrodes what remains of the sebile.
If, however, it is not possible for you to collect it all in that hour, then plaster the eye with that which soothes the pain of the eye; and leave it for several days until its pain subsides; and protect it from a hot abscess; then repeat over it according to the same method until it is healed.
And this is the shape of the forceps.
On the reduction of a displaced nasal bone.
Chapter XIX.
Physicians call this a fistula, which you treat with a cautery, or with a burning, sharp medicine, according to the preceding account of it.
And if it does not heal, then there is no skill in it: unless you pierce above the abscess at its origin, and extract all the moisture and pus within it until the bone is exposed.
When the bone is exposed, and you see corruption or blackness upon it, then scrape it with an instrument of this form.
And it is called a "rough head" instrument.
Let it be made of tempered iron, and its head be round like a ring, pointed with a file's point, or with a fine-pointed aliskilfer's point: and place it upon the corrupted area of the bone.
Then rotate it between your fingers, and press your hand a little while, until you know that the corruption has been scraped away: and do this several times.
Then restore the place with drying, astringent medicines.
If therefore the place is consolidated, and flesh grows there, and the course of pus is cut off; and it remains for forty days, and is not renewed, and does not become suppurated, and no accident occurs in it, then you know that it is now healed.
And if not, then there is no skill in it, except to return the fistula to the nostril's opening, according to this form.
And it is, that you detect the second bone with iron, or with a sharp medicine; and when the bone is detected, then take a drill according to this form, let its iron end be triangular; and its wood be a pyramid tapering to the end, as you see.
Then place it upon the bone itself: and let it be near the tear duct: and move your hand slightly away from the eye. Then turn your hand with the drill, until it penetrates the bone, and the sick person feels it; by this that he finds air coming out of it, when he holds his hand over his nose.
Therefore then restore the place with astringent drying medicines, as I taught you.
When therefore flesh is born, and the place hardens, then the matter that was discharged to the outside returns to the nose; it is therefore lighter upon the sick person.
On the reduction of the prominence of the Eye.
Chapter XX.
When the eye protrudes completely, and no harm or diminution occurs in vision, then you should release the patient; then bleed him; afterward apply cupping to the neck without scarification, but with suction.
Then apply a liniment to the eye made from acacia, aloe, olibanum, and sarcocolla. Then bind the eye from above with a plaster containing many powders.
And the method of the powders is: that you take soft cloths, many, and each cloth should be doubled over four times; make many of them; then place them one on top of the other, according to the amount needed by the eye; then bind them with a firm binding of hard cloth.
And again apply cupping with suction without scarification.
Then remove the cupping vessels, and leave the eye bound day and night.
However, if the bandage softens again, then it should be bound tightly; then remove the bandage after one day and night, as we said.
If therefore you see the eye has now returned to its tunic, it is good; and if not, then apply again the plaster, and powders, and bandage, and cupping, until it is healed.
Concerning the incision of the uvea tunic.
Chapter XXI.
When a rupture occurs in the uvea tunic, then it protrudes and proceeds outside the eyelids like a uvea grain, and it disfigures the human form because of it, and the desire is to incise it.  Then the operation on it is as I describe: insert a needle into the root of the uvea from the lower to the upper part.
Then insert another needle, on which is a doubled thread, from the tear duct side, and have it penetrate; and leave the first needle in its position.
Then, cut the location of the doubled thread, and tie the part of the uvea around the needle with it; and tighten it greatly.
Then pull out the needle, and place on the eye wool steeped in the white of an egg; and leave it until the thread with the uvea falls away.
Then treat the eye with that which strengthens it, until the wound is healed.
And sometimes the uvea is tightened from every side with a circle of cloth, until the eye gains great prominence.
Then it is pierced with a fine spatula, which reaches the depth of the eye, and the white moisture flows out, and the eye sinks, and immediately enters: then tighten it until it is healed.
Concerning the treatment of Alcomnat.
Chapter XXII.
This illness, called Alcomnat, is nothing but pus that collects in the eye, similar to descending water, and is not the eye itself.
And the method of operation in it is to make the sick person sit on a prepared seat, or upright.
Then take hold of its head with your hands at two points, and move it until you see the pus descend to your eyes. Then it is stopped and does not descend, and the light is cleared: and the sick person sees things as they saw them: and if it did not descend further, know that it is water.
If, however, the descent of the pus is not prepared with what we have said, then make the sick person sit between your hands. Then take a sharp spatula, and with it cut through the corneal membrane a little at the juncture of the conjunctiva and the cornea, at the limbus, until pus emerges.
When it emerges, then instill into the eye warm water in which you mixed honey; or water in which you have already boiled fenugreek and honey; then treat with the remaining treatment until it is healed.
Concerning the treatment of water descending in the eye, or cataract.
Chapter XXIII.
We have already discussed the species of water in the division, and what is suitable for piercing, the speaker explaining and exhibiting it; then take that same thing according to health.
Then it is necessary that you make the infirm person sit between your hands, square, opposite the light, near the sun; and bind his healthy eye, and bind it tightly; then, with your right hand, the eyelid of the eye in which the water is, if the eye in which the water is, is the left eye; or with your left hand, if the eye is the right one.
Then take with your right hand an almagda, if the eye is the left one; or with your left hand, if the eye is the right one.
Then place the tip of the almagda near the crown, through the thickness of a ray, on the apparent white of the lesser tear duct; then push the almagda with force, and you will revolve your hand with it, until it penetrates the white of the eye; and you will feel that the almagda has now reached the empty thing.
And it is necessary that the measure of the almagda's journey to the depth be the measure of the space that is from the pupil to the end of the blackness; and it is the crown of the eye. For you will see it in the very pupil of the eye's vision, because of the clarity of the cornea.
Then place the almagda up to the place where the water is. Then press it downwards, one time after another.
If, therefore, the water descends immediately, then the sick person sees that above which he opens his sight immediately, and the almagda in his eye.
Then rest a little. If therefore the water descends, then put it down secondly, except that the almagda emerges.
When, therefore, it is fixed, and does not ascend, then extract the almagda with ease, and you turn your hand gradually.
Then dissolve some of the clear gem salt in water, and wash the inside of the eye with it. Then place over the eye a whole piece of lint, or wool soaked in rose oil and egg white, and bind the healthy eye with it.
We, however, and those of our time, place on it crushed cumin with egg white.
If, however, the almagda does not obey you in entering the eye because of its hardness, since it is from men whose eye is very hard, then it is necessary that you take a spatula, which is called Alberid, of which this is the form.
Therefore, with it, scrape only the conjunctiva, and do not put your hand into the hole; and it is only so that you make a subtle passage to the almagda's place.
Then introduce the almagda, as we have said.
And at the completion of your work, prepare for the sick person a properly made bedchamber, in which he sleeps on his back in a dark house: and let him be prohibited from all movement, and from coughing: and place his food that which soothes his nature: and do not let him move his head to the right, nor to the left at all.
And let the bandage be according to its disposition until the third day.
Then remove it in that dark house, and test his sight; and make him see things. Then replace the bandage until the seventh day.
And it is not fitting that he do this at the hour of treatment, or immediately after the incision; rather, it is necessary to avoid it, because water ascends quickly through the vehemence of vision.
However, if a hot abscess occurs, then it is necessary to remove the eye before the seventh day, and treat it with that which calms the abscess until it is calmed; then resolve its sight, and place on his face an oral thing with which to regulate his sight under those days, him existing in that dark house.
Then let him emerge from the house gradually, and let him move about in his homes.
And know that in a zaltya, a student is not excused from sight sometimes; then, indeed, let him dare upon the operation.
And now indeed there has come to us someone from those who are of Alayrach, who said that there was made in Alayrach a perforated magdan, by which water is drawn.
However, therefore, I have not seen anyone in your land who has done that; nor have I read it in any of the books of the ancients; and it is possible that it is new.
And these are the forms of the species from the magdan, so that he who is ignorant of them may stand upon it.
Let them be made of proper bronze; and let their extremities be with this same subtlety triangular, and the extremity pointed.
Chapter Twenty-four.
Concerning the treatment of flesh growing in the nose.
Sometimes diverse growths of flesh arise in the nose, some of which resemble a scorpion with many feet; and of these is cancerous, stony flesh, of a dark colour; and of these is that which is soft flesh, not of a dark colour.
In that flesh among these, which is soft, not fraudulent, nor cancerous, you should cause the infirm person to sit between your hands facing the ground, and open their nostrils, and insert a hook into the flesh; then pull it outward, and cut what you have grasped of it with a fine, sharp spatula on one side, until you know that the whole flesh has been removed.
If anything remains of it whose removal is not possible, then scrape it with one of the delicate instruments with ease, until nothing remains of it. However, if blood prevails in you, or a hot abscess occurs, then apply to it what is appropriate; or if it is from malignant abscesses, then hasten to cauterize it, until the blood is cut off, and all the flesh is removed.
Afterwards, vinegar and water, or wine, should be applied to the nose after the incision. If, however, the nose opens, and moisture proceeds from it to the palate, then know that it is now healthy.
If, however, the moisture does not penetrate as it should, then know that within it is flesh grown on the upper bones of the nostril, to which the instrument did not reach with the incision.
Then it is necessary that you insert a linen thread of some thickness, and tie many knots in it; and place a quantity of a finger, or less, between each knot; and let the infirm person, as he can, direct one end of the thread into the nose with a probe, or with whatever is possible for him to do; and pull his smelling-thing until it reaches the abscess and emerges above his throat.
And many times indeed, children in schools do something similar to this; and it is an easy thing for him who wishes to do so.
Then place the two ends of the thread, one end which emerges above the nose, and the other which remains in the nose. Then apply a saw to the flesh with the knots which are on the thread. Do that until you know that the flesh is now together with the knots of the thread.
Then pull out the thread; and put into the nose, after the blood has been cleansed, the linen cloth that you have soaked in Egyptian ointment: do this for three days, or more, until the ointment corrodes all that remains of the flesh.
Then place a lead cannula at the end of the thing in the nose, for a few days, until it is healed.
If however it needs a treatment that will dry it out, use that.
To make a nasal douche, with which oils and other medicines are distilled into the nose, make it of silver, or bronze: let it be similar to a small lamp, open like a seashell: and its passageway likewise.
And if you wish, make it a closed cannula, like a pipe.
And the shell-like instrument for nasal douching should be full and uncovered; and let it have a handle at its rear, with which you hold it when you heat oil in it, or whatever you wish from juices and flowing substances.
Chapter XXV.
Often a wart is born at the end of the nose, and it grows larger and larger with the days until its appearance becomes ugly.
And therefore it is necessary to cauterize it at the beginning of its appearance, and to eradicate all of it. Then place upon the area either a cautery or a burning medicine that takes its place.
If, therefore, its incision is delayed until it grows large, then consider if it is stony, hard, of dark color, and with little sensation: then do not touch it with iron, because it is a cancerous abscess.
For often I have seen that one who incised a man's abscess, and great harm came from it upon the one who had it.
And if the abscess is soft to the touch, not dark in color, and you see that an incision is possible throughout it, then evacuate the infirmity, and incise it without fear, without anxiety: and treat the area with that which dries and constricts it, until it heals.
Chapter XXVI.
Concerning the suture of the nose, lip, and ear.
Know that when a separation of continuity occurs in one of these cartilages, little help is given in it by operation, except in some people.
Therefore, when something of that sort happens to someone, you should consider if it is a recent wound with its own blood: and then bring together the edges of the wound with sutures; then treat it until it heals.
And if the lips of the separation of continuity are already separated, and each part is healthy, then it is necessary to scrape away every part from its apparent skin until it bleeds. Then bring together the two lips with sutures, and tighten them, and powder over it the blood of the dragon, and crushed frankincense; and place upon the powders a piece of diafiniton plaster, and some other of the consolidating plasters; and leave it bound for two or three days. Then loosen it, and change the medicine; and leave it until the threads come apart by themselves. Then treat it with ointment until it heals.
The method of suturing is, that you assemble the separation of continuity, either with needles, as we have narrated in the suturing of the belly; or assemble the separation with thread, as I have made you know.
Chapter XXVII.
Concerning the extraction of knots from the lips.
Many men, indeed, often have hard abscesses in the interiors of their lips, like the grains of herbs: and some of them are smaller, and some larger.
Therefore it is necessary that you turn back the lip, and cut over all its knot, and suspend it with a hook, and cut it from every side.
Then fill the place after the incision with ground zegi, until the blood is cut off.
Then it should be washed with vinegar, and the place where there is astringency should be treated with it, until the wounds are healed.
Chapter XXVIII.
Concerning the incision of fleshy growths on the gum.
Often flesh grows over the gum, which the ancients call a *buluss*.
Therefore, you should suspend it with a hook, or hold it with forceps, and cut it at its root, and allow the pus or blood to run.
Then place on the area ground zegi, or other astringent, drying powders.
If that flesh returns after treatment, for it often does, then cut it a second time and cauterize it; for it will not return after cauterization.
Chapter XXIX.
Concerning the extraction of teeth with iron.
Sometimes rough, foul, and sometimes darkened, yellowish, and greenish, hard masses collect on the surfaces of the teeth from the inner and outer sides, and between the gums, until the corruption reaches the gums and the teeth become unsightly from it.
Therefore, you should have the patient sit between your hands, and his head in your lap, and scrape the molar and tooth, where the hard masses, similar to sand, appear, until nothing remains of them, and similarly, do the same for blackness, greenness, yellowness, and the rest, until they are cleaned.
If, therefore, what is on them is removed at the beginning of the scraping, it is good; and if not, then repeat the scraping on them another, a second, and a third day, until finally you achieve what you want.
And know that a tooth requires scrapers of various shapes, many forms, according to how it is prepared for your operation; for the scraper used to scrape the tooth from below is different from the scraper used to scrape between the teeth, according to other shapes.
And these shapes of scrapers should be prepared by you, which you see.
Chapter 30.
Of the extraction of toothache.
You ought to treat the tooth from its pain with all skill, and be slow in its eradication. For there is nothing that will replace it when it is pulled out, since it is a noble substance; until when there is no excuse for its removal, then it is necessary when the weak person is forced to extract it, to strengthen and to assure you of the aching tooth.
For often the pain deceives the sick person, and he thinks that it is in the tooth itself and pulls it out; then the pain does not recede until the sick person's tooth is pulled out.
For we have already seen that from the operation of phlebotomists.
Therefore, when the aching tooth itself is ascertained by you, then it is necessary to scarify around the tooth with a spatula, in which there is something of virtue, until the gum is loosened on every side; then move it with your fingers, or with delicate forceps at first gradually, until you break it.
Then place large forceps in a good position on it, and the patient's head between your knees: which you have already held firmly, so that it does not move; then pull the tooth straight, so that you do not break it.
If, therefore, it does not come out, then take some of those instruments, and introduce it under it from every side with ease, and attempt its movement, as you did at first.
If, however, the tooth is perforated or decayed, then it is necessary that you fill that hole with cloth; and bind it with the tip of a fine radius, so that it does not break at the time of your constriction upon it with forceps.
And it is necessary to do the scarification around the gum on every side thoroughly.
And maintain your strength so that you do not break it, and a part of it remains, and returns upon the sick person from that evil which is greater pain than his first pain.
And beware, lest you do that which ignorant phlebotomists do in their haste, and their audacity in eradicating it, beyond what we have recounted.
For very often they cause great illnesses in people, which are more difficult to break, and all or some of its roots remain; or to extract it with some of the jaw bones, as we have testified many times.
Then it should be washed after its eradication with wine, or with vinegar and salt.
If a flow of blood occurs from the places (for this often happens), then rub some zegi, and fill the place with it.  And if not, cauterize it if zegi does not help you.
The forms of the fine forceps, with which the tooth is moved first, should have long extremities, a short handle, and be thick, so that they do not double when pressed on the tooth with them.  They should be like those with thick handles, so that when you tighten them, they do not give way nor double.  Their extremities should be short, and they should be made of good iron, or well-made steel, with straight extremities.  And on their extremities should be teeth, some of which enter into others and tighten with a fitting, strong constriction.
And sometimes the extremities are shaped like the beak of a bird called a stork, and have a strong constriction.
Chapter XXXI.
Concerning the eradication of teeth, and the extraction of fractured jawbones.
When, during the extraction of a tooth, some part remains broken, then it is necessary to apply a poultice of butter to the area for one or two days, until the area is softened.  Then insert either algasts or forceps, whose extremities are similar to the beak of a bird called a stork. However, this is the form of the forceps.
Let their extremities be made like a file inside, or like aliskilfegi.
If therefore it does not yield to you for extraction with these forceps, then it is necessary to carefully treat the root, and uncover all the flesh, and insert an instrument called a small lever, whose form is this.
Let it be short of limb, somewhat thick: and let it not be soaked, so that it does not break.
If therefore the root emerges through it, it is good; and if not, it is necessary to assist with other instruments whose forms are these.
The form of the first is triangular in extremity, in which there is a certain thickness.
The form of a triangular, slender extremity.
And with other instruments and tools which preceded in the consideration of the teeth.
Also, let there be an aid with this instrument, which is likened to a large hook, of this form, triangular extremity twisted, in which there is something of thickness, so that it may not break, and let it not be soaked.
And know that there are many instruments for the teeth; and likewise, other instruments are not counted, and a skillful craftsman, subtle in his art, finds for himself the instrument according to the operation and the illnesses themselves that they signify.
Because there are illnesses for which the ancients did not name an instrument, due to the diversity of their species.
If, however, a bone of the jaw, or of other bones of the mouth, breaks or decays: then investigate over it in its place with that which suits it from the instruments and forceps that I have mentioned in the extraction of roots, and aid with a grasper, whose form is this.
Let it have something of thickness gradually, so that the bone is gripped or held with it, and does not flee and move until the bone comes out; and restore the place with medicines suitable for it.
If however there is a small decay in the bone, then scrape it from its decay, and treat it until it is healed.
Chapter XXXII.
Of the sawing of teeth protruding over others.
When teeth protrude not according to their natural course, a foul form is made by it; and especially when this happens in women and girls, namely those who are for sale.
Therefore, it is necessary that you consider. For if a tooth is born after another tooth, and is not placed, or its sawing or filing is not possible, then remove it; and if it is attached to another tooth, then cut it with this instrument, which has this shape.
It is similar to a small beak, and is made from tempered iron, with a very sharp tip.
And let your incision, by which you cut it, be made over many days, and because of the hardness of the tooth, and so that another tooth is not moved.
If however it is prominent and exposed to its filing, then file it with a file made of tempered iron, whose form is this.
Let the whole thing be of tempered iron, and its handle of small, sharp points, like the file with which needles are made.  With which the tooth is filed gradually over many days with ease, so that the tooth is not moved, and does not fall out.  Then, gently, finally, scrape it with certain scrapers.
If a tooth has a broken part that injures the tongue, then it is necessary to file it as well, until the roughness of that fracture is removed and made even; and it is flattened, and does not injure the tongue, nor corrupt speech.
Chapter XXXIII.
Of the retention of teeth with gold wires.
When the anterior teeth suffer concussion and displacement from a blow or fall, and the patient cannot firmly bite down on what they eat lest they fall out, and you have treated them with astringent remedies, and the treatment is not successful, then the solution is to bind them with a gold wire.  For silver turns green and rots after days, but gold is never altered.
And let the wire be of a medium fineness and thickness according to the space between the teeth.
And the method of retention is as follows: take a wire, and pass a double length of it between two healthy teeth; then weave the two ends of the wire between the loose teeth, whether one or more, until you reach with the weave to a healthy tooth on the other side. Then repeat the weaving back to the starting point, and tighten your grip with care and skill until it is completely firm; and let your tightening of the wire be near the roots of the teeth, so that it does not come undone.
Then cut the excess ends of the wire with scissors; and gather both ends and twist them together; and conceal them between the healthy tooth and the loosened tooth, so that they do not injure the tongue; then let it remain thus firmly fastened.
If, however, it comes loose, or is cut, tighten them with another wire, and it will remain firmly in place throughout the whole time.
And this is the method for teeth, and the way of retention for two healthy teeth and two loose teeth, as you see.
And sometimes it happens that one or two teeth return to their places after having fallen out, and are retained as we have described, and remain so; and no one but a skillful, prudent, and experienced craftsman can do this.
And sometimes a piece of bone is fitted: and it is made into the shape of a tooth, and placed in the place from which the tooth is strengthened and fastened, as we said: and it remains, and serves it for a long time.
Chapter Thirty-Four.
Sometimes this ligament which occurs under the tongue is either natural, with which a person is born, or accidental, from a wound which has already healed.
And the operation on it is that you open the mouth of the sick person at his head in your presence, and raise his tongue: then cut that nervous ligament across, until the tongue is freed from its restraint.
If there is something hard and knotted in it, and it is from the healing of a wound, then insert a hook into it, and split it across, until you cut the ligament, and the knot is loosened.
And beware, lest there be a fissure deep in the flesh, and you cut the artery there, and a flow of blood occurs.
Then wash the area of the incision with rose water, or with vinegar, or with cold water.
Then place a linen bandage under the tongue, which the sick person should hold all night: so that it will not heal a second time.
If, however, a flow of blood occurs, then place crushed zegi on the area. If, however, blood overcomes you, then cauterize the area with a lentiginous cautery, which is suitable for it; then treat it with the rest of the treatment, until it heals.
Chapter XXXV.
Sometimes, an abscess occurs under the tongue, resembling a small frog, preventing the tongue from its natural function; and perhaps it grows so large that it fills the mouth.
And the treatment for it is to open the sick person's mouth in the light of day, and examine the abscess.
If therefore you see it of a dark color, or black, hard, and the patient feels no sensation in it, then do not touch it, for it is cancer.
And if it inclines toward whiteness, in which there is moisture, then thrust a hook into it, and cut it with a fine scalpel, and free it from all sides. If blood overcomes you during your operation, then place pounded zegi over it, until the bleeding ceases; then return to your operation, until you extract it with its entirety.
Then wash it with vinegar and salt, and treat it with the appropriate remaining treatment for it, until it is healed.
Concerning the treatment of an abscess of the two tonsils.
Chapter XXXVI.
Sometimes there occur between the throat, that is, the glands which resemble almonds, which occur externally: and they are called the two tonsils. When you treat them with what we said in the division, and they do not heal, then consider.
If therefore it is a hard abscess, of dark color, with little sensation: then do not touch it with iron.
And if it is of red color, and its root is thick: then do not touch it with iron either, fearing a flow of blood, but leave it until it ripens. And then either you will pierce it, or it will rupture by itself.
And if it is white in color, round, and its root is thin: then it is necessary to cut it.
And the operation on it is, that you consider before its operation, if its abscess has quieted and been completely filled, or if it is diminished by some reduction: then therefore make the sick person sit in the sun, and let his head be in your lap: and open his mouth, and let a servant take between his hands, and press his tongue downwards with an instrument, whose shape is this.
Let it be made of silver, or bronze, which is as thin as a knife.
When therefore you press the tongue with it, and the abscess is shown to you, and your sight falls upon it: then take a hook, and fix it in the tonsil, and pull it outwards as much as you can, except that you pull out some of the coverings with it.
Then cut it with an instrument, whose shape follows this. It resembles shears; however, its ends should be curved, so that the opening of each is in a straight line with the other's sharp point: therefore take care that it be made of tempered iron, or of tempered steel.
If however this instrument is not present, then cut it with a spatula, whose shape is this. It should be sharp on one side, not sharp on the other.
And after you have incised one tonsil, cut the other according to this same type of incision.
Then, after the incision, let the sick person gargle with cold water, or with vinegar and water.
If however a flow of blood occurs, let him gargle with water in which the peels of pomegranates have been boiled: or with the leaves of myrtle, and similar astringents, until the flow of blood is stopped: then treat him until he is healed.
And sometimes other abscesses arise in the throat, besides the two tonsils. Therefore, cut those according to what I have said about the incision of the two tonsils equally.
And indeed I have already treated a woman for an abscess which had arisen between her throat, which was drawing towards blackness, and with little feeling, which had almost closed her throat: and the woman breathed through a narrow passage, and I had already forbidden her food and water to drink: and she had already reached death, if it had remained for one day, or two days.
And the abscess had risen so much that it had sent out two branches, until they emerged above the two nostrils.
Therefore, I quickly hastened and fixed a hook into one of them. Then I pulled it, and a large portion came out from it.
Then I cut it off where I grasped it from the nostril.
Then I did the same to that which came out from the other nostril.
Then I opened its mouth, and pressed its tongue; and afterwards I fixed a hook into the abscess; then I cut off a part of it, and only a little blood flowed from it.  Therefore, the woman's throat was healed, and immediately she began to drink water, then she ate food.
Therefore, I did not cease to cut from that abscess many times for a long time, and the abscess succeeded the place I was cutting, until it was excessively prolonged and with it.
Therefore, I devised and cauterized the abscess between the throat.
Therefore, it stood from the addition; then I walked away, and I did not know what God did to it after me.
Concerning the incision of the abscess of the uvula.
Chapter XXXVII.
When the catarrh descends to the uvula, and it becomes abscessed, and is long, then it is called perpendicular; and if it is in the lower part thick, round, then it is called a grape.
When it is treated with what we said in the division, and the treatment does not help; and you see that the hot abscess has calmed down from it, and it is subtle; then it is necessary to cut it.
And what is collected from it round, and does not have length, and is bloody, or of a brown or black colour, and does not have sensation: then it is necessary to avoid its incision. For there is fear upon the sick person in it.
Therefore, when you see it according to the manner which I have said, from its whiteness and length, you should make the sick person sit before the sun; and press his tongue with the instrument, of which the narrative preceded; then fix a hook in the uvula and pull it downwards; and cut it with one of the two instruments that I have mentioned in the incision of the two tonsils.
And it is necessary not to cut from it, except that which is added beyond the natural limit without addition.
For if you cut from it more, you will injure the voice and speech.
Then after the incision, use that which we have narrated in the incision of the two tonsils, and treat it until it is healed.
If, however, the sick person is terrified by the incision, then it is necessary that you use skill in cauterizing it without fear or fright.
And the method of cautery on it is not, except with sharp water; and it is as if you place the head of the sick person in your bosom. Then press his tongue with the instrument we have mentioned. Then take from the water I told you about in the chapter on cauterization, and make with it quicklime that is not extinguished, and place it neither thick nor thin, and fill with it the hollow of this instrument, which has this shape.
Let the concavity in which the medicine is placed be at its extremity, like the concavity of the radius of a spoon.
And place the instrument with the medicine upon the uvula itself; and let the sick person lie upon his side, so that saliva may run from his mouth from the internal medicine, so that nothing descends from it to his throat and harms him.
Then hold your hand with the medicine. And you shall apply it to the uvula for the quantity of half an hour, until you see it already blackened and the biting of the medicine calmed.
And if you wish to take a poultice, and wrap it around the extremity of the radius, and instill the poultice with medicine, and introduce the radius with the poultice into the cannula from above, until the poultice adheres to the uvula.
Do that repeatedly until you achieve what you wish regarding the cauterization of the uvula. Then leave it; for it dries and falls off after three or four days.
If you need to repeat the medicine, repeat it: and after the cauterization, wipe around the uvula with a poultice soaked in butter, and cleanse with it what is around it from the medicine: and rinse with cold water.
And treat externally with embrocations, and internally with gargles, until it is healed.
This method of treatment is therefore more beneficial than incision and further from danger.
And sometimes the uvula is also treated with something finer than a cauterization or incision: for it is treated with fumigation, according to this method. Take calamint, hyssop, oregano, rue, sseah, chamomile, and wormwood, and similar herbs: and gather them all, or some of them, in a pot, and immerse them in vinegar, and boil: and let the pot be lined with good clay: and let there be a hole in the middle of the pot, upon which a concave instrument should be placed according to this method.
Let it be made of silver, or brass: and let the end, on which the pomegranate is, be introduced into the sick person's mouth, until the vapor ascends to the uvula over the cannula, until the uvula is darkened much.
Then repeatedly over it many times, until it dries.
And beware, lest you perform this treatment at the beginning of the arrival of an abscess. For it usually adds to the abscess: and you should not do it except at the decline of its hot stage of the abscess.
If however this instrument is not present for you, then take a cannula, and place a piece of egg shell on its end: so that the sick person's mouth is not burned: because the egg shell prevents the vapor from burning the mouth: and this is from good treatment with health.
Concerning the extraction of thorns and bones from the throat.
Chapter XXXVIII.
Often a bone, or a fishbone, or something else adheres in the throat.
Therefore, it is necessary to extract that which is apparent from them, over which sight falls, after pressing the tongue with an instrument near the sun, and it is declared to you what is in the throat.
And what is not apparent to you and is hidden in the throat, it is necessary that you make the stomach weak before the food is digested in the stomach. For perhaps the attached thing will be expelled by vomiting.
Or let the weak person swallow a piece of turnip, or a lettuce root, or swallow a piece of dry bread; or let him take a piece of soft dry sea sponge: and tie it to a thread, then let him swallow it. When therefore it reaches the place where the spines or bone are, and is extracted, then it emerges.
If therefore it does not emerge with what we have said: then use an instrument of lead according to this form.
Let it be thicker than a radius for a little while, and at its end let there be a curvature, which he should introduce into his throat with ease: and let him have his head raised upwards.
And let him be careful not to touch his epiglottis, so that coughing does not occur to him, and let him push with it the bone or spine, or let the physician introduce it with his hand.
But that which the sick person introduces is better, because of his knowledge of the place of the attached thing: and let him push downwards, or pull his hand with the instrument upwards, the whole of it according to the quantity that is prepared for him, until it emerges.
Concerning the extraction of a leech.
Chapter Thirty-nine.
When a leech is treated with what I said in the division on treatment with medicines, and it does not help, then consider in the throat of the sick person before the sun, or in the sun after you have pressed his tongue with the instrument that I told you about.
If therefore your sight falls upon the leech, extract it with a small hook, or with suitably fine forceps.
If it is not possible with them, then take a concave cannula, and introduce it into the throat of the sick person, nearly to the throat; then introduce into the concavity of the cannula a heated iron with fire. Do this many times; and let the sick person abstain from water all day.
Then let him take a bowl full of cold water, and open his mouth in it; and let him rinse his mouth with it, and not swallow anything from it; and let him move the water one hour after another with his hand. For the leech immediately, when it senses water, falls.
If however it does not emerge with what we have described, then fumigate the sick person with lice, or with asa with the instrument which I have described in the fumigation of the uvula.
Do that many times, because it will fall itself.
And the method of operation in fumigation is, that you take a pot in which there are live prunes with fire; and the pot is covered with a lid, in the middle of which is a hole; and the end of the instrument is placed in that hole.
Then project the fumigation, and let the sick person place his mouth at the end of the cannula, and close his mouth, so that the fumigation does not escape, until you know that the fumigation has already reached the leech. For the leech will fall immediately.
If it does not fall, then repeat the fumigation many times.
And let the sick person endure thirst, and eat salty things, and garlic, and not drink water.
Therefore, it is necessary that it depart with this treatment.
And this is the form of the instrument with which the leech is extracted from the throat, when it falls upon it in sight.
It is similar to forceps, as you see: except that it has this curvature that is inserted into the throat. And its tip is similar to the beak of a bird called a stork, in which there is the roughness of a file: when it grasps something, it does not release it at all.
Concerning the opening of abscesses, and their incision, and their general treatment.
Chapter XL.
Abscesses are of many kinds, in many ways, according to the recollection of them, namely one, and one in this book: and they are diverse in their perforation and incision, from two methods.
One of which is a type of abscess within itself, and in that which it encompasses from moistures.
And the second method is because of the places in which it occurs in the body.
Because an abscess occurring in the head is different from an abscess occurring in the anus; and an abscess occurring in a fleshy area is different from an abscess occurring in the joints; and each of them has its own judgment from the operation.
And of abscesses there are some which should not be pierced, unless after the maturation of the pus in them, and its completion: and of them there are some which should be pierced while they are raw, and do not mature according to completion.
Such as abscesses which are near the joints.
Because when an abscess occurs near a joint, and its duration continues until that which is around it putrefies, perhaps the ligaments or nerves of that joint are corrupted; wherefore it is a nearer cause of contraction of that limb.
Or it is an abscess on a principal limb: because if you delay its perforation until it matures, it will harm either that limb or the principal limb through it.
Or it is near the anus, therefore pierce it unripe; and it is not fitting to pierce a raw abscess, not of complete digestion, except that which is near the anus, lest it putrefy deeply, and extend to the interior of the anus, and become a fistula, or become in its terminal point incurable.
It is necessary that you know the time of perforation of the abscess, which is mature according to completion: and it is by the subsidence of pain, the recession of fever, and the diminution of redness, and pulsation, and sharpness of the abscess head; and the other signs.
And it is necessary that you make the same perforation in the lower place of the abscess, and of more prominent eminence; and let the perforation extend in the length of the body, if the abscesses are in the parts of the hands and feet, and in the places of the tendons, and cords, and nerves, and arteries, and finally in all similar places where there is no bending.
In those however which bend, proceed with the perforation along that limb.
When however the abscess is in fleshy places, then it is better that you leave its perforation until its digestion is confirmed, as we have said according to completion.
Because if you perforate it before that, the course of the virus from it is prolonged, and there is much filth and uncleanliness, and perhaps its edges will become hardened, and its depth.
And some abscesses are perforated according to the width of the body, in case of necessity, or according to the need of the limb.
And it is necessary that you administer a small perforation in small abscesses, and a large perforation in large abscesses, or many incisions, similar to the size of the abscess.
And there are abscesses in which the skin must be hollowed out; and it should be incised when it has already become like a cloth, and has reached a point where it is already dead, as happens in many cases, such as boils and buboes.
And some of them are cut with an incision having three angles. And from among them there is one that is incised like the shape of a myrtle leaf.
Like an inguinal abscess.
And among them are some in which a round incision, and a crescent-shaped incision are administered; and similar incisions to them.
That which does not have a head, however, such as mild, superficial abscesses, should be pierced with a superficial, or merely flat, perforation.
And when the abscess is large and has already collected much pus, and you pierce it, you should not be hasty and extract all the pus at that time; rather, extract a portion of it. Then plug the abscess until another day. Then extract some more of the pus again.
Do this repeatedly according to the gradation, until it comes out; especially if the sick person is weak in strength, or a pregnant woman, or a young child, or an old and decrepit person, for the animal spirit is often dissolved by the exit of pus, and perhaps the sick person dies, and you do not realize it.
Therefore, observe this chapter with great caution.
And after your perforation, with which you perforate these abscesses, it is necessary that you clean the wound, and consider. If therefore the wound of the abscess is small, or is a flat incision, then apply bandages of linen, or old cloth. And if the abscess is large, and there are many fissures of perforation, it is then necessary that you insert a bandage into every fissure, until they meet one another.
And if in the abscess you have cut away a part of the skin, or have hollowed it out around: then it is necessary that you fill it with old cloth, or as when cloth is woven, or shaved with flax-wool without moisture; and bind it until the third day.
Then discard it, and treat it with what is appropriate of ointment, until it is healed.
If however, bleeding occurs during your operation, then apply cold water and vinegar, after soaking a cloth in them; and place it repeatedly over the bleeding area.
If however, the bleeding persists, then it is necessary that you administer the regimen, and the treatment, and powders, which I have described in many places of this book of ours, and by division.
If however, it is in the time of winter, and the location of the abscess is of many nerves: then it is necessary that you infuse cushions with wine and warm oil; and place them over the affected areas.
And if it is in summer, and the areas are fleshy: then it is necessary that you place cushions soaked in water and oil, or in wine and oil, and make the whole thing cold. Until when the third day shall have passed, as we have said, then it is necessary that you open the abscess, and cleanse it, and administer to its treatment what is appropriate for it, until it is healed.
This, therefore, is what is necessary from the knowledge of the treatment of abscesses universally.
According to the path of distinction, however, I have already spoken of every abscess, in what way the path to its treatment is chaptered individually.
Chapter XLI.
Concerning the incision of abscesses which occur on the scalp.
Small abscesses occur on the scalp, and they are of the species of Tumors, which the membranes that are sacs contain them; as if they were the gullets of a hen.
And their species are many.
Some are fatty; and some contain moisture like mud; and some contain moisture like fritters and gruel; and similar to them, and some are hard, stony ones.
And in the incision of all of them, and their extraction, there is no fear, as long as the incision of them does not oppose an artery.
And the operation in their incision is, that you should try them with an instrument, whose form comes after this, which is called an Intromissum, until you know what they contain.
For if it is that which contains moisture, then cut it by an incision along its length with a superficial incision, according to this form.
And begin with the incision from line b. to line g. When the moisture is thus evacuated, then scrape the container which holds that moisture, and do not leave anything of it at all.
For it often returns if anything is left of it.
Then immerse the cotum in Egyptian ointment, if it is present; and if not, in water and salt; and fill the wound with it, and leave it until another day. For it will corrode that which remained of the container.
Then again apply the cotum with Egyptian ointment a second and a third time, and if you need it, until you are sure that nothing remains of the container; then treat the wound with the ointment, until it is healed.
If the abscess contains a fatty lump, then cut it according to this form, the incision having the shape of a cross; and insert hooks between the two sides of the incision, and scrape it from every side; and try your skill in removing the membrane that contains it.
If however the artery offers resistance, then do that which I shall tell you afterwards.
And similarly do in the abscess, if it is stony, with the same incision and treatment, according to what we have said.
And the incision over a stony abscess is easier, because it is less bloody and moist. And sometimes there are some of these abscesses that are on the head in some people, with which there is absolutely no moisture.
That is because I incised an abscess on the head of an old woman, and found an abscess like a solid and hard stone, rough, white, which could not be broken; and if someone struck it with something, it would injure them.
In other abscesses, however, occurring on the head, apart from these abscesses that occur on children's heads and at the roots of the ears, the incision of all of them should be a superficial incision.
Or make a perforation of them always from their lower part, so that the course of pus is eased downwards.
Then treat it with what is appropriate for them from the treatment.
Concerning the incision of tumors on the neck.
Chapter XLII.
These abscesses often occur in the neck, and under the armpits, and in the groin: and sometimes they occur in the rest of the body.
And those which arise from them on the neck, are one, and many: and they generate from each other: and every tumor from them is within its own proper tunic, as is in the knots and abscesses of the head, as we have narrated.
And the types of these tumors are many. And from them are stony ones; and from them are those which contain moisture; and from them are malignant ones, which do not obey treatment.
Therefore, in that one of them which you see to be well-disposed upon touch, whose proximity to the skin color is manifest, and which moves to every part, and is not connected with the nerves of the neck, nor with the veins, nor with the artery, nor is deep: you ought to separate it by a superficial incision from the upper part to the lower part of the body from line b to line g, and scrape it from every side; and spread the two lips of skin with a hook, or with many hooks, if you need it, as we said in the abscesses of the head, and extract it gradually.
And it is a precaution that the vein or nerve not be cut.
And let the scalpel not be very sharp, so that it does not injure your hand with the incision, or disturb the sick person, and you cut what is not necessary.
However, if you cut a vein or artery, or it hinders you from the operation, then place on the wound pounded zegi, or certain powders that stop bleeding, and constrict the wound, and leave it until the sharpness of the abscess subsides, and the wound softens; or until it begins and wants to putrefy.
For the blood is then stopped.  Therefore return to your operation, until you complete it.
Then inquire with your index finger if any small strophulus or other small things remain: therefore, cut them and clean them.
If a large vein is in the root of the strophulus, then it is necessary not to cut that strophulus from its root; rather, it is necessary to tie it with a strong doubled thread, and leave it until it falls off by itself without harm.
Then fill the wound with old lint, which you have already soaked in Egyptian ointment. Then care for it.
If the entire strophulus is cut, then it is necessary to bring together the two edges of the wound, and suture it immediately, after you see that no excess remains.
However, if you see that excess remains because of the size of the strophulus, then it is necessary to attempt to cut its root and extract it; and administer the suture that we have described.
And any humors contained within the strophulus, pierce it with a superficial puncture, so that the place of its maturity appears to you; and place the puncture from that which follows below the body, as we said.
Then, after the puncture, apply dressings with ointment, and similar things, to corrode what remains of the corruption, until when you see the wound already cleansed; then care for it with a generative flesh ointment, until it is healed.
Chapter XLIII.
Concerning the incision of the epiglottis from an abscess occurring within the throat.
The ancients said this incision into the epiglottis, and I have seen no one in our land who has performed it; and this is the writing of their words.
In those suffering from synocha, the incision of the epiglottis should be avoided; for it brings no benefit, because all the veins and lungs are weak.
However, in those who have a hot abscess in the mouth, or throat, or both tonsils, when there is no sickness in the canal, it is necessary to use the incision of the epiglottis, to avoid the harm that results from suffocation.
Therefore, when we wish to do this, we should cut the epiglottis beneath three or four circles of the epiglottis, with a small incision across the width, at the point between two circles, in such a way that the incision is into the soft tissue, not into the cartilage.  This place is suitable for the incision because it is devoid of flesh and the blood vessels are distant from it.
If the surgeon is timid, then it is necessary to extend the skin of the throat with a hook. Then he should split the skin until he reaches the canal, avoiding the blood vessels if he sees any.
Then he should cut the soft tissue as we have described, and the incision of the canal is signaled by the phlegm that emerges from it, together with the rupture and severance of the voice.
And leave the wound open for a time.
When therefore the hour in which suffocation is feared has passed, bring together the two lips of the wound in the skin, and suture it itself alone without cartilage.
Then administer medicines that cause flesh to grow until it is healed.
Says Albucasis. The summary of this account we have given is not applicable unless they see that some of these abscesses have already closed the throat of the sick person; and the sick person is raised above death, and his breath wants to be cut off; they go to cut the epiglottis, so that the sick person may breathe over the place of the wound with some respiration, and may be saved from death; and for this reason they ordered the wound to be left open until the malice of the illness is consumed, and its malice is for three days, and like itself; then, therefore, they ordered the wound to be sutured and cared for until it is healed.
And that which I saw myself is that a maidservant took a knife and thrust it into her throat, and cut a part of the lung passage with it.
And I was called to treat her, and I found her groaning, like the groan of the dead.
I therefore explored the wound and found little blood that had issued from the wound. Therefore, I trusted that she had not cut a vein, nor a conduit, and wind was coming out of the wound.
I hastened then, and sewed up the wound, and treated it until it was healed; and nothing happened to the maidservant except hoarseness in her voice; and she returned after days to a better state of her health.
Therefore, I say that there is no fear in the section of the epiglottis.
Concerning the section of the hernia of the throat.
Chapter XLIV.
This abscess, called the hernia of the throat, is a large abscess, according to the color of the body; and it is very common in women.
And it is according to two ways: either it is natural, or it is accidental.
In the natural one, certainly, there is no talent.
The accidental one, however, is according to two ways: one of which is similar to fatty lumps. And the other way is similar to the abscess that forms from the knotting of an artery. And in it there is fear, and it is not necessary that presumption be made to it with iron, unless in that which is small; and you should test it and investigate it with an instrument. If therefore you find it similar to a fatty lump, and it is not suspended by any vein, then cut it, as lumps are cut, and extract it with whatever it contains from the cyst, if it is in a cyst; and if not, then search its entire extent. Then treat the place with what is necessary in treatment, until it is healed.
Chapter XLV.
Concerning the section on the types of Lumps.
There are many kinds of lumps, and I have already stated all their kinds in the division; and it is necessary for me to describe here the difference between a lump and a fistula, since it causes doubt.
I say therefore, that when a fistula is present, there is heat, fever, and intense pain, until the ebullition of the superfluity subsides and the putrefaction is complete; then the fever and heat cease.
However, with a lump there is no heat, no fever, nor pain, and it contains them in cysts, which is a special sac for them, and it is according to the color of the body. And their beginning is like a chickpea, and it becomes like a batecha, and larger or smaller.
And they are of two kinds: either fatty, or containing moisture. And the colors of moisture are many, according to what I have said in the division.
Therefore, when you arrive at the treatment of a lump, you should examine it, and first investigate it with an instrument called the "Intromissum," according to how its shape will appear in the chapter after this one.
And the method of investigation for abscesses and all lumps is that you should take this instrument and insert it into the most moist place that you find in the abscess.  And you should slowly revolve your fingers with it until you know that the instrument has penetrated the skin. Then place your hand according to the size of the abscess.
Then withdraw the Intromissum, and consider what emerges in its wake.
If, therefore, running moisture of any color emerges, then cut it with a superficial incision, as I said in the other abscesses.
And if no moisture emerges in the wake of the Intromissum, then know that it is greasy.  Cut, therefore, over it with an incision shaped like a cross, in this form, as I taught you.  And suspend it with hooks, and peel away the skin from every side with ease.  And keep a kit if you can upon it, so that you remove it [the node] whole with the lump.
If, however, the cyst breaks open during the operation, and it is not possible to remove it whole, for this often happens, then remove it piece by piece, until nothing remains of it.
For if something small or large remains of it, the lump returns most often.
If it overcomes you, and a small amount remains of it, then fill the wound at its completion with certain sharp corrosive powders.  And bind the wound, and place upon it what sits as a hot abscess, and care for it with the rest of the treatment, until it is healed.
If, therefore, the lump is large, then sew its two lips together, and treat it with what promotes healing.
If, however, there is a pulsating or non-pulsating vein there, then hurry and fill the place with pounded zege, and leave it bound for two or three days, until the wound is putrid and the blood's boiling ceases.  Then return to cutting out what remains of the lump.
Chapter XLVI.
Concerning the instruments for cutting and piercing from outside.
Among them are the forms of instruments inserted, and they are of three kinds.
For among them is a large one, and among them is a medium one, and among them is a small one.
Let them be made of iron, with square ends, well-formed, so that they readily enter the abscess.
And these are the forms of instruments, and no, that is, piercing ones: and one of them is called beris, that is, piercing: and they are of three kinds.
For among them is a large one, and a medium one, and a small one.
They are suitable for investigating abscesses, and exits, and fistulas, and buboes, from that which is between the bones.
And others are made round, smooth, and easy, like large needles with which saddles are sewn, namely of amber, or of bronze, or iron, or silver.
And the best of them are those made of amber.
And also from black lead, which are suitable for testing fistulas, whose concavity has reflections, so that they may be reflected with their smoothness with those reflections.
And they are again of three types. Because from them are long, from them medium, and from them short, according to the amount of the fistula's width and its constriction.
The shape of Hooks, and there are many types.
Because from them are simple, namely those with one curve: and they are of three types as you see, Large, Medium, and Small.
And from them are blind hooks: and they are of three types.
And from them are hooks having two curves, and they are of three types: and from them are hooks having three curves, and they are of three types: and all these are necessary in their place.
And these are the shapes of scalpels, with which knots and abscesses are cut and scraped: and they are of three types: because from them is large, medium, and small.
Their cutting edges are sharp, the other edges are blunt: and they are not placed thus, unless that with them a benefit is done in scraping knots, in fear of incision of a vein, or nerve; and so that the infirm may be healed, and find a little tranquility from the burning than he finds in scraping of an abscess.
They are made of air, and are similar to a Radiol, with which alcohol is made: and on the broad end is a hidden Spatumilis point: and it runs inwards, and outwards when you wish, as you see.
The shape of the spatulas that are hidden between the fingers during the perforation of abscesses: and the sick do not perceive them: and they are of three types, large, medium, and small.
Forms of cupping instruments with which the flow of blood is cut off: and they are of three types, large, medium, and small.
They are made of air, or brass, round, somewhat elongated, as you see: and be of a fine subtlety.
And it is necessary that these types of cupping instruments be large and small with you, so that you may cut off blood with them quickly when needed, and then when medicine is not available to you.
However, do not use them for the removal of blood in every part of the body, and do not use them except on fleshy areas, such as the thighs of the legs, and the hips, and the upper arms, and the breasts, and the belly, and the groins, and similar fleshy, moist parts.
And sometimes smaller instruments like hazelnuts are made from them, according to their shape, with which blood is cut off when it flows from a phlebotomy site, or at a vein or artery incision; and sometimes they are made round according to this shape.
Chapter XLVII.
Concerning the care of the breasts of men that resemble the breasts of women.
Sometimes the breasts of certain men swell at the time of completing sleep (that is, when they begin to become polluted in sleep) until they resemble the breasts of women, and they remain foul-looking and suppurative.
Therefore, whoever abhors that, should cut above the breasts with a crescent-shaped incision, according to this shape from line b. to line g. Then scrape off all the fat. Afterwards, fill the wound with a healing medicine. Then bring together the two edges of the wound with sutures, and treat it until it is healed.
If, however, the breast inclines downward and softens due to its size, as happens with women, then it should be split on its two upper sides with two incisions similar to the crescent shape, each of which is contained within the other at the ends of each, until there is a larger line containing the smaller one, according to this shape from line b. to line g. Afterwards, scrape off the skin between the two edges, and remove the fat, and administer what we said about sutures and powders, which is necessary for treatment, until it is healed.
If, however, you do not complete the incision that you ought to make, because of the patient's discomfort or because of the flow of blood, then you should fill the wound with cotton soaked in a corrosive ointment, and leave it until it corrodes what remains of the fat. Then treat it until it is healed.
Concerning the perforation of an abscess that occurs under the armpit.
Chapter XLVIII.
These abscesses which occur under the armpit are of the kinds of hard Strophulae, which contain cysts, and of those which contain moist humours.
Therefore, those of them that contain moist humours, should be incised with a lunate incision, according to this form, from line b to line g. When, therefore, all that is in the abscess, of pus, has been evacuated, then fill it with old lint, and leave it until another day.
Then the lint should be removed, and it should be treated with a suitable ointment for it, until it is healed.
If the abscess is of the kind of the knotty Strophulae, then incise upon it, as we have said in the section on Strophulae, evenly.
If, however, the wound extends in such a way as to emit pus, then apply a cautery to it, according to what we have said in what has been said before.
Chapter XLIX.
Concerning the incision of an abscess which occurs because of an artery and a vein.
When an artery bursts, and the skin above it consolidates, an abscess often results from this; and similarly, a vein also, when it bursts, will have an abscess and swelling occur.
And the signs by which it is known that an abscess and swelling are due to an artery and a vein are: because, when an abscess is due to an artery, it is long, gathered deep within the body; and when you push the abscess with your fingers, you feel as if there is a creaking sound to it.
And that which is due to a vein is round on the surface of the body.
And incision upon this abscess is an error, especially that which is under the armpits, and the groins, and the neck, and in many places of the body; and it is very large. Therefore, its treatment with iron should be avoided, and that which is also in the extremities, or in the head, should be avoided.
Therefore, for that which is of them from the swelling of the artery's opening, make an incision in the skin lengthwise. Then open the incision with hooks, then the artery; and free it from its coverings, until it is exposed.
Then insert a needle beneath it, and make it penetrate to the other side, and bind the artery with a double thread in two places, according to what I taught you in the extraction of the two arteries which are in the temples.
Then pierce the place, which is between the two ligatures with a lancet, until all the blood which is in it comes out, and the abscess is resolved.
Then administer a treatment that produces pus until the ligatures fall away; afterwards treat it with suitable ointments for it, until it is healed.
If the abscess is due to the incision of a vein, then you should hold with your hand whatever you can of the abscess with the skin. Then insert a needle under the place you held with your hand, and make it penetrate; and let a double thread be on it, until you extract it from the other side. Then tie the abscess with a good ligature, as I told you in the ligature of a grape, from two sides with two ends of the thread.
If however you fear that the thread will be pulled out, then insert another needle with another thread under the entire abscess at the incision of the needle: press, and tie your threads in four places.
Then cut the abscess in its middle, until what is inside it comes out; then cut the excess skin, and let what is tied from it.
Then place upon it a poultice which you have soaked in wine and oil. Then administer the treatment, which is done with linens and ointments, until it is healed.
Chapter L.
Concerning the abscess which occurs from the twisting of nerves.
Just as an abscess occurs in the artery and vein, so too does an abscess occur in the nerves: which occurs in them through a blow, or occurs from excessive labor, and similar causes; and it happens most often in those places of helpers, or of the heel, and in every place where the joints move: and it is a serious abscess.
Its color is similar to the rest of the body, and it is in many dispositions without pain; and when it is squeezed with violence, the sick person feels in it a sensation similar to numbness.
And it is not a deep-seated abscess within the body, rather it is beneath the skin, and it moves to every part, and does not go forward or backward, nor behind to the back.
Therefore, whatever of them is in the joints, should not be incised with iron. For perhaps a contraction will result.
In that which is in the head or forehead, however, cut the skin with a lancet. If therefore it is a small abscess, then hold it with scissors, and cut it away from its root.
And if it is large, then suspend it with a hook, and scrape it: then remove it, and close the wound with sutures: and treat it until it heals.
Chapter LI.
Concerning the incision of an abscess occurring in the belly.
Some people frequently have in their bellies, and in the rest of their bodies, growths which are called Fungalia, by reason of their resemblance to fungi.
Their root is subtle, and their head is thick, and their lips are turned inward. And some of them are small, and some of them grow very large.
And I myself have seen a man who had two growths in his belly, which were more like fungi than other things: there was no difference between them, white, with small roots, and their lips turned inward, and they split, and moisture always flowed from them.
Therefore, I cut them, and found one to weigh approximately ten and eight ounces, and the other approximately six ounces.  And the operation for cutting them is, that you should then consider, if the patient is moist, and the color of the growth is white, moist, with a fine root; then cut it with a broad spatula, and have cauteries ready in the fire.
For often much blood is expelled at its incision; therefore, hurry if blood overwhelms you, then cauterize it.
If you see a patient who is faint and fearful of incision with iron, then take a thread of lead, well-made, and bind it tightly around the growth.  The method of which is the one we discussed, and leave it for two days.
Then add to the lead constriction. Therefore do not cease binding the lead, whenever it presses on the growth, until it is severed, and falls away of its own accord without effort.
If however the growth is of large root, then in its incision there is something of fear and terror; especially that which is in the belly.
However, it is possible that you may cut half of it. Then cauterize it, so that it does not return.
Then treat it until the wound is healed.
And beware lest you presume to cut a growth that is dark-colored, with little sensation, and of foul appearance: for it is indeed a cancerous abscess; and I shall come with a description of Cancer after this.
Chapter LII.
Concerning the treatment of the navel eminence.
The navel eminence arises from many causes. Or from fissures of the diaphragm above the abdomen; and from it protrude the pleura, or the intestines, according to what happens in other ruptures. Or from blood flowing from a vein or artery, according to what has been mentioned previously. Or from a constriction of wind within it.
If however it is due to a fissure of the diaphragm and the protrusion of the viscera, then the color is similar to the color of the body, and it is smooth, without pain, and appears in various locations. And if it is due to the protrusion of the intestine, then its location is, with the matter we have described, of a more varied nature. When therefore you press it with your fingers, it disappears; then it returns, and perhaps there is a sound with it; and it increases greatly at the entrance of a bath, and with strenuous exertion.
If however it is due to moisture, it is smooth, then it does not disappear when you press it with your hand, nor does it contract, nor does it increase.
If it is due to blood, then with these signs the abscess appears black on the side.
If however it is due to formed flesh, then the abscess is serious, large, hard, and fixed to a single quantity.
If however it is due to windiness, then its touch is smooth.
And the operation on it is that you should consider then whether the prominence of the navel is due to blood of the artery, or vein, or windiness: then you ought to refrain from its treatment. For in that there is fear and terror, as I taught you in the chapter, in which I said abscesses due to artery and vein.
If the prominence of the navel is due to the intestine, or the zirb, then you ought to instruct the sick person to hold his breath and stand extended. Then mark with ink around the entire navel. Thereafter, instruct him to lie on his back between your hands. Then encircle with a wide spatula around the navel over the spot you marked with ink. Thereafter, extend the middle of the abscess upwards with a large hook. Then tie it firmly around with thread, or with a silk chord or strong ligature; and let the knot of the ligature be tied tight.
Then open the middle of the abscess extended above the ligature. If therefore you find it already captured by the ligature, then pull out the tied part, and insert the index finger into it, and push the intestine inwards towards the belly; and if you find a winding, then take it with a hook and cut away its excess.
If, however, it is an artery or vein that is opposite you, then surround it extensively. Then return to your operation. And take two needles, and insert in them two strong threads; and insert the two needles around the circumference you have made around the abscess in the shape of a cross, making them penetrate.
Then tie off the abscess in four places above the needles; and if you wish, remove the needles, and leave the area until the extended flesh putrefies, and falls off by itself; or cut it when it becomes softened and putrefied.
Then treat it with what is necessary of ointments until it is healed.
If the eminence of the navel is from fleshy matter in it, or from moisture, then it is necessary to cauterize the abscess, as we have said. And draw out the blood, or moisture, which you find in it.
Then treat it with what consolidates the place.
Chapter LIII.
Concerning the treatment of CANCER.
We have already spoken in the division of the species of Cancer, and how is the way to its treatment with medicines; and caution must be taken in its treatment with iron, so that it is not ulcerated; and we have spoken of Cancer generated in the womb, and caution in its treatment.
And the ancients said that sometimes Cancer is in a place where its eradication is possible, such as Cancer that is in the breasts or in the thigh, and the like, from the limbs located to draw out the entire thing: especially when it is small and beginning.
However, when it is old and large, one should not approach it.
For I myself could not cure anyone from it, nor have I seen anyone before me who has attained to it.
And the operation on it, when it is located as we said, is that you should proceed, and free the infirm person from black cholera sometimes. Then phlebotomize him if you find it with manifest fullness.
Then prepare the infirm person with the preparation in which he is to be placed with the operation.
Then throw into the Cancer the hooks that suit it. Afterwards, hollow it out from every side with the skin, according to scrutiny, until nothing remains of its roots; and let the blood run, and do not sever it quickly, rather express the places, and wipe away the entire thick blood with your hand, or with whatever instruments are possible there.
If however, the flow of thick blood from the incision of an artery, or vein, causes you opposition, then cauterize the vein until the blood is severed. Then treat it with the rest of the treatment until it is healed.
Concerning the treatment of dropsy.
Chapter LIII. We have already discussed in the division of the types of dropsy, and how the collection of water occurs, and the signs of each type, and its treatment with medicines.
And that which is treated with iron is only a type of ascites alone; and it is not approached with iron in the case of tympanitis, nor in the case of hyposarca at all; for that is mortal.
When you have already treated this type of dropsy, tympanitis, with medicines, and your treatment has not been successful, then consider. For if weakness has already overtaken the sick person, or there is some other ailment with him besides the dropsy, such as if there is a cough, or looseness of the bowels, and things similar to these, then beware of treating him with iron, for there is fear of that.
If however you see the sick person of exuberant strength, and there is no illness with him besides dropsy alone, and he is neither a child nor an old man, then the method of operation in him is that you raise the sick person standing between your hands, and a servant behind him should express his belly with his hand, driving the water to the lower part of the chest.
Then take a pointed spatula, according to this form. Let it be of two sharp parts, long, with a sharp tip like a spatula. However, let it have some degree of shortness gradually, so that you do not proceed with it in the operation all the way to the intestine and harm him.
Then consider. For if the generation of dropsy is from the part of the intestines, then it is necessary that you lengthen the incision from the navel a quantity of three fingers, downward in a direct line above the pubis.
If, however, the generation of dropsy is because of illness of the liver: then let your incision be to the left of the navel by three fingers.
And if its generation is because of the spleen, then let the incision be on the right side; and it is also not necessary that the incision be on the side on which the sick person wishes to lie, so that superfluities do not flow to that weak place.
Then pierce through the entire skin with the instrument. Then introduce into that incision, and raise your hand with the spatula between the skin, and if you do this, as if you were to scrape it, and let the quantity that is scraped be the quantity of a fingernail, or approximately that.
Then pierce, if you do this, until the spatula reaches the hollow place: and that is the place of the water. Then pull it out, and introduce into the hole an instrument of this shape. And it is similar to a cannula; it is made of silver, or bronze, or brass, smooth, polished; to which, on its lower part, is a small hole, and on its sides are three holes, two on one side, and one on the other side; and the end of it is cut, according to the manner of cutting a reed, as you see; on its upper end is a ring.
For when the instrument reaches the water, then it itself descends immediately upon the instrument, therefore evacuate from the water in a short time a moderate quantity.
Because if you evacuate more from it than necessary, perhaps the weak person dies in a short time by the dissolution of his animal spirit, or a faint that approaches death happens to him.
But evacuate from it according to the quantity of its virtue, and according to what the disposition of the patient signifies to you, from the strength of his pulse and from his condition.
Then withdraw the instrument, and retain the water.
For it is retained immediately because of the skin which retains the opening that is over the sifac: of which I have told you, that you should perforate it in that manner.
Then again use the instrument on the following day, if you see the patient tolerate it, and also withdraw a small amount from the water.
Do this for several days without fear, and guard yourself from error, until little remains of the water.
However, if you fear for the patient, and you discharge a large amount of water, then treat him with burial in hot sand, and with much sweat in a bath and the sun, and let him fast: and treat him with drying medicines, until he is healed: and cauterize the stomach, liver, and spleen after the water extraction, as I have described in what preceded.
On the treatment of infants born with their urine passages not perforated.
Chapter LV.
When any infant emerges from its mother's womb, and the opening of its urethra is not perforated, or the opening is narrow, or in the wrong place.
Therefore, it is necessary to assist with its perforation immediately when it is born, using a very fine Spatumili, according to this form.
Then place a thin leaden nail in the opening, and bind it; and keep it there for three or four days.
When, therefore, it wishes to urinate, let it be removed, and let it urinate. Then return it.
And if you do not place lead, it is possible that the urine which flows over the place will not allow it to close.
However, the one whose opening is constricted is treated with lead, as we have said, for many days, until it is enlarged.
However, those in whom the opening is in the wrong place are harmed. For, in those who are born, the opening is at the end of the penis: therefore, they cannot urinate forward until they raise their penis upwards with their hand. Nor is there generation for him because the semen cannot reach the womb in a straight manner: and it is a very foul disease.
And the method of operation in him is that the sick person be laid on his back. Then extend his penis with a strong pull of your left hand, and cut the head of the penis from the glans, with a sharp instrument or a sharp spatula, as if cutting a reed or as if you were shaving something, so that its middle comes forth like the head of the penis, and so that the opening falls in the middle in the proper way.
And beware of the flow of blood in your operation. For this often happens. Therefore, apply to it what stops the blood, and treat the wound until it heals.
Concerning those things that occur in the foreskin and the head of the penis, and its corruption, blackness, and adhesion.
Chapter LVI.
These blemishes frequently occur on the penis, and there is a prominence of foul flesh.
And from it some are malignant, and others not malignant.
Therefore, the non-malignant one should be suspended with a fine hook, and cut away until the entire area is cleansed. Then place upon it a poultice soaked in Egyptian ointment. Then treat it afterward with the ointment dyafinicon until it heals.
If it is malignant, of foul color, then it is necessary to apply a cautery to it after its incision and scraping.
If, however, the Albather is on the foreskin of an uncircumcised person, and part of the Albather is inside the foreskin and part of it outside, then it is necessary to remove the Albather that is inside first until it is consolidated, then treat the exterior; because when you treat it simultaneously, the foreskin is not safe from being pierced.
And they also occur in the testicles, and in the foreskin, blackness and corruption. Therefore, it is necessary to cauterize all that has already blackened and is about to corrupt, or is already corrupt.
Then apply a line over it with honey that has been mixed with the flour of pomegranate bark and crushed, sifted herbs.
Then treat it with the remaining treatment until it is healed.
If however a flow of blood occurs, then apply a cautery with a lunar cautery, according to this form.
For a cautery is helpful for two conditions simultaneously, namely for a flow of blood, and a wound when it is corrupted.
If the head of the penis is corroded and destroyed in an hour, then one must insert a lead cannula into the urethra so the sick person can urinate over it.
However, when the foreskin adheres to the head of the penis, and this adhesion does not occur unless the foreskin is healthy, and circumcision is not required on it: and sometimes adhesion occurs because of a wound or abscess, therefore, it is necessary to scrape it with a blunt Spatumili until the ligament is loosened, and the head of the penis is freed from every side.
If it is difficult to discern these things thoroughly, then it is necessary to scrape off some of the head of the penis and from the foreskin. This is because when the foreskin is thin, it might perhaps be perforated quickly because of its thinness.
Then separate the foreskin and the head of the penis with a thin linen cloth that has been moistened in cold water, so that they do not adhere again.
Then treat it with astringent wine until it is consolidated.
Chapter LVII.
Concerning the cleansing of infants and the treatment of accidents that befall them.
Circumcision is not a solution of continuity, like other wounds; however, since it is a procedure of our making, at our will, and its use is specifically in boys, it is necessary that we delineate a better operation and a gentler path leading to health.
Therefore, I say that the ancients did not mention circumcision in any of their books, because they do not use it in their laws, and it is only something we have acquired through experience.
This is because I have found the majority of craftsmen and phlebotomists using cleansing, circumcising with a razor and scissors, and using astringents and ligatures with thread and incisions with a fingernail.
And indeed, I have already tested all these methods, and have found no better cleansing than with scissors and a ligature with thread.
Because in cleansing with a razor, the skin often escapes. Because the foreskin has two layers, therefore perhaps the outer skin is cut, and the inner layer remains; therefore, it is necessary to cut again to cut the other, and future pain will result. And with cleansing done with astringents, that is, digital, which the surgeons use, the incision of the extremity of the male member is not secured, because perhaps it enters its hole.
In cleansing with a curette, perhaps the iron slips away and spoils your operation; and the skin of a boy is short-lived, and many times they are born in such a way that they do not need cleansing; and I have seen that.
However, cleansing with scissors and ligation with thread has shown me a good experiment, because scissors are proportionate to the incision: for the sharpness that is above is like the sharpness that is below. Therefore, when you press your hand, the two sharpnesses are proportional, and they cut according to one operation at one time; and a compression of a similar shape is made, containing the skin of the member on all sides, with which error does not fall at all.
And the mode of the proper operation is that you make it seem, especially to a boy, if he is of those who understand a little, that you do not do anything but tie a thread to his member; and you leave him until another day.
Then make him rejoice and be glad in every way possible to you from it, by what his understanding receives. Then have him stand between your prepared hands, and let him not be seated; and hide the scissors in your sleeve, or under your foot, so that the boy does not see them at all, nor anything of the instruments.
Then introduce your hand to his member, and blow into the skin, and pull it upward until the head of the member emerges. Then cleanse it from the dirt that has collected on it.
Then tie the marked place with a double thread. Afterwards, tie a second ligature a little lower. Then hold the lower ligature's location with your index finger and thumb, with good retention, and cut between the two ligatures. Then lift the skin upwards quickly, and extract the head of the rod. Then allow the blood to run slowly (for it is better) and place powder on top. And upon the powder, place a cloth on which the yolk of a hard-boiled egg in rosewater has been spread, mixed with good fresh rose oil. And leave it on top until the next day, and treat it with the rest of the treatment until healed.
The form of the scissors for cleaning is this.
Let the two ends be blunt and intersecting, so that the nail's branch does not protrude from them; and let the length of the two sharp points be equal to the length of the two handles.
An error, however, occurring in cleaning is that perhaps the inner skin entirely, or part of it, escapes at the incision.
Therefore, it is necessary to extend it from your time with your fingernail before the abscess of the place, and to cut it according to equality.
If you cannot hold it with your fingernail, then pull it out with a hook and cut it.
However, if three days have passed and that which is under the rod remains swollen, suppurated, then leave it until the abscess is ripe, and remove the pus with ease, and cut it according to what is prepared for you, and be cautious of the head of the rod. For that will not harm it.
Therefore, treat it with what consolidates a wound from the powders, which we have described in the treatise on powders, and if it is cut from the skin beyond measure and protrudes to the upper regions, that will not harm it either.
Therefore, treat it with what we have said, until it is healed.
Chapter LVIII.
Concerning the extraction of retained urine in the bladder.
Retention of urine in the bladder occurs from an obstruction caused by a stone, or congealed blood, or pus, or a grown flesh, and similar things to those which we have mentioned from the methods of treatment in the division.
And if the urine is not discharged, and you see that its retention is due to a stone, which is already in the neck of the bladder: then it is necessary that he be weak, bent over his knees. Then his feet should be placed upon his back, and he should extend his stomach from the upper part of his back, and the weak man should strain his breath as much as possible for him. Thus, the stone is forced from the neck of the bladder towards the rear: wherefore the urine is discharged.
If it is not released with what we have said, and the matter is severe upon the sick person, then it is necessary that you administer its extraction with an instrument, which is called a syringe, whose form is this: Let it be of silver, and let it be fine, smooth, concave, like a bird's feather quill in its fineness, long in the likeness of one and a half palms, to which a fine tube should be attached to its head.
And the method of the urine's exit through it is that you should take a doubled thread, and tie to its end wool, or tow, with a good ligature, and insert the end of the thread into the lower part of the syringe; and cut with scissors if any wool remains, but insert it into the cannula with force, like a lever.
Then anoint the syringe with oil, or with butter, and with egg white, and make the sick person sit on a seat, and embrocate the bladder, and its tube with moist oils, and olive oil, and lukewarm water.
Then introduce the syringe into the tube with ease, until it reaches the root of the tube.
Then double it upward from the navel.
Then push the syringe into it, until it reaches the bladder, and the sick person feels that it has reached the empty place; and this is not done in this order unless because the passage, in which it goes, is one in which there is tortuosity.
Then extend the thread with wool gradually. For urine will follow the wool.
Then pull it out, and cause the urine to run through the urinary passage; and repeat the syringe, and do not cease to do it, until the bladder is emptied, and the sick person finds relief.
Concerning the quality of bladder clysterization with a Clepsydra.
Chapter LIX.
When a sore occurs in the bladder, or blood coagulates in it, or pus is confined in it, and the force is to distill into it waters and medicines: then let it be done with the instrument which is called Clepsydra, and this is its form.
It is indeed deaf, that is, closed. And in it are three openings, two on one side, and one on the other side, as you see.
And the concave place, in which that which propels it is, be according to the quantity that fills it without addition, until when something is pulled with it, humidity is drawn out; and when it is propelled, it is expelled with it to a distance: according to what the clepsydra does, by which naphtha, that is, Greek fire, is projected in naval battles.
Therefore, when the force is to project the humors into the bladder, introduce the extremity of the clepsydra into the humor, and pull with that which propels it upwards, for the humor is drawn into the concavity of the clepsydra.
Then introduce its extremity into the tube, according to what we have narrated in the syringe. Then propel the humor with that which propels it; for that humor reaches the bladder immediately, so that the sick person feels it.
A subtle form of clyster for injecting the bladder.
Let it be made of silver, or brass: whose head be higher, similar to a small alcamas, and beneath it a sinus into which a ligament falls.
Then take the bladder of a ram, and put into it the humor with which you wish to inject the bladder. Then tie it between two sinuses with a strong ligature, using a double thread: and warm that humor a little over the fire.
Then introduce the end of the clyster into the tube, then squeeze your hand over the bladder with the appropriate constriction of the humor until the infirm feels that the humor has already reached the bladder.
If, however, you do not have a bladder present, then take a piece of parchment, and make a circle from it, and pierce it from all its circularity. Then introduce a strong thread into those holes, as they revolve. Then gather the circle, as a loaf of bread is gathered: after you have put in it what you wish of humors, and oils, and waters.
Then tie it to the instrument: and do with it as you did with the bladder by pressing with your hand, until the moisture reaches the bladder.
Chapter LX.
On the extraction of the Stone.
We have already spoken in the division of the species of stone, and its treatment with medicines: and I have stated the difference between a stone generated in the kidneys and the bladder, and the signs thereof in its entirety: and I have described the stone in which operation with the hand and incision is required: and the stone generated in the bladder properly is such: and that which is fixed in the urethra: and I am recounting it with clear exposition and brevity.
Therefore, I say that a stone generated in the bladder happens most often in children.
And among its signs is that the urine issues from the bladder like water in its subtlety: and white sand appears in it, and the infirm person rubs their urethra and suffers with it, and often hangs down. Then it rises and, with it, the anus opens in many of them.
And the cure is easy for children, so long as they reach fourteen years. And it is difficult in the elderly. However, in young people it is intermediate, in that it lies between those two: and the one whose stone is larger, the cure is easier; and if it is small, the cure is the opposite of that.
Therefore, when we come to the cure, it is necessary first to cleanse the sick person with an enema, which will remove all the faeces that are in their intestines: for it sometimes hinders the finding of the stone during examination.
Then the sick person should be taken with their feet, and shaken and moved downwards, so that the stone descends to the depth of the bladder, or jumps from a high place sometimes.
Then have him sit between your hands prepared, and let his hands be under his thighs, so that the entire bladder is inclined downwards.
Then examine him and touch him externally.
If therefore you feel a stone in the space, then quickly proceed with a section upon it.
If it does not fall under your touch at all, then you must wipe your index finger with the oil of your left hand, if the sick person is a child; or the middle finger if he is a full youth; and insert it into his anus, and examine for the stone until it is under your finger; and turn it gradually towards the neck of the bladder.
Then press upon it with your finger, and drive it outwards against the place whose section you wish; and command the attendant to press the bladder with his hand, and command another attendant to extend the testicles with his right hand upwards; and with his other hand, to remove the skin which is under the testicles at the side of the place where the section is.
Then introduce a cutting spatule, whose shape is this. And make a cut in that which is between the anus and testicles, and not in the middle, to the side of the left buttock; and let the section be upon the stone, and your finger be in the anus; and let the section be transverse, so that the section be wide externally and narrow internally, according to the amount that it is possible for the stone to exit from it no greater.
For perhaps the finger, which is in the anus pressing the stone at the section, and it emerges without difficulty.
And know that if the stone has angles and edges, therefore its exit becomes difficult because of that.
And if it is smooth, like a gland, and round: and its exit becomes easy.
Therefore, to the one that has angles and edges, add to the fissure.
If it does not emerge thus, then it is necessary to devise upon it; or to bind upon it with a suitable bandage, whose extremity is like the Moon, which binds upon the stone and does not escape from it; or to introduce under it a subtle instrument, of curved extremity.
If however you cannot upon it, then enlarge the opening a little. If anything of blood overcomes you, cut it with a zegi.
If however the stones are more than one, then drive the largest first to the opening of the bladder. Then cut upon it. Afterwards drive the small one after it; and similarly do if there are more than two.
If it is very large, then it is ignorance to cut over it with a large incision. Because it happens to the patient one of two things, either that he dies, or that he suffers constant leakage of urine; because the place is not entirely consolidated.
But administer its expulsion until it emerges; or apply ingenuity in its fracture with forceps until you extract it piece by piece.
When you have completed your operation, then fill the wound with incense, aloe, and dragon's blood; and bind it, and place over it a cloth soaked in oil and wine, or rose oil, and cold water; as is done for a hot abscess.
Then lay the sick person on his back, and do not loosen the bandage until the third day. When you have loosened it, embrocate the place with water and much oil.
Then treat it with diaphaniac ointment and basil ointment until it is healed.
If however a hot abscess is added to the wound, and corrosions, and things similar to those: as if the blood were congealed in the bladder, and the urine were prevented from passing; and it is recognized by the passage of blood with the urine. Therefore, insert your finger into the wound, and extract that blood. For if it remains, it provokes the corruption of the bladder and its putrefaction.
Then wash the wound with vinegar, water, and salt; and apply whatever is appropriate for treatment, of every kind, until it is healed.
And it is necessary in the entire time of treatment, that you tie the two thighs, and collect, for the reason of the medicines placed on the site.
If there is a small stone in the passage of the penis, and it is fixed there, and prevents the exit of urine, then treat it with what I said before you reach the stage of incision. For many times you will be spared the incision by this treatment, for I have already proven it.
And it is that you take a perforator of iron, whose form is this, with a triangular point, sharp, fixed in wood.
Then take thread, and tie the penis with it under the stone so that it does not return to the bladder.
Then introduce the piercing iron into the penis with ease, until the perforator reaches the stone itself: and turn the perforator with your hand on the stone gradually: and try to pierce it, until you make it penetrate on the other side.
For then urine is released immediately.
Then press your hand upon that which remains of the stone from the outer side of the penis. For it will break and come out with the urine, and the sick person is healed.
If however this treatment is not prepared for you, due to something that prevents it: then tie a thread under the stone, and another thread above the stone. Then cut above the stone on the penis itself between the two ligatures. Then extract it. Afterwards, loosen the ligature, and cleanse the congealed blood which forms in the wound.
And a ligature of thread under the stone is not necessary unless so that it does not return to the bladder; and another ligature on top, unless so that when the thread is loosened after the stone's expulsion, the skin returns to its place and covers the wound.  And for that reason, it is necessary for you to lift the skin upwards when you tie the upper thread, so that it returns to its proper place and covers the wound, as we said.
Chapter LXI.
Concerning the extraction of a stone in women.
Little stone is generated in women.
However, if a stone happens to any of them, then the cure is difficult, and it is forbidden due to many reasons.
One of them is: that the woman is perhaps a virgin.
And the second is, because you do not find a woman who reveals herself to the physician, when she is chaste, or having husbands.
The third is, because you do not find a woman who well knows this art, especially the operation with the hand.
And the fourth is the distance from the stone's location: wherefore it needs a deep incision, and in it is fear.
If necessity provokes it, then it is necessary that you take a female physician, well-knowing: and few are found.
If, however, you entrust it to her, then seek a chaste, skillful physician, and present a skilled midwife well-versed in women's matters, or a woman who hints at a part of this art: make her present, and especially to her, that she may do everything you command her from inquiry about the stone.
Firstly, that he should see if she is a virgin: then it is necessary that he insert a finger into her anus and seek the stone.
If therefore he finds it, he should grasp it under his finger, and then command the midwife to insert her finger into the weak one's vagina, and inquire about the stone, after placing her left hand on the bladder and compressing it with a good pressure.
If, therefore, he finds the stone, then it is necessary that he gradually move it from the opening of the bladder downwards with all his strength, until he reaches the root of the thigh with it.
Then he shall cut upon it at the opposing half of the vulva at the root of the thigh, from whichever side it is prepared for him, and feels the stone in that part; and his finger shall not be removed from the stone, grasping under it; and let the incision be small at first. Then insert a probe into that incision.
Then insert a probe into that incision. If, therefore, he feels the stone, then let him add to the incision according to the proportionate amount that the stone emerges from it.
And know that the species of stone are many. For among these there are small, and large, smooth and rough, long, and round ones with branches.
Therefore, know its species, so that this may be made clear to you concerning that which you wish.
If, therefore, blood overcomes you, then add in the place of the zegi, ground, and hold it for one hour, until the blood is cut off.
Then return to your operation, until the stone emerges: and do as I have prepared for you, from the instruments, which I said in the extraction of the stone in men, that you may aid yourself by them in your operation.
If, however, a flow of blood overcomes you, and you know that the expulsion of blood is from the artery that has been cut: then put powder on the place, and bind it with ligatures of fitting constriction: and do not change it; and leave the stone, and do not extract it. For perhaps the weak woman will die. Then treat the wound.
When therefore the sharpness of the blood subsides after days, and the place becomes putrid, then return to your operation, until the stone emerges.
Chapter LX II.
Concerning the incision of a watery hernia.
A watery hernia is not present unless there is an aggregation of moisture in a white sifac, which is under the skin of the testicle containing the egg; and it is called sifac.
And sometimes it is in its own membrane, which nature prepared for it in the part of the egg, until it rots; which is another egg, and is the skin of the testicle between the white sifac, which we have said; and that does not happen except rarely.
And indeed the generation of this hernia is from the weakness which occurs in the testicles; wherefore this matter is poured out upon them. And sometimes it happens from a blow to the testicles.
And this moisture has many colors. For indeed its color is either sloping toward yellowness, or is blood-red, or fecal, black, or watery white, and that is what is more.
And the signs by which it is known where the collection of water is, are these. For if it is in the white sifac that we spoke of, then the abscess is round in length a little like the shape of an egg: and the testicle does not appear, because the moisture contains it on every side.
And if the moisture is in its own tissue, then the abscess is round like part of an egg, and because of this a man estimates that it is another egg.
And if the moisture is between the skin of the testicles and the white sifac, then it falls under the senses.
Therefore, when you desire knowledge of the color of the moisture, then experience the color of the moisture in the abscess with the inserted square, whose form preceded. Therefore, according to that which emerges in the trace of the Insertion, judge about that which is between it.
When, therefore, we come to treatment with iron, then it is necessary that you command the sick person, that he be bled if it is possible for him, and you see his body full.
Then let him be laid upon his back upon a slightly raised object, and place many cloths beneath him.
Then sit you upon his left side, and command the attendant to sit on his right, who shall extend his rod to one of the two sides of the skin of the testicles, and to the region of the navel of the abdomen.
Then take a wide spatula, and cut the skin of the testicles from the middle lengthwise, until near the pubis; and let the incision be according to the straightness of an equidistant line that divides the skin of the testicles, until it reaches the white substance enclosing it; and scrape it and observe it, or beware of this, that you sever it; and let your scraping, by which you scrape it, be on the part that hangs more with the testicle; and carefully probe with the scraping according to the amount that is possible for you.
Then pierce the substance full of water with a large perforation, and remove all the water.
Then separate the two lips of the incision with hooks, and extend the substance upward, and do not touch the skin encompassing the testicles; and cut the substance however it is possible for you to cut it, either entirely or in pieces, especially its thin side. For if you do not carefully investigate, there is no certainty in its incision, that the water will not return.
If, however, the testicle protrudes externally from its skin during your operation, then when you have completed the incision of the substance, return it. Then bring together the two lips of the skin of the testicles with sutures.
Then treat it like the other wounds, until it is healed.
If you find a corrupted testicle with a different blackness, then it is necessary to tie the vessels, which are suspensory, fearing the flow of blood.
Then cut off the testicle with its suspensory ligament, and extract the testicle: afterwards treat it as we have said.
If, however, water has accumulated in two parts, then know that there are two branches: therefore, cut the other part in the same way as you did to the other, equally.
And if it is equal to you, so that it is one operation, then do it: then wipe away the blood. And introduce into the sections wool dipped in oil, or in rose oil: and place outside other wool which you have dipped in wine and oil, and spread it over the two testicles and the belly: and place over them doubled cloths, and they are cushions: and tie them over with a bandage, which has six parts according to this form.
Then take two cloths, and sew them together, and fill them with dyed wool, according to this likeness: and let the ends with which it is pressed be made of linen, or damp wool: and let them be joined together with a bandage on the lumbar region of the breeches: and one end will take over the anus up to the back, and the second will take to the side of the pelvis: and two ends over the two thighs below, and two other ends over the two groins, and let the entire bandage be gathered in the lumbar region of the breeches.
And sometimes this branch is artificially treated with a cautery at the place of the incision with iron: and it is that you take a thin, knife-like cautery, and cut with it the skin of the testicles: and it is heated, as we have described: until, when a white, water-containing substance is exposed, then take the cautery, according to this form.
It resembles a Greek letter.
Then pierce it with it, and let it be heated, until all the moisture is expelled.
Then spread the sifac with hooks, and scrape it with a heated thin cautery, and cut it as much as possible, until you eradicate the whole of it.
And be careful, from the egg, lest the fire touch it.
And know that this operation is safer, and further from the flow of blood, and better than the operation with a section.
If, however, contrariety arises for you at the hour of the section, or at the hour of the cautery a hot abscess, or a flow of blood, or anything else: then it is necessary that you treat whatever contrariety arises for you from that with the cure that is suitable for it, according to what has been said before.
If, however, the sick person is timid, and does not expect this operation, due to its horror: then administer the perforation according to what I narrate it: and it is so.
When it is certified to you by what we have said concerning signs, that the branch is watery, then it is necessary that you make the sick person sit upon a raised seat.
Then perforate the abscess in its lower part with a wide spatula, and place the perforation along the length of the body, and let the opening be wide, until all the water runs out.
Then place a dressing over the affected area, and bind it, and allow the remaining water to run out; then treat it until the wound is healed.
If, however, there is resistance to the outflow of water at the time you perforate it, and this is only because a white membrane creates resistance in the wound opening and hinders the escape of the water: then it is necessary that you insert a pen into the wound, or an instrument with which the water of dropsy is extracted, whose form preceded, or add to the wound operation for a little while.
And know that the water returns, and collects again after six months, or about that. When it collects again, then it should be perforated according to the same method, and the sick person will pass their days.
Chapter LXIII.
Concerning the treatment of fleshy tumors.
Know that in the incision upon this tumor, there is fear leading to destruction in many dispositions. Therefore, it seems to me that its removal is saving from it.
And I am recalling the operation upon it, and the appearance of the abscess.
I say therefore that many abscesses occur in the bodies, of which the testicles are composed: and it happens from many causes, namely.
Or from an acute or sharp superfluity that is poured onto the testicles. Or from a blow.
And the color of the abscess is according to the color of the body, and no pain is found in it: and it is a serious abscess.
And perhaps it is a stony abscess, whose color is dark, and no feeling is in it.
And sometimes it arises from the knotting of arteries, and their swelling: as its recollection has already preceded: or from the swelling of veins.
Therefore, that which arises from the swelling of the arteries is known by the arrangement of the abscess when you compress it with your fingers. And it is not necessary that you touch it completely.
That which is made from the swelling of veins, however, does not spread from it anything upon compression with the fingers.
And now it is possible that a section be made upon this kind, and upon the remaining flesh: and it is as if you separate the skin of the testicles. Then extend the egg upwards, and extract it with white sifach: and free the suspensory from the vessels, and tie the vessels: and cut the suspensory after you have freed it from all parts of the egg.
If therefore the egg is consolidated with those born flesh, then it is necessary that you pull the egg, and cut it.
And if there is adhesion between some of the siphaket, or in that which is between the vessels, then it is necessary that you free all that adhesion, and cut it with a circular incision.
If however there is a birth of flesh in the place of adhesion which is behind, then it is necessary that you cut all of it, and extract the egg, as we said.
When therefore your operation is completed, then fill the wound with wool infused in rose oil and wine; then treat it with the rest of the treatment, until it is healed.
Chapter LXIII.
Of the treatment of Ramicis, which is with the Vite.
Vitis is an abscess enveloped by a certain wrapping, similar to a bunch of grapes, with a softening of the testicles; and it makes difficult for the weak person movement and exercise, and walking.
And in the treatment of this illness there is fear, because of that which preceded it in remembrance.
But it is necessary, as we say, for the operation on it to be according to what the first ones did.
I say therefore that it is necessary to make the sick person sit on a raised seat. Then, push down the suspensory of the testicles. Then grasp the skin of the testicles with your fingers, near the vessels that are close to the penis; and let another servant hold them, and stretch them with a strong extension.
Then, cut with a wide, sharp spatula, a transverse section directly across the vessels, until the vessels are exposed.
Then, scrape it from every side, as we told you in the extraction of the arteries that are in the temples.
Afterwards, fasten a needle with a double thread to them, and tie it in the first of the places where the veins occur: and tie it again in the last of them. Then cut it in the middle, in a straight section along the length of the body, and extract what is gathered of putrid, corrupted humors.
Then treat the wound with the treatment of other wounds, in which pus is likely to generate, so that the vessels nourishing one testicle fall. For there is no evil through it.
If, however, it happens to all the vessels, then it is necessary that the testicles be extracted along with the vessels, so that the egg is not deprived of nourishment because of the incision, and it wastes away, or dries up, and there is no help with them.
Chapter LXV.
On the treatment of intestinal colic.
The outcome of this colic is from a section that occurs in the distended sifach over the abdomen in the groin area from a marvel of the belly.
Why do the intestines descend from that rupture to one testicle? And this rupture is either from the sifach, or its extension.
And these two types occur from many causes: either from a blow, or a jump, or a shout, or the lifting of a heavy object, and similar things.
And a sign, when it is from the extension of the sifach. It is that which happens gradually over a long time, and does not happen suddenly: and there is an abscess equal to the depth: because the sifach compresses the intestine.
And a sign of it, when it is from a section of the sifach, because it causes intense pain to occur suddenly from its beginning; and it is a different abscess, appearing under the skin nearby; and that is because of the exit of the intestine and its course towards the exterior of the sifach.
And sometimes it emerges with the intestine into the zirbum; and this is called a Ramex intestinalis, and zirbia; and sometimes it occurs with flatulence.
And sometimes faeces run into the intestine and are retained there; and with it is the harm of the sick person, because it causes a slight pain, and especially when it is pressed.
And in the treatment of the species of this illness, there is fear with iron; therefore it is necessary that a fall be avoided in it.
And the method of the operation is, that you command the sick person to reduce the intestine with his hand into the interior of his cavity, if it obeys the return. Then let him be laid back on his neck between your hands, and elevate his legs.
Then stretch the skin which follows the skin upwards, and cut the skin of the testicles completely along its length. Then fix hooks in the two lips of the incision, according to what you need to open the incision with them; and let the incision be, according to the amount, that it is possible for an egg to come out of it.
Then scrape the siphak, and what is under the skin of the testicles, until when a white, hard siphak is revealed on every side: then introduce your index finger into that which follows the testicle, into that which is between the white siphak, which is under the skin of the egg, and the second siphak, and detach with it the adhesion which is on the posterior side of the egg.
Then move the skin of the testicles inwards with your right hand, and with this lift the white siphak upwards with your left hand, and lift the egg with the siphak towards the incision; and order the servant to lift the egg upwards; and you detach the adhesion which is behind the complete separation.
And examine with your fingers, that there is nothing there from the intestine wrapped in the hard white siphak. If however you find something from it, then push it towards the lower belly.
Then take a needle, in which is a thick thread, made of linen from ten threads; and introduce it near the last siphak, that is, the tunic, which is under the skin of the testicles following the incision; then cut the ends that protrude from the thread, until there are four threads. Then place some of them over others in a cross shape; and tie with them the alsifach, about which we spoke, because it is under the skin of the testicles with a strong ligature, until no blood vessels which nourish them can send anything to them: so that a hot abscess may not arise from it. And place again a bandage second, outside the first bandage, distant from it by less than two fingers. And after these two bandages, leave from the siphak, which is under the skin of the testicles, a quantity the size of a finger; and cut the rest completely around, and remove the egg from it.
Then cut in the lower part of the skin of the testicles the incision from which blood and pus flows, as we described in what has gone before.
Then apply wool soaked in oil, and place it in the wound; and apply the bandage that we described. And sometimes the white siphak that we mentioned is cauterized after its incision, fearing a flow of blood. For this often happens. And leave the bandage until it falls off by itself.
If however its falling is delayed, then it should be moistened with warm water; and place upon it that which we mentioned, until it falls off.
Then treat the wound with the remaining treatment of wounds, until it is healed.
Chapter LXVI.
Concerning the windy ram.
In this type of ram, I have seen no one who dared to use iron for its treatment.
And the first, indeed, said that it happens as we have described in the ram which is with the vine. That is, to tie the vessels after incision, to pull them down with ease; then to cut in the middle, and to treat it finally with that which opens it, until the vessels fall; and to treat the wound, as we said, until it is healed.
Chapter LXVII.
Of the rupture which occurs in the groin.
When rupture occurs in the groin, as we said, and the area protrudes, and nothing from the intestines descends into the testicles; and if it does descend, it is little, and returns at all hours; but if time is prolonged with it, a fissure is added in the scrotum, until the intestines descend into the scrotum.
And that happens from the stretching of the scrotum, which is in the groin, as we said. That is, because the scrotum is stretched; then the area softens, and an abscess forms, and it protrudes.
And its treatment is with a cautery, as its previous description stated.
And sometimes it is treated with an iron, according to this method: and it is that the sick person lies on their back between your hands. Then cut the place of the abscess and protruding rupture, with a cut across its width, according to the amount of three fingers.
Then squeeze the scrotum and what is beneath the skin, until when the white scrotum is uncovered, which is beneath the skin that follows it.
Then take a rod, and place it over the protruding place of the scrotum, and press it to the depth of the belly.
Then sew two protruding places on the end of the rod from the scrotum, and connect one of them with the other with a suture; then pull out the end of the rod.
And do not cut the scrotum at all, nor stretch the egg, nor anything else, as I have made you know in the treatment of the intestinal branch.
Then treat it with the treatment of wounds. When therefore you cut the threads, cleanse it, and restore the wound until it is consolidated.
For the scrotum contracts, and no protrusion of the rupture is added.
And the cautery is better in this place, because it is closer to health.
Chapter LXVIII.
Concerning the softening of the skin of the testicles.
Often the skin of the testicles is softened in some men, on account of which the flesh between them is softened, and its appearance is disfigured.
Therefore it is necessary for the one who is asked about its treatment, to make the sick person lie on his back, and to cut off all the skin that is softened over the natural skin.
Then he shall join the two lips with suture; and if he wishes, he shall sew at first the excess of softened skin with three sutures, or four, and make the suture firm.
Then cut between the sutures.
Then treat the remaining wounds with treatment, until they are healed, and the threads fall out.
Chapter LXIX.
On Castration.
Know that castration is excommunicated in our law, and because of that it would be permissible for me not to mention it in this book of mine; and its mention is not necessary except for two reasons.
One of which is that it should be in the knowledge of the physician when questioned about it, and so that he may know the treatment for whoever suffers it.
And the other reason is that we frequently need the castration of certain animals, for our benefit through it, such as rams, boars, and cats, and similar animals.
Therefore, I say that castration is done in two ways. Or by attrition. Or by fissure and section.
In that which is done by attrition, the method of operation is: that we should place the animal in warm water, until its testicles are softened and relaxed, and hang down; then rub them with your hand, until they are dissolved and no longer appear under the touch.
In castration by fissure and section, it is necessary that you hold the animal, and press the skin of its testicles with your left hand.
Then tie the suspensory ligament, and cut over each testicle with one incision, until when two testicles are exposed; then cut them, after having scraped each one, and do not leave anything on them except a fine sifak, which is over the vessels.
And this method of castration is better than that which is done by attrition, because attrition perhaps leaves something of the testicles, wherefore the animal desires intercourse.
Then care for the wound until it heals.
Chapter 70.
Concerning the treatment of a hermaphrodite, two methods.
A hermaphrodite is from males in two ways. One of them is, because it appears in it what follows a space, or in the skin of the testicles, in what is between the two testicles, a figure like a woman's vulva, in which there are hairs; and sometimes urine flows from what is in the skin of the testicles.
In women, however, there is one species, and it is a woman's vulva on the pubis as small, completely male testicles, protruding outward: one of which is like a man's penis, and two like two testicles.
And the treatment of three species, two from men, and one species from women, is: because it is necessary to cut away the added flesh, until their impression escapes. Then treat them with the treatment of the other wounds.
In the second species of men, from which urine emerges, which is in the skin of the testicles, there is no operation, nor is there any treatment of it at all.
Chapter LXXI.
Concerning the incision of the Tentigo, and the protruding flesh in women's vulvas.
Tentigo perhaps is added upon the natural thing, until it is disfigured and its appearance becomes ugly; and sometimes it magnifies in some women so much, until it expands like in men, and reaches to the point of intercourse.
Therefore, you must hold the excess of Tentigo with your hand, or with a hook, and make an incision; and do not be extreme in the incision, especially in the deep root, so that a flow of blood does not occur.
Then treat it with the treatment of wounds, until it is healed.
However, the flesh that arises is flesh that is born in the orifice of the womb, until it fills it; and perhaps it emerges to the exterior in the likeness of a tail; and because of that, some first-named physicians call the ailment the tailed sickness. Therefore, it is necessary to incise it as we incise Tentigo, and to treat it until it is healed.
Concerning the treatment of Alratica, which is the unpierced vulva of a woman.
Chapter LXXII.
Alratica is, as it were, a woman's vulva that is not perforated, or is a small opening. And it is either natural or accidental.
Accidental is from illness that preceded: and indeed it comes about either from added flesh-growth, or from a subtle or thick sifach; and it arises either deep within the womb, or on its sides, or in its upper part, or its lower part; and it prevents intercourse and conception, and childbirth, and perhaps it prevents menstruation.
And its knowledge comes about through the obstetrician's observation, if an apparent obstruction is nearby.
If however it is not apparent, then seek it with your fingers, or with a rod.
If however the obstruction is from a subtle sifach, and is near the two lips: then hurry, and break it apart.
And it is, that you place cushions on the two lips.
Then place your index fingers of both hands together, and let the woman be on her back with her legs outstretched. Then extend the two lips with strength, until the subtle sifach is broken and the obstruction is opened.
Then take wool and soak it in oil, and place it over the place: and let the woman do this every day, so that the place does not consolidate again.
If however the sifach is thick, dense: then it is necessary to cut it away with a broad spatula similar to a myrtle leaf.
If however the obstruction is born of flesh, then suspend it with hooks, and cut it: and have with you medicines that cease the flow of blood without causing a bite, such as acacia, and dragon's blood, and frankincense mixed with egg white.
Then administer a wide lead cannula, so that the wound does not quickly consolidate, hold it for several days: and administer linen cloth made of dry flax, then treat the rest with the usual treatment, until it heals.
And sometimes in the womb there are births of other fleshy masses: it is necessary therefore that they be cut in this way: as long as it is not a cancerous abscess; for a cancerous abscess that is in the womb, there should be no conflict with iron at all.
Chapter LXXIII.
Concerning the treatment of hemorrhoids, Athehelil, and red boils in women's vulvas.
Hemorrhoids are indeed an opening of the veins' orifices, until much blood flows from them continuously.
When hemorrhoids grow old, they become thelil; and I have already spoken in the division of their species and their signs; and I will say here what receives treatment from them and what does not.
Therefore, I say that hemorrhoids which are in the orifice of the womb, and do not appear to the senses, then there is no cure for them with iron.
However, those of them which are in the orifice of the womb above which sense falls, are those which are cured.
Therefore, it is necessary to introduce the woman into a cool house. Then, extend the thelil with scissors, or with a rough cloth, and cut them from their roots.
Then, sprinkle over them, at the flow of blood, from one powder of the incisions without mordication: such as acacia, and dragon's blood, and frankincense, and similar to them.
Then let him drive her feet against the wall for one hour. Afterwards, place her in cold water.
If the flow of blood persists: then make her sit in a decoction of sumac, and quince bark, and gallnuts, and similar things.
Then take barley flour, and make it with honey and vinegar, and make a plaster with it over her back.
If therefore the blood is cut off with it, it is good; and if not, make cupping adhere to the back and armpits, without scarification.
Then take wool, and immerse it in the juice of tarathit, or the juice of arnoglossa, or the juice of alaulat branches, that is, aglanter, Pontic wine, and make it adhere to the wound.
When therefore the abscess is quiet, then treat the place with ointments, until it is healed.
Albarth, however, is red, similar to alhaasse heads, and is of harsh appearance.
Therefore, you should cut away what appears from it, according to what I said in the thelil equally, and treat it until it is healed.
Chapter LXXIV.
Concerning the perforation of the exit which happens in the womb.
Many kinds of abscesses occur in the womb, such as cancer, and stony abscess, and ulcers, and adubelati, and alekilati, that is, herpes, carbuncles, and fistulas, and hemorrhoids, and cracks, and thelil, and hot abscess.
And I have already spoken of all these illnesses and their varieties, and their signs, and their treatments in the divisions; it is necessary that I say in this treatise about the hot abscess that occurs in the womb, when it is from the abscesses which collect pus, and you wish to know how its opening is made with an iron.
Therefore, it is necessary to consider. Then if the pain of the abscess in its beginning is sharp with its percussion, and inflammation, and fever; and you see it red; if the sensation falls upon it, then do not hurry with its perforation; and treat it with that which helps in its maturation, until when the sharpness of the symptoms subsides.
Then it is necessary that you make the woman sit on a seat that has two cushions, and that she recline, or be supported on her back, and that she draw her feet towards the lower part of her abdomen; and that her thighs be spread apart, and that she place her arms under her knees, and tie each with a suitable bandage to it.
Then let the midwife sit on the right side, and administer the instrument with which the opening of the womb is opened.
And it is necessary, when you wish to administer this instrument, that you place it with the radius deep within the woman's womb, so that what enters from the instrument is not more than the depth of the womb, and harms the weak one.
However, if the instrument is more than the depth, then it is necessary that you place cushions on the lining of the womb's depth, so that the entire instrument's entrance into the depth of the womb is prohibited; and it is necessary that the winding, which runs along the instrument, be placed from the upper side; and that the attendant holds the instrument and turns the winding until the depth of the womb is opened.
When therefore the exit appears, and is touched by the hand, and is smooth and soft, then it is necessary to separate it at its head with a wide spatula.
When therefore the pus is evacuated, then it is necessary to place a linen cloth soaked in rose oil, or green oil, in which there is some astringency, on the wound; and place the cloth, and extract the section in the depth of the womb.
And place externally over the womb, and over the lining, clean wool soaked in water in which mallows have been boiled.
Then treat it after two days with an ointment suitable for it, until it is healed.
And sometimes the womb and the wound are washed, so that it is irrigated with water and honey; then with water in which the lily root or long aristolochia has been boiled; then return to the ointment.
If the wound is hidden inside the womb, then it is necessary to refrain from treating it with iron, indeed, treat it with what we said in the division.
Chapter LXX.
Teachings of Midwives, how living embryos are treated, having emerged in a non-natural form.
It is necessary for the midwife to first know the form of natural birth.
Therefore, by its signs, when you see a woman pressing downwards, and desiring to smell the air, and feeling relieved from that which is upon her concerning childbirth, and the embryo's exit is hastened: then know that this birth is according to the natural form, and its exit is above its head, and the afterbirth with it: or hanging, or depending from the navel.
Therefore, when you see these signs, then it is necessary that her abdomen be pressed, so that the embryo descends quickly.
For when it descends upon its head, the afterbirth descends with it, and it is cleansed from those superfluities by good cleansing.
However, that which is besides this birth is unnatural, blameworthy.
Because sometimes the fetus emerges upon its feet, and its body emerges before its head, and its feet, and its hands together, or one of its feet: or its head and its hand emerge: or its navel emerges: and perhaps it turns upon its neck, and similar things from blameworthy figures.
Therefore, it is necessary for the midwife to be prudent, subtle in all these matters, and to beware of error and deception: and I am showing every figure among them, and how the nature is in it, and how it should be interpreted and dealt with.
When the fetus emerges upon its head in its natural exit, and it becomes violent upon the woman, and difficult is her delivery, and you see her strength already weakened: then have her sit on a seat, or let women hold her: and steam her vulva with decocted fennel and with moist oils.
Then let the midwife insert a small spatula between her fingers, and split the afterbirth with it, and cut it with her nail until that which is in it of moisture flows: and press the woman's abdomen until the fetus descends.
If, however, it does not descend, then it is necessary for the woman to be administered an enema of fennel mucilage, with sesame oil.
Then command her, after the enema, to be compressed: and make her sneeze with condiments, and hold her mouth and nose for an hour. For the fetus will emerge immediately.
If, however, two hands of the fetus emerge first, it is necessary that you return them with ease gradually. If, however, it does not obey in its entry, then place the woman upon a seat, and raise her feet upwards; then shake the seat on the ground: and the woman must be held so that she does not fall during the shaking.
If, therefore, the hands do not emerge, and the fetus dies, then cut them and extract the remainder of the fetus: and tie its hand with a cloth, and extract it with equality; for it will emerge.
The exit of the embryo is above its feet. When the fetus emerges above its feet, then it is necessary that you push them upwards; then turn the fetus gradually; afterwards make it equal.
Then take one of its feet and extend it gradually.
When, therefore, they emerge up to the hips, then order him to be compressed, and cause him to sneeze with condiments; for it will emerge, if God wills.
And if it does not emerge with what we have described, then return the fetus gradually until you place it in its natural form. For it will then emerge with easy exit.
If it is prevented with all that we have described, then take from marsh-mallow mucilage, and sesame oil, and dissolved gum: and pound the whole in a mortar with good pounding: then apply it with the woman's vulva, and the lower part of her abdomen. Then make her sit in warm water until she achieves hypocondriacs.
When therefore you see that her lower parts are now warmed, then make her a poultice of myrrh, and apply it. When therefore the poultice holds for one hour, then make her sit on a seat. Then make her sneeze, and pinch her nose and mouth, and press the lower part of her abdomen with gentle pressure. For the fever will depart immediately.
The exit of the fetus is upon the knees and hands. When it exits in this way, then gently insert her hands. Then the woman will lie back on her back, and let her feet hang down: and let her lie on the bed, and fold her hands. Then press on her abdomen gently. Then pull out what is under her feet from the cushions, until it is prepared in the lower part. If the fetus does not emerge, then take her feet and move them with vigorous motion. Then press on what is above the hypochondria gently, until the fetus ascends upwards. Then let her insert her hands, and gently adjust the fetus: and tell the woman to press, until the fetus emerges.
The exit of the fetus, hanging lengthwise from the hands. Let his hand be introduced into the reduction. If however he cannot reduce it, then lift the woman, and make her walk.
If, however, she cannot walk, then make her lie on the bed, and shake her legs with a violent shaking.
Then administer the liniment that you prepared from the mucilaginous substances.
If she receives it by childbirth, then make her sit on a seat. Then strive in the reduction of the hand, and restore the foetus to its natural shape. And make the woman sneeze, and command her to compress herself until it emerges.
The exit of the foetus is over her neck, with outstretched hands, and its face is toward the mother's back. The midwife must hold the foetus's hand, then gradually turn it over, and straighten it easily.
When it is straightened, then place on its vulva what we have described of oil and mucilages.
Then command her to move gradually. When you have done that, then make her sit on a seat, and command her to lean to the right side. Then command her to compress herself, and make her sneeze with condiments.
The exit of the prepared fetus on the side. When it descends to the orifice of the womb in this manner with the afterbirth, then cut the afterbirth with your fingernail until it is evacuated from the moisture.
If therefore it is suspended over the face of the fetus, and its neck, then cut it from the navel so that it is not retained and dies.
Then push the fetus inwards until you place it as it should be, and command the woman to compress herself several times; for it will exit with a slight expulsion.
The exit of twins, or many fetuses. Know that twins are often born, and sometimes three or four are born. However, that is unusual and rarely happens.
However, five is a thing outside nature, and they do not survive at all; and though they multiply, they are contained by a single afterbirth, and are separated by a membrane, distinguishing them, tied to the umbilical cord of each of them.
And sometimes they emerge like a single fetus emerges by a natural, easy exit, and they emerge by an unpraiseworthy exit, as we have narrated.
If some of them are difficult at birth, and they reach the unnatural shapes we mentioned, then treat them as we have narrated: and let the midwife be skillful, and do what she does with ease and slowness, and devise according to every shape with what is prepared for her from ingenuity leading to health.
A recollection of what is formed in the womb from embryos, and miscarriages.
Sometimes one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, and more than ten are formed in the womb; and it has been verified with me that one woman expelled seven, and another fifteen, all formed, through miscarriage.
That which was done by the measurement of the glorious wise one.
This, therefore, everything ought to be in the knowledge of the Midwife. For perhaps it will come to her similar to that; therefore, let her oppose it with that which is appropriate.
Chapter LXXVI.
On the extraction of a dead fetus.
When you treat a dead fetus with what I have said concerning division from the medication, and it does not emerge, and you are compelled to use an operation with the hand, then you ought to consider.
If, therefore, the woman is of sound constitution, and is not suffering from any of the complications from which harm is feared for her: then it is necessary that the woman be laid on the bed, on her back, and her head inclined downwards, and her legs raised; and the attendant hold her by two sides, or she be bound to the bed, so that her body is not moved during the extraction of the fetus.
Then moisten the mouth of the womb with moist oils, with the mucilage of marshmallow, and fenugreek, and linseed.
Then let the midwife anoint her hand with these oils and mucilages; then let her introduce it into the womb with ease. Then let her seek with it the place where she can fix the hooks from the fetus, and the suitable places for it.
Therefore, consider then, if the fetus is prepared to descend with its head foremost: then fix the hooks in its eyes, or in its neck, or in its mouth, or in its palate, or under its chin, or in its fork, or in places near the ribs, and under the hypochondria.
If however the descent is with its feet foremost, then in its pubic bone and its middle ribs.
And it is necessary that she hold the hook with her right hand, and place its curve in that which is between the fingers of her left hand; and let her introduce it with her hand with ease, and fix the hook in any of those places that we have mentioned, until she reaches the empty space.
Then let her fix another hook, or a third, if necessary, in opposition to it, so that the contraction is equal, and does not lean to one side.
Then let it be extended with equal extension, and let the extension not only be straight, but rather move in every direction, so that its exit is eased, as is done with a tooth in its extraction.
And it is necessary that in that which is between them, the extension be softened. If a part of it is retained, then the midwife should anoint some fingers with oil, and introduce them from the side, so that she may revolve with them that which is retained.
If therefore a part of the fetus emerges, then the hooks should be moved to another higher place; do this until the whole fetus emerges.
If, therefore, a hand emerges before the others, and it is not possible to return it, because of its constriction, then it is necessary to wrap a cloth around it. Then pull it out until, when the whole emerges, cut it either at the ankle joint, or at the elbow: and thus it is necessary that you should do in the other hand, and in the two feet.
If, however, the fetus' head is large, or constriction occurs in its exit, or water is collected in its head, then it is necessary to introduce a spiny Spatumile between the fingers, and to split the head with it, and to extract the water; or to break it with the instrument called Almisdac: whose form comes with the forms of the other instruments in the chapter that is after this.
Similarly, let him do so if the fetus has a naturally large head, then it is necessary to sever the [fetus] with algengematu, or extract it with a misdach, as we have said. Then pull out the bones with forceps.
If the head emerges and is constricted at the fork, then it is to be split until the moisture in the chest is poured out.
If, however, it is not tangled nor yields to exit, then cut the head into pieces, according to what is possible for you.
If the lower belly has an abscess, or has dropsy in it, then it is necessary to pierce it until moisture runs from it.
If the fetus is above its feet, then its extraction is easy, and its direction to the mouth of the womb is slight.
If, however, it is constricted at the belly or chest, then it is necessary to extract it with a cloth wrapped around your hand; and split the belly or chest until what is within them flows out.
If however, the other limbs are removed, and the head returns, then let the midwife insert her left hand. If therefore the mouth of the womb is open, then let her insert her hand deep into the womb, and seek the head with it, and pull it with her fingers up to the mouth of the womb; then insert into it one hook, or two hooks, and pull it with it.
If however, the mouth of the womb is constricted, due to a hot abscess which occurs there, then it is not necessary to exert labour upon it, but it is necessary then to administer an effusion of moist, fatty things; and administer plasters; and sit in waters which soften and moisten.
If the foetus is on its side, then it is possible to straighten it; then administer what we have said concerning a living foetus.
If that is not possible, then it should be cut into pieces and extracted.
And it is necessary that you not leave anything of the afterbirth inside at all.
When therefore you have completed your operation, then administer what we have said concerning hot abscesses which occur in wombs.
If a flow of blood occurs, then it should be placed in styptic waters, and administer the rest of the treatment.
And I myself have already seen a woman in whose womb a dead fetus was; then she became pregnant again over it, afterwards another fetus died as well. Therefore, a long time later, an abscess occurred in her navel, and it became swollen until it opened, and began to discharge pus.
Therefore I was called to treat her, and I treated her for a long time, and the wound did not heal.
Therefore I placed upon it some plasters of strong attraction, and bone came out of the place. Then a few days passed, and another bone came out. Therefore I was surprised by this, since there is no bone in the belly.
Therefore I thought, because they were bones from a dead fetus.
Then I sought the wound, and extracted many bones, the woman being in better condition: and now she has lived thus for a long time, and sends out a little pus from the place.
And I did not establish this as extraneous here, except because there is knowledge and assistance in it for the treatment that a skilled physician performs with his hand.
Chapter LXXVII.
Concerning the shapes of necessary instruments in the extraction of a fetus.
The shape of the Vertex by which the matrix is opened.
Below here is the shape of the Strictorium, by which books are equalized, to which are equally two vertices at the two ends of two pieces of wood. However, this vertex should be finer than the strictorium, and to make it, it should be either from ebony or from boxwood.
And the width of each piece of wood is about two fingers: and the margin of each of the two is about one finger, and the length of each of them is a palm and a half: and in the middle of the two pieces of wood are two additions of the same kind of wood, which are now fixed to both, whose length is half a palm and a little more: and the width of each is about two fingers, or a little more.
And these two additions are inserted into the mouth of the matrix, so that it is opened with them when you turn the two Vertices.
Another form similar to that, finer and lighter.
Let it be made of ebony wood, or boxwood, according to the likeness of forceps. However, at its extremity let there be two additions, as you see here above: and the length of each addition of them is like a palm; and the breadth of each is two fingers.
When therefore you wish to open the womb with it, then cause the woman to sit on a bed, with her feet hanging down, opening what is between her thighs. Then introduce these two joined additions into the womb, and you hold the lower end of the instrument between her thighs. Then open your hand with the instrument, as you do with shears, equally according to the amount you wish to open the mouth of the womb, until the midwife does what she wants.
Another form of Vertigo, which the ancients called the Impelling Form, by which the fetus is impelled.
The Almisdac form, by which the large head is crushed; and it is likened to a pair of tongs, which have teeth at the end, as you see.
And sometimes it is elongated, like tongs of this form, as you see, with teeth like saw teeth, with which it is cut and crushed.
The form of a hook having one spine.
The form of a hook having two spines.
The form of a scalpel with two ends for severing the head.
The form of two also broad scalpels.
All these instruments are used, and the more their types are multiplied, and prepared by the craftsman, the swifter he is at his operation, and the higher in esteem among men, due to their quantity.
Therefore, do not despise any instrument from among them, unless it is prepared for you. For their necessity is unexcusable.
Chapter LXXVIII.
Concerning the extraction of the Secundine.
When the Secundine is retained at childbirth, then it is necessary that you instruct the woman to hold her breath. Then make her sneeze with remedies, and press your hand upon her mouth and nostrils. If therefore it emerges by this means, it is good.
If not, then take a pot, and pierce a hole in the lid; and place in it herbs that open the mother's womb, such as calamint, rue, dill, camomile, sea-salt, cinnamon wood, and centaury: take all these herbs, or some of them, and immerse them in water, and place them on the fire.
Then place a reed-tube over the hole of the pot's lid, and the other end in the woman's womb: and let her hold it until the vapor reaches the cavity of the womb.
Then make her sneeze, as we have said. For the afterbirth will emerge with ease.
If however it remains after this treatment, and does not emerge, then instruct the midwife to immerse her hand in sesame oil, or marsh-mallow mucilage. Then let her insert it into the vagina, and seek out the afterbirth with it. When therefore she finds it, then let her take it and gently pull it out.
If however it is attached deep within the uterus, then let her insert her hand, as we have described, until when she finds the afterbirth, and pull it out gently along the correct path, so that the uterus does not fall with violent pulling; rather, it should be moved easily to the right and left sides, then the pulling force should be increased. For it then yields, and is preserved, and escapes from adhesion.
If the opening of the uterus is constricted, as we have already described, treat it with sneezing, and with a medicinal decoction of herbs.
If, however, it does not emerge with all that we have described, then beware of tiring yourself out repeatedly trying to pull it out.
But it is necessary that whatever emerges from it to the opening of the uterus be tied to the woman's hip. Then administer an enema with the tetrapharmacon ointment. For this will putrefy it after days, and it will dissolve, and emerge.
However, when it putrefies, a foul odor rises from it to the stomach and head, and harms the weak one. Therefore, suitable fumigations should be administered to it.
Some of the ancients, however, have already experienced the fumigation of nasturtium and dried figs.
The shape of the instrument with which a woman is fumigated in cases of retained Secundinae and menses.
Let it be made of glass, similar to an alembic, or of bronze; and let the wide end be placed over the fire; and let the fumigation be placed over the prunings; let it hold it, until that fumigation is consumed; and again another.
Chapter LXXIX.
Concerning the treatment of a non-perforated anus.
Many children are born with their anuses not perforated, which have already been obstructed by a fine sifac. Therefore, the midwife should perforate that sifac with her finger; and if not, let her perforate it with a sharp spatula; and let her beware of touching the fleshy part.
Then place upon it wool soaked in wine and oil. Then treat it with ointments until it is healed.
If however you fear that it will be obstructed, then place a lead cannula in the opening for many days, and let it be removed when the child wishes to defecate.
And obstruction of the anus can also occur from the consolidation of a wound or an abscess. Therefore, that consolidation must be cut, then treated with what we have said about treatment and lead.
Chapter LXXX.
Concerning the treatment of fistulas that occur in the lower part.
Fistulas occurring in the lower part are swellings and thicknesses that occur near the anus externally, or in the space of one of the parts, and are either one fistula or several.
When that swelling has aged, it opens, and from it flows watery white moisture, or thin pus.
And sometimes these fistulas are penetrating. Therefore, penetrating ones are recognized by what emerges during defecation and flatulence when the patient uses defecation; and perhaps worms emerge from them.
And some of these fistulas, when penetrating, are in the space reaching the bladder and reaching the urethra. And some of them penetrate as far as the hip joint and as far as the tailbone.
By this, a penetrating fistula to the anus is recognized, even from a non-penetrating one, that you insert your index finger into the anus and introduce a thin probe into the fistula, made of air or iron, when there is no twisting.
If there is twisting in it, then introduce a thin lead probe into it, or a hair from a horse's mane, until you feel the probe or hair on your finger.
If you do not feel it completely, nor does anything pass from the opening in terms of excretion, nor wind, nor worms as I said: then know that it is not penetrating: therefore hurry to the cure.
And when the fistula penetrates to the bladder or to the urinary meatus: then its sign is the discharge of urine from it, and its prevention from this in order that the place may consolidate with medicines.
If however it penetrates to the hip joint or to the hip bone: then its sign is that the probe reaches there, if there is no twisting to the bone: and the finding of pain around the part, and that pus issues from it always: and that the treatment does not work in it, nor does it consolidate with ointment.
And in all these penetrating fistulas there is no cure at all: and their cure is labour and vanity for him, from foolish physicians, upon whom it is formed.
However, in that which is not penetrating and not ancient, healing is hoped for with the saw: according to what I tell you, and I have already proven: and it is that the sick person should lie between your hands on their back: and raise their legs up above their hips, and their hips should be inclined towards their stomach. Then introduce a lead or copper probe, if there is twisting in the fistula, until you know where the probe reaches.
If however the patient feels it around the anus, then it is necessary that you introduce your index finger into the anus.
If therefore you feel the probe already having penetrated itself, detected, besides that you feel between your finger, and between it, some sinew or flesh: then you know for certain that it is penetrating: therefore do not labor on it, for there is no healing of it, as we said.
However, they say that in some men the flesh is healed, and that through medication by which help is hoped for, it is that you cauterize a fine cautery according to the width of the fistula, as preceded, and insert it ignited into the fistula, until it reaches near the anus. Then repeat it twice, or three times, until you know that all those added filtered fleshy parts, which are similar to the quill of a bird's feather, are now burned.
Then treat it with lint wrapped in butter, until those burned flesh parts come out; then treat it with ointments that generate flesh and consolidate it.
If therefore it is healed, it is good.
And if not, then it will never be healed with any other treatment.
And if a protrusion emerges, and it does not reach your finger in the anus, and there is a thick layer of flesh between it and the protrusion, or if such a thing is there: and you see a fistula in that which follows the surface of the skin, then cut the skin from the beginning of the fistula, and you go on cutting with the protrusion that is in the fistula, until the cut reaches where the protrusion's tip reaches, and the protrusion is released and falls.
Then purify those filtered flesh parts, which are similar to the quill of a bird, so that nothing remains from them.
If, however, blood overcomes you, and separates you from your operation in that you cut those tissues, then it is better, and of more rapid benefit, to cauterize it with fire or with a sharp medicine.
Because cautery with fire brings about good conditions, by burning those added tissues, and cutting off the blood, and drying the moisture.
Then treat it with linens wrapped in butter, or crushed herbs, until the area discharges pus, and those burned tissues are expelled in the pus.
Then treat the wound with consolidating ointments, which generate firm flesh, and there are medicines containing astringency and drying.
For when it is restored, then it is already healed, and you need not fear repetition.
If however the fistula has already reached the depth of the anus, and is prolonged by bodily excess, then insert your finger into the anus and investigate with it.
If therefore you feel a barrier, and between you and it is a membrane of sifac, or flesh, and it is close to penetration, then there is no operation on it, unless according to the path of trust and hope.
This is because it is treated in one of three ways: either to cauterize it, as we said; or to cut it back until you reach its concavity, so that it is possible for you to insert lint, and treatment from nearby. And do not proceed very far with the cutting, so that you do not cut the muscle containing the anus, and cause an unwanted expulsion from the weak bowel. Then treat it with what we said.
Perhaps it will be healed; or you will remove the membrane, and clean it after you have cut it back near the anus, as we said, either with a probe, or with another instrument with a sharp end. Then cleanse those filtered tissues that are in the incision, until you can see clearly with the probe.
Then attempt to restore the entire wound with an incision, and an opening above where it is consolidated; and a fistula will remain open in the inner part of the anus, and it will be easier on the patient.
And sometimes the fistula is sewn in this way: and it is when you insert a probe into the fistula; and it is on the side of the anus near the surface of the body with the skin and margin of the anus; then take a probe with a perforated end, which is like an aleshkef needle, that is, for preparing leather, according to this form. And insert into it a thread wrapped with five threads, and about that. Then insert the probe with the thread into the fistula, until it reaches its concavity.
If therefore it is penetrating into the inner margin of the anus nearby, then pull the thread out of that opening; so that you insert your finger into the anus, and pull out the end of the thread, and bring the two ends together; and tie each, and leave it for one, or two days; and the more the thread penetrates the flesh, the more tightly tie it, until the flesh between the two ends of the thread is cut, and falls away; then treat the wound until it is consolidated and healed.
If however the opening of the fistula is not penetrating, then make it penetrate in whatever way is prepared for you, unless it is very deep. For it is not in your power to do that because of the arm, so that you do not injure it.
Then do with it as we said, until it is healed.
The shape of the thorny spatula with which the fistula is split, whose curve is very sharp, and the other part is not sharp, so that it does not injure what is not necessary, as you see.
Chapter LXXXI.
Concerning the suturing of hemorrhoids, from which blood flows from their incision; and the treatment of fissures.
Hemorrhoids are of two kinds. For they are either within the anus, like vesicles of charcoal or prunes; or like bunches of grapes themselves. And from them are small and large ones; and blood flows from them always, and there is one, and there are many. And there are outside the anus, and at its extremities.
However, those that are outside the anus, are mostly few in moisture, from which flows yellow water, or little blood with persistent flow; and they are according to the color of the body.
And the treatment of that which is within the anus is, that you command the sick person to strain: and it is to be pressed out, until it emerges from the anus, and the athelil appear to you. Therefore also suspend them with hooks, or hold them with your fingernail. Then cut them at their roots.
However, if the hooks are not retained in them, due to their moisture and their softening: then take them with a rough cloth, or with a cloth made of double-layered wool, and extract them with your fingers. Then cut them, and after the incision, powder some hot powders over them, so that they stand in place of a cautery. Or cauterize them according to what has preceded in the chapter on cauterization. Then treat them with the rest of the treatment, until they are healed.
If the anus does not yield to evacuation, then administer an enema to the infirm person containing a small amount of irritant, so that it is washed out with that which is in the anus, and it yields to evacuation quickly, when the infirm person expels it.
If, however, the piles are external from the anus, then their removal is light, easy: and it is that you seize them with your fingernail, or seize them with a hook, and cut them. Then treat them with what we have said, until they are healed.
And whoever abhors incision with iron, then it is necessary that you administer their suture according to this method. Take a wound thread, and insert it into the needle. Then pull the piles upward, and make it pierce with the needle into its root from the other side: and wrap the two ends of the thread, at the lower part of the needle, and let them be lengthwise: and tighten the piles with a strong ligature. Then tie the thread, and remove the needle.
Do that with all the piles, and leave one of them: nor its own, so that excess blood may run from it.
Then place over the anus a cloth soaked in rose oil, or cedar oil, and place it over the anus: and order the sick person to rest. Then leave it, until it falls.
When therefore the piles fall, treat them with ointments and other remedies until they are healed.
Concerning the treatment of Fissures. For they often occur from the drying up of feces and the constriction of nature.
When therefore they become old and medicine does not work on them, then it is necessary to scrape them with a pointed spatula or with your fingernail until they become moist, and to remove from them the outer layer which prevents them from consolidating. Then treat them until they consolidate as they should.
If however they do not consolidate, then scrape them again with a more forceful instrument than the first, until they bleed profusely and are abraded; then treat them until they heal.
Concerning the treatment of inverted and non-inverted Almirmar, and of dry Athelil and Formicae.
Chapter LXXXII.
Know that Almirmar is nothing other than a round swelling the color of the body, similar to the head of a nail; and it occurs throughout the body, particularly in the lower parts of the feet and toes; and pain arises from it when walking.
Therefore, it is necessary to cut what is around the head of the nail, and hold it with scissors, or with a hook, and uproot it from its root.
Then treat it; and if you wish, cauterize it according to what preceded in its chapter.
From dry athelil, one is a small, rough, filtered, round eminence above the surface of the body. And they often occur on the hands of children.
And its treatment is that you extend the athelil and cut it; or tie it with a silk thread; or with a hair, until it falls. And if you wish, cauterize it according to what was said before with fire or with a sharp medicine; and now inverted athelil are eradicated, and not inverted with the instrument that I will name.
A formica, however, is also a small, filtered, thick eminence on the surface of the body, going deep very much; and when it encounters cold, a sensation similar to an ant bite is felt in it, and it spreads throughout the body; and most of it occurs on the hands.
And its treatment is to take a cannula from a goose's feather or a strong vulture's feather; and place that cannula upon the Formica, until the cannula's circle encompasses its parts. Then turn your hand with the cannula until you separate what is around the Formica; and place it deep in the flesh, and eradicate the Formica from its root.
And if you wish, do it with a cannula of air or iron, according to this form.
Let the cannula's top be raised to a height pulling the deaf wrapped one, so that its grip and its turning around the finger are alleviated.
And if you wish, cauterize the Formica according to what was stated previously in the cauterization of Athelil in the chapter on the cautery.
Chapter LXXXIII.
Concerning the forms of instruments which are administered for clysters in diseases of the anus, and for emptying the bowels, and for colic.
Sometimes a clyster is made from silver, or from bronze, or from cast copper, or from hammered copper.
And sometimes it is made from these instruments small, and large, according to those in which they are administered.
Therefore, that which is administered in the treatment of small children, should be small: and those whose anuses are weak, or painful, so too should their clysters be.
Large clyster.
Its tube, that is, the upper head to which the bag is tied, should be large in this way; and there should be a distinction so that the bag is tied as you see, and its lower end which is inserted into the anus, should be blunt, that is, not open, smooth, very much, drawing to thinness; and on one side of it there are two holes, and on the other side one hole.
And the size of the hole should be according to the thickness of the rays, and a little thicker; and the bag in which the medicines are placed should be from the bladder of an animal, or from the egg-shell, which should be in the form of a small asofrat; whose root should be one palm.
And it should be pierced with many holes, as it is rolled, and the space between each hole should be the thickness of a finger. Then insert strong thread, made of ten threads or thereabouts, through those holes, and tie the bag to it, as if it were an asofrat. When the bag is therefore placed in it, it should be tightened at the head of the enema between the two distinguishing constrictions firmly. Then administer the enema with it.
And this is the form of the bags, depicted here, and the holes.
However, the quality of administering the enema with it is: to fill the bag, or bladder, with the medicine, which should be heated according to the patient's tolerance; and be careful that it is not too hot, or too cold.
Then the patient shall lie on their back, and raise their legs upwards; and place underneath them a *inthaan*, that is, a hide on which people lie, or a linen cloth.
Then anoint the end of the clyster with oil, or with egg white, or with the mucilage of fenugreek, or similar substances. Then introduce it into the anus with ease. Then let the attendant grasp the bag with both hands simultaneously, and squeeze it forcefully until all that is in the clyster is evacuated into the intestine.
Then remove the clyster, and let the patient raise their legs towards the wall.
If the medicine compels him to the outcome, then let him hold it as long as possible. And if he sleeps with it all night, it is more beneficial.
If, however, you administer the clyster in illnesses of looseness of the belly, and its exit is hurried: then repeat the clyster, until he is cured.
If there are hemorrhoids or damaging abscesses in the anus, then let the clyster be very fine, gentle, from the clysters with which children are treated.
And this should be the form of a fine clyster, above which there is tight skin.
Chapter Eighty-four.
I have already said in the division concerning the treatment of wounds that it was appropriate for this book, and I will now describe their treatment with the hand, and with medicines, in accordance with their entirety.
Therefore, I say that wounds are diversified according to the thing by which they are made, and according to the place upon which the wound falls.
Therefore, the things by which wounds are often made are like the throwing of a stone, or the cutting of a sword or knife, or a blow with a spear, or wood, or an arrow, and similar things from many objects.
And the wounds that are made according to the places of the body are, such as a wound that falls upon the head, or neck, or breast, or belly, or liver; and similar ones from those members.
And I am recounting the treatments of certain wounds, so that I may establish that reasoning and rule concerning the remaining wounds.
And I will begin with simple wounds of the head, because the treatment of compound wounds will come at the beginning of the third chapter.
I say therefore. When a simple wound occurs on the head, and there is no fracture of the bone: then consider, if it is from the throwing of a stone, or similar things, and it has only broken the skin; and it is a large wound, and you fear a bad outcome from a hot abscess; then hurry, and immediately perform a cephalic phlebotomy; and do not delay it; and draw from its blood according to the measure of its power; if nothing prevents it from the phlebotomy, especially if the blood flowing from the wound is small in quantity. And let the phlebotomy be on the opposite side of the wounded area.
And let the phlebotomy be on the opposite side of the wounded area. And let the patient beware of repletion, and wine, and heavy foods.
If, however, something prevents the lessening, then lessen from food, and let him not approach meats, nor wines.
And if a hot abscess occurs on the wound, apply a poultice infused in rose oil alone, or with wine that contains astringency.
If, however, you are certain of no hot abscess, then place on the wound, if it is recent with its own blood, and the air has not changed it, the powder which I will describe shortly; and if the air has already changed it, then apply certain ointments to it until it is healed.
If, however, the wound is large, or is from a sword cut, and the like; and its edges do not come together by means of pledgets, then bring them together with sutures, according to what I will describe in wounds of the belly concerning their sutures.
If, however, the wound is already exposed by the bone, and hangs, and its retention is only in a small suspender: then cut it. Then treat the wound with medicines, and restore the hard flesh in place of the skin, and order the sick person to be nourished with foods that are substantial, such as heads of grain, and cooked wheat, until it is like a pulp; and things similar to these.
If you find putrefaction in the skin, and it does not adhere to the bone, then cut away all the putrefied part, and cast it off; then treat it.
If, however, in these wounds there is an artery, or a vein from which blood flows; and it is not stopped by medicines, then inquire about the artery. If therefore you find it not cut, then cut it with a Spatumili, or tie it. If necessity compels it when what we have said is not helpful, then cauterize it until the blood is stopped.
If, however, these wounds are small, simple, then their treatment is easy, slight; so that you pulverize this powder upon them, because it consolidates them before air changes them.
Method of the flesh-healing powder. Take one part of frankincense, and two parts of dragon's blood, and three parts of quicklime; let the whole be finely ground and sifted; and fill the wound with it, and bind it with a good bandage, until it adheres well to it and coagulates with the blood.
Then bind it over with bandages and leave it, and do not loosen it while it remains, so that it may not fester. For the medicine is not removed from it until it is healed.
And sometimes lime alone does this, when frankincense and dragon's blood are not available.  Even dragon's blood does the same in many large wounds, when it is appropriate to put it on them and bind them, and are fresh wounds with their own blood, which air has not altered.
If, however, air has already altered them with some alteration, especially when it is in summer, then this powder is not intended for this position. Therefore, treat it with what we have said, that you place some digestive ointments on them; or place poultices of barley flour made with water and honey on them, until they emit pus. Then treat them with the rest of the treatment until they are healed.
However, if a fracture in a bone occurs with the wound, and it is small, then extract it with force: and I will now describe the treatment of skull fractures in what is to follow.
Of wounds of the neck.
If, however, a wound occurs in the neck, then there is no difference between it in treatment, and a simple head wound.
If, however, a nerve of the neck, or artery, has already been cut: then if it is a nerve, there is no skill in it, except to avoid its treatment with that which produces violent astringency, such as ziniar, and zegi, and similar things. Because they harm the nerves, and contract them.
And do not place anything cold on the wound at all: because the substance of the nerves is cold, and its continuation is with the brain, which is higher than the limbs: and let that by which it is treated be from mild medicines, such as lime washed with sweet water sometimes infused with oil, or with rose oil, and tutty, when washed also with sweet water: and the rest of the mineral stones, according to this manner, and moist ointments.
If, however, the wound is large, then administer a suture: or constrict its lips with powders. Then treat it until it is healed.
If however the wound has depth, or a sinus occurs in its lower part, in which pus already collects, then pierce it in the more depressed place in it.
If, however, an artery has been incised in the wound, and its blood flow has followed: then separate, or cut it, and tie it: or cauterize it, if the need provokes that.
If, however, the cartilages of the throat, or the whole throat, have been injured, and the surrounding tissues have been saved, then bring together the skin's edges with a suture over the throat's cartilage, and do not touch the throat itself, but rather level it and restore it to its natural shape. Then bind it with a suitable bandage, and leave it for a few days. Then treat it with ointments which contain astringency and drying, until it is healed.
If, however, the wound has already made an impression on the bone, then investigate it. Then, if there are bone fragments within it, remove them all, or as many as you can; and leave that which cannot be removed until the wound has festered, and its exit is separated and relieved.
If the wound is recent, then powder over it the powder which I have described. If, however, bone is seen in the wound, and it becomes a fistula, then treat it with what is recalled in its chapter.
Concerning a wound in the shoulder blades.
If there is a blow from a lance or a knife, and you see its depth, then consider. If, therefore, wind emerges from the wound, when the sick person gasps from it, then know that the wound is mortal.
If there is no depth to it, and it is fresh with its own blood: then do not place powder on it from the first hour, nor bind it, so that the blood is not retained in its depth, and returns to the heart, and kills the sick person: but place attracting ointment on it, and loosen it twice a day.
If, however, ointment is not present for you, then place old spittle in the wound's opening, so that it sucks that which emerges from it of humidities: and make the sick person sleep upon the wound, so that what is gathered in it runs out.
If, however, three days or more have already passed for the wound, and no spasm occurs to the sick person, nor bad trembling of the heart, nor constriction in the breathing, and you see the rest of his conditions good: then know that the wound is sound. Therefore treat him with bandages and other treatment until he is healed.
If, however, his healing is excused, and it always opens up, then know that it has now become a fistula. Therefore treat it according to its chapter.
And if the wound is from a sword or knife incision, and is simple on the surface of the chest or back, then treat it with what has preceded regarding sutures, if it is large, or with powder if it is small.
If, however, it has already made an impression on the bone, and has chipped off fragments: then investigate the wound, and hasten to extract those fragments, if they are separate. If, however, they are not separate, then leave them until the wound becomes putrid, for the extraction of them will be eased.
However, the treatment of other accidental wounds in the remaining limbs, the judgment is that which we have said.
Concerning wounds of the belly, and the exit of the intestines, and their expulsion.
Rupture which occurs in the belly is great, and medium, and small.
From the great one, therefore, sometimes the intestine, or a number of intestines, emerges.
Therefore, their introduction, and their suture is more vehement and more difficult.
And a small rupture also becomes difficult in another way. It follows, therefore, that their reduction is more difficult if you do not hasten their introduction to their place immediately: because it becomes inflated, opened, and enlarged; therefore, its entry becomes difficult.
Therefore, a middle rupture is better because when it occurs, the reduction of the intestine is not difficult, as it is in these two types.
Know that the suture of the belly is according to four ways.
Two common sutures agree with the suture of the belly, and with the suture of the other wounds of the body; and two other sutures properly agree with the other wounds. However, they are more proper with the suture of the belly; and I tell you each one with exposition and declaration.
Therefore, I say that when the wound is small, and something from the intestine emerges from it, and it becomes difficult to reduce it, then that is due to one of two ways. Either due to the smallness of the rupture, as we said; or because there is inflation in the intestine due to the coldness of the air.
Therefore, when this is so, then it is necessary to warm it, so that you immerse a sponge, or a damp cloth in lukewarm water alone. Or boil it in water with squinancy, and cyperus, and spike, and embrocate the intestine with it, until the inflation is resolved.
Sometimes wine in which there is astringency does it; and it is better than water alone in resolving the inflation.
When therefore you see the inflation already resolved, then moisten the intestine with water in which marshmallow or mallow has been boiled. For by it the entrance of it is eased with a small thing.
If, however, its return is excused after this treatment, then make a small incision in the disruption, with the instrument with which hemorrhoids are cut.
And the first treatment is better when prepared, than cutting; and no compulsion is made to cut after necessity and instrument failure.
Let one part of it be twisted, sharp, and the other part not sharp, and let the subtle extremity not be with the subtlety of Spatumilis, but rather somewhat blunter: and that is which is likened to a caiada, as you see.
When therefore the wound is enlarged, and the intestine enters, then it is necessary that its reduction be according to its natural form to its own proper place, if possible upon it: because it is better.
When, however, the disruption is wide in the lower part of the belly: then it is necessary that you make the sick person lie upon his back, and raise his legs higher than his head. And if it is in the upper part of the belly, then place his head and chest higher than his lower parts.
And similarly if the rupture is in one of the two parts of the belly, then place your intention and your consideration always in this, that the part in which the wound is be higher than the other part.
And thus it is necessary that you administer it in large wounds, and in medium wounds.
In small wounds, however, place it according to what is prepared for you.
Then make it so that a pious servant is present between your hands, who holds the entire rupture with his hand: and bring together its lips. Then uncover from it for the one who follows the suture something after something: and this is the common mode of a single suture.
And it is that you should take a needle, or a number of needles according to the amount of the wound's breadth. Then, leave a quantity of the ring finger, that is, the doctor's finger, from the extremity of the rupture, and fix one needle, through which you insert a thread in two edges of the skin, with two edges thus under the skin from the inside, until you make it penetrate on the other side, and you have already brought together two edges of the skin, and two edges thus; and four rows are made.
Then tighten with the doubled thread in the circumference of the needle several times from both sides simultaneously, until the two lips of the wound are joined by a proper joining.
Then leave the thickness of a finger also, and fix another needle in them; afterward, thread it with the thread, as you did with the first needle. Therefore, do not cease to do that with the needles you need, until you complete the constriction of the entire wound.
And let the needles be medium in thickness and thinness; because very thin needles pierce the flesh very quickly; and thick ones are difficult to enter the skin; on account of that it is necessary that they be medium in thinness and thickness.
And it is not necessary that the needle be fixed in the two close edges of the skin too much, so that the flesh is not pierced quickly, and the wound is opened before it is consolidated, and they should not be extended too far with the suture, so that the wound is not hindered from consolidating.
Then cut the ends of the needles, so that they do not injure the patient in their sleep; and place cushions of cloth on every side, which hold the ends of the needles; and leave them until you know that the wound is now consolidated.
And this type of suture with needles is indeed more suitable in small wounds. Because a single needle, or two, or approximately that many, are enough in their suture.
However, the second common suture is to bring together with the suture four edges: two edges of skin, and two edges of the wound in a single turn, with a needle on which a thread is wound equal in fineness and thickness.
Then, when you have pierced these four edges with the needle, withdraw the needle from the side from which you began, so that the thread is drawn back from the upper part of the wound, so that the suture is like the suture of cloth by which cloths are bound together, and place between each suture an amount of thickness smaller than a little finger.
However, men know this suture.
And with this suture I healed a wound that had occurred to a man in his belly, who had been wounded with a knife, and the wound was a rupture greater than one palm: and about two palms of the middle intestine had emerged from the intestines, and there was a rupture in the middle of the belly.
Therefore, I returned it after his intestine had remained outside the wound for twenty-four hours.
Therefore, the wound was consolidated in a space of approximately fifteen days; and I treated it, and he was healed; and he lived many years after that, engaged in his affairs.
And the physicians had judged that it would not be healed.
And it was a miracle that I did not treat it with ointment. Because I was in a place where no ointment, nor any medicine, was to be found. Therefore, I placed aged linen over the wound twice a day, and I diligently washed it with honey water, until it was healed.
I shall speak of two proper species of sutures, according to the narrative of the discourse.
And it is, that you begin with a pointed suture: and you insert the needle from the outer to the inner part.
When therefore the needle penetrates the skin and the muscle running along the length and breadth of the whole body, leave the end of the thread on the side where you inserted the needle, and make it penetrate to the other end from the inner part to the outer in the other end of the wound.
When you have made it penetrate, then make it penetrate in this same end of the wound from the outer part to the inner: and leave the end of the thread, which is on this side, and make the needle penetrate the other end from the inner part to the outer: and make it penetrate with your penetration, as you make it penetrate in the thread end of the wound, which is on its part, until it penetrates the whole thing.
Then begin also from this same side, and sew it with the end that is from the thread on the other side, and pull the needle out of the skin which it penetrated.
Then return it to that skin, and sew the thread end, which is on the other side, with this end of the wound: and pull it out of the skin that is on its side, and do it one turn and another: and do it turn by turn, until you have sewn the whole thing outwardly according to that example.
And the perfection of this suture is that it should sew the skin like the way leatherworkers sew skins, so that you thread the thread one time from one end of the skin, and that you leave it another time on the other side, until you complete it.
The second kind of proper suture, which Galen said.
His speech tells us to sew it according to the way some physicians sew them, so that they gather every part to its appropriate counterpart by nature, and they apply the end of the thread to its other end, and the end of the wound to its other end. And that is done according to what I tell you.
You should place the needle at the nearest end of the wound, on the outside, and make it penetrate to the inside, in that part alone; and leave the two ends of the thread. Then, turn the needle and make it penetrate from the outside to the inside in both ends of the thread, that is, on both sides.
Then turn both, and make both penetrate from the inside to the outside, in the two other ends of the wound, which are on the opposite side.
And this method of suture is better than the common and easy suture, and is a suture whose recollection preceded it.
This is therefore also Galen's discourse.
And some said. The suture of the belly is rectified with two needles. That is, you should insert one thread in each of them; and begin with the insertion of the needle, from where it is at your hand, and make it penetrate to the other side, according to the suture of those who suture hides equally.
And know that when there is a rupture in the middle of the belly, then its suture is more difficult than the other places of the belly.
However, the judgment of the treatment of a wound is like the judgment of other wounds.
Because when you take hold of a fresh wound with its blood, before the air alters it; and you reduce the intestine and suture it, and adjust it; then place over it powdered flesh-forming material.
If the air has already altered the wound, then put on it some ointments that are present to you, until they cause pus; and the threads fall out, and the wound is consolidated, and mirach. Then treat it as the treatment of other wounds, until it is healed.
However, if the medicines are not present to you, then immediately, from the moment it begins to discharge pus, put old lint on it; and change it twice a day, as I taught you, until it is healed.
For you do not need other medication in many dispositions, when the wounds are simple.
If however you fear that the wound communicates with the principal members in the injury, then it is necessary that you submerge soft wool in oil of moderate warmth, or in rose oil; and place it around the places that are between the groin, and under the armpits.
If, however, he feels pain, or prickings, or putrefaction in his intestines (for this often happens), then administer an enema to him with astringent, black, lukewarm wine; especially if putridity has already reached the intestine, and a penetrating exit has been made to its cavity.
And know that that which is from the large intestine is of easier healing; and that which is from the small one is of more difficult healing.
However, the intestine called the Jejunum does not receive healing from a wound that occurs in it at all; and that is because of its multitude of veins, and the size of them, and because of the delicacy of its body, and the proximity of its nervous nature.
If, however, that which proceeds from the wound is a zirbum, and you obtain it fresh, return it according to your reduction, by which you reduce the intestines equally.
If, however, a period of time has passed, and it has already become green or black, then it is necessary to tie it with thread above the spot which has become darkened by it, so that a flow of blood does not occur. For in a zirbum are veins and arteries.
Then cut that which is beyond that ligature, and place the two ends of the thread hanging from the lower part of the wound outside it, so that the traction of it, and the extraction of it in the case of a zirbum, and the emission of pus from the wound, are alleviated.
A recollection of the wound that happened in the Intestine.
When a rupture occurs in the Intestine, and it is small, then it is possible that it might be restored in some people.  Therefore, because I saw one who was wounded in his belly with a spear thrust, and there was a wound on the right side of the stomach, and the wound was old. And it became a fistula, and excrement and flatulence came out of it.
Therefore, I applied treatment, until I was not confident in his healing; nor did I cease to refine it, until he was healed, and the place was consolidated.
After I saw the place already consolidated, I feared for the sick man, that an adverse event might occur in his belly; and no adverse event happened to him from that. And he remained in better dispositions, eating and drinking, and copulating, and entered the bath, and exercised in his activities.
And now certain experimenters have said that when a wound occurs in the Intestine, and it is small, then it should be tied in this manner. And it is that you should take ants of large heads. Then bring together the two lips of the wound, and place one ant from those that have open mouths upon the two lips of the wound. When therefore it grasps them, and tightens its mouth, cut off its head, for it adheres, and does not come loose.
Then place another ant near the first, and do not cease to do this with ant after ant according to the amount of the whole wound.
Then reduce it, and sew the wound. For those heads remain attached to the intestine until the intestine is nourished and healed, and no harm occurs to the sick person at all.
And now it is possible that the intestine be tied also with a fine thread: which has been scraped from the intestine of an animal, attached to it after it is inserted into the needle.
And it is so that you take the end of this thread from the intestine, and it is scraped a lot. Then tie to the end of it a fine linen thread wrapped around. Then insert that thread into the needle and sew the intestine with it. Then reduce it into the disruption.
And this method of sewing with ants and intestines is only according to the path of trust and hope.
Know that a wound that is large, wide, especially if it is in one of the small intestines: then there is no remedy except subtlety, nor is its healing at all.
On the treatment of Zuchemen, and Fistulas.
Know that every wound, or abscess, when it grows old and becomes a ulcer, and does not heal, and constantly discharges pus, and is not separated: then it is universally called, wherever it may be in the limb, a Fistula, and we call it Zuchemen.
And a Fistula, in truth, is a filtered, hard, white knot: with which there is no pain, which has the concavity of a bird's feather: and because of that some call it Risati, that is, a feather.
And in some cases it is moist, which emits pus. And perhaps the moisture is separated in some cases. And sometimes this moisture is plentiful, and sometimes scarce; and is thick, and sometimes thin.
And I have already mentioned in the division, when I said wounds, that every ulcer which does not heal, nor flesh grows in it, is not so except for one of nine causes.
Of which one is, either because of the scarcity of blood in the body; or because of its bad quality; or because there is hard flesh between it and its edges, hindering the growth of flesh; or because of a lot of dirt and filth; or because the ulcer itself is putrid, and the material applied to it is of bad quality; or because the medicine is unsuitable for its treatment; or because the decay falling on the region is a kind of pestilence, or through the properties in the region, as happens in Caesaraugusta, in which the digestion of illnesses is difficult, and the natural healing of abscesses is delayed there; or because there is one bone, or a number of bones, in it.
And I have already shown all these causes and their signs, and their treatments with medicines in the division: and it is necessary here that I make you know the treatment of Fistula and Zuken, which is done by the surgical method with the hand.
Know therefore, that Fistula occurs in all members of the body. For among them are fistulas that reach large veins and arteries, or nerves, or sinews, or the intestines, or the bladder, or to one of the ribs, or to one of the vertebrae of the back, or to any of the joints formed by compounding, like the hand and foot, and among them are those that run near the main limb and similar ones.
Therefore, whichever of these fistulas is of this sort, is from illnesses of difficult healing, and does not accept treatment, and dealing with it is laborious and ignorant.
If there is any fistula among them whose depth does not reach these places which I have mentioned, and you hope and trust in its treatment, and wish to attain knowledge of it, then take a probe of bronze or iron, if the fistula extends in a straight line, and explore it with it.
But if there is a twisting in the fistula, then investigate it with a thin lead probe. Because lead, with the ease of its body, is alleviated and bent around the twisting.
If the fistula has many openings, it is not possible for you to mark it with a probe. Therefore, irrigate one of its openings from among its openings.
For the moisture you irrigate it with goes towards the other openings and flows out from them.
Then inquire carefully in what way it is possible for you to know whether there is a bone, or a nerve, and the fistula's cavity is distant or close; or whether it is a single fistula having many openings, and stand over all of it with all your strength; with your questioning, by which you question the sick person, and the finding of pain when pressed with your hand upon the place, and similar signs and causes of accidents of an abscess.
When you have stood over all of that in the correct manner, then proceed to treatment according to your confidence; and consider whether the fistula is a nearby apparent one, or in a safe place distant from a joint, or a nerve, or an artery, or a vein, or one of the places which I have told you: then cut the fistula as previously described in my narrative, and remove what is in it by filtration, and any corrupted flesh which arises within its opening from flesh, or pustules, and similar things; and treat it until it is healed.
If, however, the fistula is of distant and deep extent, and it is in line, then it is necessary to cut it as deep as possible. Then cleanse it of all its corrupted flesh.
Then administer strips wrapped in sharp medicines, and insert them into the cavity of the fistula which you have grasped with the iron tool; do this repeatedly until the sharp medicine corrodes everything remaining in the fistula's cavity from the corruption.
Then restore it with ointments which generate healthy flesh, until it is healed.
If, however, it is not healed by that, then cauterize it according to what we have narrated.
If, therefore, the cause of the fistula is bone, and this is ascertained by you: then investigate it, and cut it according to what I have told you: if nothing from a vein, or nerve, or principal limb prevents you, as we have said.
If, therefore, bone is found by you, and there is something of corruption and blackness in it: then scrape it, until its entire corruption is removed. Then treat it with that which makes it flesh, until it is healed.
If, however, it is not healed, and discharges pus as it did before: then know, that you have not reached the complete eradication of the corruption.
Therefore, expose it again, and meticulously perform its scraping and cleansing with all your strength.
Then restore it. If therefore it heals, it is good; and if not, then know that that corruption is in a deep and distant part of the body, which you have not reached. Therefore, you have no skill in it, except to leave it to nature.
If a small bone is corrupted, and it is possible for you, extract it with fine forceps suitable for it.
If, however, there are many bones, then carefully perform the extraction of all of them, and do not leave any of them behind with your strength.
If, however, some moisture creates resistance for you, and there is no fear or error in cutting them, then cut away those moistures and flesh, if there are any there, and free the bones.
If, however, you lack the preparation to remove the bones from your time, then apply something to the wound to cause it to fester, and leave it until that which is around those bones, from the flesh and moistures, is rotten.
And guard the wound so that it does not heal. And bind the incision that you made in your operation. Indeed, place over it, if you fear it, a poultice soaked in crushed sulfur with oil; or a poultice soaked in Egyptian ointment, or any green ointments.
For when those moistures, namely, fester, and the bones are separated from them, the removal and extraction of them is eased.
If however, there is one large bone, such as the bone of the leg or the hip bone, and similar to them, and that which is corrupted from it is a large part: then scrape it with the utmost scraping until that blackness and corruption is removed. Then restore the wound.
If however, that which is corrupted within it is a large part, and corruption has already reached the marrow of the bone, then it is necessary to saw it and cut it entirely to the place where the corruption has reached: then treat it until it is healed.
And I tell you a story, which happened to a man in his leg: that you might set it as an example and aid in your operation.
There was a young man of approximately thirty years, in whom pain occurred in his leg, from a cause which originated within the body, that is, from the internal organs, until the matter reached the leg, and a large abscess was formed: and there was no external cause for it.
Therefore, time passed with him with the error of physicians, until the abscess was opened, and much matter flowed out. And his treatment was delayed until the leg became fistulous, and many openings were formed in it: all of which emitted pus and bodily humors.
Therefore, a multitude of physicians treated him for approximately two years, and there was no wise person in the surgical art among them, until I was called, and saw his leg, and the matter which flowed from those openings with great force: indeed, the whole body of the man had now become putrid, and his complexion was yellowish.
I therefore inserted a probe into one of the openings, and the probe reached the bone.
Then I examined all the openings: and found that they reached each other from all parts of the leg.
I therefore quickly cut over one of those openings, until I exposed a portion of the bone: and found it corrupted: which was already corroded, blackened, decayed, and perforated, until it had penetrated to the marrow.
I therefore scraped away what was exposed to me, and prepared it from the corrupted bone.
And I determined that there was nothing in the bone but that corruption, which I cut away and scraped. And I had already eradicated it.
Then I applied a restoration to the wound with consolidating medicines for a long time. And it was not consolidated.
Then I tried, and I discovered a second layer of bone above the first discovery; and I found continuous corruption with the bone; and I scraped what appeared to me to be also from that corruption.
Then I attempted its restoration. And it was not restored.
Therefore, I again uncovered it, and I did not cease to cut the bone piece by piece, and to attempt its restoration; and it was not restored, until I cut away about a palm's breadth from the bone and extracted it with its marrow.
Then I restored it with medicines, and it was quickly consolidated and healed; and this repetition in its operation and section was not necessary, except for the weakness of the patient's disposition, and his little tolerance, and my fear for him of death; because he was experiencing syncopes and bad occurrences due to excessive evacuations at all hours.
Therefore, he was healed with complete healing: and hard flesh grew in the place of the bone, and a good disposition was established in his body, and his strength returned: and he resumed his usual dispositions; and he suffered no harm from walking at all.
However, if a projecting bone in a body part has already been broken, then it is necessary to saw it in this manner: and thus you should take a bandage, and tighten it at the end of the projecting bone; and instruct someone to pull it upward; and place another bandage of thicker wool over the first bandage. Then tie it over the flesh beneath the bone; and extend its end so that you pull the flesh downwards; and you expose the flesh over the place you wish to saw so that the saw does not injure the flesh.
Place wood or a plank beneath the bone below properly, because when you do that, it does not prevent the saw from cutting the corrupted flesh.
And it is necessary that the sawing be over the corrupted place for a short while, so that there is no corruption in the concavity of the bone; and it does not appear in its appearance to the senses, and compels sawing again in its place.
If the bone is corrupted, and it is not projecting, but rather its part is continuous with another part, and the corruption is in its middle or in a part of it, then uncover the flesh from all sides completely. Then place wood underneath.
Afterwards saw it from the first part, where the corruption is, until the sawing is continued from the other part; and let the sawing be along the length from the corruption for a little while, as we have said.
If the corruption is in the joint, cut the corrupted joint itself, and saw the bone where it is continuous from the other side.
If however the corruption is in the continuation of two joints, then there is no remedy in it except abrasion.
If the corruption is in the comb of the hand, or in the comb of the foot, then the matter is very difficult in it. But it is necessary that you investigate how the corruption appears to you. And you should abrade it, and cleanse it according to whatever arrangement is possible for you, and with whatever remedy is suitable for you: when it does not cause you opposition from a vein or a nerve.
And know that there are many knives and saws for cutting these bones, according to the position of the bones, and their preparation, and their thickness and thinness, and their size and smallness, and their hardness and their rarity. Therefore, it is necessary to prepare a suitable instrument of every kind of operation for that operation.
And know that these operations show you the kind of instrument you need, when you have long study with you. And the knowledge of the methods of this art is a testament to the methods of illnesses: for then you will find for yourself what suits it from the instruments for every ailment.
And I am showing you in the final part of this chapter the number of instruments, which you will place as examples upon which you will cut, and the test by which you will try them upon others.
Shape of another saw.
Shape of the connections of the razor. Let the head of this razor, according to the form of the head of a star-shaped nail, and its points be according to the form of the points of a sharpened file.
And it is not suitable, unless the heads of the joints are rubbed with it when they are corrupted, or the bone is large and great.
Form of the larger razor.
Form of the broad razor.
Form of the razor in which there is a concavity.
Form of another slender razor.
Form of another razor with a curved end.
Form of a small, slender, tensed razor.
This is similar to a saw, and the end is like a saw; it is shown in many places by the reason of bones.
Form of a razor suitable for the cutting of that which is perforated from the bones.
Its end is triangular, with sharp ends.
It is made of Indian [material]. And similarly, all that we have said must be made from razors, and knives, and saws.
Concerning the incision of the extremities, and the sawing of the bones.
The extremities putrefy, either from an external cause, or an internal one.
Therefore, when you have treated that corruption with medicinal remedies, and the treatment does not help; and you see the corruption affecting the limb, which nothing else repels; then it is necessary to cut that limb until you reach the corruption, so that it escapes death or the greater harm which is the loss of the limb.
And a sign that this happens is that the limb darkens until it becomes foul; that fire has burned it, or that it putrefies after turning black; until that putrefaction is cut away to the part following the limb, and spreads to the whole body.
Therefore, hurry with its incision, and likewise if the cause of the corruption is from the sting of certain venomous creatures, such as the sea scorpion, and viper, and rattlesnake, and the like.
If, therefore, the corruption, or the injury, is in the extremity of a finger, then cut off the finger, and do not give space to the corruption to spread to the rest of the hand.
And likewise if it happens in the hand, then cut it off from the root of the forearm, and do not give space to the corruption until it takes hold of the upper arm.
And if it invades it, then cut off the arm at the elbow joint.
If, however, the corruption passes, and you see it approximately at the elbow, then in that case death is upon the sick person. And to administer beyond that, in terms of treatment, is the measure of skill.
And similarly do with the foot, when corruption invades the toe, then cut it off at one of its joints; and if it takes hold of the sole of the foot, then cut off the entire foot. If however it ascends to the knee, then cut off the leg at the knee joint.
If however the corruption has already reached above the knee, then there is no remedy for it, except release, and to leave the sick person to die.
And the method of cutting or sawing a limb is that you should tighten the ligament beneath the one you wish to cut; and tighten another ligament above the place. And let the surgeon extend one ligament downwards and let the surgeon extend the other ligament upwards. And separate the flesh which is between the two ligaments with a broad spatula until all the flesh is exposed. Then it should be cut or sawn.
And it is necessary that you place linen cloths on all sides, and that the saw not touch a healthy part; and that an added injury and a hot abscess befall the sick person.
If however an internal flow of blood occurs while you are operating, then cauterize the place quickly, or place upon it certain powders that staunch the blood. Then return to your treatment until it is complete.
Then bind the wounded limb with a suitable bandage, and care for it until it is healed.
And I tell you that it happened to a man in his foot, this same happening that I tell you.
That is, because it happened in his foot, a blackness, with a burning which resembles the burning of fire: and that corruption first occurred in his toe, until it began the whole foot.
Therefore, the man hastened from himself, after he saw the corruption descend upon the limb with its vehemence, which he found from its pain and burning: and it struck him at the joint, and he was healed.
And after a long time passed, that same corruption happened to him in the index finger of his hand.
So he came to me, and I tried to recover that superfluity with what I placed on his hand from medicines after cleansing his body: and the superfluity was not repelled, and it began to proceed to another finger: until the corruption began in the hand.
Therefore, he called me to cut his hand: and I did not want that, hoping for a recovery of that superfluity from me: and I also feared death for him at the incision of his hand. Because the man's strength was over the case.
After he despaired of me, he returned to his own land: and it came to me about him, that he hurried, and cut his entire hand: and he was healed.
And I did not bring this account, unless it should be an aid concerning that which falls from this kind of illness: and that it might be a signification by which it may be signified, and according to which it may be acted.
Concerning the treatment of Sinuses, and the quality of enemas with medicines.
When an abscess occurs in certain fleshy members, and the abscess's space prolongs itself until it forms a collection of pus: then it bursts or is perforated, and that which is in it of pus comes out, and a hollow place remains, like a vessel: and the skin that is over it, like a cloth that is now thinned: and it does not reach its final state of decay, nor does it affect the mouth, nor the nerve, nor the ligament: it deserves to be called a Sinus: and it is not called a Fistula: however, if its space prolongs itself until the decay affects any of these members, then it is called a Fistula, or zuken.
And its treatment is to cut away that entire skin, as it revolves: and especially when it has thinned and become like a cloth: and you trust that it does not adhere to the place, due to its decay.
However, if you hope that the skin adheres, and that decay does not result from that final adherence: and if there is thickness of flesh in the skin, then treat it with an enema: and it is to be considered as a Sinus.
Then if it is large, and the pus that is emitted from it has a foul odor: then enema it with Egyptian medicine, which is vinegar, and oil, and ziniar, taking equal parts, to be mixed in a vessel: and let them be boiled over fire, until the medicine turns red: and it comes to the thickness of honey.
Then take from it what you need: and dissolve it with water and honey, and enema the sinus with it: and compress its opening, and leave the medicine in it for the amount of two hours.
Then extract it with pressure: do this for so many days, until the sinus is cleansed, and the foul odor is removed.
And sometimes it is enemated with ash water, when this medicine is not present for you: and it is so that you should take the ashes of vine wood, or ashes from the holm oak wood: and pour water over it. Then strain it, and enema with it, until you are confident that the sinus is now cleansed.
If the sick person does not tolerate the Egyptian medicine, nor the ash water, then enema it with water and honey, to which something of crushed ziniar has already been mixed. Or enema it with mixed honey and wine, since it is the property of honey to cleanse and wash away; and wine causes the sinus to adhere, especially when there is an excess of astringency and dryness in the wine.
When you do it several times, and are confident that the corruption of the sinus has been removed: then enema it with that which causes flesh to grow there.
And take from the dyafinicon plaster, dissolve it with rose oil and astringent wine, or enema it with certain medicines and other ointments, whose properties I have written in the treatise on ointments.
If the sinus opening is constricted, so that the enema cannula does not fit: then enlarge it slightly with iron, or place a linen cloth wrapped in Egyptian ointment or in basil ointment on it, until it is enlarged.
And similarly, if the opening is also wide, then bring together its edges with sutures, and leave it of a size that the enema can enter without additions.
And similarly, if the opening from which pus flows is elevated upwards: then cut it in the lower part within, so that the pus flows downwards; because when pus is constricted in the depth of the sinus, it prevents flesh from growing there.
If you cannot cut the sinus approximately below the place you wish, then try to prepare the limb in such a way that pus flows from it easily, according to the preparation you have. Try to not retain any pus at all within, and take consolidating medicines that are put on the sign, suitable for what you want. And spread them over a linen cloth. And let the cloth be of such size that it covers the entire sinus. Then cut with scissors a hole, larger than the sinus opening, directly in the opening of the sinus. Then spread some mild ointments on another cloth, according to the size of the hole; and place it over the former, further away from the sinus opening, so that the pus may more easily flow out from it; and do not remove the large cloth, except after a few days, at one time.
However, the one over the sinus opening, is the one you remove every hour, so that what gathers in it from the pus may come out; and so that you may know whether the matter running from it is much, or little; or digested, or undigested.
And with this, again consider the location of the sinus itself, whether the master of it feels pain in it, or there is no pain in it, and whether there is an abscess in it, or not.
Therefore, when your treatment is thus extended, and you see the matter that flows out over the sinus opening, then know that the sinus is now adhering, or approaching adhesion: then therefore, undo it in the morning, or on the third day; and when you undo the wound, then change another cloth, and renew the ointment.
However, if thin matter flows from the sinus after a long period, then do not despair of its adhesion, for its healing is approaching, because there are people who delay the generation of flesh in their wounds, and there are those who act contrary to that.
If, however, undigested pus flows from the sinus after many days, then know that the sinus does not adhere.
If, therefore, the adhesion of the sinus is delayed and its condition prolonged, then add to the drying medicines, but let the physicians make sure that the medicines are moist in their substance and dry in their effect; like the unguentum dyafinicon, when superfluity of the addition of zegi is added to it.
And of the more final means by which it is treated, it is that you take the unguentum dyafinicon, and dissolve it with rose oil, and sprinkle upon it old wine, equal in its substance.
Then mix it with that, and use it.
And now it does a similar action to this, when the unguentum dyafinicon is not present to you, honey, when you boil it until it thickens, and use it. Or take myrrh, and aloes, and frankincense: grind the whole thing, and powder it over the honey while it is over the fire. Then line a cloth over it, and bind it over the sinus: and line with the honey that you boiled until it thickened: and powder spices over it, and put over the cloth, and bind it.
And sometimes long aristolochia, and the roots of the lily of the valley, and the lily are administered in it: and the herb flour, and centaury. Use them simple, or aggregated, grind them, and sift them: and powder them over the honey which I mentioned, and use it.
If the sinus condition persists and is not cured by this treatment, then know that there is corruption within it; or it is already making an impression on the bones, or on the other hard members, or ligaments: then treat it with the treatment of fistulas, as was previously described.
Concerning the treatment of whitlow and worn nail, and the incision of the added finger, and section.
A whitlow is an abscess that arises under the nail of the thumb of the hand or foot, and perhaps arises in the other fingers.
Therefore, when its condition is prolonged and its treatment neglected, and the abscess becomes a hot abscess, or it corrupts and discharges pus until it gnaws at the root of the nail, and perhaps corrupts it entirely, and perhaps the corruption reaches the bone, until it has a foul odor; and the end of the finger becomes wide, and its color becomes dark.
Therefore, when you treat it, as we have said in the division, and your treatment does not help, then you must cut with a knife all the superfluity that remains from the nail. Then cauterize the wound after that. For the cautery is very helpful.
If however the bone is healthy, and the nail is also healthy, and the superfluous parts of the nail are now pressing the flesh inwards, and begin to pierce it and injure it, then you must place a thin spatula under the nail-part that is piercing the flesh, and push it upwards; and cut the flesh with ease, and put on that which remains of the flesh corrosive and burning medicines until the entire part of it is removed. Then treat it with ointments until it heals.
If however corruption has already affected the bone, then it is necessary to cut the bone and remove it: for it will never heal while the corrupted bone remains in it.
If you see corrosion and corruption affecting the finger, then cut it in one of the knots, according to the remembrance of what has been said previously. Then treat it until it heals.
If, however, a nail suffers abrasion or impact, and severe pain occurs, then it is necessary to first bleed the patient. Then cut the nail with a sharp spatula in a transverse cut from top to bottom.
And be careful that the cut does not reach the flesh beneath the nail, for you will cause the patient intense pain by doing so, and it will be the cause of added flesh growing in that place.
Then treat the place with something that relieves pain.
A finger, however, that is added in some people's hands, is perhaps entirely fleshy; and perhaps there are bones in some of them, and perhaps there is a nail in it; and some of them originate at the root of a joint, or its origin is in some nodes of the finger. Therefore, the one that originates in some nodes of the finger does not move; and the one that originates near the joint of the finger perhaps moves.
Therefore, the one that is fleshy among them, its incision is easy. That is, cut it at its root with a broad scalpel.
However, the treatment of the one whose origin is in the root of the joint is difficult. Therefore, abstain from its incision.
However, in the one that arises on the finger at the last of the nodes, then it is necessary to first cut its flesh with a round incision, down to the bone. Then saw the bone with one of those saws suitable for it. Then treat it until it heals.
However, the consolidation that occurs between the fingers often happens either from the person's birth, that is, is born with it, or from the consolidation of a wound, or from the burning of fire, and similar things.
Therefore, it is necessary to separate that consolidation until the fingers return to their natural shape. Then place between them strips of cloth, or cloths soaked in rose oil, so that they do not become consolidated quickly, and separate them: or place a thin sheet of lead between them until the place is consolidated as it should be.
And similarly, if consolidation occurs between certain fingers and the palm, then cut that consolidation, according to what is prepared and suitable for the shape of the limb.
Concerning the incision of a defect.
Ulcers are convoluted, thick veins, filled with melancholic humors, which occur in many parts of the body; and their effect is most often in the legs, especially in the legs of those who travel and work, and carry burdens.
Therefore, it is necessary that you administer a purging of the body from black bile, sometimes with strong purging.
Then bleed the patient from the basilic vein.
The treatment of these, however, with iron, is according to two methods. One of them is that they be cut, and the black blood be drawn out. And the other method is that the vein be raised, and the whole of it be drawn out.
However, its incision is according to this method. First, bathe the leg thoroughly in hot water until the thick, foul blood is resolved. Then bind the patient's leg from the upper part of the hip, down to the lower part of the knee, with a bandage. Then cut the vein in one, or two, or three places with a wide incision.
Then raise, that is, draw out the blood in your hand from the lower part of the leg, up to the upper part, and the phlebotomist must first do this for the patient. Then cut the nail, going lower until a quantity of blood sufficient and tolerable by the patient's strength emerges.
Afterwards, tie it (the vein); and order him to abstain from foods generating black bile; and again perform evacuation and phlebotomy when the veins are full, and that harms the patient.
Its elevation, however, is according to this method. Shave the patient's leg, if it has many hairs. Then immerse him in a bath; or apply a warm water embrocation to his leg until it reddens and the veins swell; or, if a bath is not available, have him exercise vigorously until the limb is heated.
Then cut the skin in a straight line along the vein's course: either at its end near the knee or at its lower part near the heel.
Then, open the skin with hooks, and scrape the vein from every side until it appears to the senses:  and at its appearance, you will see it sloping from a red to a black hue. When it emerges from the skin, you will see it white like a chord.
Then, introduce a probe underneath it until, when it is lifted and emerges from the skin, suspend it with a blunt, gentle hook.
Then cut another incision near that incision by three fingers' breadth. Then scrape the skin from above the vein until it appears. Then lift it with probes as you did, and suspend it with another hook, as you did at first.
Then cut another incision, or several incisions, if you need them. Then lift, and cut it at the very last incision near the heel.
Then pull it out to the incision that is above it.
And do that until you pull it out from the incision that is higher, or higher than all the incisions, until when the whole thing comes out: then cut it.
If, however, it does not obey you in pulling and lifting it, then insert a needle with a strong double thread, and tie it, and pull it out: or insert a probe under it, and turn your hand in every direction until it comes out. And be careful not to cut it. For if it is cut, it becomes difficult for you to lift it greatly, and it enters upon the sick person from it harm.
When therefore you have pulled it all out, then put on the wound site wool soaked in wine and rose oil, or oil, and care for it until it is healed.
If, however, the vine is contracted, having a twisting to which there is a wrapping to the parts, and is not as we said according to straightness, then it is necessary to cut into it in every direction of its twisting and its wrapping places.
Then suspend it with hooks, until you lift it all: and be careful in your incision on it that you do not cut a vein, or wound it, for it will become difficult for you to lift or remove it. Therefore, preserve your prudence.
The form of the incident by which the vine is healed.
The form of the blind hook.
It does not have the curvature like the other hooks, nor a sharp tip so as not to wound the vein: and it has a thick, smooth bend, because if it were thin, it would cut the vein with its thinness: indeed, let it have an excessive thickness, as we have said.
Of the extraction of the vein of the leg.
This vein is generated in legs in hot lands, such as Algezi and the land of the Arabs, and in arid, hot lands, of little tenderness, that is, in which neither grass nor tree grows.
And perhaps it is generated in other parts of the body besides the legs.
And indeed its generation is from the putrefaction that occurs under the skin, as happens within the bodies of snakes and worms, and worms generated between the skin and flesh.
And the sign of the beginning of the effect of this vein is that a violent inflammation occurs in the leg. Then the place becomes blistered. Then the vein begins to emerge from the place of that blistering, as if it were the root of a plant, or an animal.
When therefore its extremity appears from it, then it is necessary that you wrap a piece of lead over it, whose weight is from one drachma keil up to two drachmas, and tie it; and leave the lead hanging from the leg.
Whenever therefore something emerges from it to the exterior, wrap it in lead, and tie it. If it extends a great deal, then cut off a part of it, and wrap the remainder. And do not cut it at the root before the whole of it emerges. For if you cut it, it contracts and enters the flesh, and causes an abscess and putrefaction in the place, and a bad ulcer.
Therefore it is necessary that it be gently treated and extracted gradually until it emerges from its last part, and nothing of it remains in the body; and from this vein indeed there emerges in some men what is in its length five palms and ten. And it has already come to me that it emerged from a man of twenty palms.
If, however, it is incised during your time of treatment, then insert a rod into its opening and pierce it with a long opening, together with the body, until all the matter within it is evacuated; and treat the putrefaction of the place with medicines for several days. Then treat it with the treatment of abscesses.
And this vein sometimes has many branches, especially when it appears at the joint of the foot, or in the foot itself; and many openings occur to it, and a branch emerges from every opening.
Therefore treat it, as we said in the division, and with what has been previously mentioned.
Concerning the incision on worms generated under the skin, and it is called the Disease of cattle.
This disease is called in a certain land among us the Disease of cattle; because it often happens to oxen, and is a small worm that is born between the skin and the flesh.
And it travels throughout the body, ascending and descending; and it is made evident to the senses by its movement from limb to limb, until it breaks through wherever it breaks through the skin, and emerges.
And its generation is from the putrefaction of certain humours. As happens with worms and snakes, that is, intestinal worms, and threadworms in the belly.
And it is feared because of its malice. Because when it travels through the body, and ascends to the head, and reaches a location, then perhaps it bursts open there and emerges, and destroys the eye; and this happens many times.
Therefore, when one wishes to cure it and extract it, then it is not done except at the time of its movement and its appearance to the senses.
Therefore, it is necessary to tie what is above it and what is below it with a strong ligature. Then cut above it and extract it.
If it penetrates into the flesh, and you do not find it, then apply a cautery to the place with fire until it dies.
And the greater fear is its corruption, by which it corrupts the eye, as we said.
If, however, you see it already having reached the head near the eye, then tie the eyebrow beneath it with a good ligature. Then cut above it, and extract it.
And it is necessary for the sick person to use cleansing of their body, with medicines that dissolve bad putrid humors.
And let him beware of foods that generate putrefaction.
Concerning the incision above the sickness of Nakir.
This sickness is called Nakir in our land: and it is a pain that happens in certain limbs; then it changes from limb to limb.
And I myself have indeed seen it, as I relate to you. I was called to a sick woman in certain villas. And she uncovered her arm, and I saw a small swelling in the vein of the arm's cord.
And after I had stayed an hour, I saw one swelling move with a tremor, as a worm moves, ascending to her shoulder more quickly than possible: to be like quick silver, when it runs from place to place.
Therefore, the pain receded from that place, and settled in the shoulder.
Then I sat for an hour, and it ran to the rest of the body, until it reached the other arm.
Then she told me that it was turning throughout her entire body, as I had seen.
I was therefore amazed at the speed of its change from limb to limb. And I myself had not previously seen this illness with my own eyes in such a manner. However, I have seen many who find pain changing from limb to limb: and I did not see it with my own eyes, as I saw it in the woman.
And I do not think it to be anything other than because she was of those who are of dry-bodied people with detected veins: hence, that airiness appears to the senses in that changed form.
And it is necessary that they not appear in this way in those who are delicate, and with moist bodies, with hidden veins.
When therefore you wish to cure it, and the patient feels that pain: then if it appears to you with the eye, as we said, then grasp above it, and below it quickly: and cut above it, until that compressed airiness comes out: and cauterize the place.
If however you do not see it with your eyes: then cure it with shaking of the body, and with that which expels airiness, and pacifies them with foul pills, and pills of serapion, and similar things.
Concerning the extraction of Arrows.
Arrows differ according to their kinds and according to the places in which they strike the body.
Their diversity is, indeed, because some of them have large heads, and small ones, and concave ones, and blunt ones. And some of them have three angles. And some of them have tongues. And some of them have stars.
Those which are according to the members on which they fall are according to two ways. For either the members are from the principal concave members, such as the brain, and the heart, and the liver, and the lungs, and the kidneys, and the intestines, and the bladder, and similar to them. Therefore, when it falls into any of these members, and signs of death appear to you, which I will relate to you later, then you ought to avoid extracting that arrow from them, for death follows it in that in which it is, in many dispositions. And when these bad signs do not appear to you, and the arrow is not hidden deep within the member, then extract it, and treat the wound.
For the signs of the brain, when an arrow falls into it, and penetrates the bone, and the siphac, which is above the brain, comes forth, are: because vehement madness, and scotoma, and vertigo, and redness in the eyes, and swelling, and redness of the tongue, and spasm, and confusion of the intellect, and vomiting of cholera, occur from it. And perhaps blood comes forth from the nostrils, or from the ears. And perhaps speech is severed, and the voice is destroyed. And white moisture like gruel emerges from the place of the wound. And from it emerges something like the watery aspect of flesh.
If therefore these signs appear to you, then refrain from treatment, and extract the arrow if it does not emerge.
The signs of an arrow striking the heart are: that it is near the left nipple; and that one feels as if it were fixed in a hard thing, not in an empty thing. And perhaps the arrow's movement is similar to the movement of a pulse; and black blood flows from the wound. And that is followed by coldness of the extremities, and cold sweat, and fainting. Know therefore, that death descends without a doubt.
And the sign of an arrow wounding the lung is the exit of frothy blood from the wound: and the vessels which follow the neck become suppurated, and the sick person's complexion changes. And he breathes out a large, deep breath: and seeks the attraction of cold air.
If the arrow strikes the covering, which is in the breast, then it is near the small ribs: and there is a large gasp with violent pain, with a sigh: and all the shoulder limbs are moved.
And if the arrow strikes the stomach, then perhaps undigested food will exit from the wound.
And if the arrow strikes the belly, and is fixed in it, some excrement, or zirb, or already ruptured intestine, will exit from the wound. Therefore, there is no hope for its cure, nor for the extraction of the arrow.
If the arrow strikes the bladder, and urine escapes, and something proceeds from it outwards, and the pain is stronger upon the weak, then know that it is mortal.
However, the remaining members, such as the face, and neck, and throat, and shoulder, and the arm, and the vertebrae of the back, and collarbone, and hip, and leg, and similar members are saved according to various dispositions, when the arrow does not strike an artery or nerve, and the arrow is not poisoned.
And I tell you what I have seen concerning these arrows, so that you may indicate through that on your treatment.
Because an arrow struck a man in the tear duct of his eye, at the root of his nose. Therefore, I extracted it from the other side, under the fat of his ear: and he was healed, and no harm came to his eye.
And I extracted another arrow from a Jew, which struck him in the fat of his eye under the lower eyelid.  And the arrow was already hidden, and I did not obtain from it except a small extremity, with which it adheres to its shaft.  And the arrow was a large arrow of the Turkish bows, with soft iron, in which there are no ears.
Therefore, the Jew was healed, and no evil accident occurred in his eye.
And I extracted another arrow from the throat of a Christian.
And it was an Arabic arrow, and it is the kind that has ears. Therefore, I cut above it between the two guides: and it was already submerged in his throat. Therefore, I worked with it, until I extracted it: and the Christian was healed.
And I extracted another arrow from the man which had fallen into his belly: and we thought that he would die from it.
After therefore thirty days had passed, and nothing was changed upon him from his dispositions, I cut above the arrow: and I worked upon it, and extracted it: and he was healed, and no evil accident happened to him.
And I saw a man whom an arrow had struck in his back, and the wound was consolidated over it. After therefore it was after seven years, the arrow exited at the root of his thigh.
And I saw a woman whom an arrow had struck in her belly, and the wound was consolidated over it, and the arrow remained within her: and nothing was changed in her dispositions, and the woman found no harm in any of her natural functions.
And I saw another man, whom an arrow struck in his face: and the wound was consolidated, and it remained, causing him not much pain: and many similar things to these.
And I extracted the arrow from the king's nobleman, which had struck him in the middle of his nose, and had already bent slightly to the right side: and the arrow was completely hidden.
I was therefore called to treat him after the arrow's impact for up to three days. I therefore found the arrow wound to be very severe.
I therefore sought it with a fine probe, and did not sense it: and indeed he was finding a prick and pain under his right ear. I therefore hoped that that prick was from the arrow's tip.
I therefore plastered the place with a plaster having attractive and digestive properties, confident that the place would become abscessed and that the arrowhead would appear so that I could cut upon it: and no sign occurred in the place signifying that the arrow had struck the location.
I therefore applied the plaster to it for many days: and no sign occurred, and the wound meanwhile healed: and he remained weak from its extraction for a space of days, until he felt the arrow one day within his nose. And he told me that.
And he told me that. I therefore applied a sharp, corrosive medicine to that wound for many days, until it opened: and when I probed it, I felt a slender arrowhead adhering to the wood.
Then I added to the opening of the wound through that sharp medicine, until the arrowhead appeared visibly to us: and I spent about four months with him in that time.
Then, after the wound had been enlarged, and it was possible for me to insert the forceps into it, and move it, and it did not yield to extraction, I did not cease to refine and devise means upon it, until I began, one day, with forceps suitably fashioned, as their form will appear at the end of the chapter, until I extracted it. Then I restored the wound.
And indeed physicians judge that the cartilage of the nose is not restored. Therefore I restored it, and the wound was consolidated, and the sick man was healed with complete health; and nothing at all harmed him.
And I tell you the quality of the extraction of some arrows: so that you may place it as a rule and meaning upon that which I have not said.
Because the parts of this art and their distinctions are not comprehended with the narration; nor does that book comprehend it, and a prudent craftsman compares little things to many things, and the present to the absent; and he finds a new operation and a new instrument in the descent of foreign things of this art when they occur.
Therefore, I say that arrows do not emerge from the limbs in which they are fixed, except in two ways. Or by traction from the place from which it entered. Or by the contrary of the other part.
And that which emerges from where it entered is either an arrow proceeding into fleshy tissue: and is pulled, and emerges.
If it does not yield to exit from the hour in which it fell, then it is necessary to leave it for some days, until the flesh which is around it has rotted: and its traction and its exit will be alleviated.
And similarly if it is fixed in the bone, and does not yield to you for exit, then leave it also for some days: and repeatedly try it with traction and movement every day, until it emerges.
If it does not yield to you for exit after days, then it is necessary to pierce around the arrow in the bone itself from every side with a fine drill, until the arrow is enlarged. Then pull it, and extract it.
If however the arrow is already hidden in a place of the body, and is concealed and hidden from sense: then seek it with probes. If however you feel it, then pull it out with certain instruments suitable for its extraction.
If however you cannot get at it, because of the constriction of the wound, and because of the length of the arrow deep within: and there is no bone, nor nerve, nor vein there: then enlarge over it, until the wound is widened, and it is possible to extract the arrow.
If it has ears by which to hold it, then free the flesh fixed in them from every side, by all the means you can, and if means are not enough to free the flesh from the breaking and twisting of the ears, until it escapes.
And when you administer the extraction of the arrow, wherever it is, then use the twisting of your hand, with forceps, in all directions, until you make it escape: and by the finest subtlety, so that the arrow is not broken, and its extraction and pulling become difficult for you.
If you cannot get at it within an hour, then leave it for a few days, until the surrounding parts putrefy. Then try again: for it will be easier then.  But if a flow of blood opposes you, then administer what we said about treatment in its chapter: and guard your skill from incision of a vein, or nerve, or tendon.
And use every means possible for the arrow's escape, and let it be with ease and calmness, or with slowness and firmness, as I told you.
And it is necessary, when you pull the arrow, that the patient be weak according to the form in which the arrow was lodged. Because it is more helpful. If, however, that is not possible for you, then administer what is possible for you from the figures.
However, an arrow that emerges from the opposite side of the other part, either already protrudes from it outward, or the arrow's tip makes a swelling on the skin's surface, and you see it projecting: therefore, cut above it, and let the cut be the amount that forceps can grasp in it.
Then pull it out; for it will easily be extracted.
If, however, it is retained in the bone, then turn your hand in a circular motion until the arrow presses against the bone and enlarges itself; then pull it out.
And if not, leave it for a few days; then try it again, until it emerges.
If the arrow's wood is within it, then push it out along with it.
If, however, the wood has fallen away, and you wish to administer a push, then insert a concave instrument, so that its concavity enters the arrow's tail; then push it out with it.
If, however, the arrow is hollow, then push it with an instrument that enters it. For the arrow is lightened by it.
If the arrow is poisoned, then it is necessary to cauterize all the flesh in which the poison is, if it is possible for you. Then treat it with whatever is suitable for it.
If the arrow is lodged in the chest, or in the belly, or in the bladder, or in the side, and is near enough to that which you touch with a probe, and it is possible for you to cut above it, then cut, and beware of cutting a vein or nerve, and remove it.
Then sew the wound, if you see it, and treat it until it is healed.
And this is the form of the forceps with which arrows are extracted.
Let the ends be similar to the beak of a bird, made of iron; when they grasp the arrow, they do not release it.
And many forms are made from them, large, small, and medium, according to the quantity, size, and smallness of the arrow, and the breadth and constriction of the wound.
The form of the impelling concave one.
And the form of the impelling deaf one.
This is a deaf extremity like a ray, so that its entrance into the concave arrow may be eased, and it may be impelled with it.
Of the phlebotomy of the veins.
The veins to be bled, of which the use has run through the body, are thirty.
Of these, sixteen are in the head: two pulsating veins, which are behind the ears, called the two Herbs; and two arteries, which are appearing in the two temples; and two veins which are in the two tear ducts of the two eyes, which are called the Lookers; and a prepared vein in the middle of the forehead; and a vein which is at the extremity of the nose. And two Guidegi, which are in the neck. And two veins which are in the upper lip of the mouth. And two veins which are in the lower lip. And these are the veins which are called Algecherich. And two veins which are under the tongue.
The veins, however, that are bled in the arms, are five veins in every arm.
One of them is the Cephalic, and it is from the wild side; and the common people call it the vein of the head. And the Fusca. And is the Middle vein, and it is composed of a branch of the Basilic and a branch of the Cephalic: and the common people call it the vein of the body. And the Basilic, and it is situated on the domestic side; and it is also called the Titillicaris. And the common people call it the vein of the belly. And the Cord of the arm, and it is situated above the elbow; and it is that which is bled from, and it is that which appears above the thumb with clear appearance.
And the Saluatella: and it is the vein which is between the ring finger and the little finger; and it has two branches.
And in the leg and foot there are three veins. One of them is that which is under the curve of the thumb from the wild side. And the second is the Saphena; and its place is at the heel from the domestic side. And the vein Nesse; and its place is at the heel from the wild side.
And in the other leg are three veins similar to those.
Concerning the phlebotomy of two veins behind the ears.
Phlebotomies of the two veins behind the ears are helpful for chronic colds, and hemicrania, and sahafati, and bad old head ulcers.
And the quality of the phlebotomy is according to what I describe. And it is that the patient's head be shaved, and his occiput be rubbed in the location of the two veins with a rough cloth, with good friction. Then the patient should tighten his neck with a strip, until two veins appear. And their locations are behind the ears in two depressed places of the head. Therefore, seek them with your finger, and where you feel their pulse beneath your finger, there mark with ink.
Then take a phlebotomous knife, and it is the one which is called Incidens. Then insert it beneath the vein in the skin, until the phlebotomous reaches the opening. Then lift your hand with the vein and skin upwards, and cut the vein with the skin with an incident incision. And let the length of the incision be the amount of two joined fingers, or about that: and cause as much blood to exit as you wish.
Then bind it with bandages, and leave it until it heals.
And already in the beginning of the book there was a description of their incision, and their cauterization.
The phlebotomy of the two arteries which are in the two temples is a benefit for the ancient hemiplegia, and for crooked paralysis, and for incessant ophthalmia, and for the flow of excessive acute fluids to the eyes.
And the quality of phlebotomizing them is according to what I tell you. Let the sick man hold his neck tightly, until two veins become distinctly apparent to the senses, and their pulse be demonstrated under your finger. Then mark the signs with ink.
Then raise the skin above the vein upwards with your index finger, and insert the phlebotomous incision underneath, and raise the vein upwards. And cut it, as you did in the other two veins, and cause blood to flow according to your need.
Then loosen the sick person's constriction, and place your finger upon the vein for one hour. Afterwards place over it a cloth and cushions, and bind it tightly above the constriction; and leave it until it heals.
And already the remembrance of them, and their incision, and their extraction has preceded in the beginning of the book.
Indeed, the benefit of phlebotomy of the frontal vein is after phlebotomy of the Cephalic vein, for the old ailments of the face; and for hemicrania, and redness; and foul ulcers.
And the quality of its phlebotomy is, according to what I tell you. The sick man tightens his neck with a bandage until the vein appears. Then take the instrument called Fossorium.
Place the prominent point that is on the head of the Fossorium over the vein itself, and strike upon it with a comb, or with something else in its manner; and allow the blood to flow according to the quantity you wish. Then loosen the wound of the sick person, and bind it until it is healed.
And sometimes it is opened with a wide phlebotome. However, it should not be a phlebotome with a sharp end, like other phlebotomes, but rather one with a broad end. And phlebotomize it in a transverse manner, since the bone is close by; and perhaps the phlebotome will break in it when it is slender.
However, the aid of the two veins which are in the two tear ducts of the two eyes is for the eye from scabies and redness; and for speckles in the eye, and for ailments of the face.
And the quality of their phlebotomy is such that it binds a weak neck with a strip. Then phlebotomize them, and you be standing over his head.
And let the phlebotomy be made transverse to the length slightly, with a small phlebotom, a little broad, for there is no flesh in the place. For if the phlebotom is of a subtle extremity, perhaps it breaks.
Then make the blood run out as much as you need. And place a compress over them, and bind them for one night, and unbind them.
Phlebotomy of the veins of the nose is beneficial for acute fevers, and violent headaches, and ailments of the face, such as hemicrania, and redness that occurs in the face, especially when it is old.
And the quality of its phlebotomy is such that it binds the weak neck. Then hold his nose with your left hand, and take a slender, long lancet, and insert it into the middle of its nostril, between that which distinguishes the nose according to its straightness. Because the vein does not appear to the senses there, and because blood begins to flow immediately.
And you ought to hold your hand with the lancet for a little while, and cause blood to run according to your need. Then bind it with a bandage. For it is restored quickly.
Indeed, phlebotomy of the Guidegi's veins is a help against shortness of breath, and the beginning of leprosy, and melancholic illnesses, and impetigo and bad ulcers, and those that corrode, that is, summer herpes.
And the quality of phlebotomy of them is such that the infirm person should be bound tightly beneath both his shoulders with a bandage, and the artisan should stand over the head of the infirm person, and the infirm person should sit on a seat.
Then the phlebotomist should make a vein incision to the length of the phlebotomy, wide for a short time. Then draw out a moderate quantity of blood, or according to that which you see necessary for it. Then do likewise with the other vein.
Afterwards, loosen the bandage, and bind the two veins with a moderate ligature, so that the infirm person is not over-constricted. And leave it until morning. For the wound is healed.
Concerning phlebotomy of the veins, Algeberich. The veins, however, according to Algeberich, are a help in phlebotomy: because they contribute to the sore throat, and the corruption of the gums: and to bad ulcers: and cracks of the lips, and bad ulcers, even those that are in the nose, and in its surrounding area.
And the quality of their phlebotomy is such that you should make the infirm person sit before you, and bind his neck with a bandage. Then roll back his lip, and look at the two veins, one of which is to the right of the lip, and the second to its left: and the demonstration of each is by the blackness of both. And that is true, because in their surrounding area are small, black veins. Therefore, cut each with a single incision.
If however there is doubt upon you, and you do not know which of them it is, then aim at the incision of the larger and more manifest of them.
And similarly do with the two veins which are in the upper lip: and indeed, the custom mostly runs with it: and cut the two veins which are in the lower lip.
Concerning phlebotomy of the veins under the tongue after the phlebotomy of the cephalic veins. However, the benefit of the phlebotomy of the two veins which are under the tongue is that phlebotomy of the cephalic vein is for the obstructions which are in the throat, and the ailment of the uvula, and the ailments of the mouth.
And the quality of phlebotomizing them is such that the weak person sits between your hands in front of the sun: and raise his tongue, and look under his tongue on one side of it a vein, and on the other side of it a vein: and the color of each of them sloping towards blackness.
Therefore phlebotomize each of them: and beware lest you extend your hand too far when phlebotomizing them. For under them are arteries, and perhaps a flow of blood will occur from those arteries.
The three veins, however, which are phlebotomized in the elbow, are those in whose phlebotomy custom has run in all men.
And their phlebotomy is done according to two methods. Either by pricking with a broad myrtle phlebotome: or a small olive-shaped one, sloping: or by cutting with a knife-shaped phlebotome, and it is Alnesil. And this is its form.
And from them are broad and narrow types, according to the wideness and narrowness of the veins. The form of the myrtle phlebotome should be broad, as you see. And it is suitable for opening concave, full, proceeding, apparent, large veins, and those which contain thick, turbid blood.
And this phlebotome is of smaller width, and of finer extremity.
And it is suitable for the phlebotomy of fine veins, which contain thin, yellowish blood.
The Basilic vein, which is one of these three veins, is a help for phlebotomy. Because it extracts blood from illnesses that are under the throat and neck, from that which follows the chest, and the abdomen: and it is fitting for the phlebotomist, when phlebotomizing it, to be cautious, and to be above fear from it, for the artery is under it. Therefore, if he errs, and adds in the phlebotomy puncture, he will strike that artery, and a flow of blood will occur. Therefore, it is necessary that he not phlebotomize it with the phlebotomy lancet; rather, let him use a cutting instrument, like the Alnesil.
If the Basilic vein does not appear clearly, then it is necessary to abandon it, and switch to another, or look for one of its branches; or phlebotomize the brachial vein in its place. For it is clearly visible, and cut it with the phlebotomy lancet Anesil, as we have said.
If, however, you wish to phlebotomize the same vein, then it is necessary, before tightening the arm, to feel the area, until you locate the pulse. Then mark the area with ink, next the arm, and cut the vein with a concave incision using the phlebotomy lancet Alnesil, as we have said. And beware that the incision does not fall a distance from the artery's location.
And when you see, as you tighten the ligature, inflation in the place you marked with ink, then that inflation is the inflation of the artery: therefore, avoid it.
If you see blood at the phlebotomy leap, like a child's urine, and the blood is thin, red: then know that it is from the artery's blood. Then quickly place your finger on it for a long space, then remove your finger. If, therefore, blood is cut off (for it is often cut off), then tighten the arm and release it; and let the patient beware of moving it; and let it be on his fear.
And do not move it for several days, until it is healed.
If, however, the blood is not cut off, and it overcomes you, and there is no medicine present for you at your moment, then cut the artery if it appears to you. For its extremities are contracted, and blood is cut off.
Or take the bark of the fig tree, and split it; take one half, and tie it over the place of the vein's constriction with a bandage and dressings until another day.
Then if the blood is cut off, it is good. And if not, then treat it with that which preceded it in the memory from the place of powders that cut off the flow of blood; and the cutting off of its blood is not difficult in many cases, because of the small place of the wound, and the possibility of a bandage from the arm.
Phlebotomy of the Fusca vein is helpful, because it draws blood from the upper part of the head and the lower part of the body; because it is composed of a branch of the Basilica vein and a branch of the Cephalica vein, as we have said.
And it befits the phlebotomist to be cautious when performing phlebotomy on it, for there is a nerve beneath it. Therefore, if the phlebotomist, while making the incision, encounters a nerve, numbness results, and the healing becomes difficult, and perhaps it will not heal completely.
And this nerve frequently appears to the senses. However, if it is hidden in some people, and is subtle and not shown, then it is necessary that you place your phlebotomy, by which to phlebotomize it, the incision with Alnesil, and avoid the nerve with your skill.
If the vein is between two nerves, then split the vein lengthwise.
Concerning the Cephalic vein. Phlebotomy of the Cephalic vein is helpful, because it draws blood from the head, and is beneficial for eye ailments.
And it is necessary in this vein properly, if you wish, that you phlebotomize it by puncturing with an olive-shaped lancet or with a myrtle-shaped lancet, because it is the safest of all veins, since there is no underlying artery or nerve.
However, it is appropriate for you in phlebotomy to avoid injuring the elbow with the lancet, and to seek a gentler spot; and it does no harm to it, if not found with the first stroke, for it to be repeated with the phlebotomy several times.
However, perhaps it becomes suppurated in some people when it is not phlebotomized on the first stroke, but that suppuration does not harm it in any way.
Concerning the usefulness of Phlebotomy, and the precautions to be observed in it. The quality of Phlebotomy, and its resulting effects, which you must consider in correcting.
First, you should know that phlebotomy is not performed except in the preservation of health, and its persistence, and caution against the onset of illness.
And so that phlebotomy be performed on one of the three veins in the elbow, namely the Cephalic, and the Basilic, and the Median cubital. And phlebotomy should be performed in the beginning of spring on an empty stomach, in the spring and summer, and in autumn and winter after eating, when signs of fullness appear.
And phlebotomy be done on the first or third day after three hours have passed of the day.
However, phlebotomy given in illnesses does not have a set time: but when the need and appropriateness call for it, by night, or by day, and in every hour, and in every time.
And it is not necessary that boys be bled until they reach fourteen years. Nor should a pregnant woman be bled, except from the fourth to the seventh month. Nor should old people who have already passed sixty years be bled.
Therefore, when someone wishes to be bled for whatever reason, it is necessary that they cleanse their bowels beforehand with a gentle clyster, if there is much retained stool, so that the veins during the bleeding do not draw putrid harmful superfluities from the bowels to the principal limbs.
Nor should a patient suffering from toctina, that is, nausea of satiety; nor the inebriated, nor those recovering from drunkenness, be bled until that is removed from them. Nor a sick person with dropsy.
And let phlebotomy be avoided again after colic, vomiting, and diarrhea, and an excess of sexual activity, labor, exercise, vigils, fasting, and any condition that dissolves bodily or animal strength.
Then consider the subtlety of the humors before that, if the blood is thick with foods, drinks, and medicines, if it is possible to do so.
Then let him enter a bath, if nothing prevents him; or let him be exercised by some exercise, so that the blood may be refined.
And place his phlebotomy in the chest, about the third day, as we have said; and strive that his chest be evacuated that day of all evil animal accidents: such as anxiety, anger, and fear; and of all bodily accidents, such as labor, pain, superfluity of coitus, and the like.
And let him have present at his seat things with whose use the custom of men is accustomed, from aromatics, and scents, and rejoicing, and things similar to these, to the extent possible.
Then let the phlebotomist sit on a pillow that is higher than the pillow for the phlebotomist to sit on; afterwards, let him draw his arm out, and let the phlebotomist rub it with his hand twice or thrice. Then tie the ligament with a strap, and wrap it twice.
And let the constriction be moderate, because constriction, when it is unequal, or through excess in the constriction, then it hinders the flow of blood; or in its slackening, then it also hinders the flow of blood.
Then, after the constriction, it is necessary that the phlebotomist rub his hands together until the veins swell and become apparent to the senses.
Then the phlebotomist should wipe the phlebotomized area with a little old oil.
Then he shall place his left index finger slightly over the vein itself, below the place where he intends to make the phlebotomy, so that the vein does not move and the puncture is precise. Because there are veins which, like a fleeing chord, are found during phlebotomy; and there are those that are full of airiness; and when you place the phlebotom on them, they contract beneath the phlebotom, and the phlebotomist is deceived, and the phlebotom does not open the vein; and if he opens it, it is constricted; therefore it is necessary for the phlebotomist to be firm and careful in all these matters.
Then he should place the phlebotom down. If therefore the vein is opened at the first attempt, then it is good. And if not, then do it again a second time a little below or above that place with haste, if the place is not ulcerated.
If, however, it becomes ulcerated, or the patient becomes fearful, then leave him for a day or two days: and do not tighten the ligature. For perhaps it will draw a hot abscess. Nor let him enter a bath.
Then again he should practice phlebotomy, if he wishes.
If the opening is small, or the blood flows subtly, and you fear that not enough of the desired amount will escape from the blood, then again perform phlebotomy at the very opening in a straight line, and add a little in the operation.
And do this with haste, before the place becomes abscessed, for an abscessed place occurs in many people with small incisions.
If therefore you see it already abscessed, then do not repeat on it at all, for it does not excuse anything to you. And place something from the dregs of oil upon it, because it alleviates the flow of blood. And it is better in this place than the oil itself, and than other oils.
And similarly administer the dregs of oil in all your phlebotomies, by which you lance veins to prohibit the flow of blood: and the Tyrians and alfarach and sagzenea do it, when placed from one of them on the place.
For blood is thinned and resolved when it is thick.
If a large abscess should occur at the site of the phlebotomy, for it often happens, especially to one who is not a phlebotomist except on that occasion, or if the opening of the vein is small, then hurry and place upon the site a sponge soaked in water and salt, warmed for a short time; and bind it for one hour; because it is resolved.
And it is necessary that you do this after the exit of blood from the vein itself, with the completion of it, or from another vein.
If some blackness or greenness remains at the site after a few days, it does not harm; and if you wish, place some dissolved aloe or myrrh upon it; or something from the juice of mint, that is, balm or something similar to it.
And very often indeed, abscesses and swellings occur near phlebotomy in the Basilica.
Therefore, place your hand upon it; then if you find softness upon pressing it, then that swelling is bad. Therefore be careful to place upon it something of what we have said. For perhaps blood from an artery will flow from it.
But make a plaster on it with that which has astringency, so that the place is hardened. Then treat it with the remaining treatment, until it is healed.
And it is necessary to extract from every man's blood according to the quantity of its virtue. And that which appears from the color prevailing over the blood.
For if the blood is black, then let it go out until it becomes red; and similarly if you see it thick, then let it go out until it becomes thin; and similarly if it is sharp, until its sharpness is removed.
And it is necessary for one who is full, strong, and in need of bloodletting at once, that the phlebotomy of the vein be widened and the phlebotomist be broad; and in one who is weak, be the opposite of that.
And it is necessary to extract it in stages, and that the opening be narrow; and better that is administered in phlebotomy of a vein is that it be a transverse section, not a puncture.
And this method of phlebotomy is safe from a flow of blood, and from an incision of the nerve; and it is more praiseworthy and safer than phlebotomy by width and length.
And to whom it is accustomed to arrive at phlebotomy syncopes, it is necessary that he eat before the phlebotomy with moderate bread soaked in water of pomegranate juice; or with secaniabin, if it is heated; and extract from him from the blood in three times, or four.
And if he is of a cold complexion, then let him take before the phlebotomy bread soaked in the syrup of miel, or in syrup of honey aromatized with spices, or in an aromatic, fragrant syrup.
If fainting occurs during phlebotomy, and the cause of it is the exit of much blood, then it is necessary that he take in drink water of meat, and a subtle fragrant syrup; and that he use aromatics with algalia, and that his chest be lined with it; and that he use the rest of what we have said in the division in the chapter on syncopes from evacuation.
Whoever wishes to evacuate their arm, and to release their blood a second time, it is necessary for him whose phlebotomy is for much evacuation, and whose strength is weak, that they release the blood gradually by a quantity of strength in continuous days.
But whoever wishes to evacuate their arm and release their blood a second time, and their body is strong, then let them do it after seven hours, or nine, from their first phlebotomy.
But whoever wishes to draw blood from their body to the opposite part to which it inclines, it is necessary that it be evacuated for them on the second, or on the third day.
In whose body, however, there is much blood already heated, and sharpens, and causes fever to occur: it is necessary that blood depart from it in one instance, and a great quantity be drawn from it; and the opening be amplified until fainting occurs; after you have observed all the conditions of phlebotomy; and that you place your hand upon his pulse during the flow of blood, so that death does not occur in place of fainting. For often that happens, when the phlebotomist is ignorant and negligence falls.
And it is not proper, when one wishes to release the arm, and release blood a second time, when the opening of the vein is already closed, and the exit of blood becomes difficult, to press upon it with violence, and quickly bend or extend it. For that is very bad; indeed, leave it, until it is phlebotomized a second time.
Or remove with sharpness the clotted blood from the opening of the vein, and place some salt dissolved in water upon it. And place something of al-fārokh tyriaca, or sagzenea, upon it, and apply a gentle pressure until the blood emerges.
If however the vein is already suppurated, then leave it, and do not cover it, until the abscess is resolved.
If, however, necessity compels you to draw blood a second time, and there is no excuse, then either phlebotomize it above that place, or in another arm in another vein.
However, the arm's vein is phlebotomized at the location of the Fusca and Basilica veins, when they are not found, and are hidden, because it is composed of them.
And the quality of its phlebotomy is such that the infirm person should immerse their hand in warm water until the hand becomes red, and the vein becomes clearly visible.
Then tie it above it with a ligature of medium constriction. Then phlebotomize it transversely, gradually, not laterally, nor lengthwise; and let the opening be wide, and let your phlebotomy be such as to phlebotomize above the joint of the hand for a short time.
If the flow of blood is prevented, then immerse the hand again in warm water, and allow the blood to flow into the water until you achieve your desired result.
However, if you are in the days of summer, then you will excuse yourself from repeating the immersion of the hand in warm water. And indeed the flow of blood is placed most abundantly in warm water in the time of winter.
And phlebotomy of this vein is safer than all veins, because there is no pulsating vein nor nerve beneath it.
Phlebotomy of the right hand's Saluatella vein is beneficial for liver ailments.
And the quality of its phlebotomy is such that you should bind the mahason of the hand with a bandage, or with your hand, after you introduce it into warm water, until the vein swells and is clearly visible. Then, incising the vein transversely. And if you cut it completely, it will not harm him in any way.
And keep your hand away from the phlebotomist. For beneath it are the nerves of the fingers bare of flesh.
Then return the hand to warm water, and allow the blood to flow into it. For if you do not return it to warm water, the blood clots in the opening of the vein, and is prevented from flowing.
When therefore you have drawn out the necessary quantity of blood, then place oil and salt upon the vein: so that it does not quickly consolidate.
And similarly it is necessary that you do with every tight branch.
The advantage of phlebotomy from the left hand, however, is that it is helpful for ailments of the spleen; and similarly do in its phlebotomy as you did in the second equally.
The advantage of saphenous phlebotomy is for ailments in the lower part of the body, such as ailments of the womb, and retention of menses, and infirmities of the kidneys, and old ulcers of the hips and legs, and similar ailments.
And the method of its phlebotomy is that the sick person should immerse their foot in warm water and make friction upon it until the veins swell; and tie above the joint of the foot with a bandage. And indeed the vein's location is near the heel, appearing towards the big toe; and branches from it into many branches on the foot's face.
Therefore, phlebotomize it in its larger branch, or near the heel in its confluence, because it is better and safer.
If you phlebotomize it on the foot's surface, then beware of the nerves that are under it on the foot's surface.
And place your phlebotomy so that you phlebotomize it across, as if you wish to cut it: and let the phlebotomist be skilled.
If however the exit of the blood is hindered, then again place his foot in warm water; and let the blood run into it, until it is evacuated.
If, however, the phlebotomist errs in the first instance, then he should repeat the phlebotomy a little higher up, for the place is safe, and you need not fear harm from it, when you beware of the nerves, as we said.
And similarly with the Saphena of the other foot equally.
The Sciatic vein's location, as we said, is near the heel on the wild side.
And the aid of phlebotomy is for the pain of the hip, when it is due to hot blood.
And the quality of its phlebotomy is that the sick person should enter a bath and hurry; and that they should bind his leg from the side of the hip up to the heel by four fingers, with a long thin bandage: for it does not appear except for that.
When it therefore appears, then let the phlebotomist cut it according to whatever skill is possible to you, or according to the transverse method; and it is better either to cut it with an incision or to divide it with a section. For its location is safer, and it is in many people very hidden.
For its location is safer, and it is in many people very hidden. If you do not find it, and it does not appear to the senses at all, then let the phlebotomist cut some branch of it, and that is the one which appears on the back of the foot and towards the ear; and beware of the nerves, and make the blood run in whatever quantity you wish.
Then loosen the binding, and place a skin over the place of phlebotomy, and bind the place. For it is quickly healed.
Concerning cupping, and the quality of its use.
Cupping instruments are made from horns, and from metal, and from glass.
And cupping indeed is done in two ways. With scarification, and the extraction of blood; and the other is cupping without scarification.
And this cupping which is without scarification, is in two ways. For it is either with fire. Or it is without fire.
And the cuppings which are administered with scarification and the extraction of blood are fourteen places of the body. Of which one is, the cupping Alnocrati, and is at the back of the head; and Alkehel, and is the middle of the neck; and the cuppings Alhagdahim, and are two lamina of the neck on both sides together; and the cuppings menti, and is under the jaw in the lower part of the mouth; and the cuppings of two shoulder-blades; and the cuppings Alachosos above the end of the tail; and the cuppings of two armpits, and are in the middle of the two arms; and the cuppings of two thighs; and the cuppings of two calves.
And indeed cupping does not draw blood from the small veins scattered in the flesh, and because of that no virtue is lost from them, as is the case with phlebotomy. Nor should cupping, whether with or without fire, be administered in any illness arising from repletion until the whole body is emptied.
If necessity prompts cupping from illness, or for habit, we administer it at any hour at the beginning of the month, at its end, and in the middle of it, and at any time.
This is because there are people who, when blood multiplies in them to the point where they need its extraction by cupping, find heaviness and headache in their heads.
And some of them find fullness and redness in their face, head, and neck. And some of them find itching in their face and forehead, and darkness and dullness in their eyes.
And some of them scratch the place of their cupping. And some of them have their laughter multiplied. And some of them find the taste of blood in their mouth: or the tongue is suppurated, and they spit out blood. And some of them have their sleep multiplied. And some of them see in their dreams blood and redness, and slain men, and wounds, and things similar to these.
Therefore, when we see something like that, and especially if it is in the third middle of the month, we then order that venesection be performed after two or three hours have passed of the day.
The benefit of venesection of the nape of the neck is that it alleviates heaviness in the head and that which flows to the eyes. However, it is necessary that it be after the evacuation of the whole body.
And this venesection is in the place of a cephalic phlebotomy.
And it is not permitted to use it for one of cold disposition or in whom there is a cold. For it brings great harm to him.
And on account of that, it is not appropriate that the elderly use it, nor those with cold ailments in their head.
If one is constantly over it, forgetfulness is generated in him.
And therefore it is necessary to command the wind-doctor to put his hand for a short while lower with the windpipe, fearing the generation of forgetfulness.
Ventosation, or Alkehel, is in place of the phlebotomy of the Fusca and the phlebotomy of the Basilica, and therefore it benefits asthma, and constriction of breathing, and rupture of the breathing instrument, and coughing, and repletion.
And it is necessary that the Alkehel cupping be impelled for a short time, because if it is placed lower, it generates weakness in the heart and stomach.
Ventosation of the alhagdahim benefits accidental pains in the head, and ophthalmia, and hemicrania, and perforation, and pain in the roots of the teeth: and it is in place of phlebotomy of the Basilica.
And it is necessary that you command the wind-doctor not to press his hand with the scarification, so that he does not cut the artery and cause a flow of blood.
Ventosation under the chin benefits sores in the mouth, and corruption of the gums, and similar to them from illnesses that are in the mouth: and it stands in place of the phlebotomy of alieherich, which are on the two lips.
Ventosation of the shoulder blades benefits alchafacham, which is produced by inflammation and heat.
Ventosation of the inner parts of the two armpits benefits the relief of phlebotomy of the three veins, Basilica, and Fusca, and Cephalica; because it draws blood from all those small veins that are in the flesh; and those small veins draw from other larger veins than them, until the drawing reaches the three veins.
And it is necessary that you command the wind-doctor not to proceed too much in the scarification, because the place is deprived of flesh, and beneath it are nerves and arteries.
A cupping that is applied over the alchausos benefits hemorrhoids of the anus and lower ulcers.
And it is necessary that you command the cupper to use a large, air-filled cupping, because the area needs strong suction, and perhaps the small cupping devices will break; and let it be scarified with a large scarification.
Cupping of the thighs reduces swelling noticeably, because they draw blood from the entire body, and they relieve long-standing pain in the kidneys, and the womb, and the bladder; they induce menstruation, and they alleviate bother and discomfort; and they take the place of phlebotomy of the two saphenous veins and alhorcobeni.
However, they weaken the body greatly, and cause fainting in many people.
And the cupping of alhorcobeni is nearly as helpful as the cupping of both thighs.
The quality of applying cupping is to place the cupping initially empty, and to draw with moderate suction; and do not prolong the application of the cupping, but place them quickly, and remove them quickly, so that the humors may come to the area with equal arrival; and do not cease to repeat this and continue until you see the area already reddening and swelling, and the redness of blood appears; then scarify, and repeat the suction gradually. Then consider the disposition of the bodies.
For those people of tender flesh, with rare pores, it is necessary to scarify them once, no more, so that the area does not become ulcerated.
And instruct the cupper to enlarge the scarification a little, and deepen it slightly; and to moderate the suction with ease, speed, and gentle movement.
If there is thickness in the blood, then it is necessary to scarify him twice. In the first instance, a pathway is opened for the thinning and liquefaction of the blood; and in the second, for the meticulous examination of the extraction of thick blood.
If the blood is very foul, then let the scarification be done a third time, so that the final result may be achieved.
And finally, when we wish to extract blood gradually, or a little at a time, one scarification suffices for us. If we wish for a large extraction of blood, we scarify many times.
And if we measure that the blood is thick, then it is necessary that it be scarified with deep incisions; and the equal measure in scarification is the depth of the skin.
What is it that must be administered from oils at the application of cupping glasses, and what should the cupper beware of?
In that person whose skin is thick, hard, dark, and whose pores are tight, it is necessary to anoint the cupping locations with oils that are opening, soothing, and dissolving: if it is in the summer, like the oil of alkekengi, or bruised oil, or oil of sweet almonds, or oil of pumpkin seed.
And if it is in the winter, then narcissus oil, or lily oil, or camomile oil, or savin oil; and similar to them.
If however the excess is thick, cold: then the oil should be amaranth oil, or balsam oil, or white oil, or dill oil; and similar to them.
If however the cupper is of wide pores, tender flesh: then it is necessary that he abstain from oil, and that these wash the cupping locations after cupping with rosewater, or with cold water, or with soothing water, or with pumpkin water, or with purslane water; and similar to them.
That person whose blood is of much moisture, should wash the cuppings with vinegar, or with myrtle water, and sumac; and similar to them.
However, whoever has thick excesses, should wash their cuppings with old wine, or with samsuca water, or with dill decoction, or chamomile; and similar to them.
And it is necessary that cupping be avoided in a bath, or in the vicinity of a bath; indeed, it is necessary that it be administered after exiting the bath by an hour, or by two hours.
And it is not appropriate for someone to sleep after cupping.
What is it by which the cupping, or bloodletting, should be governed before cupping?
And after it, it is necessary, first of all, to consider: then if the cupper or bloodletter is choleric, and sharpness and inflammation prevail over his blood, then it is necessary that he receive cooling things, such as pomegranate juice, and also endive with vinegar and lettuce, and secaniabin, and iuleb, and similar to them.
And place his food chickens, and the meats of sheep sekebiget, and foods seasoned with agrimony, and similar to them.
And whose complexion is cold, it is necessary that he take in drink syrup of honey, or of almiua, or alsecaniabin made from seeds; and let him take moderate fragrant wine, which is between old and new; and let him be instructed to use little food. And place his food chickens, and canebir, and sparrows, that is, small birds, and doves' young.
And it is necessary that the drink on the day of cupping and bloodletting be more than the food; and it is necessary that there be given in the drink to some people at the hours tyriaca alfaroch, or medicine of musk, that is, muscat, or alesselithe before cupping; and before bloodletting, or after: so that the principal limbs may be strengthened, and the blood refined. And it is not necessary that they take it in heated drink.
Concerning cupping without scarification. However, cupping without scarification is cupping that is placed on the liver, and spleen, and gout, and on the stomach, navel, and kidney areas, and the pouch of the loins, because these limbs do not tolerate scarification upon themselves.
And they are not sought after unless there is either an attachment of blood from a limb to a limb; just as we place a cupping vessel on the breasts in a sickness of nasal blood flow. And we use them to release cold, viscous airiness from a limb; such as placing a cupping vessel on the stomach and navel. For it itself thins the limb and warms it, and removes the pain because it has resolved that airiness.
It is also placed on the kidneys, when obstruction or stone occurs in them. For by its power of attraction perhaps it opens the obstruction or extracts the stone from its place.
And similarly it does when placed on the liver and spleen, when there is viscous airiness to be treated in either of them.
And these cupping glasses are administered empty with only incision. And sometimes they are administered with fire.
And sometimes they are administered full of lukewarm water in diseases of pleurisy: and that is, so that the cupping glass be filled, and be large, with just warm water, or water in which herbs suitable to it have been boiled.
Form of cupping glass administered with fire.
Let its opening be the width of two open fingers, according to what we have shaped it: and its depth be half a palm: and let there be a small hole in its side, approximately in the middle of it, to accommodate a needle: let it be made from bronze, or brass, with thick, smooth, equal, polished edges, so that it does not injure the limb at its placement upon it: and let there be a crossbar of bronze or iron in its middle, where the candle with the fire is placed.
And now this cupping glass is made large, larger than the one we have described, and somewhat smaller than that, according to the diseases and age of the one who uses it.
For the cupping glasses of children, and of those who are thin, are different from the cupping glasses of men and those with thick bodies.
The method of placing this cupping glass with fire upon the limb is this: light a wick with fire from linen properly, or a small candle of wax, and place it over the middle of the crossbar that is in the middle of the cupping glass; so that the fire is burning approximately at the lower part of the cupping glass, so that the sick person's body is not burned.
Then it should be placed on the limb, and a finger should be placed over the hole that I mentioned, until when we hold the cupping glass; while we need it, let us remove the finger, and vapor will come out through that hole, and the cupping glass will be released immediately.
Then light the wick according to its manner, and repeat it, if you need it.
However, in a cupping glass administered in the illness of pleurisy with water, there is no crossbar, nor hole; and it is not administered unless it is filled with water, and is placed upon the limb only.
And this is its form.
And this cupping glass, the larger it is, so that it can hold much water, is better.
Concerning the suspension of Bloodsuckers.
Bloodsuckers are not applied in numerous places, except in those limbs where the application of cupping is not possible due to their small size, such as the lip, and the gums, and similar parts. Or on a limb stripped of flesh, such as the finger and the nose, and similar parts.
And the quality of using them is: that you obtain bloodsuckers that are in fresh, clean waters, free from putrefaction.
Then they are to be left in fresh water by day and by night, until they are hungry, and nothing remains in their belly. Then the body is to be emptied first by bloodletting and by cupping. Then wash the limb of the sick person until it turns red. Then place them upon it.
When therefore they are filled, and fall, and suction of the place is possible with the cupping vessel, then it is more useful in the treatment; and if not, then wash the place with vinegar. Then with much water, and it is rubbed, and squeezed out.
If the flow of blood after the fall of the Sanguisugae is prolonged, and it is oozing: then immerse a linen cloth in cold water, and place it above, until the oozing is stopped.
If the blood is multiplied, then pulverize on it ground zegi, or gallnuts, and similar astringents, until the bleeding is stopped.
Or place the halves of shelled beans on the area: and leave them, until the beans adhere to the place, for the blood is stopped.
And if the use of leeches is necessary, when possible, change them.
If however the leeches are prevented from being suspended, then the area is to be wiped with fresh blood. Or fix a needle in the areas, until something comes out of the blood. Then place them, for when they sense something of the blood, they immediately adhere.
Therefore, when you want them to fall off, sprinkle something of crushed aloe, or salt, or ash on them, and they will fall off immediately.
This chapter is also very necessary in the art of medicine, and it is the restoration of fractures and dislocations of accidents in bones.
Know, O children, that the foolish among physicians and the common people boast about this chapter, and those who have never examined the book of the ancients, nor read a letter from it.
And for this reason, this method is private among the sciences in our land. And I never encountered any good in it at all, and I did not obtain what I have obtained from it unless because of the length of reading the ancient books, and the study on the understanding of them, until I extracted the knowledge of it from them.
Then I adhered to experimentation and study for the length of my life.
And now I have described to you from it in this chapter all that my knowledge contains: and upon which my experience passed, after I abbreviated it for you, and freed it from the occupation of elongation, and abbreviated it by the end of abbreviation, and showed it by the end of declination: and I formed in it many forms from the forms of instruments that are administered in it, since it is from the addition of declination, as I did in the two preceding chapters.
Chapter II.
It is necessary, as we say in the prologue of this chapter, to summarize the discourse and chapters, the understanding of which the craftsman is first required to consider regarding their truth: so that you, and those who are eager, may know, or learn this noble art, and others from you.
I say, therefore, that when a fracture, or dislocation, or twisting, or fall, occurs to someone, then it is necessary to hasten first to bleed him, and to loosen him, or both at the same time: if nothing prevents it, such as weakness of strength; or if the one to whom something has happened from among those is a child or a decrepit old man; or if it is a time of great heat or great cold.
Then let him be content in his food, with cold vegetables, and the flesh of birds and kids; and prohibit wine, and fatty meats, and overfilling from foods and all food that fills the veins with blood. Until when you are certain about the hot abscess and do not fear the effusion of matter to the limb: then let the sick man return to his first regimen with which his custom ran.
When, therefore, the fractured bone begins to be restored, then it is necessary that the sick person be fed with nutritious foods, with much, thick, heavy nourishment, in which there is viscosity: such as foods made from cooked wheat with water, and rice, and heads, and feet, and bellies of cows, and eggs, and fresh fish: and thick wine, and similar to them. For with this regimen the coagulation of the fracture happens more quickly and better.
And know that fractured bones, when they are in men who are in early old age and decrepit, are not possible to be joined and consolidated according to their nature always, because of the drying out of their limbs; and those from them are consolidated and joined in the end of their softness, like the bones of small children.
However, nature connects something similar to glue, in which there is thickness, to the fractured bone from every side, to which it adheres and binds it, until they are glued together and bound together, until it reaches the end of strength and firmness, as it was at first, until nothing prevents it from its functions; and for this reason it is necessary that you provide the sick person with foods that have heaviness, viscosity, and thickness, as we have said.
And know that the types of fractures are diverse, according to the diversity of the limbs; because a fracture of the leg is different from a fracture of the head bone; and a fracture of the chest bone is different from a fracture of the spine; and likewise all the other limbs are different from each other; and I have come with a recollection of every type of fracture, displayed in its own chapter, distinct from another. And the types of bone fractures are diversified even within themselves.
Because a fracture of it can be curved, besides which splinters occur in it. And sometimes its fracture is along the length of the bone; and its fractures are splintery, that is, splinters and proceeding additions, like those in a reed when a knife is fitted to it for writing. And not proceeding; and there is a fracture with a wound and disruption at the head; and there is a fracture with a small fissure.
And every type has an appropriate nature, or instrument, in its restoration, according to which its recollection will come, distinct in its locations.
And from that by which the fracture of the bone is known, is its twisting and its prominence; and its appearance to the senses, and its sound when you compress it with your hand.
Therefore, when there is no apparent twisting in place, nor sound upon your touch when you touch the bone with agitation, nor does the infirm person find great pain there, then there is no fracture there, rather it is possible that there is a twist or a small fissure; therefore you should not move it with your hand and compression entirely, but rather place upon it from the medicines, of which its recollection comes, after that moment which is suitable to the place; then a subtle bandage should be applied.
And know that when a place is bowed and split into two, besides the struggles that happen in it, nevertheless, every part is removed from its counterpart; then it is necessary for you to begin at your hour for its rectification, equalizing it before a hot abscess happens to it.
If however a hot abscess happens to it, then leave it for a few days, until the abscess rests. Then equalize it according to whatever method is possible from gentleness and skill.
And know that its restoration and equalization are easier than that of a bone in which struggles occur.
Then bind it, according to how its memory will come to you.
If however there are struggles in the bone, then necessary is the extension of this fractured limb from two parts, if it is a hand or a foot: or with your hand, if the limb is small: or with two ropes, or with a rope and a hand.
And let your position be such that you place the limb over an equal place, according to its natural form, until when the parts of the fractured limb are extended: then strive to restore those additions to their places with all your skill, and according to any method you can: and be careful according to your strength, lest pain or injury befall the weak through your operation: and strive according to your strength to apply one of the two bones with its partner, according to the best forms.
And it is necessary at that time to try and touch it with your hand. If therefore you see there anything different, correct it, and equalize it according to the measure of your ability.
And beware of violent extension and strong compression, as many fools do. For often they cause a hot abscess or contraction in the limb through that operation of theirs, as we have already seen it from their operations many times.
Then bind after the equalization and proper operation, and the tightening of that limb, and rest, and tranquility; and admonish the sick person about it. And make him beware lest he move it in the hours of his waking and sleeping, at his turning and stirring, and at his excretion, and all his movements with his utmost power. And that he beware lest the position of the limb be one that will be followed by pain. For when he feels pain or injury in the disposition of the limb's position, then it is necessary to change it to another disposition in which he does not feel pain.
And be careful with him that his position be thus equal, straight, so that tortuosity does not befall the limb when it is restored.
And the quality of the fracture of the limb is, according to what I narrate.
Know that broken limbs are diversified in their smallness, and their size, and their shape.
Therefore, those of them that are small, like an arm, and a finger, and a toe, and similar to them, then it is necessary that there be a wrapping of soft, fine cloth. But those of them that are large, like the thigh and the leg, it is necessary that there be a wide, hard wrapping on them.
Because a wide ligament connects a large limb and binds it from every side with equal constriction, so that no blemish enters it.
Then, after your evacuation, begin to apply a suitable liniment to it, on soft linen over the place of its fracture. Then begin to wrap the bandage over the place of its fracture three or four times, according to what the limb deserves; and hold your hand for a while on the bandage.
Then proceed with it to the upper part from the place of the fracture, and bind less tightly than your constriction with which you bound the broken place. Then move away the bandage from the fracture a little, and loosen the constriction gradually, until you take hold of a large part of the sound place.
Then take another strip, and wrap it again over the broken place in turns. Then proceed with the bandage to the lower part from the fracture. And let your operation on the tightening of the bandage, and its loosening, be according to what we said in the first upper bandage.
Then place between the bandages soft linen, or cloth, with which the twist of the fracture is equalized, if there is twisting in it: and if not, do not place anything in it.
Then wrap another strip over it. Afterwards, place over these bandages properly made stars immediately, if there is no swelling or hot abscess in the place.
If however there is swelling or abscess in it: then place over it that which will settle that abscess and remove the swelling; and leave it for several days. Then tie over it the stars.
And let the stars be from the halves of broad reeds, shaved, cleverly shaped; or let them be from the wood from which sieves are made, which are made from pine, or gerard, that is, palm branches, or calingi; and let the breadth of each star be according to this form and this same figure.
However, it is necessary that the star placed over the wound itself be a little thicker and wider than the other stars; and the length of the star should be according to the size and smallness of the limb.
Then tie over the stars with another bandage, according to the same first binding. Then tie over it carefully with threads, according to what we said about the binding; and it is that your binding should be tighter over the place of the fracture; and the further it is from the fracture, the looser the binding.
And it is necessary that the middle threads be of medium thickness and fineness, and be of soft flax.
For if the threads are thick, as I have seen from the operation of foolish men who place their threads from twisted flax cords, it is a great error, since the binding falls outside of its proper quality with them.
And again, thin threads do not suit, for you will not achieve with them through the binding that which you wish.
And it is not necessary that there be less than a finger between the splint and the splint.
If the sick person is injured by the ends of the splints after the binding in healthy places, then place under them soft wool, or dyed wool, until nothing is injured from it.
However, when there is a fracture with a wound, and a break occurs in the skin, I will come with a recollection of it in the second chapter, in accordance with its particularity.
And know that not every broken limb needs to be bound with splints from the first day. That is because, when a limb is large, you should not place splints upon it unless after five days, or seven, or more, according to your safety from the event of a hot abscess.
And this is the method of plasters, by which the ancients restored those which are placed upon a fracture and dislocation.
A method of a common abbreviated plaster, restoring a fracture, suitable for many complexions, especially women and children, since it is from it that neither heat nor cold prevails.
And it is, that you take from the mill's dust, and it is the flour-meal that hangs on the mill's walls at the grinding of the millstone: and you make it as it is, except that you sieve it with egg-white: and place its preparation not thick, nor thin. Then use it.
A different method of plaster, restoring fracture, dislocation, and torsion. Take aloes, and laudanum, and acacia, and enula, and mugath; and juice of all, ana 10 drams; myrrh, and aloes, both ana 5 drams; and alethil 20 drams.  Grind all together, and sieve them, and mix with alethil water; or with egg white, if the patient's complexion is heated. Then use this plaster. For it is a good composition, restoring broken bones quickly, and benefiting many people.
Another method of plaster, which also benefits fracture and torsion. Take mugath, and mess, and white mallow, of all ana 10 drams; myrrh, and aloes, both ana 5 drams; acacia 6 drams; Armenian bole 20 drams. Grind all together with much trituration, and sieve them, and make into a poultice with water, or egg white: and administer.
A method of plaster for joints and bones separated from their places; and it relieves pain that occurs to them, and bone fissure, and fracture. Take wool, and soak it in vinegar and decocted oil, and place it over the affected area.
And in this plaster there is no power of restoration, but it is good in quieting a hot abscess; and it expels pains properly.
A method of plaster that restores a broken bone. Take leaves of the fig tree, and leaves of wild poppy: and grind them all, and make a plaster from both.
A method of a shortened plaster, administered in the restoration of a fractured bone; and when you want resolution of the remaining abscess. Take root of marsh mallow, and camomile, and violet flowers, and herb flour, of each one part: let all be ground, and be made into a paste with wine, if the limb is not inflamed.
If however it is inflamed, then make it with water of moist coriander, or with water, and use it.
A method of another stronger plaster for resolution, than this first one, when a hard abscess occurs in the restoration of a limb. Take root of marsh mallow, and flax seed, and pomegranate seeds, and melilot, and marsh mallow, and violet flowers, and camomile, of each one part; let all be ground, and be made into a paste with willow water, or with fresh water, or with wine. All of that according to the warmth of the limb and the rest of its heat.
Hippocrates however did not say in his book that a plaster should be placed on a fractured limb during its restoration, except for one made from wax and oil: nothing else; and he related that it should be intermediate in thickness and fineness.
Galen, however, believed that things which dry out heat should be placed on a fractured limb during its restoration, such as myrrh, and aloes and frankincense, and similar ones to those we have mentioned.
Method of the plaster that helps against injury and pain. Take equal parts of barley, chickpeas, cut human hair (or bird feathers), marshmallow root, and salt: grind them, sieve them, and mix them: and make a plaster from it.
However, the amount of time that the bandage should remain on, and then be removed, is that you should then consider if the patient experiences no pain, nor itching, nor if the fractured bone is moved from its place; then do not remove it for many days. But if intense itching or disturbing pain or swelling occurs at the location, then quickly remove it in an hour, and take the plaster off: and take a soft cloth, or a soft sea sponge, wet: and immerse it in lukewarm water, and wash the place with it, until the itching subsides, and the pain is calmed.
But if intense itching or disturbing pain or swelling occurs at the location, then quickly remove it in an hour, and take the plaster off: and take a soft cloth, or a soft sea sponge, wet: and immerse it in lukewarm water, and wash the place with it, until the itching subsides, and the pain is calmed. Then leave the limb at rest for one hour. Then place upon it shredded wool, soaked in vinegar and oil, or rose oil, and bind it over it for one night, until you are sure of being free from a hot abscess, and the swelling of the limb is calmed, and its pain is removed.
Then apply it again to a fine bandage and a small plaster; and do not tighten it with your initial constriction, and use fine bandages with it, until it is healed.
If you see that the abscess, redness, pain, swelling, and all the accompanying conditions have been completely removed, and you no longer need a plaster and bandage, then apply it again as you did at first, evenly.
If none of the things we have mentioned happen to the limb, then do not loosen it, unless after three, or four, or five, or seven days. And when twenty days have passed, as it appears to you from the limb's loosening, as we said, until when the fracture adheres and the flesh's coagulation approximates over it: then also add more to your initial bandage, and add also to the thickening of the weak food, as its prior application recalled.
If, however, you see the fracture site already drying out and wasting away more than it should, then know that nourishment is being prevented from reaching it. Therefore, anoint it with warm water every time you loosen it, and let it be so for all three days, and slightly ease the bandage.
By this operation, then, nourishment flows to the limb, and it is healed quickly.
However, what foolish restorers do with a fractured limb a second time, when it is not restored at first as it should be, and is restored in a crooked fashion, is an error of their operation and a great fear.  And if it were correct, the ancients would have said so in their books, and would have operated with it.
And I have seen no trace of it anywhere at all, and it is better that it not be done.
Concerning the accidental fracture of the head.
The kinds of fracture are diverse, and its shapes are many: and its causes are distinct.
For there is a fracture that occurs from striking with a sword: and the blow removes the bone completely until it reaches the siphac, which is beneath the bone, just as an axe does in wood: and because of this, this type of fracture is called Axial.
Or the sword cuts a part of the bone, and cuts its surface, and the incision does not penetrate to its utmost extent: and this type of fracture is called Kalaan, that is, Lifting absolutely.
And there is a wound of two fractures, either large or small.
And there is a fracture, which is a crushing, or attrition: and its cause is a blow with a stone, or a fall on a stone, or similar things.
And this fracture is also either penetrating, which is now approaching the tissue that is beneath the bone, or it is on the surface of the bone; and the wound of these two fractures is also either small or large.
And there is a fracture, which is hidden in the bone in the subtlety of a hair: and it is a small fissure, and because of that this type of fracture is called Capillaris.
And from those is a fracture, which occurs from a fall, or a blow of a stone, and things similar to them, which cause the lamina of the bone to enter the interior, and a hollow space is made; as happens to bronze kettles, when a blow strikes them, and part of them enters the interior.
And this happens most often in the heads of moist bones, such as the heads of children.
And all these types of fractures are made separately, and I will come with a recollection of that entire thing in its place.
And we recognize all these types of fractures by probing over them, and investigating them with probes, and removing the putrefied flesh that is over them.
However, the capillary species is recognized by this, that it is uncovered above the bone, and it is wiped and anointed on it with ink: for the fracture appears black.
In the treatment of a fracture, first consider the patient's symptoms: then, if you see from the symptoms that it signifies clearly an impending danger, such as vomiting, cholera, extension, loss of intellect, loss of voice, fainting, acute fever, protrusion of the eyes, redness of the eyes, and similar symptoms in various conditions, undoubtedly it will not be healed. And if you see symptoms not alarming you, and you hope for recovery, then begin its treatment.
If a wounded person comes to you immediately after being wounded, and it is in the days of winter, then it is necessary that you strive in the removal of the bone before the fourteenth day according to all conditions.
And if it is in the days of summer, then it is necessary that you hasten to remove the bone before the seventh day, before that which is under the bone from the membrane is corrupted, and those accidents occur that we have described.
If the fracture of the bone has now reached the membrane touching the brain, and is with fragments and crushing, then it is necessary that you cut away the broken and crushed part, as I describe to you.
And it is necessary that you shave the head of the wounded person, and uncover the bone in whatever way is possible for you, and according to the shape of the wound and what is mild on the sick person.
If, during the uncovering of the bone, a flow of blood or a hot abscess occurs, then apply to it what is appropriate. And it is necessary that you fill the place with cloths soaked in wine and rose oil, and make the wound rest until the abscess subsides and you are secure from the flow of blood. Then begin the treatment of the bone and its removal.
And that is done according to one of two methods.
One method is to cut the bone with a scalpel of a sharp point; and this is its form.
Then apply another scalpel, slightly wider than the first, and this is its form.
Then apply yet another scalpel, wider still than the second.
And the second method is that you should have a number of different scalpels, some wider than others, and some shorter than others; and let their edges be sharp, and let them be made of iron, or steel; and use ease in striking upon the scalpel so that it does not strike the head and injure it.
If the bone is strong, hard: then it is necessary that you pierce around it, before you apply the scalpels, with drills, which are called non-penetrating drills, and are not so called except because they do not pass through the limit of the bony flesh to that which is behind it; because a drill has a round end on the part below its sharp head, like a margin, and a small circle prevents sinking, and passing through the thickness of the bone.
And it is suitable for you to take from these drills a multitude, each appropriate to the thickness of the bone, until you have a drill for every skull; whose sharp end's size in length and shortness should be in proportion to the thickness of that skull.
And this is the form of three kinds of drills, or trepans.
The method of piercing around the fractured bone is: that you place the drill on the bone, and revolve it with your fingers, until you know that the bone has been pierced. Then change the drill to another place, and place what is between every hole the thickness of a radius, or approximately that.
Then cut with the chisels what is between every hole from the bone; and make it thinner than you can above it from the end of lightness, as we said, until you remove the bone, either with your hand or with some other instruments that you have prepared for it: such as pliers and fine forceps.
And it is necessary that you guard against every precaution, so that the drill, or chisel, touches nothing of the flesh.
When therefore you have encircled the bone by piercing, and it has been separated from the flesh, if it has been continuous with it, and you have pulled it out, it is necessary that you scrape and make even the extremity of that which remains in the bone with another similar instrument to the chisel. However, it ought to be thinner and finer than other chisels.
If however anything of small bones, and splinters, remains, then take them away with ease, with what is with you of instruments. Then treat the wound after that with the bandages and ointments that we have said.
And another method of operation is easy, completely far from fear, which Galen said, and praised it with great praise: and this is his statement. It is necessary for you first to begin to uncover the part of the bone from the place where the fracture is more severe and more obvious until when you have uncovered that part and have placed under it the extremity of this lenticular chisel, which has this form.
And the lenticular part, smooth, does not cut anything: and its sharp part, running in length on its two sides, as you see: so that the lenticular part rests against the siphac, its sharp face resting on the bone.
Then strike the chisel from one side with a small mallet, until you cut the entire bone with ease, as it turns; and you be secure from the cloth, that no accident happen to it, which you fear entirely.
And if the surgeon were not more foolish than men, and more ignorant of it, and were not asleep, then if anything remained attached to the bone from the cloth in some places, he would cut it from it with the extremity of the lenticular chisel itself, and free it from it with ease. It is freed from it without harm, and without fear.
And if the fracture of the bone does not penetrate to the cloth, and that which is cut away from the bone is its surface, and there remain on it roughness and subtle irregularities, then it is necessary to scrape away that roughness, and eradicate those irregularities with the fine razors of which you have prepared a number of different sizes, so that it may be possible for you to administer from them whatever is more appropriate and straighter in every place, according to that to which the operation leads you, and the fractured bone, and its shape. And it is necessary that you administer in your reasoning, with which in the first place you scrape the bone, more widely those razors. Then use after it a finer one.
And it is necessary that you administer in your reasoning, with which in the first place you scrape the bone, more widely those razors. Then use after it a finer one. And do not cease to do this according to continuity, until you arrive at administering the thinnest and finest of them all.
In every one of the remaining small fissures, and subtle fracture, it is necessary to administer care, according to that which leads to its rectification.
And it is a matter not hidden over every one in this art having any study, and stood upon that which we have written and shown in great fractures.
If, however, the flap is retained when you excavate the bone, then it is necessary to take a linen cloth, according to the quantity of the wound, and immerse it in rose oil, and place it over the wound opening. Then take another cloth, doubled or tripled, and immerse it in wine and rose oil, and place it over the first cloth.  And do this as easily as you can over it, so that it is not weighed down by this.
Then apply a wide bandage over it; and do not tighten it, unless by a quantity which holds the wound only.  And leave it with this treatment for one day or two days, until you are secure from a hot abscess. Then loosen it, and apply after it medicines with which superfluous dryness is removed: such as lily roots, and herb flour, and frankincense powder, and aristolochia, and similar to them; and it is that you should make a powder from these medicines, which is powdered over the wound as if dry.
And universally apply to it any medicine of whose property it is that it cleanses and does not bite. And take care, according to your skill, that the wound in your treatment is clean: neither be there filth of ointment, nor any dirt.
And take care, according to your skill, that the wound in your treatment is clean: neither be there filth of ointment, nor any dirt. Nor allow the virus to gather on it at all: for when the virus gathers on the brain membrane, it corrupts it and rots it, and great harm comes upon the sick person afterward; and this happens in the head’s cavities, when the bone is cleansed from it, especially when its care is neglected, a blackness in its surface.
Therefore, if the sick person experiences the ailments we have described, know that it is undoubtedly harmful.
And if blackness does not occur, except from the medicine placed upon it, and it is in the power of that medicine to cause that blackness: then it is necessary that you take one part of honey, three parts of rose oil, and linen with them. Then place it over the cavity: afterward, treat it with the kinds of remedies that are suitable until it is healed.
Concerning the restoration of the Nose when it is broken.
Know that only the two upper parts of the Nose are broken simultaneously, or one of them: because they are two bones; since its lower part is cartilaginous, it does not break, and it is not afflicted with anything except abrasion, and twisting, and crookedness.
If one of the two parts is broken, then it is necessary to insert the little finger into the nostril and straighten the fracture with your index finger and thumb on the outside, until the nose returns to its natural shape: and do this artfully, with ease. And beware that your operation upon the afflicted does not cause pain.
If the fracture is in the upper part of the nose, and the finger does not reach it, then it is necessary to straighten it with the end of a rod, of which the thickness is small.
If, however, the fracture is in two parts, then do likewise: and hasten its restoration on the first day of the fracture, if possible. And if not, then after the seventh or tenth day, by means of rest of a hot abscess.
Then insert into the end of the nose a bandage made of linen cloth, if the fracture is in one part; or insert two bandages if the fracture is in two parts; and let the bandage have a thickness of such a quantity as to fill the nostril.
And some of the ancient restorers said that the bandages should be soaked in butter, and changed every day. However, that does not seem to me to be so; rather, the bandage ought to be soaked in the white of an egg, mixed with mill dust. Then leave the bandage until the bone is strengthened and the cartilage is hardened.
And sometimes a goose feather is inserted into the nose in place of a bandage, after a soft cloth has been wrapped around it; and this holds the nasal fracture more firmly, and so that the weak person is not prevented from breathing.
And this is not necessary. If you wish, do it; and if you wish, make bandages.
If, while treating a hot abscess, the nose happens to be injured again, plaster the nose with caeroto, or with cot infused in rose oil, or with a small amount of diaquilum.
If, however, a hot abscess does not occur, then it is necessary that you plaster it with sesame flour and powdered frankincense mixed with egg white. Then place soft lint over it, and do not bind the nose with anything at all.
If, however, the bones of the nose are fractured or broken into small pieces, then it is necessary to cut over them, and remove them with instruments appropriate to them. Then sew up the wound, and treat it with that which heals and consolidates it with appropriate plasters or ointments.
If a wound occurs between the nostrils, then it is necessary to treat it with bandages, and administer a lead cannula, until it is healed.
Concerning the restoration of the lower jaw, when it is broken.
When the lower jaw is broken, and its fracture is not accompanied by a wound, then examine if its fracture is only external, and it is not broken in two, and curves inward: then its recognition is easy.
Therefore, if the fracture is on its right side, you should insert the index finger of your left hand into the patient's mouth; similarly, if the fracture is on the left side of the jaw, then insert the index finger of your right hand; and with it push the curvature of the fracture from inside outward with your other hand from the inside of the bone properly, and with it straighten it.
If the jaw fracture is already separated into two parts, then it is necessary to administer an external force from both sides, according to the straightness, until its alignment is possible.
If however, there is already movement or breakage in the teeth, then tie those which you hope will remain with gold, silver, or silk thread. Then place a poultice on the fractured jaw. Then place a doubled cloth over it, and place a large properly made bandage, or a piece of leather sole of equal length to the jaw, over the cloth.
Then tie it above, according to how its bandage is prepared for it and its application fits, until it is not destroyed; and instruct the sick person to use tranquility and quiet, and give him/her soft drinks as food.
If, however, you estimate that something of its form has already been altered in some way, then hasten and loosen it on the third day. Then straighten what has been altered, and plaster it with mill dust, with egg white, or with sesame flour, after you have removed the poultice; and place soft wool over the plaster.
While, therefore, that plaster remains attached to it, and the bone's position is not altered, leave it, so that you do not loosen it, until it is healed; or bind the fracture. For this fracture is often bound for three weeks.
If, meanwhile, a hot abscess occurs, then administer what we have said many times for its reduction, until that abscess is removed.
And if the fracture is with a wound, consider it. For if a fragment has already separated from the bone, or from the surrounding tissue, then be delicate in this, so that you remove those fragments of the surrounding tissue with what is suitable to you in removing them from the instruments.
If truly the opening of the wound is constricted, then widen it with a phlebotom knife according to your necessary amount.
Then, when you have removed that surrounding tissue, and nothing remains of it, suture then the opening of the wound, if it is wide; and if not, place over it from plasters that are suitable for it, and cause it to heal, until it is healed.
Concerning the restoration of the [surgical] fork, when it breaks.
Indeed, the surgical fork breaks most often at the anterior humeral portion, and its fracture occurs according to one of three ways.
For it either breaks and separates into two, apart from what happens to the surrounding tissue: and it is easier to restore it.
Or so, that there are injuries to the bone: and it is more difficult to restore it.
Or so, that there is a fracture with a wound.
And the operation for it when the fracture is without a wound is that you should have two attendants present, so that one of them holds the support which follows the broken fork, and the other extends the neck towards the part.
Then adjust the fracture with your fingers, until its shape is as it should be: and there is neither a prominence nor a concavity in it.
If you need more extension, then it is necessary to place under the patient's armpit a ball made of cloth or wool: and its size should be according to your need: and extend and raise the fork, and compress the ball with your hand, until you make the fracture straight, as it should be.
If you cannot pull the end of the fork outward, because it has gone deep, then it is necessary that the patient lie on their back, and place a pillow of medium size under their shoulder, and let an attendant press the patient's shoulder downward, until the bone of the fork that is deep is lifted upward; and then straighten the fracture, and make it even with your fingers.
If, however, you feel a splinter from the fork, and it moves, then it is necessary to cut above it, and extract the splinter with ease.
If, however, it is held in the bone, then make an incision with one of the incisions you have prepared for it, after you have placed an instrument that holds a sifach under the fork; and this instrument is of wood or iron. And this is its form.
It resembles a spoon that has no concavity.
And let its width be according to what you need of it in terms of the size of the bone, and its smallness. Its length, however, also according to what is possible for you for the operation.
And it should have two ends, as you see: and one end should be wide, and the other narrow.
If however the rupture of the wound that you made when you extracted the splinter of bone is wide, and you are certain of avoiding a hot abscess: then bring together the two edges of the wound with sutures.
And if the rupture is small, or you fear a hot abscess: then fill the wound with cloths and bandages according to the size of the wound's tear.
If a hot abscess should occur, then soak a cloth in rose oil, vinegar, and wine, and place it upon it.
A constriction of the bone, however, when it is without a wound and without incision, is to apply a plaster made from mill flour with egg white to the bone. And place soft lint over it. Then place a sphere under its projection, if you need it. Then take a himematem, that is, a wheel which the Saracens hold, which is very long, and its width is one palm, or approximately that. Then place a doubled pad over the lint and plaster. Then take a sliver from a thin board, whose width is three fingers, and similarly in length. Then wrap it in cloth. Then wrap that cloth with the sliver in the place of the alhimemati that falls over the fracture and the place. Then place the alhimemati over the fracture as it revolves, and wrap it around its neck, and under its healthy and under its infirm titillico: and reduce it over the entire part, and as you see that the constriction holds the fracture with decent constriction: and that is it, which is not hidden from you, and all of it, so that the sliver is not removed from the fractured bone. And for this it is necessary that you observe the ill person every day. Therefore, whenever the ligament softens, and you see the sliver already being removed, then straighten it and tighten the ligament.
Then place the patient's head on his back, and place a small pillow under his head at night, so that with it his support may be raised from his side. Therefore, the fracture of the collarbone is raised by raising the shoulder.
Or tie his arm to his neck; and do not loosen the bandage if it does not happen in a place where it occurs from itching or an abscess, up to twelve days.
Then renew the plaster if you see his face towards it. And add to the constriction, and leave him until it is restored and congealed.
And indeed a fracture of the collarbone is bound and strengthened, in most cases, within twenty-eight days; and sometimes in certain people it occurs within a shorter time.
Concerning the restoration of a fracture of the shoulder blade.
The shoulder blade is rarely fractured, and at a wide place on it; and only its edges are broken from it.
Therefore, when a part of it is fractured, and it is fractured in its middle, and this is not recognized except by touch, then according to the shape of the fracture, attempt its preparation. And restore it to its natural shape by every means of ingenuity that is possible to you.
Then place on the area ground flour with egg white, and soft linen, and place a cushion made of doubled cloth on top. Then place over it a wide splint of thin wood, according to the size of the entire shoulder blade, or a little larger.
If, however, there is a hollow under the splint in any part of the shoulder blade, then fill that hollow with soft linen until the splint rests evenly.
Then bind it tightly with a long bandage, with fitting constriction, and firmness of the splint, until it is not removed from its place.
And consider the bandage every day. Whenever, therefore, the bandage softens, tighten it, and adjust the splint if it is removed from its place: and let the sick person lie on his healthy side.
And the shoulder blade is restored in twenty days, or in twenty-five days.
When, therefore, this number is completed, then loosen the bandage: and be you in safety. For it is from bones whose joining is not feared, nor their separation.
If, however, a fragment of bone protrudes and pierces under the skin, then split it over it and remove it. And do what we said in the fracture of the fork from the subsidence of a hot abscess, if anything happens from it.
On the restoration of a fractured breast.
The breast sometimes breaks in the middle of itself, and that rarely happens. Its extremities, however, are broken and crushed very often due to its accidents.
When its middle breaks, inclining downwards, it is accompanied by intense pain, difficulty in breathing, and coughing; and perhaps vomiting blood, and a hollow in the fractured bone is revealed, and not hidden from sight.  Its restoration is that the sick person be laid supine on their back, and a pillow be placed between their shoulder blades.
Then press on their shoulders, and gather the ribs from both sides with your hands, and make them even, in every way that is possible and suitable, until the shape of the bone returns to as it should be.
Then place a plaster and linen bandage over it, and put a thin wooden slat, or a splint, or something similar in lightness, over that, after you have wrapped it in cloth. Then carefully bind it over the broken bone so that it does not move: and go around the back with the bandage several times, and tighten it properly.
Then check the bandage every hour, and whenever it loosens, tighten it. And if its need prompts its loosening due to itching or corrosion occurring in the area, or pain, or an abscess: then hurry, and untie it, and remove the plaster, and correct what has happened with the method of its treatment.
Then replace the plaster, if you see it fitting, and apply a bandage to it until it is healed.
Concerning the restoration of ribs, when they are broken.
Know that a rib fracture does not occur except in the thick places which follow the back, and from their extremities on the anterior side. And attrition does not happen to them unless because they are cartilaginous. And its knowledge is not hidden from the senses when examined with the fingers.
And its restoration is done thus, that one aligns the fracture with the fingers to the extent possible, until the shape is made equal, as is proper. Then apply plasters, and bind the fractured bone with splints, if it needs it.
And if the rib fracture is sloping inwards, then intense pain and a stabbing sensation occur to the patient, like the stabbing sensation that occurs to one who has pleurisy, because the bone pierces the membrane, and also difficulty in breathing, coughing, and vomiting of much blood occur, and this is a difficult condition to treat.
And the ancients were ingenious in this, with many methods, and among them are those who say that one should give the patient foods which produce inflammation and windiness, so that the abdomen is inflamed and distended, and the fracture is driven outwards.
We, however, abhor this, lest it become a swift cause for producing a hot abscess, if it does not already exist. If however it has already occurred, then add to it.
And some of them said: let a wind-inducing substance be placed upon the affected area, then suction should be applied with force, and this is a similar line of reasoning. However, it is feared that wind-inducing substances will draw superfluous fluids to the area, because of the weakened condition.
And some of them said: the area should be covered with wool that has already been immersed in hot oil; and cushions should be placed between the ribs, until it is filled, so that the bandage is even when you wrap it around the curvature.
Then the sick person should be treated with the treatment for pleurisy, through food and medicine.
If a strong substance, which the patient cannot tolerate, constricts the patient, and the mouth is pierced or injured by a sharp object, and we fear for the patient, then it is necessary to cut over the area and expose the fractured rib. Then we shall place upon it the instrument which preserves the sinews, the description of which preceded: and we shall cut the bone with ease, and cut it.
Then we shall bring together the two edges of the wound, if it is large, with sutures; and we shall treat it with plasters until it heals.
If, meanwhile, a hot abscess occurs, then hasten, and pour powders in rose oil, and place it upon the area; and let the patient be treated with what is suitable for the abscess.
Meanwhile, let him lie on the side on which he sleeps, until he heals.
On the restoration of a fractured spine of the back and neck.
A fracture of the bones of the neck sometimes occurs, and attrition rarely happens to them; and similarly with the vertebrae of the back. Therefore, when this happens to someone, and you wish to know whether it will heal or not, then consider. For if you see his hands already softened, and numb, and dead; and he cannot move them, nor extend them, nor contract them; and when you contract them with your fingers, and prick them with a needle, he does not feel it, and does not feel pain in them: then know that it will not heal, and in most cases is mortal.
If he moves them, and feels the contraction with his fingers and the prick, then know that the neck bone is sound, and that the sick person will be healed with treatment.
If a similar condition affects the vertebrae of the back, and you wish to know whether it will heal or not, then consider his feet.  Then, if you see that they are softened, and that the same condition as in the hands occurs in them; and when he lies on his back, wind and waste discharge involuntarily; and when he lies on his stomach, waste discharges involuntarily; and when he lies on his back, and wants to urinate, and cannot, then know that it is fatal. Therefore, do not labor in his treatment.
If, however, nothing of that happens to him, the condition is less severe.
And the treatment for what occurs from that is to try to relieve the hot abscess: so that you place on the vertebra a crushed rose oil alone, or with the yolks of a roasted egg.
Place that on it several times a day until the hot abscess subsides.  Then place one of the strengthening, drying plasters over the area and bind it with a bandage.  And order the sick person to use rest and quiet. And do not let him sleep on the part where he finds pain until it is healed.
If, however, it happens in the rubbing of the bone, a suppuration, or something that has already separated from it: then it is necessary to incise the skin and remove it. Then bring together the two edges of the wound, if it is large, with sutures. Then treat it with some kind of healing ointment until it is healed.
If, however, the last bone of the tail breaks, and it is the end of the tail: then it is necessary to introduce the thumb of your left hand into the anus, and straighten the broken bone with the other hand, as much as possible, and with a second straightening.
Then place it on top of it, and remove it: and treat the wound with the treatment that preceded, until it is healed.
Concerning the restoration of the hip.
Chapter XI.
The bones of the hips rarely break. If they do break, then their fracture is not, unless it is a shattering at their extremities: and they are split lengthwise, and are bent inwards: and pain and a prickling sensation occur in the injured area, and the leg that breaks is numb.
And its restoration indeed is, that you extend your hand over it, until you stand over the fracture in its way.
If the fracture is only at its extremities, then align that fracture, according to what is prepared for you from the alignment, until it resembles its natural shape.
If however the fracture is lengthwise, or has already bent inwards, then make the sick person lie on their stomach, until its fracture's restoration is prepared for you. When therefore you have aligned it, place a plaster over it; then place over it a splint of wood, or of leather; and bind it tightly, so that you need not fear the fracture's shifting, nor the splint's removal.
And align the concavity of them with that which fills it, until the binding takes it according to equality; and command the sick person to sleep on their back, or on their healthy side.
If however a hot abscess occurs, then cease from extending it, and its restoration, until the hot abscess subsides; and place over it that which settles it, according to what went before, then return to its restoration; and bind it as is appropriate.
If however it occurs in the bone of the shin, or it is shattered, extract it.
On the restoration of the fracture of the Adiutor.
The Adiutor is that which is between the elbow and the head of the Scapula.
If therefore it is broken, then its restoration is according to one of two methods.
One of which is: that you should take a piece of wood of medium thickness, according to this form, which follows.
And two bandages are tied at the two ends.
Then it is suspended from a raised place, and the patient sits upon a seat. Then the patient should place his broken arm over the wood, until it reaches the point of the wood's curvature, which is in the middle.
Then suspend something heavy over it, so that the attendant extends it downwards. Then the physician should bring the fracture together with his hands, until the fracture returns to its proper alignment.
And another method is that the patient lies on their back, and suspend their arm from their neck with a bandage. Then instruct two attendants, that one of them hold that which is above the fracture with their hands, and that the other hold below it, and that each of them extend it to their side.
And if you wish the extension to be stronger, then bind below the fracture with one bandage, and above it with another bandage, and let each of the two attendants extend them to their own sides.
If therefore the fracture is near the extremity of the humerus, then it is necessary to place one bandage under the armpit, and another under the fracture towards the elbow.
And similarly if the fracture is near the elbow, then it is necessary to place a bandage above that place, and above the elbow itself.
Then equalize the fracture with ease without effort, until when the fracture is equalized as it should be, and a good application is applied; then bind it, if a hot abscess does not occur.
If however a hot abscess occurs, then leave the binding until the seventh day. And place over it cut wool soaked in vinegar and rose oil, until when the abscess rests; then bind it; and the way of binding it is, to place a plaster over the fracture.
Then place a wrapping of new cloth over the plaster. Then support the arm on the aid itself, and place his hand open on his shoulder.
And place cloth, and bind the arm over the aid, so that the arm stands in place as stars: if nothing hinders you from it, nor is anything of the broken bone disturbed upon you.
If you fear that anything of the broken bone may be disturbed upon you, then use splints: and it is that you place upon the fracture itself a splint which is broader and stronger than the other splints. And place between each splint the width of a finger: and the length of the splints should be according to the fracture with the addition of three fingers on every side.
Then bind over the splints the binding which I said at the beginning of the chapter.
And it is that your binding should be tighter over the place of the fracture. And the more the fracture is lengthened, the smaller the binding should be.
If therefore you see the positioning of the splints and the binding, as we have said, at the hour in which you restore the limb immediately, then do so; and if you fear a hot abscess, then leave the binding and the splints until the seventh day, as we have said.
Then consider the ligament for all three days, lest itching or swelling occur in the place, or lest food be prevented from reaching the limb, due to the disposition of superfluity of the binding. Therefore rectify it all, according to what we have said.
If however you are confident that nothing will happen from it, then do not loosen the binding unless after three days, or more.
And let the patient's sleep be on his back, and his hands on his stomach; and place under his assistance a mattress full of wool equally.
And consider at every hour of the night or day that the shape of the fractured limb is not loosened or the bandage softened. Therefore, rectify all of that with your skill.
And give the patient food according to the order we have previously described, so that the food should be subtle at first, until the mouth begins to become strong; then it is necessary to increase the thickness of his food.
For it is the custom of the assistance and leg that it should become strong in forty days; then, therefore, it is necessary that it be loosened, and a bath administered, and it be medicated with ointments which rectify it.
If the fracture is foul, bruised: then do not loosen the bandage and splints from it until fifty days, and until two months.
Concerning the restoration of a fractured arm.
The arm is composed of two bones, which are called two forearms.
One of which is small, and it is the one that follows the thumb. And the other is large, and it is the one that is placed below the small one at the lower part.
Perhaps therefore only the larger forearm is broken, or the smaller one, or perhaps they are broken at the same time.
When therefore the smaller forearm is broken above, then its restoration is easy, and its healing is easier.
And when the forearm is broken below, its fracture is bad, and its healing is difficult.
And worse than that is when the two bones are broken at the same time.
If therefore the bone that is broken is the smaller forearm above, then it is appropriate for the physician, in its restoration, to place a small extension with ease, until he equalizes it.
If however the large forearm is that which is broken: then it is necessary that he place a very strong bandage.
And it is necessary that he place the shape of the hand in its restoration, and its extended extension upon a bolster. And let the thumb of the hand be higher than all the fingers; and let the lower joint be lower than all the fingers, or the rest; and let the sick person be seated upright, and let the bolster be before him, or directly in front of him, at a height so that the sick person does not incur labor.
Then let the attendant extend the arm from the lower part, either with his hand or with a bandage. And another attendant extend from above similarly.
Then the physician should align the bone until he restores it to the best shape possible.
If there are splinters in the fractured bone, then try to restore each fragment to its place with your skill.
However, if a separate splinter is visible, and it pierces the skin, and you have no hope of restoring it: then cut over it and remove it according to the method we discussed in the preceding matters.
If however the fracture is with a wound, I have already made a special chapter about that, therefore take its treatment from there.
If, however, a hot abscess occurs at the beginning of your restoration, then line a cloth with a cerate made from rose oil and white wax, and let it be of medium thickness and thinness: and bind the cloth over it with fine binding, until the abscess subsides; then remove the cerate, and apply a plaster prepared from mill dust with egg white. Then place splints, and let the splint placed over the fracture itself be a little wider and stronger.
And know that the number of splints for the arm is six in most arrangements, whether the fracture be in one or two hollows simultaneously.
Then apply your binding to the fracture site more strongly and forcefully, and somewhat more binding above or below the fracture; or apply a binding somewhat softer than its previous binding, according to what was previously mentioned at the beginning of the chapter.
And let the cloths wrapped around the fracture be soft, moist cloths; and let them not be hard, rough. And let the thread with which it is tied be of linen, properly, medium between thin and thick, as we have described.
And consider the limb and the ligament after days. If anything requiring correction should occur, such as itching which afflicts the limb, then it is necessary to bathe the limb with warm water, until that itching ceases, and to release the limb without binding until it rests; then reapply the binding.
If the binding has now softened, and the bone has now been removed, and similar things to these: then rectify all of it with your skill, and consider again.
For if nourishment is prevented from reaching the limb, because of the excessive tightness of the binding, then it is necessary to soften it a little, and to release it for a few days, until nourishment flows to it; then bind it again.
However, if nothing of what we have said happens to the sick person, then it is not necessary to loosen it, unless after twenty days, or thereabouts.
Then let the sick person's hand be suspended from his neck. And let his neck be level, and be guarded by his own skill from violent movements. And have him sleep on his back.
And know that this fracture is restored in thirty days, or in thirty-two days: and perhaps it is restored in twenty-eight days. All that is according to the dispositions of the complexions, and the dispositions of the strength.
Concerning the restoration of fractures of the Hand.
Know that fracture of the hand's pectines and the nodes of the fingers rarely occurs. And it does not occur to it unless by frequent attrition.
Therefore, when a fracture or attrition of the sole occurs, then it is necessary that the infirm person sit square; and in front of him there be a seat according to equality. Then place his hand upon it outstretched.
Then let the attendant extend the broken bones, and let the physician align them until they are joined with a good union.
Then it is necessary that he apply a plaster and lint, if a hot abscess does not occur. Then place a bandage over it according to the size of the area, and you have already wrapped it in linen.
If however the fracture is towards the lower part of the sole of the foot, then make a sphere out of cloth, and instruct the sick person to hold it with his fractured foot upon it, then tie it with a long cloth.
And let the bandage be of leather, in which there is softness, so that the leather is applied to the sole of the foot; and tie it as is necessary.
If however the fracture is outwards, then it is necessary that you place a bandage over it, and another bandage from below on the sole; and let the hand be open and straight. Then apply a constriction, as the hand is revolved; and extend between the fingers with a bandage.
If a fracture happens to any of the joints of the fingers, then if it is the thumb, it should be equalized as necessary. Then it should be bound to the sole; and if you wish, place a small, straight bandage on it so that the fracture is elevated and does not move.
If however the fracture is in the remaining fingers, such as the middle, and index, or ring, and little finger, then it should be equalized and bound to the healthy finger that follows it; or all should be bound according to their continuity; and this is better. Or place a small bandage upon it, as we said in the case of the thumb.
And consider in your restoration, and after the disposition of the hot abscess itself: and apply with it what is necessary, when something from it happens, according to the repetition of its narrative.
Concerning the restoration of a fractured hip.
The hip bone is frequently fractured, and it is evident to the senses, because it is turned towards the interior and posterior part.
And its restoration is done thus, that a ligament is tightened above the fracture, and another ligament below the fracture. And the sick person should lie on their face.
Then the attendant should extend each ligament to its side according to equality; and this, when the fracture is in the middle of the bone.
However, if the fracture is near the root of the hip, then let one ligament be on the side of the crest, so that the extension falls upwards; and another ligament below the fracture.
And similarly, if the fracture is near the knee, then let the ligament be near the knee, so that the extension is downwards.
Then the physician should align the bone with both their hands, until they restore it according to the likeness of its natural shape; and the bone is joined by a good union.
Then it is necessary that you apply a plaster and a bandage, if no abscess occurs in the limb. But if an abscess does occur in it: then leave it for a few days, until the hot abscess subsides, then return to your treatment.
However, its bandage should be like this. It is necessary that you wrap a hard bandage, that is, a sling, over the fracture: and double it twice, or thrice: and let there be excess from it. Then bandage the leg until the heel reaches the root of the buttocks.
And introduce a long thread between the thigh and the leg near the knee to the lower parts, and let the ends of the thread come from the upper part of the two parts. Then wrap around the leg and thigh what remains over from the bandage.
Then place over the thigh, at the site of the fracture itself, splints, and place one splint over the shin bone.
Then fill the spaces between the leg and thigh with soft cloths, so that the constriction is equal.
Then begin with a strong constriction in the middle, over the fractured area, with three or four wrappings. And the farther you move away from the fracture site with the bandage, the smaller, softer, and gentler your constriction should be.
Then pull on the two ends of the thread, which you inserted between the thigh and leg. Tie then with both ends the three splints that are above. Then proceed with the two ends of the thread downwards, until you reach the ankle. And with both ends tighten also the ends of the splints on the other side, so that the bandage does not move from its place.
Then release the tightening over it, while it remains, so that no corrosion, nor abscess, nor swelling, and things similar to them, occur to the limb. If anything of that sort happens. Therefore hurry with its removal, and rectify whatever happened from it entirely, according to what we have said many times.
If truly there is a piece of bone from the bone that pierces, then it is necessary, that you equalize it, if it is possible for you. And if not, split over it, and remove it: and treat it with that which preceded it is recalled, until it is healed.
And sometimes this fracture of the hip is tightened, besides which are added splints, as we said in the aid and arm.
However, in the restoration of it, thus fractured, lameness does not happen to the sick person. And if it is restored alone, besides which the other leg is applied to it, then it is necessary that he whose it is limp always.
And know that the hip is tightened in fifty days, or a little is added, or a little is diminished: all of that is according to the diversity of complexions and other dispositions.
Concerning the restoration of the fractured kneecap.
Know that the kneecap rarely suffers fracture, but it often suffers attrition.
If however a fracture occurs in it, then it is only either a fissure or a hole in its parts. And it is both with a wound and without a wound. And one stands over the whole thing with feeling.
And its restoration is such that the parts of it which are broken are equalized with the fingers until they are brought together and joined as much as is possible by adjustment, ease, and skill.
Then place a plaster of sesame flour, or mill flour, with egg white: and place a round pad on top of it, if you need it: and bind it with a suitable bandage over it.
Then consider all the treatments which we have described for other fractures: such as a hot abscess, and similar things: so that you oppose every accident with what is suitable to it, until it is healed.
Concerning the restoration of a fractured leg.
Know that the leg has two bones, one of which is thick, and is called the Cruris, and the other thin, and is called the Focile.
And the same kinds of fractures occur in both of them as occur in the two bones of the arm: and because of this, its restoration is carried out, just as the restoration of the arm is equally, and the operation is one.
If the two bones are fractured together, the leg turns in all directions.
And if the thinner bone is fractured, the leg turns toward the front.
And if the thicker bone is fractured, you find it lower: and it is among those that are not hidden from you.
Then administer extension, and alignment, and the ligature of splints according to that equally.
However, if the fracture of the leg is a foul fracture, having much bleeding, let the extension be less, and the easing of your treatment gentler.
And in the leg there is something more about the operation than the arm: and it is, that when you have aligned the splints, and completed all your operation, then take two strips of pine wood, such as is used in the construction of the roofs that are placed under the boards; and they are made from palm leaves; and choose those of small thickness, and let them not be small; and let their length be according to the length of the leg, from the knee down.
Then wrap each one in a cloth in two folds along its length. And place one part of the leg on one side, and the other on the other side: and let them be from the knee down to the foot.
Then tie the two strips in three places from the two ends and the middle. For when the constriction is forbidden, the leg declines to the right and left, and stands in good posture.
And now indeed let a cradle of wood be administered according to the length of the leg, and let the leg be placed in it, so that it preserves it from movement.
And very much indeed it is necessary that you do that in a fracture when there is a wound with it properly.
Then consider the leg every day, and strive with that final effort against the abscess, or swelling, or any other remaining ones. If therefore anything from those happens, then oppose it with that which is necessary, until it is healed, if God wills.
Of the fracture of the bones of the Foot and Toes.
Indeed, a fracture of the heel bone does not happen completely.
However, fractures of the bones of the foot sometimes occur, and fractures also rarely occur in the toes; and they do not occur to them except for attrition in many dispositions.
If a fracture of the bones of the foot occurs, and you see those bones raised up above one another, then let the infirm person place their foot on prepared ground, as if walking.
Then stand you, and place your foot on that which is raised from those bones; afterwards press it, or tread on it; and straighten it, until it returns to its place.
Then place a plaster, and linen over it; and place a small board under the sole of the foot, with two flat ends.
Then bind it with a fitting bandage, after you have wrapped it with cloths, and other things it needs.
When therefore three or four days have passed, then loosen the bandage. For you will find the bones straightened, whether they are broken or dislocated. Therefore, the operation on them is as you see.
If, however, some fingers are broken, then restore them and straighten them according to what I have told you concerning the restoration of fingers of the hand. Then place a splint along the length of the finger, and let it be slightly wider than it; then place beneath the foot this board that I have told you about, and bind it with a suitable bandage.
If, however, what is broken of the bones is two, or three, or more, then place a splint of its appropriate size over each finger, wrapped in linen cloth; and bind the board to the lower foot; and let it stand upon one head of the board outside the foot's belly, so that it holds with good retention.
And it befits you, so that you do not forget, to consider all that I have said to you in the rest of the fractures from accidents that we have mentioned; and oppose every accident with what is appropriate.
Concerning the fracture of the woman's vulva, and the rib bone, and the man's penis.
When the woman's vulva is broken, then make her sit square. Then incline her towards the part of her back a little, and let it be held back.
Then let the midwife fill her vulva with wool, until it fills it: and let it become in the vulva like a sphere.
Then let the woman be shaken, and raise her back gradually. For that wool comes out, until it becomes before the door of the vulva like a sphere, and the broken opening returns.
Then place a cushion on her back. Therefore, when she wishes to urinate, remove the wool with ease, then let her urinate: and return it according to the manner in which you first introduced it: then let her return to her first cushion.
Let her do that for seven days, or thereabouts, for the opening itself is restored.
And if you wish, take a sheep's bladder and tie a reed cannula over its opening, and introduce the whole bladder into her vulva. Then blow into the cannula with force, until the bladder inflates within the vulva, for the rupture is thereby restored.
Then let it be filled with wool, and let it stand for several days, according to what we have narrated, until it is healed.
And when the bone of the penis of a man, or a woman, is fractured, then administer in its restoration, and its equalization, that which we have narrated in the case of the coccygeal bone.
And the rectum is not concealed in these nearby fractures, which rarely occur, especially in someone with some skill or experience.
And understand well my book, for the fracture itself signifies to you in many situations the correct way to restore it and to constrict it: understand therefore.
However, when the penis of a man is fractured, take the throat of a goose, and insert the penis into it. Then place over it a bandage of cloth, and let it be wrapped and left for three days, or thereabouts, and it will be healed, if God wills.
Concerning the restoration of fractured bones when there is a wound.
It is fitting for one who has a fracture with a wound, especially if it is large, like a fracture of the hip bone, or of the arm bone, or similar to it, that you hurry and bleed him immediately; if the conditions for bloodletting are as we have previously stated.
If the wound is flowing blood, then it is necessary that you hurry to cauterize it, so that you powder the crushed zegi over it, if you do not have another remedy available.
Then begin restoring the fracture on the same day, and do not postpone it if an abscess has not developed.
If however a hot abscess has developed, then postpone its restoration until the ninth day, until the abscess subsides. And do not approach it on the third and fourth days at all, for you would cause him to suffer harm.
If however the broken bone is protruding above the skin, then it is necessary that you try to reduce it, and align it with your hands with ease and a small extension.
If however its extension and alignment with your hands is not prepared, then reduce it with this instrument. And it is an instrument made of iron, whose length is the amount of seven or eight fingers, and its width is according to the size of the wound. And because of that, it is necessary for the physician to take from them three or four, according to the quantity needed for that treatment in every kind of fracture.
And let it be round, and let it have a small thickness so that it is not doubled upon compression on it during the operation; and let it be sharp at the ends, having a margin on its extremities. And let its upper part be of a thickness from its midpoint down to the lower part.
And this is its shape.
It is necessary in this operation that its sharp curved end be placed on the projecting end of the bone, and to drive it with it in one turn, until when the bone returns and is equalized with some equalization.
Therefore, try to equalize the ends of the fracture with each other.
If its fractured ends are slender, and the instrument does not grasp them well, then it is necessary to saw the end of that bone until the instrument has a hold on it.
If however you cannot reduce them with what we have described at all, then cut it with whatever of the cutting instruments we mentioned is suitable for it, or saw it with one of the saws in any way possible for you.
Then smooth that which remains on the bone from roughness and small splinters.
Therefore, when the bone is reduced, and the infirm person finds intense pain hurting him after its reduction, then know that the bone has not returned to its natural place.
Do therefore that. For you confer great aid to the infirm person when your restoration of the bone is completed.
Then immerse a cloth in astringent, black wine. And properly if it is in summer. And do not place a cauterized piece of cloth, nor anything containing oil, on the wound: so that you do not cause putrefaction and corruption in it.
Then administer the splints at the hour of completion of your restoration of the bone. And leave the wound exposed, so that you cut a hole with scissors in the bandages according to the size of the wound.
And be careful with every precaution not to bind the wound with the fracture. For many times foolish physicians have done this, and have caused their patients either death, or corruption, or zoche, that is, pus. And let your constriction be soft, gentle, different from the constriction of the other fractures.
If the wound is bad, or is a large wound, and you fear some bad accidents that we have mentioned, and find pain in a suspended place, then you should not place splints on it. And make wrappings for them from hard cloths in the place of splints, and bind it with them.
When, however, it is after one day or two days, and you see the wound beginning to generate pus in it, then remove the cloth that you placed upon it with wine. Then administer bandages and ointments with which it is our custom to treat wounds, such as the tetrapharmacon ointment and similar ones.
And it is fitting for you to loosen the bandage. And consider the wound every day morning and evening, until it is consolidated and healed.
And it is necessary that the limb be prepared so that pus runs from it downwards with ease.
If many days pass over the wound, and it does not consolidate, nor is pus separated from it: then know that there are small bones' afflictions there. Therefore it is necessary that you examine the wound with probes. However, remove those of those afflictions that are separated, and extract them. And those of them that are not separated, and pierce the limb, and cause pain to occur, try to cut them out, and remove them by every means possible to you.
If a wound experiences putrefaction, or festering, that is, an ulceration, or some other species of corruption and putrefaction: then it is necessary to apply to each of them with that which suits it from the treatment, of which the description precedes in its chapter.
And in that on which my discourse should stand, and to which you should direct your mind when a bone is fractured and protrudes from the limb, such as the hip bone and the kneecap, and similar large bones, you should not attempt to pull it back, for often death results from that; rather, leave it until it becomes putrid.
For perhaps it will fall out by itself after twenty or thirty days.
Then, therefore, treat the wound if it seems to you; and if not, leave it.
Concerning the treatment of a swelling at the site of a fracture.
This swelling frequently occurs at the site of healing fracture. Especially if it is near the joints: and the shape of the limb is disfigured by it. And perhaps it prevents the limb from its natural function.
Therefore, if the swelling is recent, administer to it medicines that have astringent properties, such as aloe, and frankincense, and myrrh, and sarcocolla, and acacia, and similar things to them.
So, take some of these, or all of them: and mix them with astringent wine, or with egg white, or with vinegar: and place them on the swelling in linen, and bind them tightly over it.
And leave the bandage, and do not loosen it for many days. Then loosen it, and apply another, until the swelling is removed.
Or bind over it a lead plate properly. For lead has the property of removing everything that is feared from the limbs.
However, if the swelling has already turned to stone, and it is tight, and necessity urgently demands its removal: then split over it from above, and cut away the protruding excess; or scrape it with certain scrapers, until it is removed; and treat it until it is healed.
Concerning the treatment when it is restored, and a limb remains after it in a delicate state, not according to its nature.
When a fractured bone is restored, and a limb remains after it delicate, weak: then it is not so unless due to many causes. One of which is, the multitude of loosening of the ligaments and their ligation not according to what is proper; or because of an excess of the tightening of the ligaments, until the nourishment is prevented from flowing to the limb; or because of an excess of embrocation at an inappropriate time; or because of a lack of blood in the body of the sick person and his weakness.
And the treatment of that is, to nourish the sick person and to make his body gentle, until the blood multiplies within him. And administer a bath. And introduce joy and gladness upon him.
Then place pitch upon the limb, so that the pitch attracts much nourishment to it. And assiduously embrocate it with warm water, until the nourishment flows, and it returns to its natural form.
Concerning the treatment of fractured bones when they are restored crookedly.
When, in a limb already restored after its healing, crookedness and prominence of the fractured bone, or a knot, occur; and the form of the limb is marred thereby, yet the limb is not hindered from its natural function; then you should not accept the opinion of one who thinks that the limb should be broken again.
And many foolish physicians and surgeons have already done that in our land.
And this operation is indeed highly reprehensible, leading to death or great fear, so that it may be deadly.
But if the lameness and knotting are recent, then it is necessary to soak it in lukewarm water in which softening herbs have been boiled, such as marshmallow leaves and its root, and melilot, and similar things. And a plaster should be made with a softening plaster, such as a well-made diachylon.
Or take the mucilage of marshmallow root, and mix it with hen's fat or sesame oil, and plaster it with that.
Or take fat figs and grind them with pigeon dung, and similar medicinal substances that are said to lessen consolidation.
And sometimes the knotting is loosened with diligent, long-standing, gentle rubbing, which is done with wet hands. And movement of the limb should be administered to every part at all hours.
If, however, twisting has already occurred, and it has become strong, and turned into stone, and the necessity for its treatment with iron has arisen: then it is necessary that it be cut above it, and the continuity of the bone be loosened, and that which is superfluous from the knotting or bone be cut away with fine incisions; and that ease be administered to it with care and diligence.
Concerning speech on Dislocation.
Dislocation is the departure of any joints from their place. Therefore it is prohibited from its movement, and the shape of the limb is disfigured. And it causes intense pains and severe injuries to the afflicted.
Therefore, when any dislocation occurs, one must hasten to restore it; nor should one delay it at all.
For if delayed, the place becomes suppurated, and perhaps the reduction of the dislocation as well.
Therefore, it should not be moved or extended during the time of its suppuration. Because it often causes spasms and painful injuries.
But when that happens, then one should hasten to perform phlebotomy on the patient. Then let it be left alone until the abscess subsides.
Then the limb should be bathed with warm water and oil. Then it should be reduced gently.
And every limb should be treated in such a way that it returns to its proper place.
I have indeed already arranged the chapters on dislocations, even as preceded by those on fractures, from the upper part of the body down to its lower part.
Concerning the treatment of dislocation of the lower jaw.
The two jaws are rarely dislocated, except rarely.
And the dislocation of both occurs according to one of two methods. For either they are moved from their places by a small displacement, and are softened a little. Or they are dislocated completely, until they are softened to the chest area, until the sick person's saliva flows, and he cannot hold it, nor can he close his mouth, and his tongue is involved with the speech.
However, when its dislocation is small, then it returns in many dispositions by itself with little difficulty.
But if it is a complete, full dislocation, then it is necessary that its reduction be administered quickly, and not delayed at all; and it is that the minister should hold the sick person's head; and the physician should insert the thumb of one of his hands into the root of the dislocated jaw between his mouth, if the dislocation is on one side. Or he should insert two of his thumbs simultaneously, if the dislocation is on two sides. And the remaining fingers of his hands should be outside, with which he should steady it.
And instruct the sick person to clean their jaws and allow them to chew on every side. And the physician should steady the jaw and push the jaw until it returns to its place.
If its reduction is difficult, especially if both jaws are dislocated simultaneously, then apply vaporization with hot water and oil until the reduction of both becomes easy:  nor delay the reduction of both at all, as we have said.
When they return and are steadied, and the sick person's mouth is closed and does not soften, then place pads of cloth, with a cerate made of wax and rose oil, upon them.
Then bind it with ease with soft bandages.
And let the sick person's sleep be on their back, and let their head be supported between two pillows, so that it does not move to the right and left, nor try or be forced to chew anything; rather, let their food be a gentle drink, until when the pains are removed, and the jaw is tied: then let them eat what they wish, and let it be administered with ease.
Let them not labor over the operation of their mouth at eating and drinking and yawning until the jaw is set and healed.
If the reduction of the two jaws becomes difficult, when they are dislocated at any time and do not return to their places, then fevers and persistent sweating often result, and perhaps the sick person's bowels loosen, and perhaps they vomit pure bile.
Therefore, when you see that, then know that it is destruction, and often the one who suffers this dies within ten days.
On the reduction of the dislocation of the collarbone and the extremity of the humerus.
The collarbone indeed does not dislocate from the inner side, because of its connection with the chest. And it sometimes dislocates outward, and that is evident to the senses.
And its restoration is that the sick person lies on their back, and extends their arms. Then grasp the place with a strong squeezing of your palm, for it will return.
Then place a plaster and cushions over it, and bind it.
However, its extremities that follow the elbow and are continuous with it do not dislocate, except rarely. If however it dislocates on any day, then it is necessary that it be reduced and put in place according to what we have said, and as is prepared for you.
Then place a plaster and cushions over it, and a bandage. And command the sick person to adhere to tranquility and rest until healed.
And with this same treatment, the humerus extremity is reduced when it is also separated from its place.
Concerning the reduction of the dislocation of the humerus.
Know that the humerus is not dislocated except in three ways.
One of which is that it is dislocated to the side of the armpit inferiorly. The second is that it is dislocated to the side of the chest. And perhaps it is dislocated to the upper part of the Humerus; and that happens rarely.
And it is not dislocated posteriorly, because of the scapula. And it is not dislocated anteriorly, because of the nerves.
And very often it is dislocated and emerges downwards towards the pubic region, especially in those whose flesh is scant. Because it emerges quickly in them, and enters quickly.
However, in those whose flesh is abundant, it is the opposite; namely, because it emerges with difficulty, and enters with difficulty.
And perhaps in some men, a blow or a fall occurs, and the humerus becomes inflamed with a hot abscess, and it is thought, because of this, that it has already been dislocated.
Therefore, you must test it, until you stand on the certainty of it, and then proceed in its treatment.
And dislocation is recognized when it is turned towards the armpit: and distinguish between a dislocated humerus and a healthy humerus. For you find a clear difference among them, and you find a concavity in the head of the humerus, and below the armpit, when touching, the head of the humerus seems like an egg; and the sick person cannot bring their hand to their ear, nor move it in all ways.
And similarly, if it is dislocated towards the chest, or upwards: then you find a clear touch, and it is not hidden.
And the reduction of this dislocation is easy when it is recent, or the patient is a child.
And its reduction is for the attendant to lift their hand upwards. Then place your thumbs under their armpit, and lift the joint with force upwards to its place; and let the attendant lift their hand and extend it upwards. Then let him place it below, for it will return quickly.
However, if it does not return by what we have said, and there have been many days since the dislocation occurred, then it is necessary for the patient to bathe in warm water, and an embrocation to soften and soothe should be administered, such as if the roots of marshmallow, fenugreek, and melilot are boiled in water, and administered.
Then let the patient lie on their back; and let a sphere and wool be placed under their armpit, which should be of a degree between softness and tightness.
Then let the physician place their heel on the sphere, and lift the head of the humerus with force, and pull the patient's hand downwards.
And if you wish, reduce it in this way: and let a man taller than the patient be present, standing on the side, and let him insert his arm under the patient's armpit, and lift their armpit upwards until the patient hangs suspended in the air. And another attendant should pull the patient's hand downwards towards their abdomen. However, if the patient is light, then it is necessary to suspend something else with him to weigh him down; for the dislocation returns immediately.
And it is also reduced by another method: and it is that a long piece of wood, whose head is round in shape, like the sleeve of a mortar, should be fixed to the ground; which should not be thick, nor thin. Then, after soft cloths are placed on the head of the wood, the patient is placed beneath it, standing along the length of the wood.
Then his hand is to be extended downwards on one side, and his body extended on the other side with strength; for the joint returns to its place quickly.
If his reduction is difficult by all that we have said, then use this treatment: and it is that you should take wood whose length is the size of two arms, and its width the size of four fingers, and its thickness the size of two fingers; to which there should be a round head, so that its entry into the depth of the tendon may be facilitated, according to this form.
Then soft cloths are tied over the round head, so that the wood does not injure the patient.
Then place it under the patient's tendon, so that the hand or arm is extended along the wood downwards; and tie the wood to the support and arm and hand.
Then place the arm on a step of a ladder across its width, and extend the hand downwards, and let the rest of the body hang from the other side. The joint immediately enters.
When, therefore, its entry is completed in whatever way is possible, then it is necessary to place a sphere of equal size made of wool under the tendon. Then place the prepared plaster, made of mill dust with frankincense and egg white, over the entire shoulder, as it revolves from above.
Then bind tightly under the tendon with a suitable bandage; and let the ligament be wrapped around the plaster from above; and bind his hand to his neck, and let it hang, and let his hand not be moved for seven days.
And it is necessary that little food be given to the sick person, until the limb is strengthened; because this is quicker for its healing.
Then, after seven or five days, a larger one should be put on, and exercised with movement. If therefore it is strengthened and does not soften, then it is now healed.
If however the joint is dislocated many times, because of the moisture that happens to it, or because of another cause, then it is necessary that a cautery with three holes be administered to it, according to what has been stated in the chapter on cautery.
If all this is done, and the ligament loosens after seven days, and the joint does not strengthen, and the plaster and constriction are applied to it repeatedly, and it does not strengthen, and it falls, and cannot lift itself upward: then know that its nerves that are to the head of the humerus are already cut, or stretched, or softened: and know that the joint will never be fixed in its place.
The reduction of a dislocation towards the breast and nipple, or to the rear, is done with pressing and stretching with the hands until it returns, and the remaining constriction and treatment are administered to it until it is healed.
If, after healing, heaviness occurs in the limb, and slowness in its movement, then the patient should use the bath many times, until that heaviness is lessened, and it returns to its first natural state.
Concerning the treatment of elbow dislocation.
Know that the elbow joint dislocates with difficulty, and similarly returns with difficulty; and indeed it dislocates to all parts, and especially to the front, or to the back.
And its dislocation is not hidden from you, because it is evident to the eye and to the touch, according to whatever form it is dislocated. And when you join the dislocated elbow with the healthy one, it is clearly evident to you. For the joint is hollowed out, and cannot double the arm, nor touch its shoulder with it.
And it is necessary that you hasten and reduce the dislocation promptly, before a hot abscess occurs in it.
For if a hot abscess occurs in it, its reduction becomes difficult, and perhaps it will not be completely healed, especially when it is toward the back. For it is worse than all the types of dislocation, and causes them more severe pain: and often death descends with it.
And its restoration, when it is one of those that can be reduced, is that his hand should be extended with two hands, and his arm be stretched out, and the physician's hands be above and below the elbow, and he should push the joint with the thumbs of his hands together, or with the root of his palms, until it returns to its place.
Or truly the dislocation is to the front: then it returns in such a way that he doubles his hand with his hand, until he strikes with the root of his palm the elbow that is dislocated.
If the dislocation does not yield to reduction, then administer a vigorous, very strong extension; and it is that two assistants should extend the arm, and two assistants should also hold it so that it is not moved during the extension.
Then the arm is to be turned in every direction after a long doubled cloth, or a broad bandage, is wrapped around his hand.
And when the physician touches the joint with his hand, let him anoint it with oil, so that it may be one of those things that assist in the lubrication of the joint with ease. Then he should drive the joint with a strong impulse until it returns.
And after its reduction, it is necessary to place a plaster upon it, containing astringency and desiccation with egg white; and it should be bound with a suitable bandage. And let the arm be suspended from the patient's neck, and leave it for a few days.
Then it should be released. If therefore the joint is strengthened in its place, then loosen the bandage from it, and leave it.
And if you see the joint not being properly bound, then reapply the plaster and bandage, and leave it for a few days, until it is properly bound. Then release it.
However, if after the reduction of the joint, heaviness occurs to it, and its disposition is in motion: then administer moistening in bathing, and gentle friction, and compression, until it is lined, or place upon the joint the iliac, that is, the fat rump of a ram. Then it should be bandaged, and leave it on it day and night. Then remove it, and immerse it in a bath. When therefore it sweats, then rub the joint with moderate friction. Then repeat upon it the application of aleliati once, and a second time, and a third time with each bath entry, until it is eased.
And if you wish, place upon it cow dung, moist, warmed with butter, and bind it over it.
Do it several times. For it is thus eased, and returns to its condition.
Concerning the treatment of the dislocation of Almahassem.
The joint between the arm and hand, Mahassem, is frequently dislocated.
And the reduction of its dislocation is easy. On the contrary to the other joints. However, it is necessary that speed be used in reducing its dislocation in the hour in which it is dislocated, before the place becomes suppurated: or a hot abscess occurs there.
And the reduction of the dislocation in it is that you place the weakened hand of Mahassem upon a table, and let the attendant extend his hand; and let the physician place his palm upon the eminence of the joint, and push it until it returns.
However, it is necessary to consider if the palm has already receded to the back of the hand; then let the weak person place the back of his hand upon the table at the extension and reduction; and if the dislocation is proceeding to the back of the hand, then let the position of his hand be inwardly upon the table, that is, the inner part of his hand be placed upon the table, so that the hand of the physician falls upon the very eminence of the joint.
If therefore it returns immediately, it is good; and if not, then bind it with a plaster that quiets the abscess, and leave it, and do not repeat it.
For if it does not tolerate it, nor can you accomplish its reduction, after the days have passed, nevertheless the joint remains according to its twist; and it does not harm the weak person anything, except that the hand is softened and cannot grasp anything; then know that the nerves have been severed or bruised.
Therefore there is no skill in it, unless it is bound with a cautery near its location. And perhaps it does not contribute anything.
When therefore the Almahassem does not return, then place upon it the plaster which we have narrated. Then it should be bound and left for five days; afterwards it should be loosened and left, and the hand exercised.
If, however, its movement is deprived, and something serious happens to it: then soothe it with heated water and friction several times, until it is soothed.
Concerning the treatment of the dislocation of the fingers.
When a finger is dislocated from any part, or a finger is dislocated towards the back of the palm, or its belly: then straighten the finger, and push the dislocation with your thumbs until it returns.
Then support the head of the finger, and suspend it towards the part to which it is dislocated, and leave it for two days.
Then suspend it, and straighten it, until it is made straight on that day of its own.
Therefore, when it is night, bind it according to the narration itself: and do not cease to loosen it by day: and exercise it with movement: and bind it at night.
Do that for several days, until it is strengthened.
And similarly do this with it, if it is dislocated to the palm of the hand: and bind it to the part itself, and do your first operation with it, until it is healed.
And similarly do this with it when it is dislocated to the other parts.
Concerning the treatment of the dislocation of the spinal column.
When a dislocation of the spinal column, or of the neck, occurs completely, or when many vertebrae are removed from their places, then there is no cure for it, since death hastens for the infirm.
And a sign of this is that the infirm's excretion comes out involuntarily, nor can he hold it: and many times certain members of his, or his two legs, or his two arms, or one of them, soften, or a vertebra is removed from its place.
For often it is removed, for often their removal occurs in four directions.
Therefore, that which is removed to the back is called a hump.
However, the treatment for it is that you should consider then, if the hump occurs from childhood: then there is no treatment for it, nor is there any healing from it at all.
However, in that which happens from a fall, or blow, or similar things to these, the ancients have already spoken of methods of treatment at length. Of which very little returns with profit.
I, however, have now abbreviated it, of which little excuses the much of its proximity to my intention: and by my exposition I have exposed it, and formed its instrument in a different manner from that in which they showed it and explained it.
I say therefore, that in a hump that occurs on the anterior part, there is no remedy, nor healing from it.
And similarly in that which is made on both sides also.
And it is not cured from them, unless that which occurs on the back properly, with what I narrate: and it is, that the infirm person be stretched out on their face on a level platform near a wall; and moist straw be spread under it, so that his chest is not injured.
Then let a straight piece of wood be fixed in a hole in the ground, at the end of the platform, approximately at his head; and another piece of wood, approximately at his feet, at the other end of the platform; and let an attendant hold the wood, and it not be firmly fixed in the hole. And another attendant hold the other.
Then wrap around the head of the infirm person, and beneath his armpits, a soft, firm bandage: and extend the end of the bandage to the wood which is at his head; and tie it to it.
Then tighten another bandage over his armpits, and over his knees, and at his ankles. Then gather all the bandages, and tie them to the other piece of wood which is at his feet.
Then let every attendant extend the bandage towards the piece of wood, and do not remove the two pieces of wood from their places where they are fixed; however, do not let them be fastened, as we said.
And let the physician place his hands upon the vertebra with strength, until it returns to its place; or let him place a board upon it. Then he ties his feet to the board until it returns.
If however it does not return by this treatment, then take a board whose length is approximately three arms. And hollow out a wall, of which we said is near the sick person, a place into which the end of the board may enter. Then place the middle of the board upon the vertebra. And let the physician place his feet upon the other end. And pull tightly until the vertebra is constricted, and returns to its place.
Then if you wish, operate with the lathe that is wrapped with your hand: and it is, that you fix in the earth, near the head of the sick person, on the back of the footstool, two pieces of wood, whose length is equal to one arm's length: and near his head on the back of the footstool two pieces of wood.
And let the length between each piece of wood be one palm: and now a hole has been made in every place, through which the lathe runs: and let all the wood be firmly fixed in the earth, so that it does not move at all.
And let a round piece of wood be inserted: and the lathe revolves the bandage in the two holes of the two pieces of wood.
And at its end is a hole in which a piece of wood is fixed, whose length is a palm's width along with that which revolves: and in the other two pieces of wood is likewise the same.
Then tighten the bandages that you have tied around the chest of the sick person with the lathe that is near his head; and the bandages that you have tied around his legs with the lathe that is near his feet.
Then let a servant stand near each lathe, who shall turn his hand with the cord with which the lathe revolves: and the physician shall adjust the Spondyle, as we have said.
This is the form of the lathe, which follows.
Then, after the Spondyle has returned and the place is adjusted, you should apply a drying plaster with egg white. Then, linen. Then place a strip of wood on top of the plaster, whose width is three fingers, or thereabouts. And its length should be the amount that covers the place of the hump and over the healthy part of the Spondyle.
Then bind it with the bandage we mentioned. And let the sick person use mild nourishment until they are healed.
If something of a protrusion remains in the place at the end of healing, then it is necessary that medicines that soften and soothe be administered, along with the administration of the board that we described for a long time. And now a lead plate is administered on it.
And sometimes a protrusion occurs in the final part of the spine of the back, and it is thought to be a dislocation, and that is the bone which now protrudes. Therefore, it is not fitting to use this medicine on it: for it might, perhaps, cause death.
Concerning the treatment of a dislocated shoulder.
Know that dislocation of the shoulder joint, and the joint of the humerus, happens only as a complete dislocation; and what happens to the other joints as a result of a small displacement and concavity does not happen to them.
And indeed the shoulder joint is dislocated in four directions. Which is, because it is dislocated forward and backward.
And it is most often dislocated inward; and it is little dislocated forward and backward.
And the treatment for its inward dislocation is as follows: when you join the sick leg with the healthy one, it is longer; and the knee of the sick person is more prominent than the healthy one, and the sick person cannot bend their foot at the groin; and the place following the groin is suppurated with a hot abscess, because the head of the thigh has now reached there.
And the sign of someone who has experienced an outward dislocation is that their symptoms are the opposite of these symptoms.
And the sign of someone who has experienced a forward dislocation is that they extend the healthy leg to its full extent; however, they do not bend it without pain in the knee; and if they try to walk, they cannot move forward on it; and their urine is retained, and their groin is suppurated, and in walking, their heel strikes the ground.
And the sign of someone who has experienced a backward dislocation is that they cannot extend the knee, nor can they bend it before bending the groin; and their leg is also shorter than the other; and the groin is softened, and the head of the thigh is at the location of the ilium.
The reduction of this type of dislocation, however, is to consider if the dislocation is old, already established in the person with it. Then, if you attempt its reduction, and it remains in its position, there is no cure for it at all. Therefore, it is not necessary to attempt a complete presumption for him.
However, in the case of one whose dislocation is recent, and is of one of the four types of dislocation, then hasten to attempt to move the joint, and extend it inwards and outwards, and move it to the right and left; for perhaps it will return, and not require further treatment.
If, however, it does not return in this way, then it is necessary to prepare a strong assistant, and let him extend his leg from below; either with his hands, or with a bandage that is tied above his leg above the knee; and another assistant should extend his hand from above, so that he inserts his hands under his kneecaps. Then, he should tighten with a gentle bandage over the root of the thigh, and hold the other end of the bandage.
And let his extension be either from the anterior part of the groin to the part of the crotch, or from the posterior to the part of the back.
And let the extension of all of them be simultaneous, until the sick person is lifted with his body from the ground, and remains hanging.
And this type of extension is a common type of the four types.
If therefore the dislocation returns with what we have said, it is good; and if not, then it is necessary for every type that I speak of the proper cure.
In the proper reduction of it, when the dislocation is towards the interior, it is necessary that the sick person be laid on his healthy side. Then he shall place a bandage over the root of the hip, in that which is between the head of the hip and the place that is under the groin. Then extend the bandage upwards from the groin towards the higher part of the body, towards the part of the crotch.
Then let another strong attendant take his arms, and lessen the bulky place of the diseased hip, and extend it outward with forceful extension. For now it returns to its place.
And this type is easier than the other types of treatment, by which this limb is reduced.
However, if it escapes from under you, and does not obey you in entering with this type of treatment at all: then it is necessary that two feet of the diseased limb be tied together with a strong, gentle bandage, over the two heels, and over the two knees: and the length of each should be of the measure of four fingers from its partner: and the diseased leg should be extended by two fingers more than the other.
Then let the diseased person be suspended over a wooden beam in the house, and its length from the ground should be the measure of two arms.
Then command a strong youth to secure the head of the hip; and let another youth be suspended with the diseased person; and let another youth, securing the hip with strength, propel it, for the joint returns to its place quickly.
However, in its own return, when the dislocation is to the outside, it is necessary that the sick person lie on a raised platform, according to what we have narrated in the case of the one with a hump. And let a bandage be tightened over his diseased leg, and over his chest.
Then let two wooden beams be placed, one at his feet, and the other at his head. Then let a further wooden beam be placed in the middle of the platform, firmly fixed; upon which let damp cloths be wrapped, so that it does not harm the sick person; and let the beam be between his hips, so that it is not pulled downwards during extension.
Then let each attendant pull on their respective side, and let the physician adjust the reduction with his hand.
If therefore it yields to the return, it will be good.
And if not, place it upon the board itself, and press it, just as we have said in the case of curvature, evenly. However, it is necessary that the sick person lie on their healthy side.
And when the dislocation is towards the front, then it is necessary that the sick person's leg be pulled quickly; and it is according to this same account on the plinth; and let the physician place the palm of his right hand on the sick person's groin. Then grasp it with the other hand, and with that grasp put it extended downwards to the part of the knee.
And if the dislocation is backwards, then it is not necessary that the sick person be extended downwards and raised from the ground; rather, it is necessary that he be placed upon a hard object, as is appropriate, as also happens if his ankle is dislocated outwards, according to what we said about his lying on his two ankles; and it is on his face, and the ligaments extended, according to what we said recently.
And it is necessary that compression be administered with a board also on the place to which the joint emerges, when the reduction is completed as it should be.
And the sign of its return is not hidden from you: and it is that you extend the two legs of the sick person; and when you see them equal, and the sick person tightens his leg, and extends it without excuse, then know that the limb has now returned as it should; then join the two thighs, and put on a plaster, and bind with a bandage, that is, a roller: so that the ankle does not move to any part: and let the sick person adhere to rest for three or four days.
Then loosen the bandage and plaster, and compare the leg with the other; then if you see them equal in condition, then know that the dislocation is now firm; therefore dismiss the sick person to walk.
And if you see any softening, then return, and plaster it, and bind it according to your first binding: and leave it also for three days.
Then loosen it and make him slow in walking on both legs for a few days, until he is well strengthened.
Concerning the dislocation of the knee.
The knee is dislocated in three ways. It is dislocated outwards, inwards, and downwards, that is, backwards.
And it is not dislocated forwards.
And the sign of its dislocation is that you should instruct the sick person to apply his leg to his thigh. If however it does not adhere to the thigh: then know that the knee is dislocated.
And the restoration of all the ways of its dislocation is that you should make the sick person sit upright, so that he may if possible extend his leg over it, and adhere your back to his face: and place his foot between your feet.
Then make his knee adhere to your palms, and place them straight between your fingers over his knee. Then apply with your palm the two sides of his knee with strength. And another attendant should extend his foot until the knee returns to its place.
And the sign of its return is that the leg adheres to the thigh with ease, not with effort.
Then plaster it, and make the leg adhere to the thigh. Then bind them together with a bandage for three or four days. Then unbind them.
And let the sick person not use walking for several days, until he is healed.
If, however, its reduction is refused by you, then administer strong extension with bandages, of which the description preceded in the treatment of a sprain, until it returns.
Concerning the treatment of a dislocated heel.
The heel sometimes is moved by a small displacement, and sometimes is dislocated completely. And its dislocation occurs either inward or outward.
And the sign of its dislocation is that you see the heel swollen, protruding towards the side to which it is dislocated.
The treatment of its displacement is easy to restore: it is to gently extend it with the hands, and straighten it, until it returns to place.
In treating it when it is completely dislocated, it is necessary that you make the patient sit upright, and a strong assistant hold him firmly from the back of his spine, in the middle of it.
Then, hold his foot with your right hand at its upper part, and with your left hand at the lower part of his foot, near the ankle.
Then pull the foot towards you with your right hand. Then with the left hand twice.
Then extend with the left, and push the foot's sole with the right towards the leg without effort.
Do that twice, as we have described.
Then push the sole of the foot towards the leg a third time, and you pull the heel.
If therefore it returns in one or two times according to this method, and you see the foot straightened, it is good; and if not, then repeat the operation upon it, because it returns.
If, however, its reduction is forbidden to you with what we have described, then place the sick person on his back on the ground, and fix a firmly planted stake in the ground, so that it falls between his thighs; and you have now wrapped a cloth around it, so that it does not harm the sick person.
Then let the attendant take his thigh; afterwards let another attendant extend the foot, either with their hands or with a bandage that ties above the ankle. Then let every attendant pull against the pull of their counterpart; and the stake should stand between the sick person's two thighs, restraining him so that his body is not pulled downwards during the extension.
Then the physician should straighten the dislocation with his hands, and another attendant should hold the healthy leg downwards. For the dislocation returns with speed.
Therefore, when the dislocation returns, and its return to health is clear to you, then place a plaster and a bandage, and firmly bind it with bandages, and bind the foot to the leg with a bandage.
And it is necessary that you beware or fear for the nerves that are above the posterior heel, so that the bandage is not too forceful on them and harms them.
Then leave it for two or three days. If the bandage softens, tighten it; then loosen it on the third or fourth day; and prohibit the sick person from walking for forty days. If, however, he attempts to walk before that period, there is no certainty that the dislocation will not loosen again, and be corrupted, and not receive subsequent healing.
If a hot abscess should occur to him, then it is necessary that you administer to it, in its allaying, that which our previous account in another place has described in the treatment, and a fomentation, until it is removed.
Concerning the dislocation of the toes of the foot, and its treatment.
It is necessary that what is dislocated from them be brought into its proper place by a slight extension without any effort; and indeed this is not difficult, rather it is easy.
If however the dislocation is in some of the dorsal knots of the foot, then it is necessary that the sick person place his foot on level ground, or on a board; and he should stand as if walking.
Then you stand, and place your foot upon that which projects from those joints. Then press it with your foot with force until it returns, and you see it now in its proper place, and no protuberance appears in the location.
Then place under the sole of his foot a board that will support the entire foot, having two ends. Then bind it with a suitable bandage for three days. Then loosen it, and have him rest from walking for many days, until it is strengthened and secured from reduction.
Concerning the types of dislocation with wound or fracture.
When something like that happens, and you try to cure it and restore it, death often results.  Therefore, it is not appropriate for anyone to presume to treat such a case unless they are skillful through extensive experience, compassionate, pious, slow, not bold, nor presumptuous. And they should initially use only medications that soothe hot abscesses, and leave the patient to divine judgment. Unless you see, or hope for, salvation from destruction with a gentle lessening of the illness, and in which something of hope appears. Therefore, attempt its reduction immediately at the beginning of the matter, before a hot abscess occurs.
If, therefore, the limb returns as desired, then administer a regimen to soothe the abscess, and treat the wound with whatever appropriate drying ointments are indicated.
If the dislocation is with a fracture, and separated bone fragments occur, then attempt their removal, and do in it what we have said in simple illnesses from what preceded in their locations.
And beware according to your ability, and guard yourself from entering the path of fear, as my previous teaching to you has prescribed.
For that is better for you before your Creator, and more lasting for your glory, and more salutary to your body among those in your time.
