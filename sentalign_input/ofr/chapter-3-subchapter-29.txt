On the dislocation of the fingers of the hand
Sometimes the fingers of the hand are dislocated in any direction, sometimes on the back of the hand or the palm; then stretch the finger, and push the dislocation with your thumbs until it returns to place, then support the tip of the finger, and bend it towards the part where it is disjointed; and leave it for two days, and then straighten it that day; and at night tie it, as we have said, and untie it during the day, and make him move it, and re-tie it at night; and do this often, until it is strong, and do the same if it is dislocated on the palm side of the hand, and do as you did before, until it is healed; and do the same when it is dislocated in another direction.
