of the treatment of hemorrhoids
When hemorrhoids are in the fundament, one or more, and are old and of thick, cold, and moist corrupted humors, and are treated as we mentioned in the divisions, and it does not help, then make cauteries: three on the spine, the one furthest below the shoulder blades little by little in a triangle, and one cautery below the navel, two fingers' width;
and if you think his stomach is cooled, and the food does not digest, and the face is seen to swell, then make a large cautery on the stomach as mentioned before, and another on the liver, and another on the spleen with the clavile cautery; and leave the cautery open for a long time. Afterward treat the area until it is healed.
