After I have finished with you, my Son, this book which is the latest in the science of medicine, together with its completion, I have reached the end of it, having set out in it the exposition of its contents and their declaration. It seemed to me that I should complete it for you with this treatise which is a part of the art of surgery, that is, surgery with the hand.
Since surgery with the hand is a work of great importance in our age and in our time, and since its secrets have been hidden away and are not to be found except in the slight descriptions of the ancient books which have been tampered with by the hands of men: and there has arisen from this both error and hesitation, until its intentions have been closed and its purpose has been extended: I have thought it good to set forth this treatise with reference to the arrangement of this work in its order, and its declarations, and its brevity: and that I may bring together the forms of instruments such as the Cautery and the like, with the rest of the instruments of the art. In this way it will be possible to understand its declarations and to prepare it in the way which is necessary.
The reason why one does not find a good surgeon of this kind in our age is that the art of medicine is a long one, and the author must exercise himself beforehand in the science of anatomy as Galen has said, until he knows the functions of the limbs, their shapes, and their connections, and can distinguish between bones, nerves, and lacerations, and count them, and know their exits, and the pulsation of veins, and the quietness and positions of the exits of these
And for this reason Hippocrates said, that the name is much with the name, and little with the work, especially in the art of the hand.
We have already spoken of this in the beginning of this book.
For he who is ignorant of the things which we have spoken of concerning anatomy, will not be excused; for he will fall into error, and will be the cause of the destruction of men. Just as I have seen many of them who form themselves on this science without knowledge or experience.
Because I have seen many doctors who have followed blindly in the footsteps of their predecessors, neglecting the pulse of a scrophulous swelling in a woman’s neck, and who have thereby injured some arteries in the neck: causing the woman’s blood to flow until she died in their hands.
And I have seen other doctors who have wrongly supposed that they could extract a stone from a bladder that was passing away, and that the stone was large.
So it came to pass that he extracted it with the bladder’s husk
And the man died on the third day.
And I myself was called to extract it: and I saw from the greatness of the stone and the condition of the patient that he would die.
And I have seen another doctor who took a bribe from a certain Duke of our land concerning medicine: and it happened to a black slave who was with him, that he fractured his leg near the ankle: and the doctor, with his ignorance, bound the fracture with nails and string, and did not allow the wound to drain.
Then he dismissed him according to his desires.
Afterwards he sent him away for a few days, and commanded him not to move his ligament: and he stood thus until the swelling of his leg and foot had passed away, and he himself perished
I was called to him again: and I treated him for his ligament: and there was peace and an end to his pains
Truly, corruption has been confirmed in the limb: and I am unable to restrain it.
The corruption has ceased its wandering in the limb, until it passes over
And behold, another physician who has pierced the cancerous swelling: and it has become ulcerated after days, until the malice of the latter has been increased with its lord.
For when the cancer is pure from black bile, then it does not suffice to hold it back with all the iron, except in the limb that will tolerate it, that it be cut off entirely
And therefore, my son, you must know that the operation is divided into two parts: that which is associated with health, and that which carries the peril in many arrangements I am excited in every place of this book in which the operation is mentioned, in which there is fear and terror.
Therefore, you must be cautious of this, and be restrained: that they do not find folly in speaking, and be dishonest
Accept therefore measure with humility and protection, and the sick with facility and firmness, and use the better way that brings glory to God to health and praiseworthy succession: and banish the grievous anxieties that make you fear, that there should be hesitation in your faith and comfort For there remains a greater glory for your faith, and a sublimation in this world, and finally for your souls.
For Galen has said in some of his admonitions. Do not call evil a bad physician: do not blame the physician for the name of the disease.

Part I
Concerning the application and preparation of Cautery: and on what complexion it is suitable, and when: and if with iron or gold
Chapter I
But before we recall any operation which is to be performed, we must say what is the quality of the instruments and materials to be used: and in what complexion they should be shown
I say therefore, that the discourse concerning the quality of the application of Cautery, and its preparation, is a long and subtle science, a secret which has been hidden away.
And many wise men have spoken of this; and they have differed in their opinions: and indeed little is to be learned from their discourses, fearing that they are too long.
I say therefore, that the Cauterium is universal for all compositions, which is with matter and without matter: except for two compositions which are the hot composition without matter and the dry composition without matter.
However, in the hot and dry composition with matter they are dispersed
Some indeed say that the Cauterium is suitable for these (compositions).
Others say the opposite, namely that the Cauterium is not suitable for inflammation, which is from heat and dryness: for the nature of fire is heat: and it is inappropriate to cure an inflammation from heat and dryness with heat and dry matter.
And he who says the opposite says that by the Cauterium an ointment is made in every heat and dry inflammation which occurs in the bodies of men: for when you compare the body of a man and moisten it, with regard to the fire, you find the body of a man chilled.
And I myself have experienced this from experience several times.
However, it does not suffice to believe this, unless one has been proven, has exercised in the last chapter of the Cauterium exercise, and has recognized the diversity of the compositions of men, and the disposition of inflammation in themselves, and the causes of these, and the accidents of these, and the time of these things.
Except for these two compositions there is no fear in the rest: and especially in the cold and humid inflammations. Indeed all the physicians agree on this: and they do not dissent concerning the use of the Cauterium in these things.
Note that the children know that the Cauterium with fire is more beneficial than the Cauterium with burning medicine: for fire is simple, whose action does not extend except to the part which is cauterized: and it does not harm any other connected part with it, except for a slight wound
The action of inflammation extends from the limb and often makes it difficult to heal wounds in the limb, and sometimes causes death.
Fire, however, because of its slightness and the goodness of its substance, does not make this worse, except in excess
I have learned by experience, from the length of my service and from my studies with art, and from experience on things: and from this I am excused for the length of this sermon
And know ye, that even the wisest men differ in their time when it comes to the making of the cautery, and they put a better time upon the lesser wound.
I say indeed that the cautery is always useful: for in every time the document which is to be cauterized is covered with moisture, which is attracted by the cautery.
Especially if the cautery is for severe and urgent pains, which cannot bear delay: for they fear from the fire that there may arise from it a greater mischief than from the small wound itself.
Let no one think that because the physician has used cautery for a disease that it is a return: for this is not always the case. For indeed the cautery alters the complexion and dries up humors which are the causes of the disease itself
However, the cautery surpasses the physician in speed of action, in the excellence of its operation, and in its gentleness: and it is possible that the disease will return at some later time according to the complexion of the patient, the situation of the disease, and the excellence of the physician. And this is prepared in the body by the collection of superfluous matters in the body itself: and it comes to the same thing as if it were taken from the disease itself. Acute pain in a limb with few supernumerary and humid swellings, like a tooth burn, because of pain, and similar to it, is possible that it will not return in that place of pain.
But that is in few cases.
Indeed, the term "cauterium" is the most recent of medicine; it is the correct term: not for that about which they think in this way: because they believe that there is no remedy which can confer the same as medicine, neither with any other after the event of cauterium.
However, the thing is contrary to that: and the intention, that cauterium is the most recent of medicine, is not except when we administer modes of treatment in some disease, and these do not confer that medicine: then we administer in the end cauterium, and it confers: thus it falls out that cauterium is the most recent of medicine, not according to the intention which the vulgar and many doctors understand
The ancients said that cauterium is better with gold than with iron: and they did not say that except because of the equality of gold, and the fineness of its substance: and they said that it does not form pus at the place of cauterium. But it is not absolutely so: for I myself have proved that it does not cause it in some bodies without other things
And cauterium with itself is good, and better than with iron, as they said.
But when you ignite the cauterium with fire from gold, you are not told when you ignite it according to the quantity that you wish, because of the redness of the gold: and when it approaches the cold, and if you add to it the fire above, it liquefies in the fire, and turns into leaves.
Why does the artificer depart from that to engage in this occupation? And thus Cauterium is made with iron among us more rapid and proximate to the operation, from its straightness towards the operation.
I have also arranged this Chapter on Cauterium, according to the chapters: and I have arranged these from head to foot: so that they may satisfy anyone who wishes to learn from this. How to cauterize the head in the coronal suture.
Chapter II.
Here the cauterization is performed in accordance with the lord of humidity and cold over the brain: which are the causes of swelling, and of the flow of humors from the head to the eyes and ears, and of the swelling of the brain, and of toothache, and throat pain: and in general of every ailment which arises from cold, such as paralysis, swelling, epilepsy, and apoplexy, and things like these.
The method of cauterization is as follows: immediately before the operation, give the patient a solution of vinegar and salt to drink for three or four nights, according to the severity of the patient's condition, and his age, and his habit.
Then order him to raise his head with a new nail.
Then make him sit between your hands square, so that you can place your hands over his head
Then place the root of your thumb over the root of his nose between his eyes Wherever your middle finger reaches, that is the place where the cautery should be done with the flame. Then ignite the Cauterium with Olive Oil: thus it is formed into this shape Then place it over the marked spot with a burn, descending gradually, until your hand is clasped.
Then grasp your hand quickly and touch the spot.
If you see that the bone is fractured by the quantity of head of the tibia or the quantity of hemlock, then grasp your hand again.
And if not, repeat your grasp with the iron itself, or with something else that is cold: until the bone is seen to move, as I have told you
Then take some salt and dissolve it in water, and drink it in this way, and apply it over the spot: and keep it for three days.
Then apply over it a butter-soaked cloth, and keep it over the spot until the eschar is consumed by fire. Then care for it with unguents containing four herbs, until it is healed
It has been said that the greater the wound remains open, the more pus is emitted: which is better and more useful
Some people say that the skin should be cauterized until the bone is reached: and hold the cautery until something of the thickness of bone is burned.
Then remove what has been cauterized from the bone, and then care for it
Others say that it is necessary to continue cauterizing until the impression of a mark or tool like that which women use to burn initials is impressed in the bone: and that this should be done until steam escapes from this place, and the wound is closed for a long time.
Care for it until it is consolidated
However, in some individuals they do not issue from two species of Cauterii except in those where fear is great.
It is better for me that you depart in peace than with fear of me
The head suffers from the weakening of continuity of its natural substance: as we have seen in the rest of the limbs: and especially when the head is weak from its natural constitution: the first kind of Cauterii is more safe and better for me, and is more useful. It is therefore to be used with it for the sake of health.
Concerning the cautery of the head in the case of general head-ache
(The text continues with the next section of the translation.)
When in the whole head there occurs a chronic pain that lasts a long time, and that is accompanied by fever, and vomiting, and head-pounding, and oil, and similar things are used for its treatment.
And especially if it has been cauterized with one Cauterium, as we have mentioned, and nothing else is added to it: then consider it to be sufficient
For if the head is strong in its natural constitution and is not weak, and if there is intense cold: then cauterize with another Cauterium under the first one a little
Then cauterize the whole circumference of the head with the Cauterium, but do not pass through the skin, and uncover the quantity of bone as we have said.
And cauterize once in the occiput of the head in the place which is called the uas: and this is the place where the marrow is placed: elevate the head above this, and do not uncover the bone
For in this way the patient finds relief from the intense headache, and from the various pains of the other Cauteria of the head in general
And I say concerning this Cauterium that it must be placed in its proper location: and it is necessary that the Cauterium should burn the horns of the head and the back of the head more subtly than the middle of the head.
This is its form.</start_of_turn>

When there is pain and swelling in a part of the head, and the pain extends up to the eye, and is evacuated with medicinal poultices of the head, and the rest of the treatment is administered, as I have said in the treatises on diseases, and it is not sufficient: then cautery is required in this case, according to two methods: either with acute burning medicine or with iron.</start_of_turn But as for cautery with acute burning medicine, it is that you take a tooth of another and burn it, and excoriate it, and cut off its extremities from both sides.</start_of_turn
Then divide the place of the pain in time with a wide vein-cutting, until there is a bubble under the skin, where the tooth is caught.</start_of_turn
Introduce it there under the skin until it is hidden: then string over it with a thread of constriction that is somewhat thick, and leave it for fifteen hours. Then remove the thread, and draw out the foreign body in two or three days. Then place over it a soft cushion soaked in butter, until the place has healed. Then care for it with an unguent until it is healed.</start_of_turn

The cauterization of the bowels with iron is in this manner.
The iron cautery, which is of this shape
And it is called Clavus: for its head is of the shape of a key, in which there is some curvature, and in the middle there is a small prominence.
Then place it upon the place and hold your hand: and move the iron gradually with a velocity: and let the amount which is to be cauterized from the thickness of the skin be as much as half of it
And lift your hand, so that it does not cauterize the artery which is below, and to avoid the flow of blood
Then soak the wound in salt water, and place it upon the place, and leave it for three days: then place the wound with butter: afterwards care with unguent until it is healed And if necessary, cauterize this half of the haemorrhoid with the second extremity of the cautery.
And burn from the incision of the artery in this half of the haemorrhoid, not from the old one directly.
Thus cauterizing in the old haemorrhoid.
End of book V
When you have cured the haemorrhoid, with what we have said before concerning the treatment of diseases, and when the cure has not taken place: and if you perceive from the disease that it is not sufficient for it what we said of the initial cauterization with medicine, or of the cauterization with fire, then you must take the cautery with the knife, until the mark of pain appears on the place, which is as long as half of a finger, or as much as that: and then take your hand away gently, and tighten the area until you have cut the artery, and hold it until the bone is reached. It is necessary to tighten the jaw, lest the continuation of the mandible should move during mastication, and cause the edge to become dull, or the nerve which moves it, from which the spasm arises.
Take great care to prevent any bleeding from the artery which has been severed
For in the cutting there is fear, and especially for him who is ignorant of what he is doing, and who is not skilled, and does not take sufficient care: and he abandons the operation immediately.
And I shall come with a reminder of the regimen of the flow of blood which has happened from the artery according to its custom, and in its place in this book
If you are of the opinion that the cautery is not sufficient for the case, and that the body of the sick man can tolerate it in the middle of the head, as we have narrated, take care of the wound, until it is healed
And if you wish, apply the cautery, which we mentioned in the chapter on the extraction of the artery with a cautery that has two blades
For the cautery is better made with two blades than with one. Of the method of cauterizing in the pain of the ears.
Chapter VI When there is pain in the ear from cold, and it is treated with salves, and the rest of the treatment which we mentioned in the explanation, and the pain does not subside, then apply the cautery: and that is what is called the Punctum, which is shaped like this.
Then make the puncture around the whole ear, or around both, if the pain is in both.
And prolong thee with the Cauterium from the root of the ear downwards, after you have marked the place with the Cautery: and let the quantity of the Cautery be ten points in every aure, and as much as that.
And then care for the place until it is healed
So as to cauterize in the Torture
Chapter VII
Torture which is cured by cautery is nothing else except for those kinds which arise from phlegmas, as we said in the discussions about the causes of diseases. And you must cauterize the kind which arises from exiccation and spasm of the nerve
When you cure this kind of torture with hyeris, caputpurgiis, and gargarisms, and the cure does not suffice, then it is necessary to cauterize the patient with three Cauteries: one at the root of the ear, and the second a little lower from the temporal region, and the third at the junction of the two lips
And place your Cautery opposite the lower part of the infirm.
For the softening does not take place except in the part which appears healthy
And the form of cautery is that you cauterize the Cautery itself in a direct line from the extremity of the upper ear under the earlobe a little: and the other in the temporal region: whose length should be according to the length of the thumb
And put your hand with the Cautery until the quantity of half the thickness of the skin is consumed by the flame.
And this is the form of the Cautery, and it is like a knife, whose form is like that: truly it is not finer than that of urine: and it is necessary that the knife be of such a size as to be somewhat thick Then care for the place, until it has healed.
Until it has healed.
Chapter VIII.</start_of_turn>
When the old apoplexy has subsided, and you have cared for it as we have said, and the medicine does not suffice, and the patient does not have a fever, then cauterize him four times over every horn of his head, and cauterize in the middle of the head, as we have said, and cauterize at the back of the head, as it is proper. And the manner of cauterization should be as we have said.</start_of_turn>

If not: then make for him three cauteries on the back of his head, which are descending from the upper part of the head down to the lower part of the eye: and put between every cautery the width of a finger.</start_of_turn

In Paralysis, and in softening.
Chapter X
It is necessary to proceed in the softening of the head with hyssop, and with that which we have mentioned before.
Then take the head of the patient: afterwards make the Cauterium in the middle of the head, and the Cauterium over every horn of the head, and the Cauterium over the back of the head, and three over the joints of the neck.
If however it does not agree in bodily mollification by these several means, and the patient is able to tolerate it, and the ailment is strong: then make for him four Cauteriums over the joints of the back, and the last one with the Cauterium, until it is consumed from its surface most of all, and raise your hand.
Then care for itself, until it is healed: and let the Cauterium be applied like oil
In Epilepsy
Chapter XI
The epileptic patient is not Cauterized, except for one whose epilepsy is from phlegm It is necessary therefore to soften the brain of him in the first place with hyssop, and with the rest of the cure which we have mentioned before: when the patient is great, or is tolerant in receiving medical treatment
If, however, the boy does not tolerate medicines, then gargling and nourishing bites of food are administered to him for many days before the restoration of his nourishment.
Then the head is bound, afterwards it is cauterized with one cautery in the middle of the head, as it has been said before in this manner: and with another cautery on the nape of the neck, and over all the horns of his head is cauterized
If he is a strong man, and is tolerant, then cauterize with cauteries what I have said in a paralytic, and soften the body over the bones of the neck and the bones of the back: and let the cautery be olive oil according to the manner which has been said before. If he is a weak boy, then place the cautery delicately, according to this manner.
(The provided text does not contain any information regarding the method of cauterization in Melancholia, so I am unable to translate this portion.)
(The provided text does not include any additional sections or chapters, so I am unable to translate anything further.)
When the cause of melancholy is corrupted humors and thick phlegm, then cauterize with the cautery which we mentioned in a paralytic state.
And if the cause of melancholy is excess of bodily humors tending towards melancholy, and the body of the patient is soft, then give him to drink something which will nourish his brain, according to what has been said before in the discourse: then bind the head of the patient, and make after a while a circle from linen, like a circle.
Then place it in the middle of the head: and the patient sitting square is to be held from all sides
Then apply liniment. It is more worthy to be taken from an old butt than from a new wound.
Warm it over a moderate fire, as the finger can tolerate it when it goes in.
Then evacuate it in the middle of its head in a circle, and let it go until it is cold to the touch
Do this every week to the patient, along with the rest of his treatment, until he is healed
Or if you wish, cauterize it by making many small punctures, because by this means you will keep the hand firm with the cautery: even if it smells badly
For this kind of cautery is moist and has the quality of nourishing the brain with moisture
Then put over it a cushion soaked in butter, or fat from a hen.
In descending water, cauterize the eye.
Chapter XIII.
When the water in the eye is declared by the signs which I mentioned in the preceding discourse, then begin to bathe the patient, with the hand which will move his head
And keep it away from all moisture, and make him sit in a bath for a few days.
Then command him to raise his head, and cauterize it in the middle of his head Then cauterize it over two tempora with two cautery instruments, if there is an incipient descent of the water in both eyes simultaneously: or from one side only, if there is an incipient descent of the water in only one eye: and cut through all the veins and arteries which are under the skin: and let the cautery be long in the width of the tempora: and burn from the flow of blood.
If anything is seen to be issuing from it, then immediately sever it with whatever medicine is available: and I shall come with wisdom in the extraction of arteries, and the severance of them, and the precautions against the flow of blood.

How to cauterize in the softening of the Palpebrae
Chapter XVI
When the Palpebra of the eye is softened by dryness or humidity: then cauterize the Palpebra with a single cautery, like the lunar cautery.
And if you wish, cauterize it above two upper lashes by means of two cauteries in every part: and extend for two times: and let the length of every cautery be according to the length of the lashes: and do not touch your hand with the cautery, but according to the quantity which is to be cured of the third of the Palpebrae.
This is the form of the cautery according to this method of the lunar cautery
How to cauterize the Palpebra when the hairs are set on fire in the eye Chapter XVII
There are two methods of cautery: either with fire or with a burning medicine.
But in the cautery with fire, command the patient to expel his hair before that, if there are those which fall out, until they be prolonged and equal If however they are burnt at the root: then hold the eyes closed with a bandage, so that they do not move, until they are healed
When they are healed and equal, then place the head of the patient in your hand: then sign over the Palpebra of the eye with ink, in the shape of the leaf of the Myrtle: and let the beginning of the sign be near the hairs
Then place the soaked cushion in albumin or: over the hair on the eye.
Then apply the cautery, which is shaped thus
Then burn over the figure which you have marked gradually in many places, until the surface of the skin is consumed, which is like the figure of a myrtle leaf, throughout its appearance
And the sign of the completion of your work is: if you press the eyelid of the eye with your finger, and pluck the hair at the point of the eye
Then lift your hand up: and let go of it in three days.
Then place upon it a cushion with butter, until the pus is eradicated
Then care for it with unguent until it is healed
If any hair remains after an hour, and you soften the eyelid: then burn the cautery once more over the same place as before
If however the hair is in the lower part: then burn the lower part only, until it rises to its natural place: and make sure that the hair does not prick the eye
In the same way as with the burning cautery with medicinal herbs in the same case.
Chapter XVIII
It is like the main rule for the sick person, that he should pluck the hair, until it becomes long and even
Make from parchment in the shape of a myrtle leaf
Then take from soap that has been pounded, and from dry mustard one pound or almost that: then mix these together with some lukewarm water, and make it into a thick paste, so that it does not freeze
Then take from the middle of it a piece like the shape of a myrtle leaf, and place it upon the lid of one or both eyes.
And place under the eye a piece soaked in albumin: and the head of the patient should be in your lap.</start_of_turn>
And place your finger on the sign of the physician, and press it gently.</start_of_turn>
And you shall move it whenever the patient feels the bite of the medicine: because its bite is like fire.</start_of_turn
While you are doing this, you will have perceived its bite; then remove the medicine and move it with your finger.</start_of_turn
When the bite has ceased, then remove the medicine and wipe the eye with water.</start_of_turn
And consider then, if the lid is raised by the elevation with the contraction like that which happens with fire, or with an incision, it is well done: and if not, then repeat the medicine upon the place where it did not stick, without denigrating it, until the operation is complete and the eyes are closed.</start_of_turn>
Then place upon it a piece of butter, until the wound of the skin is eradicated.</start_of_turn
Then care for it with ointment of diaphanicon, or something else, until it is healed.</start_of_turn>
And it is necessary for you at the operation, that you should keep watch until the last moment, that nothing of the medicine should fall into the eye.</start_of_turn
For if the eyelid becomes soft after a day, and there is something of the hair which has fallen out in the eye, then repeat the medicine upon the place where the eye is softened in its own way, as you did at the beginning.</start_of_turn
Then care for yourself until you are healed.
This is the form of the myrtle leaf.

Then put the soaked sponge in the white of the eye, or in the mucus of the eyelashes over his eye: then apply the Cautery, which is of this shape
Let it be concave, like the shape of a pentagon twig at its joint, as the Cautery is: and if you see that it is penetrating to the other extremity, or if you see that it is going upwards like this: do so too
But it is better to make it concave for your work
Then put upon it again the Cautery, which is alight with a flame.
Hold your hand close to the Cauterium from the eye to the part of the nose, so that your hand does not move, or disturb the patient: and place the Cauterium on the fat of the eye and consume it.
If you linger at the beginning of the Cauterium until the bone, it will be good
If not: then repeat the Cauterium once, or twice, if you are unable to digest it: and let it go in three days.
Then place the bandage with butter, and care for it with an exicator until it heals. If after forty days it does not heal: then place above it an acute corrosive medicine, until the bone is broken: and do it according to what is written in its chapter
There is another method of Cauterizing fistulas, which some of the first men have said
Intend to the place of the fistula, and find it: then place under the small opening of the fistula a thin sliver of sliver of camphor, which is shaped like this.
And mix with it the quantity of a drachma of liquid lead, and hold your hand with the cane firmly in place, and do not move the patient at all, so that it does not run or cause the liquid lead to reach the eye
And it is necessary to place above the eye of the patient a bandage soaked in albumin or in water.
Lead burns the place of the fistula, and heals it with a miraculous healing.
When the fistula is healed, as we have said from the Cauterium and the care, it is good
If not, it is necessary to make a hole in the nose, and reduce the fistula to the course of the nose, according to what is written in its proper place.
On the method of cauterization in fissures of the Labiorum.
On the method of cauterization in fissures of the Labiorum.
Many are the acids that occur in the Labium's fissures, which are called Pili, and especially in the lips of children.
When you have cured the fissures, when you do what we said in the instruction of diseases, and it does not suffice for the cure, then you must make a small burn with the cautery, in this form
And let its depth be according to the sharpness of the knife
Then care for it with the cautery until it heals
On the method of cauterization in the fistula of the Oris
On the method of cauterization in the fistula of the Oris
When swelling appears in the root of the gingiva, or in the palate, or in the roots of the teeth: then pus forms, and it bursts: afterwards it heals, pus runs, and a fistula forms: then you must cure the fistula itself, and not in its cure, then it is necessary to make an incision with the cautery according to the quantity that is in the fistula
Then insert the flame into the cavity of the fistula, and hold your hand, until the iron of the flame reaches the depth of its bottom, and its end: do this once, or twice at most
Then care for it afterwards, as we said in the curing until it heals
If therefore it breaks and heals, it is good.
And if not, it is necessary to remove the place and lift out the corrupt bone according to what comes into his head.
In the treatment of gums and teeth, cauterization and softening are useful procedures.
Chapter XXII.
When the gums are softened by moisture, the teeth are mobile, and care is taken with the physicians, and it does not happen: then put the patient's head in your lap
Then make cauterization, whose shape will come afterwards, so that you put the canula over the tooth: and introduce the burning cauterization into it quickly: and keep your hand away, until the patient feels the heat of the fire has reached the root of the tooth
And lift your hand away: then repeat the cauterization a few times, according to what you wish.
Then let the patient rinse his mouth with salt water, and keep it for one hour: and then expel it.
The tooth will henceforth be firm, and the gums will be softened and stretched, and the moisture will be dried up
Chapter XXIII.
When toothache arises from cold, or if cold exists in the tooth itself, or worms, and no relief comes from physicians: then Cauterium is applied in two ways: either with butter or with fire.
Cauterium is applied with butter, thus take butter, mix it with wax, and apply it to the cavity or to the root of the tooth
Then take charcoal and cover the end of the tooth with it.</start_of_turn>
Then put it in boiling butter: and put it on the aching tooth until it gets cold: then repeat it several times until the fire has reached the root of the tooth.</start_of_turn>
Or if you wish, soak wool or charcoal in cold butter and put it on the aching tooth: and put on top of it a burning iron until the fire has reached the depth of the cavity of the tooth.</start_of_turn>
The latter method is with fire, as for the cannula of air or of iron.</start_of_turn> And let there be something of size in the body of it, so that the fire does not reach the bone of the patient.</start_of_turn>
Then take the Cauterium, which has the desired shape: and put it on the tooth: and hold your hand until the Cauterium cools down.</start_of_turn
Do this several times, for the pain will vanish either on the same day or the next day.</start_of_turn
And let there be an imprint of the Cauterium in the impression, so that the patient may put butter on his own bone and keep it for an hour: then expel it.</start_of_turn>
This is the form of the Cauterium.
And this is the shape of the Cauterium.
So cauterize with whatever extremity you wish, according to what is possible: and this is the shape of the Cannula.
Chapter 24.
When the Strata are affected by phlegm, and by cold humours, and do not obey digestion by medicines, and you wish to speed up their digestion: then ignite the Cauterium which is concave, and whose form is like this
Having two open extremities, so that the smoke of the Cauterium may escape from the other extremity: and place the burning instrument upon the boil once, and a second time if you fail to digest the first, until it reaches the depth of the boil
If the boil is small: then place the Cauterium according to the quantity of the boil
Then withdraw it for three days, and place above it a soaked bandage in butter, until the burnt part has healed
Then care for it with unguents until the shape of the Cannula is restored
¶ So cauterize in raucedine of voice, and constriction of the chest.
Chapter 25
When moisture accumulates on the channel of the lungs, and especially when it is accompanied by the coldness of the complexion, then it is necessary to evacuate the patient immediately with the help of medicinal solutions
Then cauterize at the neck in the pit below the root of the gullet: and take care not to bring the Cauterium too close to the gullet or to the skin, except for some reason
Then burn it with another cautery at the junction of the neck towards the end of the last rib: and let the cautery be closed in the manner that preceded it.
Then burn it with another burn until it is healed.
In the case of wounds of the lung or the chest, burn from the inside outwards.
Chapter XXVI.</start_of_turn>
When the cough and the chest-ache of the lung are from cold humours, and the patient has neither fever nor phthisis, nor old disease: then burn it with two burnings above the rib in the hollow places, in the leni, in the uacu.</start_of_turn>
And burn another one in the middle of the chest between the two nipples: and let the burn be closed in the manner that preceded it.</start_of_turn
And if you wish to make a puncture with the burn, which is called Punctum, whose shape preceded the puncture of the pain of the ear: and let the punctures be from thirty punctures up to almost to the others.</start_of_turn>
Then burn it with another burn until it is healed.</start_of_turn> And thus is the burn having three branches: in this shape.</start_of_turn
Therefore the burn must be made with three burns when you do it with oil.</start_of_turn
In the case of a dislocation of the humerus or the titillum, burn from the outside inwards.</start_of_turn
Chapter XXVII.</start_of_turn
When the head of the ulna is dislocated by the cause of humours, and does not return to its place in the hour following its dislocation, until it has become accustomed to its return: then it must be reduced by a small movement, as we have often testified concerning this, and then it is necessary to reduce the dislocation from the first place.</start_of_turn
Then the sickly person lies upon his back, or upon the side of the healthy one.
Then raise the skin which is inside Tilliculus towards the upper parts with your left hand: and if the dislocation has gone inwards.</start_of_turn>
Then take Cauterium having two hairs. Whose form is this.</start_of_turn
Then burn the skin until it goes through to the other side, and the figure of the cauterization will be like four cauterizations.</start_of_turn
And when the cauterization is made with a cauterium having three hairs, because of which the figure of the cauterization is then made of six cauterizations: and these are the hairs according to their slenderness.</start_of_turn
And this is the form of the cauterium having three hairs.</start_of_turn>
And when one is added over this way one more, because there are eight cauterizations.</start_of_turn
Then place upon the cauterization soaked porros with salt.</start_of_turn
Then make the sickly person adhere to tranquility, so that he does not move the limb for some time, until he is comfortable.</start_of_turn
And if the dislocation is towards the upper parts, and this is rare, then burn it above the humerus with the claw cauterium, or with many punctures.</start_of_turn
For the dislocation will be firm, and the moisture will be absorbed: and the sickly person will be healed.</start_of_turn
In this way the Stomach is cauterized.</start_of_turn
Chapter XXVIII.</start_of_turn
When cold and moisture abound in the stomach, until they are extracted from its composition, and the humors are multiplied to it, and attentive methods of treatment are not conferred: then it is necessary that the patient rest upon his back, extend his limbs, and place his hands.
Then cauterize with three cautery instruments, a cautery under the pectoralis cartilage equal to the length of a single finger with a cautery of the nail, and two lower cauteries from two lateral sides of one cautery, until the triangle of the cauteries appears.
And lengthen between each [cautery] so that they do not join, when pus is formed. And the depth of the cautery is equal to two-thirds of the thickness of the skin
And the shape of the cauteries is as follows: without addition: and if you wish to cauterize a large cautery in the middle of the stomach according to this shape: let the cautery be as much as this single cautery according to the figure of the circle according to this shape
The stomach is cauterized by pricking that which returns from this cautery: and it is that the signs above the stomach prick according to quantity, as much as you wish with the incisions: then cauterize it with the puncture cautery: then care for it with the care which preceded until it is healed.
In this manner cauterize the spleen when cold.
Chapter XXIX.
When cold or large winds exist in the spleen, until it naturally evacuates from its composition and superfluous humors are expelled: then it is necessary that the patient rest upon his chest, and signs with three cauteries according to this shape and this quantity should be placed below the hypocondria, where the elbow of a man rests: and let the space between every two cauteries be equal to the length of a finger. And let the cautery be equal to the length of the rectum of a man: and do not press your hand with the cautery much.
And let the quantity of that which is to be drawn out from the roughness of the skin be equal to the middle quantity of it, neither more nor less: and let the patient be lying on his feet.
If he is not standing, then let him be lying down, with his limbs extended and his arms uplifted This is the form of cauterization.
And it is also possible to cauterize these carbuncles with a cautery knife, when there is skill and prudence in the art.
Beware lest you proceed too far with the cautery, and that you cause the roughness of the whole skin to endure, whereby the whole body is scorched and the intestines are damaged: for the skin there is soft, as you know well
Concerning the cautery of the after-effects of the liver.
Chapter 30.
When the discharge comes out, and you wish to write, if the after-effect is in the liver itself, or in its membrane: if it is in the liver itself, there is dull pain and greatness without acute pain: and if it is in the membrane of the liver, with acute pain which is a heavy burden: and you must know that this fatigues the physicians who are caring for him
It is therefore necessary that the patient lies on his back on his bed of rest.
Then the position of the after-effect with the cautery: then you burn with the cautery that absorbs the heat.
And this is its form
And cauterize with one cautery until the whole skin is burnt through and the intestines are exposed, until the whole discharge has gone out: then care for the discharge itself until the patient is healed.
Neither is it proper that every kind of cautery should be used, except for one whose study in the art of medicine has been prolonged: and by whose hand these diseases have already been encountered with experience. Then indeed may one dare to attempt such an operation.
It is better for you to depart from me than to linger.
Regarding cautery in Pleurisy.
Chapter 1
The ancients say that cautery, when applied with the roots of Aristolochia to a cold Pleurisy, should be done in this manner
And it is to be taken that from the dried roots of Aristolochia, one should take a long root, which comes from it, and let it be as thick as a digit
Then submerge the cautery in oil: and kindle it in the fire
Then cauterize the cautery once with the thumb between the continuation of the collarbone and the chin, and with two small cauteries under guidance slightly depressed at the part under the beard
And with two cauteries also in that which is between the fifth and sixth ribs depressed downwards to the back part: and with another cautery in the middle of the chest, and another above the stomach
And three cauteries from behind: one in that which is between the two scapulae: and two cauteries from the two sides of the chest, the lower cautery which is between the two scapulae
And it is not proper that you should press your hand with the cautery, but rather let it rest openly on the skin smelling faintly And some ancient writers say that there are those among men who use a cautery like iron: they ignite it, and putting it inside them between the ribs, they hold it there until it is consumed with it at the end: and it comes out whole, and the patient is healed: as we said concerning the Apoplexy of the Liver
But in this perforation with the cautery is from fear, for either the infirm dies immediately, or it happens that in the place of the fistula there is no healing.
Regarding the cautery of the spleen and head of the pancreas thus.
When you treat the ailment of the spleen, when what we said about the treatment of the ailments does not confer healing, then the cautery is in these three ways, all of which are right
One of them is that you make three cauteries or four in line following the length of the spleen according to the shape of the cautery of the Liver, which precedes in figure
And be between every cautery the amount of the breadth of a finger, or less.
And be the manner of cautery which we said concerning the cautery of the liver equal.
Do not press your hand with the cautery: and let the infirm be lying on his back over his belly
And another manner of cautery is: that you make a cautery having two rings, as we said in the chapter on dislocation of the humerus: and lift the skin which is directly over the spleen, where the elbow of the infirm’s left arm lies: and lift your arm as much as you lift the skin according to the width of the body, so that the cautery should go according to the length of the body.
Then insert two rings of fire alight on the outside, until when the fire has penetrated the skin from the other side: then draw back the cautery: there will be four cauteries thus And if you wish to cauterize with another cautery having three rings.
Then take care of the cautery after you have put it away to emit pus for several days: for this is better than all that has preceded from the treatment
On the method of cauterizing in Hydropsis.
In Hydropsis, on the method of cauterizing.
In Hydropsis, cautery does not suffice without specific excisions.
When you are treating Hydropsis with methods of treatment which we have mentioned in the preceding discourse, and the condition does not improve, then it is necessary to cauterize the four cauteries around the navel, one above the stomach, one above the spleen, and one above the kidneys, and two behind the ribs, and one in the middle of the chest, and one in the middle of the abdomen: and the degree of depth of the cautery should be proportionate to the thickness of the skin.
Then draw out the cautery cautiously, so that pus will discharge over a long period of time
Do not remove the diseased part after cautery, but leave it to heal: for two intentions will be gathered together with this: and it will soon heal with the help of God
The form of the cautery which should be used for the uterus is the claw-like: and for the back, the olive-like form
On the method of cauterizing feet and limbs. Chapter XXXIV.
When swelling occurs in Hydrops and the limb is filled with yellow fluid: it is necessary to cauterize above the ankle, between the heel and the toe: and hold your hand with the cautery, and do not twist it: then raise your hand: and do not move it at all
The yellow fluid will rise up, and the cautery should be used in this fashion
Then make upon each foot two carbuncles in every foot, and bring the cautery to a close with the extremity of the knife of the cautery: and make the cautery according to the length of the leg, one under the knee and the other beneath the other, about the middle of the leg: and upon every heel make two carbuncles: and draw out the cautery without healing for a long time: that it may suffice from it something of the water; then care for the rest as we have said.
Then make upon each foot two carbuncles in every foot, and bring the cautery to a close with the tip of the knife of the cautery: and make the cautery according to the length of the leg, one under the knee and the other beneath the other, about the middle of the leg: and upon every heel make two carbuncles: and draw out the cautery without healing for a long time: that it may suffice from it something of the water; then care for the rest as we have said. Then make upon each foot two carbuncles in every foot, and bring the cautery to a close with the tip of the knife of the cautery: and make the cautery according to the length of the leg, one under the knee and the other beneath the other, about the middle of the leg: and upon every heel make two carbuncles: and draw out the cautery without healing for a long time: that it may suffice from it something of the water; then care for the rest as we have said.
When the belly is in solution from the cold and moisture until the power of retention and digestion is weakened, which are in the stomach and intestines: and it is cured with the methods of treatment, and not healed: and the strong man tolerates the excessive power of the cautery; then make the great cautery upon his belly according to what has been said concerning the circular cautery upon the stomach with the cautery, and four cauteries around the navel downwards, with the cautery of the heel downwards; and the cautery above the navel above the ribs, or two cauteries.
And if the water makes the excess moist, and the patient tolerates it, then make the great cautery upon the loin, and the cautery upon every hip: and perhaps add two small cauteries upon the stomach near the great one.
There exists indeed a proficient treatment whose application does not err.
There exists indeed a proficient treatment whose application does not err.
Chapter six.
When in the rectum there are numerous old haemorrhoids, either one or several, and they are of gross, cold, or moist humour, and are cured with that which we mentioned in the treatise, and not by other means: then burn with three burnings the lower part of the spinal column below the almond-shaped area triangularly, and burn beneath the navel as with two fingers.
And if you think that its stomach is hardened, and its food does not digest, and that its face is pale and moist: then burn it on the stomach with a large burn, as has been said before: and burn on the liver and on the spleen themselves, with the cautery hook: and remove the cautery when it is open at some time: then care for it until it is healed
Chapter six
When the belly button has been cut, and there is still some discharge from the wound: then burn the surrounding area with a cautery, as much as necessary.
When you cut the belly button, then burn the cautery that absorbs the wound
Then insert the burning instrument into the cut belly button: and with your last hand, until the cautery reaches the opening of the vein from which blood flows: do this once or twice. If there are many belly buttons, then burn each one individually as we have said before
Then care for it, with that which helps to remove the discharge, until it is healed.
And if you burn it with a large cautery on the fat, that is the last thing to be done in the treatment.
How to cauterize a Fistula in the Anus.
How to cauterize a Fistula in the Anus.
When the patient does not yield to section and operative measures in its place, and recurs to the same, it may possibly be cured by cautery.
When such a thing happens to any Fistula, and it is closed, pus runs out of it, and the corrupted parts are moistened
Therefore it is necessary to make an incision with a fine needle
Then recognize the depth of its puncture with the needle
Then apply the cautery, which is like a rod
Then introduce the burning part of the cautery into the Fistula itself and the quantity in which the thread entered the fistula. And repeat the cautery over the place several times, until all the corrupted parts are consumed, once, or twice, or thrice, according to the necessity
And be attentive to avoid the nerves, if there are any, or great veins: or if the Fistula comes to the wall of the rectum, or to the intestine, then take care to avoid these places
Do not do this unless the Fistula is in a fleshy place: and be aware that it does not penetrate
Then care for the place until it is healed
If, however, the place is sealed, and is separated from the surrounding matter, and remains so for a long time: then you know that it has been completely healed
And if it is not separated from the surrounding matter, then you know that it is penetrating, or that there is a broken bone in its depth, or as if this comes from these things: which memory will arise in its place.
How to cauterize the kidneys.
How to cauterize the kidneys.
When pain in the kidneys arises from cold or from large swelling, and it diminishes on account of that from which the patient suffers, then it is necessary to cauterize above the navel over the kidneys, with cautery over the whole kidney along with the cloul.
And perhaps we must also cauterize below in the same cavity.
Because three lines come together there
Therefore there are two last things in the wound
How to cauterize the bladder.
How to cauterize the bladder When in the bladder there is weakness, and softening from the stone and humidity, until the patient does not retain urine, then cauterize in the lower part of the belly over the bladder where the hair of the pubic bones begins, and cauterize from the right side of the belly and also from the left side of it: and let the length of that cautery be as much as the breadth of a thumb: and cauterize with a lower cautery or with two cauteries, as you please: and do so as much as the cautery claw demands
How to cauterize the matrix How to cauterize the matrix
When in the matrix there is cold and humidity, and it is prohibited by this from conception, and corrupts its menstruation, and delays the discharge of its seed, and there is pain in its vicinity, then it is necessary to cauterize with three cauteries around the navel, as we said concerning the cautery of the bladder, and cauterize over the lower belly below, or with two cauteries: and let the cautery claw be as much as the claw of the cautery.
How to cauterize the Ancham in dislocation.
How to cauterize the Ancham in dislocation.
When moisture of the mucous membrane spills over onto the head of the Ancham, and is the cause of its displacement from its place: and its sign is that the thigh is prolonged over the other thigh when compared with the limb that is not displaced: and the place of dislocation is found in that hollow space.
Therefore it is necessary to cauterize the diseased area over the head of the Ancham with a cautery similar to a circle: after which you must mark the sign of encasement around the circumference of the head: and let the head itself fall into the middle of the circle
And let the cautery be of the form which preceded in the cautery of the stomach
If this cautery is not present, then cauterize it three times with a large olive cautery: and make the depth of the cautery equal to the thickness of the entire skin
Then care for it until it heals.
How to cauterize in Sciatica. How to cauterize in Sciatica
When there is pain in the head of the Ancham, and the cause of it is cold and moisture: and the disease is cured by that which we mentioned in the explanation, and not by any other treatment, and it is old: then it is necessary to drain the disease from the thick humors with foul pills, or with artificial pills, and similar things
Then cauterize it.
And the mode of cautery in these two ways: either with cautery alongside the physicians, or with fire.
The cauterium with fire is according to many methods.
One of them is that it is cauterized over the mark of the ailment three times by a triangular cautery, according to this form.</start_of_turn>
And make the depth good, or bad.</start_of_turn>
And there be space between every cautery of the size of the breadth of a finger: and let the cautery be olive-shaped.</start_of_turn>
When, however, the cautery is in the middle over the head of the ailment.</start_of_turn
Then are four cauteries.</start_of_turn
And if you cauterize with a circle, whose shape precedes the form in the cautery of dislocation of the limb, one: so that it may contain the whole limb.</start_of_turn
And burn the thickness of the whole skin.</start_of_turn
This is the method of cautery in Sciatica, when the pain is adhering to the limb itself, and does not extend until the knee and thigh.</start_of_turn
If, however, it extends until the knee and thigh, then cauterize with two cauteries over the knee, over the place to which it has been brought there in that part which is painful, and cauterize your thumb and four fingers up to the wrist on the outer side: and let the cautery be like a knife.</start_of_turn And let the depth of the cautery be according to the depth of the thickness of the skin.</start_of_turn
And if the patient says that the pain extends almost to the toes, then cauterize there where the pain is with the point, or with three, or four, or as many as are necessary for that.</start_of_turn
And if pain persists below the knee towards the heel, then cauterize it there with a single lancet.
And perform every cauterization cautiously, lest you burn nerves or a great artery, and cause thereby excessive pain or contraction.
I also know of some who have cauterized above the ankle, and have finished cauterization, and the limb has swollen, until the tumor has followed the limb down to the foot, and has burst, and all the limb has been corrupted: afterwards there followed solution of the belly, and pus after that.
If pain is in two parts simultaneously, cauterize both according to this method.
And some wise men say concerning the cauterization of an abscess that this is the method
Make a mark like that of iron, whose diameter be half of the palm: and be at the orifice as much as the diameter of the kernel of the thumb, or less: and there be within it a third part like itself
And be the space which is between every mark as much as the quantity of the thumb-node: and let the marks be opened from two parts: and let the height of them be like a node, or two nodes: and make a handle of iron aptated in the middle of the marks.
This is its form.
Then it is ignited in the fire, until it turns red, and throws sparks: and then it is placed upon the abscess inflamed above the sound side.
Cauterize thus three times with round lancets in one place
Then remove it on the third day.
After applying the plaster with butter: and discharge the opened wound after many days.
Then care for it with ointment until it heals.
Albucasis says: in this kind of burn, or of a son, we use it little, because of the fear of its aspect: and therefore we find few who dare to expect more of it.
It is true that among good burns those that please it find their place.
A burn, however, with physicians who are experienced, is like two hairs having a perforated arm, in which the wrist of the limb has descended from the air, or from iron, of the length of half the wall: whose height is that of two nodes, or as if it were one
And let there be the space which is between two quantities of the thickness of a finger, and let the lower and upper edges be open: and let the contents extend to the middle, following this shape.
Then place the burn over a cushion of wool, with the sick person resting over the healthy side
And compress the hand over the cushion of wool much.
Then pour between two circles of lukewarm water, which is warmed with fire a little, and keep the burn immersed for the quantity of an hour: and the patient will tolerate the biting of his burn, and the heat of the burn, for he finds the biting like fire until it rests
Then lift the hand with the instrument, and wipe away the lukewarm water from the whole burn with sweet water: then discharge it on the third day.
And put butter on it, until the black of the burn be removed: and discharge it in a few days, and it will go out from itself.
The utmost is in healing.
Then care for it with unguents until it is healed.</start_of_turn>
If the pain extends to the hip or thigh: make for it a posture in which water can be contained, as you did in the wider area.</start_of_turn>
And this is the way of warm water: and I have written about it in the treatise on the rectification of medicine.</start_of_turn
Take alkali and unburnt lime of both together in equal parts: put each of them in a new vessel, and make a small hole in the bottom of each vessel with a single hole: put under the bottom of the vessel a vessel filled with water: and pour over it alkali and lime from sweet water, so that it submerges each by a finger: then close them with your hand and press them well: and let go of the vessel when the acute water has descended from the lower part of the treated vessel.</start_of_turn
Then gather up the whole water and pour it over the other lime: and close, until it recovers.</start_of_turn
The very thing itself is a strong antidote for acute pain, which is administered in many medical operations and in the cauterization of the remaining members.</start_of_turn
For it does the work of the fire operation itself.</start_of_turn
And from the physicians, when they cauterize the wide areas, even like testicles, and mastic, and nutgall, and lime with soap, thus both are mixed together.</start_of_turn
And Galen himself relates that a certain man from the ancient physicians, who cured the pain of sciatica and the pain of the heel: and praised its power.</start_of_turn
And he said, "It is not necessary for other treatment, for he has been healed from one bath alone, since perhaps he himself may have entered the swollen bath and emerged from it whole. And it is taken from the green herbs: if it is not found green, take dry, mix: and apply much with some fat, and put over the swelling, where is pain, or thigh, or in the hip: and bind, and let it go for the quantity of three hours, or for the quantity which the patient feels sedation of the pain.
Then introduce him into the bath.
When the body is softened, introduce him into the tub
For the pain retreats, and he is healed
And you know that it does not be necessary to use any other cauterization with these doctors, except after the evacuation of the body.
And Dioscorides, who said this, says that the dung of goats, when it is cauterized with vinegar, gives relief for a sciatica: and it is cauterized in this way.
Take wool, and soak in old oil, and put on the deep place, which is between the thumb of the foot, and between the toes, and is closer to the toe
Then take the dry dung of goats, and burn it in the fire, until it becomes charcoal
Then put it on the wool, and let it go, until it is extinguished
Do it again like this.
Do not cease to do this until the sense of pain has passed by sensation until the swelling has gone down, and the pain has ceased
And thus this method of cautery is called cautery of the Vaccinum.
Of the cautery of the pain of the back
Chapter 44
When there is pain in the back from many causes, or from a wound, or from a blow, or from excessive evacuation, and similar things, from the infusion of cold and moist material: and the cautery is not useless, except in one kind only, which is from the infusion of cold material.
It is necessary therefore after evacuation of the sick with foetid pills, and things like these, to make three lines upon the back, where the pain is, along the width of the palm of the hand, after having signed with the cautery in every line five burnings, or more according to the tolerance of the sick person or the severity of his illness: and let the cautery be made with the cautery-needle.
And if you will, burn three or four times with the middle cautery, according to this shape
Of the manner of cautering in the swelling of the knee.
Chapter 45
Many times this swelling happens to small children
And the sign of its swelling in children is: when there is a stricture in the ankle with elevation and movement: and you find it in the last vertebra of the back and the nodes of it, which begin to protrude over the rest of the vertebrae
When you see this, and you wish to do the same, then burn it with the cautery which is in the shape of a circle according to this form
And take the cautery over the whole part of the vertebra equally: and if you wish, burn around the vertebra with the needle two or three lines: and let the punctures be close to each other
Then care for the place, until it is healed with what we have said.
Do not apply cautery to a swelling, which occurs from a spasm of the nerve.
As for cautery in podagra, and in joined pains. Chapter 46.
When the pains of the joints are from cold humours which flow upon every limb of the body, then when such pains happen in the feet, it is customary among physicians to call that Podagra
When, therefore, Podagra is caused by cold humours, it is cured by means of cautery, not by removing the pain
And it is necessary to cauterise after the evacuation around the joint of the foot with many cautery instruments: and let the cautery be of Olive Oil
This is the form of it
And if you do not like to make holes upon the face of the foot, then make holes with the cautery.
When the pain ascends up to the knee, or if the other joints remain, and this happens frequently, then cauterise the whole knee with three cautery instruments, or four from all sides, with the same cautery as Clauili If, however, more is necessary of this cautery, then cauterise it Do not immerse your hand with the cautery, but keep the thickness of the skin around it only
When the pain ascends up to the knee and the back: then administer what we have said concerning cautery in its chapter
If pain is in the hands only, then points are made around the circumference of the fingers, like two lines that are reversed.
If, however, the pain remains in the digits, then points are made over every knot of the finger and over the palm of the hand.
If the pain then ascends to the elbows or shoulders, then cauterize both from every part.
Do not evacuate the patient from the treatment regimen or the care of physicians.
For if a good regimen be made and phlegmas be evacuated, the patient will recover with the aid of God with this cautery
Concerning the cauterization of ruptures.
Chapter 42.
When a rupture occurs in the groin and the intestines or the bladder descend to the testicle, and this is at the beginning near: then it is necessary for the physician to order the patient to vomit his food on the day of the injury
And to give him laxatives, with which the stool will descend from his belly
Then let him sit between your hands on his back: and command him to hold his breath, until the bladder or the intestines appear
Then reduce the digitum youris, and sign with the cautery under the rupture over the bone of the wrist, with the sign that its extremity is like the middle of a circle towards the upper parts of the body
Then make the cautery, which has this shape, until it becomes white, and throw away the smoke.
Then reduce the intestines or the bladder to their place
Then he places his hand on the belly, so that the intestines do not escape: for you have already opened between the ribs of the sick man, and you have placed under it some powder, and another servant is above his ribs, and another above his chest which holds his hand.
Then he places the cautery upon the very mark, your hand being fixed upright with the cautery
Hold it there until you reach the bone: or go again with it until you have reached something else, if you have not followed it with the first one until the bone
And cautiously observe the escape of the intestine at the time of your cautery, lest you burn it, and let it pass over the patient or wound, or great malice.
And you know, when you do not follow with the cautery the bone, your operation is in vain.
And it is necessary that the cautery be slight of infants, according to their measure
Then take care of the remaining unguents until he is healed.
And let the patient lie upon his back for forty days, until the wound is healed
And it is necessary to give him nourishment throughout the time of his cure, which will soften his belly: so that the intestines do not escape through the wound and be evacuated.
Then when he wants to rise after forty days, then perform the ligature of the median ligament, and hold it for another forty days
For when you observe this regimen, the healing will be perfect
When, however, ruptures happen in the rest of the belly, and are starting, and you wish not to add to them, then cauterize the rupture with a round cautery according to its quantity: and let that which is cauterized be as much as a third of it
Then cure it with that which we have said: and do not add to it.
And some have said: to cauterize the rupture with a triangular cautery, according to this form.
When it has been signed with charcoal and put on, and a line is drawn which is through the width at the upper side of the rupture, and a line to the lower side And place your hand in the middle with the cautery of a claw
But the first cautery is easier and better. In the case of pains caused by swelling or percussion.
Chapter XLVIII
When in some limb there is swelling from a blow or percussion, and the pain persists for a long time, and does not subside with the aid of physicians: then it is necessary to cauterize with a needle cautery
And let the cautery be of the same size as the limb, and its breadth, and its flexibility, and its strength, and the place of torsion, and the pain from it.
If therefore it is healed from the first cautery, it is good
If not: then repeat over the same cautery.
Since custom is for these diseases that they should be transferred from one member to another that approaches them.
Therefore it is necessary to follow them with the cautery until the patient is healed.</start_of_turn>
On how to cauterize in Lepra.</start_of_turn>
Chapter XLVIX.</start_of_turn
Leprosy, however, sometimes requires the greatest cautery.</start_of_turn
And especially in the kind of Leprosy that is caused by putrefaction of phlegmas and melancholy: in such a case, one must consider the cautery itself.</start_of_turn
If, however, the Leprosy is severe and does not yield to treatment, as we mentioned previously, and does not descend, neither does it remain: and when it extends over the entire face, including the corruption of the whole complexion: then cauterize the head five times: one in the middle of the head, and the second below it at the edge of the hair, and two on the two horns, and one behind the nape of the neck.</start_of_turn
And lastly, touch your hand with the cautery nearby, until you make an imprint in the bone, and break from it the layers of cortex: so as to alleviate the emission of thick vapors from it, and cauterize the spleen also, as we have said before.</start_of_turn
If, however, the Leprosy is not very widespread over the patient and is evident: then it is necessary to cauterize with these same cauteries that we mentioned in the head, and a cautery on the tip of the nose, and two on the two cheeks, and two on the thyroid cartilage, and six on the vertebrae of the neck, and one large one on the flanks at the joints of the buttocks and one above the genitals: and two on the shoulders: namely one on each shoulder, and two on the elbows, and two on the wrists, and two on the chest. And cauterize the whole of the joints, from the joints of the fingers of the hands and feet, and the heel of the feet.
And take care of the nerves that are above the heel, so that you do not burn them. When cauterizing with the cautery above the ankle bone, and also above the rib cage, and also above the spleen.
Know that the more you add the cautery, the greater the damage, and the greater the suffering.
And know that the sick man does not feel pain in the cautery, just as he does not feel it in health: because his body is already stupefied
It is necessary that the cautery should be of suitable size, and fine according to the parts and the sutures: according to what precedes from the species of instruments
The head of L.
When some part is swollen and treated with physicians, and oils, and poultices, and does not heal, then cauterize the swollen part with the cautery, according to the magnitude of the limb or its thickness
And let your cautery not penetrate too deeply into the thickness of the skin
Then care for it with unguent until it is healed
And when cauterizing causes any swelling of the hand, foot, in the vertebrae of the back near the outlet of the nerves that move that limb: and it will move the swelling away
But do not be proud of this, except for one who is learned in the anatomy of the limbs and the course of the nerves moving the body

How to cauterize in Albaras.
When the Albaras has hardened, and no effect of any medicinal procedure is observed: then cauterize over the cautery itself, somewhat deep, according to the quantity of the thickness of the skin, until the white is restored and the color changes.
Then care for it with meal of herbs, and lentils with rose oil, and arnica leaves, and columbic blood, and hyrundine blood: take a little of each: mix them together, and smear over the wound, and bind in place, until healed
How to cauterize in Cancer
How to cauterize in Cancer
When Cancer is beginning, and you wish to stop it: then cauterize it with the cautery in the circle of its circumference, as it turns over
The wise men say, however, that the cautery should be done finally in the middle.
I, however, do not see that: because I fear that it will ulcerate: and I know that I have seen it happen many times It is better to cauterize around it with a circle, as we said: or with many cauteries. How to cauterize in Adubelati
How to cauterize in Adubelati
When anyone has Adubelati, and it is delayed in maturation, or because of excess fat which makes it limp, or because of age which makes the blood weak, or because of time, and you wish to hasten the maturation of the Adubelati: then cauterize around its circumference with many small cauteries puncturing
Then let go of it.
Then let go of it. For it will hasten with its growth.
If, however, you wish to perforate it with a cautery, then ignite the cautery, for this is its form
And place it in the middle of the Adubelati, until it pierces the skin: and let the cautery be from that which follows the diseased part, so that it may alleviate the course of the purulent matter.
Then care for it until it is healed.
In the case of a corrosive ulcer. Chapter 14.
A corrosive ulcer is not except for corruption in a movable limb, and it consumes it: just as fire consumes dry wood
If, therefore, you wish to cauterize the corrosive one in a place where it tolerates it with fire, then ignite the cautery many times, with small and large claws, according to what will be convenient for the place where the corrosive one is
Then cauterize it from all sides until you have eradicated the whole corruption, and let nothing remain of it inside Then let it go for three days, and place upon the cauterized place powdered sulphur with oil, until all the pus has been eradicated, and all corruption.
Then care for it with nourishing poultices of flesh
If, therefore, after three days flesh has been born anew in a healthy state, in which there is no corruption, this is good
And if not: then repeat the cautery over that which remains from the corrupted places.
The corrosive one is to be treated at the same time with acute medicine.
The very same thing arises at the place of the cautery.

Then let go of it, for the cavity is erased with its roots.
Do it like this with one after the other, until you reach above all that is in the body from it.
Then take care of them after they are erased, when there is what generates flesh from the pus.
In Tremore, cauterize in this way.</start_of_turn>
Chapter 66.</start_of_turn>
When it happens to anyone that they have a tremor from cold in a nerve, or from a quartan fever, or from something else: then it is necessary to cauterize it four times, or five over the vertebrae of the back, and between every vertebra cauterize, and in the belly of it cauterize, and over the stomach of it cauterize.</start_of_turn>

The wound must truly be closed after evacuation when performed with phlebotomy.
The wound must truly be closed after evacuation when performed with phlebotomy.
The wound must truly be closed after evacuation when performed with phlebotomy. The wound must truly be closed after evacuation when performed with phlebotomy, because of the great flow of blood from the artery which has been cut at the wound, which occurs both outside and at the incision of the bone, or by cautery of the limb, and similar things: and this makes it difficult to close it.
When therefore anything of this kind has happened, then you must promptly take hold of the artery at the orifice and put your finger over it: and tighten it much, until blood is obstructed under your finger, and does not flow out of it again Then put on the olive oil cautery with a small pan and a large number: and blow on them until they are alight cold.
Then take from these things one, or a few, or many, according to the wound and the place where the artery has been broken, and put the cautery on the wound itself, after which you remove your finger quickly: and hold the cautery until the blood is closed
If it is expelled when you remove your finger from the orifice of the artery, and you extinguish the cautery, then take another cautery quickly from those which are prepared in the fire. Do not cease doing this until the blood is closed.
And be careful, lest you burn the nerve which is there, and do not add any other harmful thing to the wound And know that when blood flows from an artery, then it is not possible to close it: especially when the artery is great, except with four fingers
Either as with the cautery, as we have said.

If, however, it happens to anyone of these, and there is no physician or medicine present: then he should begin with the position of the index finger over the opening of the wound, as we have said, and constrict it downwards, until the blood is driven away from the upper part of the wound to the lower part, and over the artery.</start_of_turn
And the finger should not be moved, but should be held down with cold water or ice always, until the blood is congealed, and has become firm, and is cut off.</start_of_turn And meanwhile consider what is necessary from the cautery, or from the medicine.</start_of_turn

And I proceed in this chapter in the same way: as when I must join that which is being sought after to its like Before I begin this, it is necessary to add that which is in this chapter is from the error of that which is in the first chapter of cauterization
Therefore it is necessary to be cautious in this operation, because in this chapter there is much bleeding with blood, with which the sense of smell is confused, or there is swelling over the bone, or opening of the vein, or opening of the belly, or extraction of the arrow, or incision of the stone, and such like things: from which all these are associated with tremor and fear, and fall in many of them.
I warn you, do not let this discourage you, for in this art there are many who have come after you in like manner as the sick with their diseases.
From these things is he who is enraged with his disease and is light in his ailment: because of the greatness of his illness and the length of his suffering
And when the disease is from fear that it signifies death.
And from these things is he who gives you his hope and says to you with this, hoping for health, and his disease is treacherous. It is not necessary to consent to him who comes to you from these things, whose manner is like that of a madman
And be more cautious than your desire and your wickedness
And do not presume anything about it from this, except after a certain science has confirmed it for you that it brings about a successful result
And be mindful in the care of all female patients, in prognostication and indication of that to which it is fitting for her to be restored to health.
For in this lies your help towards acquiring fame and glory, and the memory and praise.
May God inspire you, son, your intellect, and do not take from you direction and inspiration: for that is in his hand.
And I, too, have arranged this Chapter distinguishing it by chapters, according as it follows the Chapter of Cautery, from the groin to the feet: that you may be helped in what you desire from this, and in what you need.
Of the care of water which collects in the heads of children.
Chapter I.
Know that this illness often happens to children at birth: or when the midwife tightens the head of the child without lubrication
And sometimes also from an occult cause which is not known
And I have not seen this illness in any other way than in children: and concerning all whom I have seen it, death has followed: for this reason it is fitting for me to send away the operation in this case
And I have also seen in children whose head was filled with water, and whose head swelled up every day, until they could no longer sit on their own because of the size of their head: and the humidity increased until they died
And this humidity, either accumulates between the skin and the bone: or accumulates under the bone on the flesh.
And the operation in this case, if there is humidity between the skin and the bone, and the swelling is slight, then it is necessary to find a single opening in the middle of the head: and let the length of the opening be like two knots, until the humidity is cured
This is the shape of a sponge.
If, therefore, humidity is more increased and the swelling is greater, then put two incisions on either side, according to this shape
If humidity is below the bone and its sign is that the fluid bursts open all over the head: and the water is dried up when you press your hand inwards, and it does not remain hidden: then it is necessary to make three incisions in the middle of the head, in this manner.
And after the incision, extract the whole moisture.
Then cover it up above with wine and oil until the fifth day.
Then loosen the ligament and care for the wound with tension and stitches.
And do not let the head be bound with equality
And give the patient little food with much dryness, until the limb is comfortable and healed
And another method of incision is that you consider where the swelling is great and the collection of water is great
For sometimes it is in the back more, or in the cheek, or in the right, or in the left
Rise up therefore with the incision where you see the swelling and the collection of water: and cut that according to what you are able to do
Observe that you do not cut an artery, and there be no flow of blood, and the patient dies from that flow with the evacuation of moisture
Of the incisions of the arteries which are behind the ears
Chapter II.
When swelling occurs in the eyes or the chest, and the condition persists without medical attention: then the last remedy in such a case is the incision of both arteries.
It is necessary therefore when you wish to make an incision, that you cause the patient to relax his head.
Then wipe the place with a rough cloth so that the arteries appear.
Then bind the patient's neck with whatever cloth you have available.
Then consider where the pulse is to be found
And the places where both are to be found are those which are below the ears: and they are rarely hidden, except in some men.
Then mark with a branding iron above each: and cut each with a knife, with a slight curve, from the bone: and do this through the breadth of the head.
And if you wish, introduce a sponge under the artery, and cut upwards with the incision.
And let the length of the incision be like two joined fingers.
For when the artery is cut, blood flows out with the pulsation, which jumps inside frequently.
But if the artery does not appear to be pulsating, then it is necessary to measure from the ear to the quantity of three fingers' breadth
Then mark with a branding iron, and find until the bone.
And that which should be emitted from the blood is six ounces, and perhaps more or less is emitted from it The whole of this is according to the quantity which you see from the patient's vomiting and the filling of his artery
Then consider the vein.
Then if anything remains on the bone from the incision, then cut that away, so that there be no remaining swelling: then tie up the vein with strips of linen cloth.
Then care for the wound with ointment, until it is healed.
Concerning the extraction of arteries, which are in their prime
Chapter 3.
When it happens to a man an old headache, or acute catarrh because of acrid humilities and heat in the lacerta of the times, or an old soda, which cause swelling, and similar things: and it is medicated with the methods of the medical art, and does not yield to them: then we are experts in extracting arteries from the times, or cauterizing them, as we have narrated
And the method of the operation in extracting them is that he grasps the sickly hair which are in the times, and directs it towards the apparent artery in the time.
And itself is shown to you by its pulse, and rarely hides itself except in a few people, or by cold moisture
And if it hides itself to you, then tie down the sickly head with anything you like: then rub the place with rough linen cloth
Or pour water over the place with warm water, until the artery appears to be manifest Then take the hemostatic sponge, which I have mentioned before in the form. Then scrape with it the skin with ease, until you reach the artery
Then throw into the vein, and extract it upwards, until you have extracted it from the skin, and make it bleed out from under the cloths which are under it from all sides
If the artery is slender: then loop it with the extremity of a ligature.
Then cut from it the second part according to the quantity which the extremities lengthen, and tighten, and the blood flow does not proceed.
For if it is not cut and if it is not divided, the blood does not ascend completely. Then wash from the blood about six ounces, until three ounces.
If the artery is great: then it is necessary that you bind it in two places from double silk, strong, from gut: or from horsehair, so that it does not become putrefied before the consolidation of the wound, and that the blood flow proceeds
Then cut off the excess, which is between two ligatures.
Do this in an hour, or after an hour And if necessary, cauterize the artery with a cautery until it reaches the bone, with a cautery knife: until the extremities of it are cut off, and it remains stable in the place of the work.
And it is better to do the work when the patient has a low fever, or a flushed complexion.
For the cautery is from lead, which is used to dry moisture
Therefore it is better to use something that dries.
And it is necessary after the extraction of the arteries, that the place be dressed with the old cloth: and put upon it some coarse wool that has been plucked from the middle of the fleece.
And after the closing, care for it with dry physicians, who make the flesh grow, and with cloths, until it is healed
If during the operation blood flows from an artery, then promptly bind it off with cautery, or place a plug in the gap: and grasp your hand until the bleeding stops.
If neither of these is present, then place your finger over the spot until the bleeding stops.
And soak the place with cold water until the pain subsides, and then bind it securely as required
And for that which is easier and more convenient for the extraction of the artery, it is to cauterize the vein with this cautery which has two blades: and let the pain be equal to that of an almond
For indeed their sharpness is much less than that of two blades.
Since if they are sharp like two blades, they prepare both the flesh and the bone: and they do not cut with speed.
When there is some thickness in the tissue, hold it in the fire for a little while, and the flesh will be quickly severed: in this way the work is better, easier, and more convenient
And let the space between the two blades be equal to the thickness of a finger, after you have marked two points with the cautery: and place both the blades burning hot until they reach the bone, and cut the vein in two places: so that it is prolonged between its extremities
For with this cautery there is no need for great force
This is the form of the cautery.
Beware of the sharp tears of the tears from the eyes
Chapter III
When tears are thick and their course is from the eyes above the crown of the head outside: neither medicine nor physicians confer anything useful in this case, and the face of the patient turns red, and he feels a wandering in front of him like ants: and his eyes are wide, wet, as if their lashes were being corroded: and his eyelids are inflamed from the sharpness of the tears. Then the ancients indicated in the treatment of these operations, and they called this treatment Ense.
And it is, indeed, as you must shave the hair on the patient's face in this case.</start_of_turn>
Then make three incisions on the forehead, equidistant from each other according to the length of the forehead: and let the length of the incision be like two fingers, and let one incision be equidistant from the length of the nose in the middle of the forehead, and the second according to the length of the lobes of the ears, and the third from the other side: and take care to avoid the arteries which are in the two sides. And extend your hand from the continuation of the two mandibles, and let the space of the incision be equal to the quantity of three joined fingers. And prepare a sponge or dry cloth with which to soak up the blood.</start_of_turn>
Then introduce the curved tip of two acute extremities, whose following shape is like that.</start_of_turn
From the incision at the temple, up to the second incision: and scrape away everything with it, the whole skin which is between the two incisions, with chaff, which is over the bone.</start_of_turn Do the same with the middle incision up to the second incision.</start_of_turn
Then extract this sponge and introduce into the first incision once more an instrument called the acute knife, from one side blunt, not sharp from the other side.</start_of_turn
This is its form.
This is its form. Spread the flesh sharply over the meat and skin it with the fat: spread the flesh gently over the bone: and push it forward until it reaches the middle cleft: and cut through when all the matter which descends from the head to the eyes has gone: except that the incision should be continued until something appears from the skin.
Then make that in the middle cleft until another cleft is reached.</start_of_turn>
And when the blood has run out, express the place from the clotted blood.</start_of_turn> Then put in every cleft a bandage of old cloth, and put over it soaked wool, or grease, or vinegar.</start_of_turn
And see that there be no formation of a cold abscess.</start_of_turn
And on the third day heal the ligament, and give many drinks of lukewarm water.</start_of_turn>
Then care for the wound from the base of the nail, and for the rest which heals: until it is healed.</start_of_turn
Regarding the care of acute tears and catarrh of the eyes from the inside of the head.</start_of_turn
Chapter V.</start_of_turn>
When anyone has acute, severe, or sticky catarrh: and the eyes are extended, sparse, and weak: and the eyelids are ulcerated, and hair falls out from the eye, and there is acute pain in the depth of the head, which causes sneezing: then take from these things whatever does not come from many tears.
And the best cure for the eye is this.</start_of_turn
And it is, that you must shave the patient's face.
And then make an incision in the middle of the face, or on the other side along the width, and commence the incision from the left ear to the right ear: and let the incision reach the bone: and stretch out your hand from the teeth which move during mastication: until the bone is revealed: and you will dry up all the blood with a sponge.
Then separate between the two lips of the incision with wool felt, or with strips of linen.
And then string up from above with little strings: and soak the little strings in wine and oil, so that they do not cause a cold abscess.
And when you have finished with this, and you have seen that the abscess of the calus is diminishing: then it is necessary that you burn the bone, until it begins to form flesh anew
And then care for yourself with the management of the excision which makes flesh grow: thus as if you take from wheat flour two parts, and from colophony four parts: and prepare from these materials a plaster, and apply it to the wound.
And take care of it during the course of six months. (The text continues with the next chapter heading.) Every wound which falls in the course of six months is of four kinds: either a mineral stone, or like stone, such as iron and copper: or it is of a plant origin, such as chickpea and beans: or it is a fluid substance, such as water, and vinegar, and blood, or something resembling it
When such a stone or solid substance from which no nourishment is derived, nor which does grow in the course of six months, is exposed to the air: if you see that it is a stone, then distill from oil or vinegar something from vinegar.
Then manage the extraction [of the tooth], and make the cheek firm with pressure, and put oil on the gums near the cheek pressure, after you have put in the vicinity of the ear a soft cushion of cloth or wool, and extend the ear upwards.
Many things go well with this care
If it does not go well, then manage the extraction [of the tooth] with beeswax, that is, fine beeswax: which has this form.
If it goes well with the beeswax, that is good
And if it does not go well, then manage the extraction [of the tooth] with a little scoop of bone dust of little duplication. If it does not go well with that, then make a hole in the air, and introduce the end of the tube into the ear cavity much, and put oil what is around the tube with soft wax, so that there is no air inside the tube: then extract with your hand with great traction Many things go well with this that we have said.
If it does not go well in this way: then take from hellebore, or from vinegar, that is, prepared gluten with which birds are caught, a little: and put it on the end of the radius after you have enveloped over the cheek the soft part of the ear which is placed downwards: then introduce it into the ear hole with ease, after you have dried the ear from moisture
If it does not go well with all that we have said, then prepare for breaking, before the tooth becomes cold, or spasm.
And the way of breaking is like a phlebotomy in the forehead: and extract it from the blood according to its measure of virtue.
Then sit the patient down between your hands, and bring his ear close to you, and find the opening of the earwax in the root of his ear near his earwax in the depressed place: and let the opening be like a crescent, until you reach the stone. Then take it out with the instrument.
Then take it out with the instrument with speed and care, until it is healed.</start_of_turn>
If anything falls into the ear from a grain that grows and swells: then manage its extraction.</start_of_turn>
If, however, it does not obey you for evacuation, then grasp a sponge held loosely, subtly, according to this fashion.</start_of_turn
And manage with it the excision of that kind from the grains that fall into the ear, and do not make it so, when you think that the said grain is already moistened by the moisture of the ear, until you place it firmly: then take it out with hooks, or with a subtle grasp, or with suction, as we said, for its evacuation alleviates.</start_of_turn>
But when water enters the ear, the patient must sneeze at the beginning: and immediately pour out the water from his ear with a little old cotton: and lie over the ear that has the water in it.</start_of_turn
If thus it comes out, it is good.</start_of_turn
And if not: then grasp many stones, according to the length of a finger, firm, smooth, and heat them with fire nearby, and let the patient put one of his ears into the hole of his ear: and he will spit out one foot from that side, and strike with another stone against the stone that is in the ear.</start_of_turn
It is not right to do that until all the water has drained out.
When the water has drained out, take a piece of charcoal or a splinter of wood and insert its extremity into the wound: then apply the other extremity with fire until most of it is consumed by the flame.
Repeat this procedure several times until all the water has drained out: then withdraw the splinter or charcoal with a hook as described on the stone
In the extraction of an animal that is small in body, such as a flea or something similar, care for it as I said in the instruction concerning wounds.
But if the body is large, which appears to sense: then manage the extraction with forceps and hooks: and thus it is easier for everything that holds in the wound
When the worm has been generated in the wound, when you have cared for it as we said in the discourse on distillation, and in the treatise on compresses, and if your care does not suffice: then you must burn the wound with the sun.
If anything appears there from the worms, then extract it with forceps or with fine hooks.
If nothing appears there, take a tube whose shape is like this, narrow below and wide above: and insert its lower extremity into the wound according to the capacity of the patient: then draw out with that strong suction
Do this repeatedly until all the worms have drained out
If they do not obey you for the exit, then smear around the circumference of the tube with fat, as I said in the stone
When they do not drain as we said: then perform distillations as the ancient experts are accustomed in the interception of worms: and you will find it in the treatise on distillations.
And let your effusion be such as that which flows out with oil and medicines into the ear with this instrument, whose form is depicted here.
As with lead or brass, make it lower strict, in which there is a small hole, and the greater above.
Let the driving force which is in the curve of the tube be made of air centred
And if you wish, grasp a ball, and cover its extremity with a cotton ball: then pour oil, or gum, or whatever you wish of these medicines into the tube: and let it be in the ear: then insert the ball with the cotton downwards, and express it outwards by your compression, until the oil is driven into the curve of the ear, and you feel it inside: and that which is poured into the ear shall be warmed with gentle heat, and take care that nothing is distilled in it when it is cold: for medicines do not bear this.
Concerning the care of the hairy growth of the ear.
(The remaining text is not included in the provided text.)
Whenever some children go out of the doors of their mothers' houses unperforated.
And sometimes it happens to some people that their ear hair grows inward from a wound, or is born in it
And this hair sometimes grows in the depth of the ear canal, which does not usually happen: and sometimes it happens to the outside of the ear canal a little, and this does usually happen
That which happens in the depth of the ear, and which does not comprehend the aspect, is difficult to heal in many ways
And in that which happens to the outside of the ear, it is necessary to place the ear of the patient in the sun, and to touch it: then if you see the hair coming out, open the ear with a fine speculum, whose form is this which follows, and let its extremity be somewhat broad, and its part be acute: and the rest of the speculum be soft on both sides: so that it does not harm the ear
If, therefore, a swelling has arisen from the bone of the ear: then hold the finger with a fine clamp, and pierce it with ease until the whole tissue is excised.
If, therefore, the swelling is deep in the ear: then grasp a slender needle, soften it, and heat it slightly: then pierce the swelling in the ear meat
If you feel a swelling in the ear which is causing deafness in the ear, try to open it with ease: and take care, lest you damage the nerves of the ear.
Then put into the ear a quantity of unguent corresponding to the size of the opening of the wound: keep it for a few days, until you are certain that the wound is consolidated
Or take a unguent and mix it with rose water, and sprinkle over it fine gunpowder, and use it thus.
If you wish to remove the swelling from the ear: then it is necessary to extract the ointment, and leave it with another ointment which you mix with rose water, until the swelling becomes soft: then care for it until it is healed.
If blood flows: then immerse a sponge or compress in cold water, and put it on the ear: and use the rest of the treatment which eliminates the blood flow mentioned in the treatise on distillation.
(The text continues with instructions on treating eye injuries.)
(End of text.) These are the Althelis which happen in the eyelids when they are moist and are dry.
It is necessary therefore to hold them with tongs or with a finger, and pierce them with a needle from their roots.
Then place upon the wound a poultice of lead.
If blood flows from the wound, then cauterize it with a fine lancet.</start_of_turn>
And cauterization is better after the incision.</start_of_turn>
Many indeed return when something remains from their roots.</start_of_turn
And when they are cauterized with fire, those roots are consumed, and do not return.</start_of_turn
Regarding the care of the large palpebrae of the eye.</start_of_turn
Chapter IX.</start_of_turn
Many things happen in the palpebrae of the eye that Crandinus assimilates into its nature, because of its hardness, and because of this it is called Great: and it is an accumulation of thick moisture in the upper and lower palpebrae.</start_of_turn
The operation therefore is in the eye, as you will consider, if there is a Greatness proceeding from the palpebra, which appears from the palpebra and moves to every part, and its effect is easy.</start_of_turn
Find therefore above the seam across the width.</start_of_turn
Then scrape the eye from all sides with ease, until it is bled dry.</start_of_turn
Then suspend the eye with a thread, and cut it off.</start_of_turn
If however it is not prepared for you to cut off the eye, except after you have pierced the palpebra with a small incision, then it will be harmful to the patient in some way.</start_of_turn
If the incision is large: then unite it with a suture: and care for the eye, until it is healed.</start_of_turn
Even if it is small, it will not bring any harm from it.
The ointment will restore the limb itself, and kill the pain.
If it is large, it hangs down towards the inner part of the ear, then turn the eyelid downwards, and suspend the large blood vessel with a single thread: except that you will not need to make an incision, and press it from all sides.
If you lengthen the eyelid by incision, that will not be harmful in any way.
Then from the eye after the incision of the large blood vessel, with salt water: and take care of the place with it until the infirmity is healed
As for the care of the eyelids...
Chapter 10.
The swelling which is generated in the upper eyelid is called Axirnath: and this most frequently happens to children. It weighs down the eyes, and causes them to become dim in the mornings, and they are unable to see the sunlight, because the tears run down over them, and on account of this the eyelids are always wet over their surface, and over their eyebrows. They are also swollen under the eyebrows, which is why the swelling of Axirnath appears in the eye. And when you press on it with your fingers, you feel Axirnath between them.
And the method of treating it is to put the patient's head in your lap
Then take a strip of linen, and prepare in it a little weight, and make from that little weight a circle according to the quantity which contains the Axirnath from all sides
Then place it over the eye, and press with your fingers from all sides, so that the Axirnath is gathered in the middle of the circle
Then find in the middle of that moisture with the thumb resting against the fissure, that it is not a larger fissure than that which is made in phlebotomy in depth.
Or it may be necessary to find the whole skin surrounding it until you reach Axirnath in various positions, for Axirnath proceeds from the fissure following the form of the white fatty substance
Extract it therefore with the towel which you have infiltrated between your fingers towards the outside: and you will rotate your hand to the right and left, until it is scattered: and take care, lest you add it to the fissure, lest you pass it to the eye, and stain it
But if you do not see Axirnath at the beginning of the fissure, you add a little to the fissure with ease until Axirnath proceeds.
Then extract it as we have said.
Then immerse the towels in vinegar and water, and place them over the place, and bind them with threads.
And there are some who smear salt upon the people, and put it into the cavity of the fissure, so that the moisture that remains from that moisture will liquefy
Then care for it until it is healed
But if there should happen in the place of the after-burn a soft swelling, then care for it with soothing compresses until it is healed.
As for the mode of Ataxmir of the eye, that is, when the palpebra is softened, the eye will wrinkle as it should not
Chapter 11.
When hair has grown in the eyelashes of the eye beyond the course of the natural hair, and has become excessive: then it causes damage to the eye, and produces various ailments, such as excessive tears, softening of the eyelids, and pus, which is the cause of the destruction of the eye.
The eye is cured by Ataxmir according to four methods. Or by cauterization with fire.
Or with sharp medicine, as mentioned previously in the chapter on cauterization.
Or by incision and stitching with Ataxmir
Or with cannas, as I will say
You must place the head of the patient on your lap.
Then touch the eyeball with your left hand
If it moves, that is good
And if not: insert the needle through the skin at the base of the eyelash, and bring the needle out close to the roots of the lashes, where they arise: and draw the thread up to the upper eyelid, and sew the skin together with the thread.
Then find under the added lashes in the inner part of the eyelid, with a sponge dipped in the greater and less lachrymal fluid.
Then draw out the thread, and place under the eyelid a small piece of cotton or gauze: then seal over the eye with beeswax, which should be like the figure of a myrtle leaf
However, it must be known that this is done according to the quantity and elevation of the eye: for this varies in men
From this it is evident that when the quantity of the eye which must be excised is great, it must be done according to the quantity of the soft parts of the eye which are softened by the palpebra. Then when the sponge has found its way over two lines which you have marked, and when you have reached from the greater lachrymal to the less lachrymal, and there is one suture near the natural lashes, like the thickness of a radius.
Then introduce the hook into one of the two angles of the skin. Then remove the entire layer of skin. Then join together two lips with a suture, with a needle and a fine thread: and stop the bleeding, and make fast what is superfluous from the threads over two eyebrows, with some painful things if you wish to make it so: or if not, do not cure it
Then remove the suture and thread for three days, or four: afterwards care for it And if you wish, remove the wound without a suture, and care for it with that which dries it and contracts it
For the eye swells at the sealing of the wound and the gathering of its parts: but the future is better.
Such a way of treating it is taught by the ancient Ataxmires.
But attention is necessary over the sick man, and it is from a good operation, and not in him there is fear
And another method in Ataxmir is also that: and it is that there should be a sign on the eye like the shape of a leaf of myrtle, as we have said.
Then lift the eye with three hooks separated or gathered, according to the shape of this, and then cut away what is superfluous with small scissors, according to this shape, with the equality of the incision.
If, however, it is not possible to keep the hook, and it is not equal: then grasp the point where the thread is, and introduce it into the middle of the shape: and introduce another thread near the greater lacrimal gland, and a third thread near the lesser lacrimal gland: and join the threads between your fingers with equality
Then raise your hand equally and elevate the limb above the mark of the cotum, as we have said.
Then close the two lips of the wound with sutures: and care for it until it is healed.</start_of_turn>
If there be swelling at the incision or fracture: bind that swelling with a dressing, and do the like with other unguents which are sitting.</start_of_turn>
And when the eyelashes also swell, as the hairs bend over.</start_of_turn
Concerning the care of Ataxmir with a dog.</start_of_turn>
And that you cover the eyelash, and split the fracture which is inside, as I have said.</start_of_turn
Then make two incisions, or two slender sticks: whose length is according to the length of the eyelash, and the width of them less than the width of the pupil: and pass the thread through the extremities from both parts where you have the hair.</start_of_turn
Then close both with a little over the excess of the eyelash of the eye, and bind the two threads from both parts strongly, and let go of it every few days.</start_of_turn The skin is strict and will die, and will become black, and will putrefy, until it falls away by itself.</start_of_turn
If it is late, then cut through it with scissors.</start_of_turn
And care for it until it is healed.</start_of_turn
When the body is firm, elevate the eyelids: do not pierce the hair.
This is the form of two nails, which you make according to this figure and quantity in length and width.
Regarding the elevation of hairs puncturing the eye with the needle.</start_of_turn>
Chapter XII.</start_of_turn>
The operation in this case is that you take a fine needle and insert it through a thin silk thread, which is soft.</start_of_turn Then you join the extremities of it and make knots at each end with a fine knot: and let the length of the thread be as much as one palm.</start_of_turn
Then lay in another thin thread under this one in a short space, and knot the extremities of it if you wish.</start_of_turn
Then put the patient's head on your lap, and let it be close to the cheek so that the operation is seen: because the operation is slight, or even a moment.</start_of_turn
Then insert the needle with the sutures through the root of the eyelid, and make it penetrate the eyelid quickly, until you have extracted the natural hair.</start_of_turn
Then draw out the hair until above the sutures: and insert into the sutures the light of the hair: if there is one, or two, or three, not more.</start_of_turn
Then draw your hand away with it, until the hair comes out with the sutures in the eyelid with the natural hair.</start_of_turn
If, however, the sutures are pulled out, and the hair does not come out with them: pull out the sutures to the lower part, with the thread which you made in them, until the sutures come out of the upper hole, and you see the eye: then indeed pull out the sutures and the thread, and close the eye: and keep it closed for two days, or three, until the hair has grown back in its place, and has arisen above the flesh.</start_of_turn>
If the hair is short, then either associate it with a long hair from natural hair, and elevate it with that; or discharge it, until it has elongated over space, and then elevate it.
If the hair is short, then either associate it with a long hair from natural hair and elevate it with that; or discharge it until it has elongated over space, and then elevate it.
Chapter XIII.
When this happens to the eye, it is called Leporina.
This condition is either natural or accidental
Accidental is therefore caused by the consolidation of a wound, or section, or cautery, and the like
And the method of operation in this is to find the consolidation and to separate the lips, and to place between them a piece of linen, and to bind them until they are healed
And do not use in the treatment of this anything that will irritate and constrict: for if you do, the condition will deteriorate more than before. Rather use in it those things which soften, such as barley-straw. Mix with water, in which be dissolved alum, poppy seeds and oil: and apply with it the bandage.
And your method of treatment should be such that you overcome every ingenuity, so that it does not solidify, according to the form which it had at first
And this operation which we have mentioned is not except a certain rectification of the Leporina, so that it does not return to its original shape again Concerning the care of the Leporina which happens in the lower eyelid, and is roughness or contraction upwards to the right and left.
Chapter 123.
This lower part of the head is called the Alxatrati.
It is natural and accidental.
It is caused by a wound, or a fracture, or a burn, or similar things
And the way to operate in this is that you take a needle which has a double thread, and you pass it through the flesh from the left tear duct to the right tear duct, until the thread reaches the two extremities of the flesh
Then extend the flesh upwards with the needle, and cut the flesh with a spatula that is wide open.
If the figure of the eyelid returns according to what is required, that is good
And if it does not, grasp the edge and put it into the fracture, and join it with that: and find two holes on the inner side of the eyelid, and the extremities of the two holes are from two angles of the incision, until they converge and make an angle: until when they converge, they make the figure of these two letters, and it is the Greek laudation letter
And then remove the flesh by the amount which is the width of its upper acute angle below, from that which follows the eyelid.
And then join the separated parts: its flesh with a thread.
And then care for it as we said, with soothing medicines and compresses, until it heals
And if the Alxatrati comes from a fracture, and a suture, or a burn: then you must find a flat fracture under the eyelashes, even as before
Then separate between two lips with linen, as we have said.
And thus the conclusion of the discourse concerning the care of the Exaltatus is that, when he is either above or below, that is, in this operation, it is necessary to proceed according to the preparation of the Exaltatus.
For there are many different forms of him: and the prudent artist prepares the spirit in whatever way is possible for him, until he directs it to make a figure resembling his natural form, or something close to it, and the patient himself, according as it agrees with him from the operation and the instruments in many different dispositions.
As to the adhesion of the eyelid to the conjunctiva, or the cornea.
Chapter 15.
When this adhesion happens with many people, it is necessary to consolidate the upper eyelid with the white of the eye, and to keep it away from its natural operations.
Therefore one must introduce the extremity of the radius under the eyelid, and lift it up: or stretch it out with a hook: then cut through the adhesion with a fine spatula, which must not be as acute as the sharpness of the spatula, but rather obtuse, in order that it does not irritate the patient during the operation, and that the spatula may be withdrawn without causing damage to the eye: and let the incision be such that it resembles your scraping away the adhesion with ease, until when the eyelid returns to its natural shape and the adhesion is completely healed
Then pour water with salt into the eye, when you have washed it out: or instill it from a syringe made from a horn with salt dissolved in it
Then separate between the eyelid and the eye with linen thread: and place upon the eye wool soaked in alum or egg white: and on the third day use a sponge, and solid dressings, until it is healed.
On the incision of the nail and the prominence of the flesh of the tear ducts.
On the incision of the nail and the prominence of the flesh of the tear ducts.
You know that the nail exists in two ways. It is either nervous: and is similar to a hard sponge, fine.
Or it is not nervous, resembling frozen white moisture: which when it touches iron, or when you try to grasp it with a hook, it breaks and does not remain in the nail
Both of these kinds do not begin until they reach the greater lacrimal gland, until which time they are covered by something, and prevent light and the movement of the eye.
And the way of working in its incision is: as you place your hand over the patient’s head
Then open the eyes and lift the eyelid with your hand
Then grasp the nail with a hook of few doublings and extend it upwards
Then take the needle and pierce the hair from the hair of the horse, and burn or cauterize: and let the thread be strong, and double the end of the needle slightly, and fix it in the middle of the nail: and pierce the nail with the needle, and bind the nail with the thread, and extend it upwards: and remove the surrounding hair around the pupil as though you are grooming the hair until the last of it
And cut the remaining part in the root of the lacrimal gland with a fine scalpel, or with small forceps: and let the natural flesh of the lacrimal gland go, so that it does not cause excessive discharge from the incision of the tear ducts.
And when the nail is extended with a hook alone: or with thread, as we said before
Then it is to be scraped with a blunt sponge of gentle pressure, whose form is like this.
Take heed, lest you tear the delicate tunic of the intestines, and cause a rupture, and perforate the pupil.
Then, after the incision, pour some salt in the eye, or make it from pounded aloe, and let it remain until tomorrow.
And take care of it with what is necessary, until it is healed. If the nail is neither sensitive nor has solid matter to impede its progress, if it does not bulge in it, then it is to be treated with multiple medications by the physicians, and it will heal as I have said previously
If you wish to make an incision, then open the eye of the patient, and grasp the intestines gently, of low degree of sharpness, according to this form
And trim off the nail with reason with sharpness.
If it should happen that it becomes rareified and fractured, and leaves its imprint in the eye, then let it be washed from your eye with a sponge of aloe, or with red ochre, or with salt: and anoint the eye until tomorrow
Then repeat the operation until the whole of it is remedied
Unless there be in the eye a thickish yellow pus: then leave it alone, and care for the pus until it is healed. Then repeat the operation with reason until it is healed
The swelling of the tear-gland which hinders the eye from closing, if it causes great discomfort, is to be suspended with a hook, and from it to remove a portion of it: and do not make the incision at the end, lest the flow of tears be hindered
Then stop the bleeding with a red leech, or one made from sponge, until it heals. After the incision, if flesh remains in the eye.
Chapter 17.
Sometimes in the eyes of men there is a red piece of flesh, either in itself or superposed, which covers the pupil, approaches, or tightens over the eyelids, and perhaps turns the eyelids outwards: and it is like a rose petal
And the operation for this is also that you put your hand in his head
Then open his eyes, and collect all the flesh with hooks which are convenient for this: and hold it with one forceps, or grasp it.
Then cut the flesh at first, until all of it is finished with the knife
And burn from the eye, so that you do not damage it during the operation: and let your incision be such as you would make it if you were cutting a nail, or with sponges, which we mentioned in the incision of the nail: or with small forceps, with which you collect fat, as it will come after this chapter
When your incision is finished, and you have moved all the surrounding flesh, then take out the eye from salt which has been crushed: or distill it into powder, and do the like of physicians who have corroded it: and put over the eye a bandage of cotton with alum, so that it may be protected from the heat of the afterburn.
If anything remains of the surrounding flesh, and the blood is hot, and the swelling is great: then take out the eye, and care for it as you would a wound that has healed
Then do over the eye with the operation, until it heals.
And in like manner do it with meat added which has happened in the eye from this kind.
And truly it is necessary to know that the care of every eye must be from a natural cause, either from a natural cause, or from an accidental cause, working with iron: and do not put your hand into any of these operations until you are sure that that limb can tolerate that operation.
Regarding the collection of the sebum from the eye.
Chapter XVIII. The sebum are red veins which spread over the eye, and prevent the liquid from performing its operation: and they weaken the eye with the length of the days.
It is necessary therefore, that first you consider, if the eye in which there is sebum is strong, and there is no other ailment in it except for the sebum: then collect the sebum from it
And it is necessary, as a precept, to place your head in your lap
Then suspend those veins with one thread, or two according to your wisdom: and let the thread be fine as half the diameter, or let there be two threads gradated in one body, according to this shape.
Then collect with fine tweezers those veins with care, and wash away the blood an hour after an hour, until you are sure that you have removed those veins from the eye, and that they have dissolved: and beware lest you damage the eye with the extremities of the tweezers
And let your operation be in the middle of the day before the sun, and be firm in your operation, so that you do not injure anything except those veins.
And when you have finished, then instill into the eye a little oil, or a little red: so that your sight may be restored by its sharpness which remains from the sebum
If, however, it is not possible to collect all of it in that hour, then smear ointment over the eye, which will soothe the eye pain: and leave it for a few days, until the pain subsides: and keep it covered with a warm compress. Then repeat over it again in the same way until it is healed.
And this is the manner of the forceps.
Of the reduction of the Arissa to the nose.
Chapter XIX.
Physicians call the Arissa Fistula which they cure with cautery, or with acute medicine and burning, as the occasion demands.
And if it does not heal, then there is no wisdom in it: except that you find a boil on the swelling near its origin, and extract all the moisture which is in it and pus, until the bone is bare
When the bone is thus extracted, and the cavity is washed out with liquid, or blackened, then close it up with an instrument whose form is like this
And it is called the Asper of the head
It is made of iron, and its head is round like an olive, which is pierced with the point of nails, or with the point of a awl, or with a fine puncture: and place it over the place of the broken bone Then rotate it between your fingers, and your hand near, until you know that the fracture has vanished: and do this every day
Then rotate it between your fingers, and your hand near, until you know that the fracture has vanished: and do this every day Then restore the place with dry astringents.
If thus the place is consolidated, and there is formed in it flesh, and the swelling subsides: and there is no recurrence of the pain, and no swelling, and no accident occurs in it: then you know that it is healed
If not, then it is not in that cavity, unless the fistula be reduced to the opening of the nose, following this form.
If not, then it is not in that cavity, unless the fistula be reduced to the opening of the nose, following this form.
If not, then it is not in that cavity, unless the fistula be reduced to the opening of the nose, following this form.
If not, then it is not in that cavity, unless the fistula be reduced to the opening of the nose, following this form.
If not, then it is not in that cavity, unless the fistula be reduced to the opening of the nose, following this form.
If not, then it is not in that cavity, unless the fistula be reduced to the opening of the nose, following this form.
If not, then it is not in that cavity, unless the fistula be reduced to the opening of the nose, following this form. If not, then it is not in that cavity, unless the fistula be reduced to the opening of the nose, following this form.
If not, then it is not in that cavity, unless the fistula be reduced to the opening of the nose, following this form
If not, then it is not in that cavity, unless the fistula be reduced to the opening of the nose, following this form
If not, then it is not in that cavity, unless the fistula be reduced to the opening of the nose, following this form
If not, then it is not in that cavity, unless the fistula be reduced to the opening of the nose, following this form
Repeat the process with the stomach without incisions.
Repeat the process with the intestines, and keep the eye closed day and night.
If the ligament is again softened, it is necessary to tighten it much: then remove the ligament after a day and night, as we have said
If therefore the eye is again found soft in the swelling of the tunica, it is good: and if not, then repeat the packing, the sponges, the tightening, and the stomach until it is healed.
Of the incision of the belly-tunica.
Chapter XXI.</start_of_turn>
When disruption occurs in the belly-tunica, then it comes out and proceeds outside the eyelids like a grain of the belly-tunica, and it swells like a man because of this. It is therefore necessary to make an incision in this: and the operation in this is as follows: introduce the needle into the radix of the belly-tunica from the lower part to the upper part
Then introduce another needle in which there is a double thread from the lacrimal part, and make it penetrate: and withdraw the first needle according to its position.
Then make an incision at the place of the double thread, and ligate with it the part of the belly-tunica around the needle: and tighten it much
Then withdraw the needle, and place over the eye a lanolin-soaked wool plug: and leave it until the thread is consumed by the belly-tunica
Then care for the eye with it, which comforts it, until the wound is healed
And when the belly-tunica is tightly bound round about with a circle of cloth, until it has added prominence to the eye.
Then it is perforated with a fine needle which reaches the depth of the eye, and moisture of the mucus is curried, and the eye descends and immediately receives: then it is bound up until it is healed.
Then it is perforated with a fine needle which reaches the depth of the eye, and moisture of the mucus is curried, and the eye descends and immediately receives: then it is bound up until it is healed.
Then it is perforated with a fine needle which reaches the depth of the eye, and moisture of the mucus is curried, and the eye descends and immediately receives: then it is bound up until it is healed.
This ailment which is called Alcomnati, is not, in fact, anything other than health which is aggregated in the eye, similar to descending water, and is not itself.
And the method of operation in this is that you make the patient sit upon a prepared seat, or directly
Then take hold of his head with your hands from two parts, and move it, until you see health come to the lower parts of your eyes
Then it is perforated with a fine needle which reaches the depth of the eye, and moisture of the mucus is curried, and the eye descends and immediately receives: then it is bound up until it is healed. And you see the patient as he saw: and if it does not descend downwards, you know that it is water
And if it is not prepared for the descent of health as we have said, then make the patient sit between your hands Then take a fine needle and find with it above the corneal membrane at the edge of the junction of the conjunctiva with the cornea in a circle, until health comes out.
When it has come out, then distill into the eye lukewarm water in which you have mixed honey: or water in which you have put barley and honey: then treat with the rest of the treatment, until it is healed
Concerning the care of water which descends into the eye, or a cataract.
Concerning the care of water which descends into the eye, or a cataract.
We have spoken of ten kinds of water in flux, which is declared and shewn to be harmful, and take heed of that according to the health of the eye.
Therefore it is necessary that you make the sickly hand rest upon the square opposite the light, near the cheek: and hold the eye steady, and bind it tightly: then take your right hand, if the water is in the left eye, or your left hand, if the water is in the right eye
Then take your right hand, if the water is in the left eye, or your left hand, if the water is in the right eye.
Then put the tip of the sponge near the circumference of the cornea at the apparent white of the smaller lacrimal gland: then push the sponge with force: and you draw back your hand when you feel that the sponge has penetrated the membrane of the eye: and you will know that the sponge has reached its place.
And it is necessary that the extent of the sponge be measured to the depth, measuring the space from the pupil to the end of the black circle: and that is the circumference of the eye
You will see it in the pupil of the eye by the clarity of the cornea.
Then put the sponge until it reaches the place where the water is
Then press down alternately from below with one hand after the other
If thus water descends immediately, then the sickly hand will be brought over that which opens the eye immediately, and the sponge in its eye.
Then rest a little while.
If water should descend, then lay the bandage aside for the time being, before it is expelled by the vomit
When it has been expelled and does not ascend: then draw out the vomit easily: and you will gradually move your hand Then dissolve in water something of clear salt like a pearl: and bathe with it when the eye is affected.
Then place over the eye the whole of the bandage, or wool soaked in fat, and alum: and bind with it the sound eye
But we who are of our time put upon it a soft cushion with alum and egg white
If it does not yield to you the vomit at the entrance of the eye because of its hardness, because it is from a man whose eye is hard and cold: then you must take a sponge, which is called Alberid, whose form is like this.
So soak it with the sponge along with the eye itself, and do not touch the hand with the thumb: and do not do anything except to make the vomit move to a lower place.
Then draw out the vomit, as we have said.
And in addition to this, prepare for the sick a comfortable bed, made in the middle of the room, in which he may lie on his belly in a dark room: and keep him away from all movement, and from coughing: and give him food which soothes the nature of his ailment: and do not move his head to the right or the left at all
And keep the bandage in place according to its position until the third day. Then take him out of that dark room, and make known his condition: and set him free.
Then reduce the ligament until the seventh day.
Then do not make it in the hour of care, or immediately after the incision: but rather later on, because water ascends quickly through the open part.
If, however, there is a cold swelling: then it is necessary to loosen the eye before the seventh day: and correct it when it has subsided: then take away its cause, and put over its face a quantity of oral medicine which will regulate its discharge for a few days, while it exists in that dark place
Then gradually depart from the place and return to its case.
Know that in surgery the pupil should not be excluded from vision for a long time: for in that case it will hear about the operation
And indeed it has been reported to us by some of the people of Alayrach, who say that there was an opening made in the great magdalan of Alayrach, through which water ascends.
But indeed we do not know anyone in our land who has done this: neither have we read of it in any of the ancient books: and it is possible that it is new.
And these are the forms of the spirits of the magdals, as they remain over those who know them not
Let them be of air alone: and their extremities shall be like those of a triangle with a pointed base.
The forms of magdals.
On the care of the newly born flesh in the nose.
Chapter XXVIV.
When different kinds of meat are born in the nose of a child, there is something which is assimilated from the scorpions of many feet: and from this there is a cancerous tumor, a stone, of a dusky color: and from this there is what is soft flesh, not of a dusky color
If any part of these meats is soft, not fraudulent, neither cancerous, you must make the infirm man sit between your hands opposite the sole, and open his mouth, and throw the hook into his flesh: then draw them out to the exterior, and cut off what you have grasped from it with a fine acute scalpel from one side, until you know that the whole flesh has been removed.
If anything remains of that from whose excision is impossible: then cut that with a fine instrument from one side until nothing remains of it
If blood flows or a thick clot has formed: then oppose it with that which is proper: either from malignant clots, then cauterize it until the blood is stopped, and remove all the flesh.
Then throw into the nose after the incision of the bladder, and water, or liquid.
If indeed the mouth is opened, and moisture proceeds from it until the palate, then you know that he is healed.
If indeed moisture does not penetrate, according to what is proper, then you know that the flesh has naturally perished in the upper bones of the nose, which did not go away with the incision of the instrument
Then indeed you must introduce a thread of linen which has some thickness, and knot it in it many knots: and put between every knot as much as a finger, or less: and the infirm man will put one end of the thread into the nose with a hook, or as he can do after he has made him do the same: and he will draw out the foul matter until it has gone right up to the epiglottis, and come out through his mouth
And many do the like of this boy of Attomus in schools: and it is an easy thing for him who wishes it.
Then place two extremities of the fili, one which goes out over the nose, and the other which remains in the nose.
Then bind the flesh with stitches which are in the fili Do this until you know that the flesh is held together by the knots of the fili
Then draw out the filium: and put it into the nose after washing the blood away with the customary unguentum aegyptium: do this every three days, or more, until the unguentum has eaten away all that remains of the flesh.
Then put at the end of the matter in the nose a lead weight for a few days, until it is healed.
If, however, further care is required, use it accordingly.
For the application of caputpurgium make it with olive oil and other medicines in the nose: make this of silver, or brass: which is like fine sand, opened like a conch shell: and its passage is like that of a worm
Or if you wish make a closed cannula, like a tube.
The instrument for the application of caputpurgium should be full, with a handle at its end, with which you may grasp it, when you heat it in oil, or when you wish to put some succus into it, and to let out the fluxes.
And this is the shape of the instrument Of the care of the eye of the nose
Twenty-five days.
The eye of the nose grows very much at the extremity of the nose, and grows greater and greater with the days, until the wound has healed and its aspect has become normal
And therefore it is necessary, that in the beginning of its appearance, you cut off all of it.
Then place above it, or apply cautery, or burn a blistering ointment in its place.
If, however, its incision is delayed until it has grown large, then consider whether it is a stone, hard or of a dark colour, with little sensation: then do not touch it with the iron, for the swelling is cancerous.
For many times indeed, the incision which causes the swelling of the tumour itself arises from the malice which is in it over that which it has.
And if the tumour is soft to the touch, not of a dark colour, and the incision can be made throughout its whole extent, then evacuate the patient and make the incision without fear, without pain: and care for the place with that which closes and binds it up until it is healed.
Concerning the suture of the nose, lip and ear.
End of book.
You know that when solution is continued in some cartilaginous substances, it brings about little benefit in the operation, except in certain persons.
It is necessary therefore when anything of that kind happens to consider whether there is a wound with its own blood: and then join together the edges of the wound with a suture: and then care for it until it is healed
And if the continuous solution of the lips has already separated, and each part is sound: then it is necessary to scrape away all the parts from the apparent skin, until blood flows.
Then join together the lips with a suture, and bind them, and smear above it the blood of a dragon, and ointment: and place above the powder a piece of plaster of Paris, and some other solid plaster: and leave it bound for two days, or three
Then solve yourself, and move the medicine: and send yourself away, until the threads are severed by themselves. Then care for yourself with the unguent, until you are healed.</start_of_turn>
The way of stitching is that you gather the solution of continuity, or with an awl, as we say in the stitching of the belly: or you gather the solution with the thread, as you have been told.</start_of_turn>

Chapter XXVII.</start_of_turn Many people suffer swelling in the inside of their lips due to hard bumps resembling seeds of herbs: and some of them are small, and some are large.</start_of_turn
Therefore it is necessary to cover the lips, and find over every bump of it, and suspend it with a thread, and cut it away from all sides.</start_of_turn
Then apply a little balm to the place of the incision so that the blood is absorbed.</start_of_turn
Then bind it up with vinegar, and care for the place with that which has styptic properties, until the wound is healed.</start_of_turn>

Chapter XXVIII.</start_of_turn Many people are born with flesh that appears on the gums, which the ancients call abuluss.</start_of_turn
Therefore it is necessary to suspend it with a thread: or to hold it with tweezers, and cut it away at its root, and let the blood run, or the pus.</start_of_turn
Then place upon the wound a dry sponge, or other cohesive powders, to absorb the exudate.
If the flesh returns to its original state after treatment, for it has returned too much, then cut into it again the second time, and cauterize it: for it will not return after cauterization

Chapter XXIX.</start_of_turn
When teeth gather together on the surface both from the inside and outside, and between the gums there are rough and hard layers, and sometimes they decay and become black, and yellow, until corruption reaches the gum, and the teeth become loose.</start_of_turn
It is necessary therefore that you make the infirm hand rest between your hands, and hold its head in your jaw, and take away the soft and hard parts, where you see the rough layers, like sand: until nothing remains of the bad thing, and similarly make away the blackness, and the yellowness, and the yellow spots, and all until it is cleansed.</start_of_turn
If therefore the bad thing is taken away from the beginning of the treatment, it is good: and if not, then repeat the treatment on the third day, the second day, and the first day, until the study is complete in this matter.</start_of_turn

On the extraction of the toothache.
On the extraction of the toothache.
It is necessary to cure the toothache with all skill and to eradicate it entirely.
It is no use to deceive the pain when it is eradicated: for it is a lofty matter. Therefore, when it is not necessary to eradicate it, it is proper that the sickly man eradicate it himself, so that he may strengthen his body and be certified by thee as free from the toothache
Many indeed deceive the patient with pain, and think that they have eradicated it by extracting the tooth: but the pain does not depart until the sickly tooth is eradicated itself
For we do not see that it departs from the operation of the bloodletting.
When thou art certified by thee that the toothache itself is gone, then thou must sacrifice around the tooth with the sponges, in which there is some virtue, until the gum is separated from all sides: then move the tooth forth with thy fingers, or with fine forceps at first slowly, until thou hast broken it through
Then place there great forceps in a good place, and the patient's head between thy knees: which thou shalt hold firmly, so that it does not move: then draw out the tooth according to its direction, so that thou dost not break it
If it does not come out, then take some of those instruments and introduce it under all parts of it with ease, and move it about, as thou didst do at first.
If the tooth is perforated or corroded: then thou must fill that hole with wool: and bind it with the extremity of a fine thread, so that it does not break in the time of thy constriction with the forceps.
It is necessary that the skilled surgeon should go around the limb with the knife from every side many times.
Hold fast your courage, that you do not break it, and leave some of it there, and return over the sick part from that from which the pain first arose
Be careful, lest you do what the unskilled do, the phlebotomists of our time, who are audacious in their eradication of the disease, without knowing how to administer that which we have narrated.
Many indeed do make the sick depart from great diseases, of which some are difficult to break, and remain with all their roots, or that they extract the same with some teeth of the jaw: as we have been informed Then shall be collected after the eradication of the disease with wine, or with vinegar and salt. When blood flows from a place (for many indeed such a thing happens) then there is something from the ulcer there, and smear it over that place: and if that does not suffice, cauterize it if it does not suffice to bring about the ulcer
The forceps which we use for teeth in the first place should be of fine form, and their handles long, their thumbs short, thick, so that they do not bend when pressure is put on them: they should be like large nails, until when they are put against the tooth, they do not bite into themselves, neither do they bend: the handles should be short, and they should be made of iron or of beaten steel, straight, and in their extremities should be teeth, some of which enter into the substance of the tooth, and which bind the constriction closely, firmly
And when the extremities are like the beak of a bird which is called a ciconia, and are strong constrictions
On the eradication of wisdom teeth and the extraction of fractured mandibles.
On the eradication of wisdom teeth and the extraction of fractured mandibles.
When it remains for the eradication of a tooth which has fractured something, then one must place over the site of the fracture butter on the first or second day, until the place is softened: then introduce into the cavity a sponge or forceps: whose extremities absorb the edges which are called ciconia.
The form of these forceps is as follows: ...
Their extremities are made like a file or like a nail file
If, however, these do not suffice for the extraction, then one must place over the root a hook, and remove the whole flesh, and introduce an instrument which is called a small palance, whose form is as follows: ...
Its short handle, large head: and it is not to be wet, so as not to break
If the root comes out through that, it is good: and if not, one must bite with other instruments whose forms are like these
The form of the first is triangular, at the extremity of which is some breadth
The form of the triangular extremity is slight.
One must also bite with this instrument having two branches, whose form is as follows: ... And with other instruments and things which go before concerning teeth.
One must also bite with this instrument which absorbs a large single, of this form, triangular extremity twisted, in which there is some breadth, so as not to break: and it must not be wet
Know that the instruments for teeth are many: and like the rest of the instruments, they do not all work in the same way. A skilled craftsman, experienced in his art, discovers for himself the appropriate instrument for each operation and ailment.
For the ailments of which the ancients did not speak, there are instruments which are diverse in kind
If, however, the jawbone or any other bone of the mouth breaks, or becomes putrid: then one must examine the place itself with the instruments and forceps which I have mentioned in the extraction of teeth, and handle it with care
So be careful that there should be some degree of length to it, that it may be held firmly with the bone, and not slip away or break, until the bone comes out: and restore the place with the physicians who are appropriate for that
If there is a slight putrefaction in the bone, then remove it from its putrefaction and care for it, until it heals.
About the closing of the teeth which project over the others.
Chapter two.
When teeth do not follow their natural course and project, a wound is made by that shape: and especially when it happens in women and girls, that is to say in the young ones.
For if a tooth has been born after another tooth, and is not placed, or if it is possible to close it, or to file it down: then extract it. And if it is connected with another tooth, then cut it with this instrument which has this shape
It is like a small knife made of iron, with acute extremities that curve downwards
And let your incision be such as that which you make on many days, and because of the hardness of the tooth, and that it does not move another from the teeth.
If, however, there is a prominence of the exposed edge of the tooth: then file it down with a file like that which has this form.
Let the whole of the handle be of bone, and the fingers of its handle be of small nails, like a file which is made with teeth: with which the tooth is slowly ground on many days with ease, so that it does not move, and falls down: then soften it, and in the end smooth it with some rasps.
If there is a tooth from which a part is broken off, and which is injuring the tongue: then it is necessary to file it down until the asperity of that fracture is removed, and it is evened: and flattened, and does not injure the tongue, nor corrupt speech
Of the reposition of a tooth with files.
Chapter 33.
When it happens that the front teeth have concussion and commotion from a blow, or in a case: and it is not possible for the patient to bite without causing it to fall out: and if treatment with medicines does not suffice: then the wisdom is to bind them with gold wire: for silver becomes black with use, and putrefies after days: but gold never changes.
And let the middle wire be of moderate thickness and size according to the quantity that it can grasp between the teeth.
And the form of the reposition is that you grasp the wire, and pass its double between two sound teeth: then you will sew with two ends of the wire between the moving teeth, whether one or more, until you have reached the sound tooth of the other side
Then again, proceed with the texture until you reach the part from which you commenced: and keep your hand firm with dexterity and wisdom until it does not move forward: and let your constriction be such as that it holds the thread at the roots of the teeth, so that it does not slip away.
Then again, grasp the superabundant threads with forceps: and gather each together, and bind them together with the thumb: and conceal them between the sound tooth and the moved tooth, so that it does not harm the tongue: then let go of the tight knot when it remains.
If, however, it dissolves or is fractured, string it with another thread, and keep it firm as before for the whole time
This is the form of teeth, and the figure of the alternation of two sound teeth and two moved teeth, as in water
And when one or two teeth have fallen out due to an injury, they must return to their places as we have described: and they remain: and this does not happen except by a skillful, wise, and experienced artist.
And when some fragments of bone or flesh adhere: and it becomes like the shape of a tooth, and is placed in its place, where the tooth was lost and bound: it remains, and serves for a long time
Concerning the incision of the ligament which occurs under the tongue, and which hinders speech.
Chapter 34.
If there is any hardness or nodulation in it, and if that is from the consolidation of the wound: then thrust into that part of the gut and find it by its breadth until you cut the ligament and the nodulation is resolved.
If blood flow is to be increased, then put upon the place a bruised egg. If blood boils, then cauterize the place with a blunt cautery, which is suitable for that: then care for it with the rest of the treatment, until it heals Of the extraction of the ranula which is under the tongue.
Chapter 5.
Whenever there occurs under the tongue a small swelling which is absorbed by the ranula, hindering the tongue from its natural operation: and perchance it becomes so great that it fills the mouth.
If there is blood of a dusky or black color, hard, which the patient does not feel: then do not touch it, for it is cancer
And if it inclines towards whiteness, in which there is moisture, then thrust into that part of the gut and cut it with a fine knife, and free it from all around
If blood should spill upon thee in the hour of thy operation, then place above it a rough sponge until the bleeding ceases: thereafter return to thy operation, until thou hast extracted it with its complement.
It shall be bound with vinegar and salt: and take care of the rest according to the customary treatment for the same, until it is healed.

Chapter XVI.
And then either perforate it or it will rupture by itself
And if it is of a white colour, round, and its root is slight: then it must be cut off
And the operation for this is as follows: consider before your operation whether the after-effect has become calm and quiet after completion, or if it has begun to diminish: then sit the patient with his head resting on your lap: open the mouth and take hold of the tongue with your hands, and bring it down with an instrument of this kind Make an incision from silver or from air, which is delicate like a knife.
When the former things are done and the language is relinquished, and the apostema appears and falls upon the part you are dealing with: then grasp the hook and fix it in the flesh, and draw it out as much as possible, without leaving anything behind in the tunic.
Then insert the instrument of this shape which follows.
Like scissors: truly the extremities of these are bent downwards, so that the opening of each is opposite the other at an angle: from which care must be taken lest it be scorched or burnt by the iron or alum.</start_of_turn>
If the instrument is not present, then insert it with the spatula, which has this shape.</start_of_turn>
Be acute from one side, not acute from the other side.</start_of_turn
And after you have incised one part of the flesh, insert the other according to this same kind of incision.</start_of_turn
Then let the patient gargle with cold water, or with vinegar and water.</start_of_turn>

The abscess has ascended as far as it could, since it has emitted two branches, until they have gone beyond the two nostrils.
The swelling has progressed as much as possible, and has fixed itself in one of its roots.
Then I draw it out, and from it is a large piece removed
Then I cut through the abscess, where it encompasses the nostrils
Then I do the same with the other nostril that was affected by the abscess
Then I open the mouth of it, and press the tongue: and afterwards I fix the root of the abscess in it: then I cut away from it a part of it, and no blood flows from it: it is the gut of a woman, and immediately it begins to drink water, and then it accepts food.
I do not cease to cut into that abscess many times: and the abscess returns to the place where I cut it, until it becomes prolonged and with it.
I devised a way, and cauterized the abscess between the gut
I remained watchful: then I went away from it, and I do not know what God did with it after me
About the incision of a boil or abscess
Chapter 7.
When a catarrh descends to the lower parts and causes an abscess, and it is large: then it is called a perpendicular abscess: and if it is in the lower part and round, then it is called a large abscess
When it is cured with what we mentioned in the previous discourse, and the cure does not take hold: and when the abscess becomes soft and quiet from it: then it is necessary to cut it open
And whatever is aggregated in a round form, which has no length, is blood, or of a dusky or black colour, and has no sensation: then it is necessary to perform an incision upon it.
There is fear of injury in such a case.
It is necessary therefore when you are treating it according to the mode which I mentioned from its whiteness and its length, that you make it sit forward from the sole: and you must grasp its tongue with an instrument, of which I have spoken: then fix the knot in one, and draw it downwards: and cut it through with one of the two instruments which I mentioned for the incision of two carpal bones.
And it is necessary not to cut through it except that which adds to the natural limit without addition
For if you cut through it more, you will wound the vessel and the marrow.
Then after the incision, use what we have mentioned in the incision of two carpal bones: and take care of it until it is healed
If however the limb remains swollen from the incision: then it is necessary to use ingenuity in its cauterization without fear and without hesitation.
And the mode of cauterization in this case is not except with acute water: and it is that you place the head of the limb in your lap.
Then grasp its tongue with the instrument which we mentioned before.
Then take from the water which I mentioned before, and mix it with burnt lime, and put it on it neither thick nor thin, and scrape from it the concavity of this instrument.
The extremities of it in which the medicine is placed are in the shape of the concavity of the cochlea of the radius.
Place the instrument with the medicine above the wound: and the patient lies with his side open, so that the moisture from his mouth may flow out from the medicine inwards, so that it does not descend into his gut, and cause him pain.
Then hold your hand with the medicine.</start_of_turn>
And from the first touch of the hand over the wound, measure for half an hour, until you perceive that the pain has subsided, and the biting of the medicine has ceased.</start_of_turn
And if you wish to take hold of the limb, and cover it with the medicine, bind the limb with the medicine, and insert the thumb with the finger into the cannula above, until the limb is firmly bound over the wound.</start_of_turn Do this many times, until you follow that you wish for cautery of the limb.</start_of_turn>
Then withdraw the medicine: for it itself will dry and fall off in three days, or four.</start_of_turn
If you think it is necessary to repeat the medicine, repeat it: and after the cautery, remove the surrounding parts of the limb with the thumb and immerse them in butter, and anoint with oil what is around the wound: and cool with cold water.</start_of_turn
And care for the outside with embroidery, and inside with gargles, until healed.</start_of_turn
Thus is this kind of treatment safer than an incision and more effective in the fear of complications.</start_of_turn>
And when the wound has healed even with the medicine which is finer than cautery and incision: it is healed by fumigation, according to this method.</start_of_turn
Take calamine, and hyssop, and origanum, and rue, and sassafras, and chamomile, and wormwood, and similar herbs: and mix them all together, or some of them in a pot, and immerse them in vinegar, and boil: and cover the pot with a lid: and there should be a hole in the middle of the pot, above which the instrument is placed in this way.</start_of_turn
Let air or silver issue forth: and let the extremity be introduced into that which contains the pomegranate, until the vapor rises up to the mouth of the cannula, until the mouth becomes very dark.
Then proceed over the much, until it boils over.</start_of_turn>
Take heed, do not perform this treatment at the beginning of an attack of apoplexy.</start_of_turn>
Indeed let some of the powder be added to the apoplexy: and it is not fitting that you should do this except when the apoplexy is in a state of cooling down.</start_of_turn
If, however, this instrument is not at hand, then take a tube and insert in its extremity a piece of resin or pitch: that it may not burn the bone of the patient: for the resin or pitch will prevent the vapor from burning the bone: and this is a good treatment with safety.</start_of_turn>

And that which does not appear to you and is hidden in the gut, you must make the patient vomit before the food is digested in the stomach.</start_of_turn
Perhaps therefore also the thing annexed will go out with the vomit.</start_of_turn
Or the patient may swallow down a piece of poppyseed, or the root of licorice, or swallow down a dry breadcrumb: or take up a dry piece of sponge-wool and bind it up, then swallow it down.</start_of_turn
When the bone or spine has been reached and is extracted, it then departs. If it does not depart with the former as we said: then use a lead instrument according to this fashion.
Let it be thicker than the Radius of a lesser diameter, and at its extremity let there be a curve which intrudes into its gut with ease: and let it itself have its head elevated upwards.
Beware of its touch to the epiglottis, so that it does not cause it to swell, and drive it forward with the bone, the spine, or let the physician introduce it himself with his hand.
Truly that the patient intrudes it, this is better: because of his knowledge of the place of the annexed thing: and he drives downwards, or pulls his hand with the instrument upwards, all this according to the quantity which is prepared for him, until it departs
Of the extraction of the blood-sucker
Chapter XXXIX.
When the physician treats the blood-sucker with what I have said in the instruction for the cure alongside the physicians, and it does not suffice, then consider in the gut of the patient under the sole of the tongue, or beyond the tongue after having grasped its tongue with the instrument which I mentioned
If your hand slips from the blood-sucker, extract it with a small hook, or with fine graspings from under.
If this is not possible with these instruments: then grasp a funnel with a wide neck, and introduce the bone into the gut of the patient up to the gut: then introduce a needle with fire at the end into the funnel
Do this often: and let the patient abstain from all water throughout the day.
Then he shall take a full measure of cold water and open the mouth of the patient in it: and he shall join his jaw with it and not swallow anything from it: and he shall drink water an hour after the other with his hand.
The bloodsucker will go away as soon as he feels the water falling.
If he does not go away when we tell him to, then we shall fumigate the patient with sponges, or with an instrument as I told you in the fumigation of the ulcer
Do this many times, for it itself departs.
And the manner of operation in fumigation is that you take oil in which there are dates with fire: and the vessel be covered with a cover, in the middle of which there is a hole: and make in that hole the extremity of the instrument.
Then he throws the fumigation and places the patient's jaw at the extremity of the tube and closes the jaw, so that it does not escape the fumigation, until you know that the fumigation has passed to the bloodsucker
For the bloodsucker immediately departs.
If it does not depart, then repeat the fumigation many times.
And the patient will tolerate sitting and eating garlic and onions, and he will not drink water. It is necessary therefore that he depart with this regimen.
And this is the fashion of the instrument with which the bloodsucker is extracted from the gut when it falls over the vomit.
It is like tweezers, as for example: except that it has this curvature which enters the gut

The abscess is near the main limb: for if you delay the perforation of the latter, until it matures, it will either burst itself or through that main limb.
The abscess is near the limb: for if you delay the perforation of the latter until it matures, it will either burst itself or through that limb You must know the time of perforation of the abscess, for it has matured according to the completion of its complement: and it is in the cessation of pain, reduction of fever, and decrease of redness, and pulse, and intensity of the head of the abscess: and the rest of the signs. You must make the perforation in a lower place of the abscess, and of greater prominence: and let the perforation be wide in length throughout the body, if the abscesses are in the parts of the hands and feet, and places of laceration, and strings, and nerves, and arteries, and finally in all places equally, in which there is no reflection
But in those which reflect, proceed with the perforation according to that limb.
When the abscess is in a place of carnis: then it is better to delay the perforation of the latter until its digestion is confirmed, as we said according to the complement
For if you perforate the latter before that, the course of the disease is prolonged, and there is much pain and suffering, and perhaps it bursts through its lips, and its depth.
And some abscesses are perforated throughout the body for necessity: or according to that which is needed of the limb.
And you must manage in small abscesses a moderate perforation, and in large abscesses a wide perforation: or multiple sections according to the similarity of the size of the abscess
There are also from apostematibus, in which it is necessary that the skin should be gathered: and it happens when it has been made like a cloth, and has been made at the end, when it has already died: as it happens with many things, as with wounds and boils.
And there are also those which are severed with a section having three angles.
And there are also those which happen like the shape of a myrtle leaf
Like a heel wound
And there are also those in which an round section and a lunar section are administered: and similar to these are sections in general.
That which has no head, like are superficial lenient wounds, must be pierced through with a superficial perforation, or only planed
And it must be, when the wound is great and has collected much blood, that you perforate it, so that you do not leave it and draw out the whole pus at once: better to take out a part of it from it itself
Then anoint the wound until the next day.
Then draw out some of the pus again.
Do this many times according to the degree, until the patient is healed: especially if the patient is weak in spirit, or a pregnant woman, or a young child, or an old man who is decrepit: for the spirit of the animal is resolved with the evacuation of the pus: and perhaps the patient will die, and you will not know it
Therefore take heed of this chapter, for it gives great care
And after you have perforated the wound, which is what you do to the wounds, you must remove the clot: and be careful
If there is a small fistula of the apostematis, either perform a plane section or administer lead from an old vessel.
If the apostema is large and there are many holes in the perforation, it is necessary to insert lead into every hole until it reaches the bottom
If you have cut away a piece of skin from the apostema or have cauterized around its circumference: then you must apply an old vessel or as much lint as when lancets are removed, or you should smear it with lanolin without moisture: and keep it tight until the third day.
Then remove it and care for it with what is necessary from the unguent until it heals
If however blood flows at your operation in your hour: then administer cold water and vinegar, after it has been drunk on a piece of bread: and put it over the place of the blood flow many times over
If the bleeding persists: then it is necessary to administer regimen, care and powders, which I have mentioned in many places of this book, and from experience.
If it is in the winter and the place of the apostema is full of nerves: then it is necessary to infuse sponges with wine and warm oil: and put them over the place.
And if it is in the summer and the place is fleshy: then it is necessary to put sponges soaked in water and oil, or in wine and oil, and all of this cold
Until then, as we have said, on the third day you must remove the apostema, drain it, and administer to it what is good for it until it heals
This is everything that is necessary for the knowledge of the treatment of apostemata in general
According to the passage of the wound without distinction, as I have said concerning every apostemate, how is the way to its cure capitulated singly.
According to the passage of the wound without distinction, as I have said concerning every apostemate, how is the way to its cure capitulated singly.
The head of the wound is at XLI.
Small apostemata occur in the head of the wound and are of the kind of knots which contain tunics, which are like sacks: as if they were chickens' eggs
There are many kinds of them
Some are fat: some contain moisture like mud: some contain moisture like blood clots and pus: some are like those, and some are like stones
And in the section of all of them, and in their extraction, there is no fear, as long as during their section it does not make an artery hostile.
The operation in the section of these is to learn them with the instrument which comes after this, which is called Intromissum, until you know what it contains
For if it contains moisture, then dry it out with the superficial section: in this form
And begin with the section from line b to line g. When the moisture has been evacuated, then remove the knot which contains it, and do not leave anything behind
There are many of them which return if anything is left behind Then immerse the head in Egyptian unguent if it is present: and if not, in water and salt: and press it with a willow twig, and leave it until another day.
The wound eats away what remains of the cyst. Repeat over the wound with the second and third fingers, and if you find that it does not yield, continue until you are confident that nothing remains of the cyst, and then indeed cure the wound with oil until it is healed
If there is a fatty node remaining in the wound: then dry the wound according to this fashion, making a section in the shape of a cross: and bring out the nails between the two layers of the section, and cleanse the wound from all sides: and attempt your skill in extracting the membrane which contains it.
If, however, there is resistance from an artery, then do that which I shall tell you afterwards.
And in the case of a stone in the wound, do the same by section and treatment as before The section of a stone in the wound is easier: because there is little blood and moisture.
And sometimes there are some wounds of this kind which are in the head of some people, in which there is no humidity.
Or make the perforation of them always from the lower part upwards, so as to aid the flow of healing downwards.
Then care for it with whatever is suitable for it from the care.
Then care for it with whatever is suitable for it from the care of the throat
Chapter 42.
Many of these swellings occur in the throat, under the armpits, and in the groin: and sometimes in the rest of the body.
And concerning those which occur in the throat, there is one kind, and many: and they are generated from a single cause: for every Strophula originates from its own tunic, as in the nodes and swellings of the head, as we have stated
And there are many kinds of these swellings
And from these things there are fat ones: and there are those which hold moisture: and there are malignant ones, which do not obey treatment
In this way, if there are good-dispositioned liquids in the touch, whose mark is the proximity of the colour of the skin, and which move to every part, and are not connected with the nerves of the throat, neither with the gullet nor the arteries, nor is it deep: it is necessary to section it superficially from the upper part to the lower part of the body from the line A to line B, and to excise the skin from all sides: and to spread out two lips of the skin with one finger, or with many fingers, if necessary, as we have said concerning the swellings of the head, and to extract it slowly.
And it is necessary to be cautious not to damage the bone, or the nerve
And the sponge should not be acutely pointed: so as not to add your hand to the incision, or to frighten the patient, and to cut what is not necessary
If, however, you cut a vein, or an artery, or are hindered by the operation, then put in the wound a lump of charcoal, or some powders which bleed, and tighten the wound, and let it go, until the pain subsides after the operation, and the wound is softened: or else it will begin to putrefy.
Or else blood will be shed too much for the operation, and will return to the operation before it is complete.</start_of_turn>
Then take care of yourself.</start_of_turn>
If the trocar is completely cut, then you must gather together the two lips of the wound: and hold them in place immediately, after you have washed because if you do not there will remain excess.</start_of_turn
If indeed there remains excess blood because of the greatness of the trocar, then you must extend to the cutting of its root and extract it: and administer a suture as we have said.</start_of_turn
And what remains of the trocars should be moistened, perforate it with a superficial perforation: so that you may see the seat of its maturity: and put the perforation from below what follows the body, as we have said.</start_of_turn
Then administer after the perforation lint with unguent, and like this, remove what remains of the corruption, until when blood has become softened: then take care of yourself with the unguent of generation of flesh, until it is healed.</start_of_turn
On the excision of the epiglottis from the apostemate within the guttur by chance.
On the excision of the epiglottis from the apostemate within the guttur by chance.
They say that the ancients performed this excision of the epiglottis, and none of them in our land have been able to do so: and this is the account of the elders.
However, in acute cases of synanchiam, it is necessary to excise the epiglottis: because without it there is no remedy for the pain: for all the veins and the lung are diseased.
In these cases, where there is a hard apostemate in the mouth, or the guttur, or the two amygdales, when there is no inflammation in the canal, it is necessary to perform an excision of the epiglottis to escape from the destruction which is caused by the projection It is necessary therefore, when we wish to do this, to excise the epiglottis under three or four circles of the epiglottis, with a small section through the thickness, at that place where there is a recess between two circles, because that is the most convenient place for the excision, because it is devoid of flesh, and the blood vessels from it are long
If the physician is timid, then it is necessary to extend the skin of the guttur with a finger
Then find the skin until you reach the canal: there will be blood vessels there, if there is anything there.
Then cut the thickness as we have said: and it is signified over the section of the canal by the phlegm which comes out of it, when it is ruptured, and by the cutting of the vein.
And withdraw the wound open for a while at some time.
When the hour has passed in which the focus is complete, gather two lips of the wound together and sew them alone without cartilage.
Then apply medicines which cause the flesh to grow back until the wound is healed.
Albucasis says.
This is all that Albucasis says about the matter which we have mentioned: that when some part of the body has become gangrenous and the patient is still conscious, the physician should immediately cut through the swelling to prevent the patient from suffocating: for as long as the swelling persists, life hangs in the balance. Therefore they order the wound to be opened until the mischief of the disease has passed away, which mischief commonly lasts for three days and is like itself: then indeed do they order the wound to be sutured up again, and to care for it until it is healed.</start_of_turn>
And this, which I have just seen myself, happened that a maidservant took a knife and put it into her mouth, and it went into a part of her windpipe.
I was called to care for her, and I found her foaming at the mouth, just as one who is dead.</start_of_turn>
I saw that from the wound blood had flowed out.
I am confident that if she had not been cut open she would have died, neither could I discover any wound: and the wind was coming out of the wound.</start_of_turn
I treated her accordingly, and closed up the wound, and cared for her until she was healed: and the maidservant suffered no further harm, except for the wound in her mouth: and she recovered after three days to her former health.</start_of_turn
Hence it is said: there is no fear in the section of the epiglottis.
Hence it is said: there is no fear in the section of the epiglottis.
Chapter XLIV.
This section is called the hernia gutturis, which is a large swelling, according to the colour of the body: and it is very common in women
And it is according to two modes: either it is natural: or it is accidental In the natural one there is certainly no malice.
The accidental one, however, is according to two modes: one of which is like a swelling of fat nodules
The other mode is like a swelling from the bursting of an artery
And in this there is fear, and it is not right to assume that it is like that with the steel, except in that case where it is slight: and you must try it and investigate it with the intestines.
If you find it like a fat nodule, and there is no suspicion of any other vessel: then dry it out, just as you would cut away a nodule: and extract it with that which contains the swelling, if there is one: and if not, then to search all around it
Then care for the place with that which is necessary for the cure, until it is healed
Hence it is said: there is no fear in the section of the epiglottis
Chapter XLV There are many kinds of nodules, and I have mentioned all of them in the enumeration: and it is necessary to know the difference between a node and an extrusion when there is doubt I say therefore, when the evacuation is complete, warmth, fever, and pain cease until the superabundance of humours is dissipated, and decay is completed: then indeed fever and heat subside.
When the abscess is evacuated, neither warmth, nor fever, nor pain remain, until the humours are perfectly balanced, which is the natural state of the body: and this is the cause of the cicatrix and the bathes, which are greater and less.
There are two kinds: either dry or moist
The colours of moisture are many, as I have said previously It is necessary therefore, when one proceeds to the treatment of the abscess, to test it, and to inquire about it at first with the instrument which is called the Intromissum, according to the form of which will be described later.
The way to inquire about the abscess, and of all abscesses, is to take this instrument and introduce it into the moist place which you find in the abscess: and withdraw your fingers gradually until you know that the instrument has pierced the skin
Then lastly touch the hand according to the measure of the abscess.
Then withdraw the Intromissum, and consider what comes out through its wound
If therefore moisture comes out running of any colour: then dry it superficially, as I have said of other abscesses
If not, you know that it is dry: dry it therefore superficially with a section having the shape of a cross, as it has been taught you: and bind it with ligatures, and scrape away the skin from all sides with ease: and keep the abscess if you are able, until you have evacuated it whole
If, however, the bladder is ruptured during the operation, and it is not possible to extract it whole, much the same happens in this case, then extract it piecemeal until nothing remains of it.
Or if anything remains of it, even a little or a lot, the procedure returns to the beginning according to the majority of people
If it causes you to doubt, and anything remains of it, then place a sponge wet with corrosive powders on the completion of your work: and bind the sponge, and place above it what rests upon the soft cushion, and care for it with the rest of the treatment until it heals
If there is a large node, then two of its lips must be opened, and care for it with that which enters it. If, however, there is a swelling of the bone or which is not pulsating: then straighten it out, and place a dressing over the wound, and leave it loose for two or three days, until the sponge putrefies and the boiling of the blood subsides: then return to the work which remains from the Node.
About the instruments outside which are for section and perforation.
Chapter XLVII.</start_of_turn>
From these there are three forms of instruments which are introduced, and there are three kinds.</start_of_turn>
From these there is a large one, and a medium one, and a small one.</start_of_turn
Let them be of iron, rounded at the extremities and flattened in the middle, so that they may hasten the entrance into the bladder.</start_of_turn
And these are the forms of the instruments of those who have experience, and no, that is, perforators: and one of them is called the beris, that is, the perforator, and there are three kinds.</start_of_turn
From the inside outwards is great, medium, and small.
The structures extend from the center outwards, namely bones, joints, exits, fistulas and abscesses
They are round, triangular, blunt like a large needle which bites under the skin, from lemon juice indeed, or from air, or iron, or silver. The best of them are those that are made from lemon juice.
There is also experience with black lead which comes together so that they may perceive fistulas through their reflection, which are reflected with their smoothness against those reflections.
There are three kinds of them. For indeed from the inside outwards are great, medium, and small according to the quantity of the diameter of the fistula and the degree of its constriction The shapes of these are diverse, and there are many kinds of them. For indeed from the inside outwards are simple, that is to say those which have only one curvature: and there are three kinds of them like liquids, great, medium, and small
And from the inside outwards are blind neighbours: and there are three kinds of them
And from the inside outwards are nails having two curvatures, and there are three kinds of them: and those which have three curvatures, and there are three kinds of them: all of them are necessary in their place
These are the forms of scalpels with which one severs and excoriates nodes and abscesses: and there are three kinds of them for indeed from the inside outwards are great, medium and small.
Their extremities which are for the cutting are acute, the other extremities are not acute: and they are not placed thus, except when there is an intention to make an incision in the nerve or vein, and to cause an abrasion of the node at the same time, and in order to cure the patient and bring him peace rather than to aggravate the inflammation of the abscess
These are Magda, and are three in number.
These are Magda, and are three in number.
The shape of the sponges which go between the fingers at the perforation of the apostem: these are not perceived by the patient. There are three kinds, large, medium, and small.
The shape of the sponges which absorb the flow of blood: these are three kinds, large, medium, and small.
Let them be of air or citrine, round, of equal length somewhat like liquids: and they must be firm.
And it is necessary that these kinds of sponges should be both large and small: in order to absorb the blood with speed when necessary, and then again when it is not necessary for the physician to be present
But do not use them for the absorption of blood in every part of the body, and do not use them except in places where there is carnation: such as for wounds of the leg, and hip, and wounds of the arm, and breast, and belly, and groin, and similar wounds of carnation, wetness
And sometimes other small things like sponges, similar to the cortices of fists, are used for the absorption of blood when it flows from the site of phlebotomy, or at the incision of a vein or artery: and sometimes they are round like this form.
Concerning the care of the breasts of women who suckle the breasts of their children.
Chapter XLVII.
When the breasts of some men swell somewhat during the night (that is to say, when they begin to become soiled during sleep) until they resemble the breasts of women: and they remain with the nipples hardened.
Whoever abominates at this thing should cut across the breast with a lunar section, according to this form from the line A to the line G. Then scrape away the fat completely
After that, the physician must extract the stone from the body.
Then he must join together the two lips of the wound with sutures, and care for it until it heals.</start_of_turn>
If, however, the breast inclines downwards and is softened by its size, as is the case with women: then it is necessary to find two points on the two upper sides of the breast, similar in shape to a crescent moon, and join each one to the other at the ends so that one line is greater than the other, following the form from the line, b. to the line, g. Then, after that, scrape the skin between the two lips and remove the fat, and administer what has been said concerning the sutures and powders, which is necessary for the cure, until it heals.</start_of_turn>
If, however, you do not wish to make an incision because of the patient's anxiety or because of the flow of blood: then you must extract the stone under the skin with corrosive unguent, and let it go, until that which remains of the fat has corroded.</start_of_turn
Then care for it until it heals.</start_of_turn>
As for the perforation of the kidney, which happens under the rib.</start_of_turn
Chapter XLVIII.</start_of_turn These kidneys which happen under the rib are of the kind called Strophularia dura, which contain a bladder, and from these are the humdities which proceed.</start_of_turn
Which are from the humdities which contain moisture, must be sectioned in a crescent shape, following the form from the line b. to the line g., and when all that is in the kidney is evacuated from the blood, then extract the stone from the kidney, and let it go until another day.</start_of_turn
Then the heel is raised up, and cared for with a suitable unguent until it heals.
If the heel were of the kind of knots called Strophulas, then it should be cut above that, as we mentioned in the section on Strophulas that are equal
If, however, a swelling extends in this way as to emit pus, then administer cauterium in it, according to what we mentioned previously in this respect.
Concerning the section of the heel which happens because of the artery and the vein.
Chapter XLIX.
When the artery is ruptured, and the skin above it is consolidated, then there is a great swelling of the heel in this way: and in the same way there is swelling in the veins also, as in this heel and swelling.
And the signs by which it is known that the heel swelling and swelling are because of the artery and vein, are these: because when the heel is swollen because of the artery, it is long, aggregated in the depth of the body: and when the covering of the heel is grasped by the fingers, it feels as though there is a constriction there
And that which is because of the vein, is rounded in the manifest body.
And the section of this heel is an error, and especially under the heel bone, and the ankle bone, and the throat, and in many parts of the body: and it is very dangerous
It is necessary therefore that its care be taken with iron, and that it be taken out from the extremities, or from the head, for in all these places.
For concerning that which is from the swelling of the opening of the artery, find in the cut in the length on the surface of the heel.
Then open the part with hooks, afterwards the Artery: and free it from the tunic until it is detached.
Then introduce the hook under that [tissue], and make the incision pass through to the other side, and bind the Artery with a doubled thread in two places, as you have been taught in the extraction of two Arteries which are in the flanks
Then puncture the place which is between the two ligaments with the sponge, until the blood which is in it all comes out, and it is dissolved afterwards.
Then give attention to the formation of pus, until the ligaments are gone: afterwards care for it with suitable unguents until it is healed.
If there should be a swelling on account of the section of a Vein, then it is necessary that you should hold your hand as much as possible over the swelling with the skin
Then introduce the hook under the place where you held your hand, and make the incision: and there be in it a doubled thread, until you draw it out from the other side.
Then bind with it the swelling with a strong ligament: according to what I have told you concerning the ligation of the veins, from two parts with two extremities of thread. If however you think that the thread is to be drawn out, then introduce another hook with another thread under the whole swelling at the incision of the needle: beforehand, and bind your thread in four places.
Then dry the swelling in the middle of it, until when it comes out what is in it: then cut away the excess of the skin, and let go what is bound from it
Then put over it a little powder which you have submerged in wine, and oil.
Then give attention to the treatment which is done with liniments and unguents, until it is healed
Of the swelling which happens from the twisting of nerves.
Of the swelling which happens from the twisting of nerves.
As in the case of swelling which happens in an artery or vein, in the same way swelling can happen in nerves: which can happen either through percussion or from excessive labour, or from like causes: and it is most frequent in the armpits, or the calves, or in any place where there is a joining of nerves: and it is a serious swelling. It is similar in colour to the rest of the body, and is to be found in various positions without pain: and when it is squeezed with pressure, a feeling of faintness similar to that of drunkenness is perceived in it
It is not a deep-seated swelling of the body, but rather under the skin, and it moves to all parts, and does not go forward or backward, or to the rear
Since it is from the nerves which are in the joints, it does not need to be treated with iron.
Perhaps it will happen that there will be a contraction.
But in that which is from the nerves of the head, or the face, find the skin with a spatula.
If it is a slight swelling, then hold it with forceps, and cut it away from its root
If it is large, then suspend it with a thread, and remove it: then gather up the surrounding tissue, and sew it together: and take care of it until it heals.</start_of_turn>
Of the cutting away of the swelling which happens inside.</start_of_turn>
Of the cutting away of the swelling which happens inside.</start_of_turn These often happen to many people in the insides of their bodies, and in the rest of their bodies, these are called Fungae, because of their resemblance to fungi.</start_of_turn

The root is slender, the head is bulky, and the lips are closed.
And indeed I saw a man who had two boils in his belly, which were greater than any other like mushrooms: there was no difference between them, the white, the black, the large root, and their colour was dark.
I saw a man who had two boils in his belly, which were larger than any others like mushrooms. There was no difference between them, whether white, black, large or small root, and their colour was dark. I therefore cut them open, and I found in each one almost 18 ounces in one and 6 ounces in the other. And the operation of their incision is as you consider, if the patient is humidus, and the colour of the boils is white, humidum, subtilis radicis: then cut through with a spatula and there will be seen in your presence their caecum in the fire.
A great deal of blood is expelled at the incision: be careful therefore if you are inundated by blood, then cauterize it.
If you see the patient pale and timid from the incision with the iron, then take a leaden thread from the centre and tie it with it: its method is as we have said, and leave it for two days.
Then add lead in stricture.
Do not cease tying the lead until it has burst through, and has fallen without work
If the boils are large of the root, then in their incision there is something timid and fearful: especially because of what is in their belly
However, it is possible to cut through the middle of them.
Then cauterize it so that it does not return.
Then cure it so that it does not return.
And do not presume to cut that which is like a dark-blue spot, little sensation, bad aspect: for that is the head of cancer: and I shall remind you of cancer afterwards.
About the care of the navel
Chapter 52
The navel becomes prominent from many wounds
Or from cuts that are over the belly: and comes out through that or the intestines, according as it happens in other ruptures
Or from the blood which flows from the vein, or from the artery, as is reported
Or from the clotted blood in it
If however it is by a cut of the belly, and the discharge of the tumor: then is the color of the tumor similar in color to that of the body: and is soft, without pain: and appears in various places.
And if it is by the discharge of the intestines, then is its place with that which we mentioned, of greater diversity
When you touch it with your fingers, it is hidden: then it returns, and perhaps makes a sound: and swells greatly at the entrance of the bath, and great labor.
If however it is by humidity, it is soft: then it is not hidden when you touch it with your hand, neither is it compressed, neither does it adhere
Which if by blood, then appears with these signs the tumor is black like soot
If, however, it is because of meat that has died: then it is a severe, bulky, hard abscess, and it forms according to the quantity of one.
If, however, it is because of an infected wound: then its touch is gentle And the operation in that is, as you consider, if the prominence of the navel is because of blood of an artery or vein, or infection: then it is necessary to refrain from its care.
For in that is fear and danger, as I taught you in the chapter where I spoke of abscesses caused by an artery or vein.
If the prominence of the navel is because of an intestine or a tumor: then it is necessary to remove the sick part, as long as it retains its natural movement, and to leave it extended
Then signs with incisions around the whole navel.
Then command him to rest his hand over his back
Then surround with a piece of lint about the circumference of the navel over the place where you made the incision with the knife
Then extend the middle of the abscess upwards, with a large loop.
Then tie it firmly in the circumference with a strong thread, or with silk thread: and let the knot of the thread be firm.
Then open the middle of the abscess that is extended above the ligament.
If, however, you find that you have captured the gut with the ligament: then draw out the knot that is alenxoted, and introduce your finger into the gut, and push the intestine inwards: and if you find a tumor, then grasp it with a loop, and cut off its excess
If, however, the artery or vein is opposite, surround it much.
Then return to your work.
And take two needles and pass them through two strong threads: and pass two needles through the circumference which you made around the swelling like a cross, which you make penetrate.
Then tighten the swelling in four places over the needle: and if you wish, remove the needle and leave the place, until the extended flesh putrefies: and it will fall away by itself: or cut it when it subsides and putrefies.
Then care for it as you deem necessary from the unguents, until it heals.
If there is a swelling of the navel from the flesh or from moisture: then it is necessary to concave the swelling, as we have said
And extract the blood or moisture which you find in it.
Then care for it until the place is healed

I am unable to heal anyone from this: neither do I know of anyone who has preceded me who was able to do so.
The operation in this case, when the organ is positioned as we have described, is to precede and evacuate the diseased part from black bile occasionally
Then let a bloodletting be done if necessary when the swelling is obvious.
Then prepare the patient for the operation, in which the diseased part is placed alongside the operation.
Then place over the wound the nails which meet it
Then concave it from all sides with the skin, according to the prescription, until nothing remains of its roots: and let the blood flow out, and do not cut it off quickly, but rather express the place and drain all the thick blood you can, or as much as possible with the instruments
If, however, it makes the blood flow excessively from the incision of an artery or vein: then cauterize the vein, until the bleeding stops
Then care for the patient with the remaining care, until he is healed.
(The text continues with instructions on treating hydrops.)
Chapter 14.</start_of_turn>
We shall speak in this section of the different kinds of hydrops, and how water is collected: and the signs of each kind, and their treatment with physicians.</start_of_turn>
And that which is cured with iron is not except the single kind of ascites: and is not approached with iron in the kind of tympani: neither in the kind of hypospasmus: for that is deadly.</start_of_turn
When you are treated for this kind of hydrops of the tympani with the physicians, and the treatment does not suffice: then consider it.</start_of_turn
If a patient has already been affected by weakness, or is accompanied by other diseases besides Hydropsism: such as if there are tussi or solution of the intestines, and similar conditions: then do not treat him with iron.
If, however, the physician be of a robust spirit, and there be nothing besides Hydropsism: neither young nor old: then the mode of operation in such a case is that thou shalt elevate the patient upon thy hands, and the minister will express the abdomen with his hand, driving out the contents into the lower part of the belly
Then take a sponge of thorns, according to this shape.
Sit two acute angles, long, with acute extremities like a Sponge of Thorns.
There is indeed something of shortness of breath gradually present, so that thou pass not thereby through the operation until thou reach the intestines, and sealest the wound.
Consider carefully.
If indeed there is a generation of Hydropsism from the part of the intestines, then it is necessary to lengthen with a section from the navel to the amount of three fingers below the belly button
If indeed the generation of Hydropsism is on account of the disease of the liver: then thy incision shall be on the left side from the navel to the amount of three fingers.
And if the generation of it is on account of the spleen: then the incision is on the right side: and it is not necessary also that the incision should be on the side which thou wilt cause the patient to vomit, so that no excess blood flow to the delicate place.
Then perforate with the instrument the whole skin
Then introduce into that section the Sponge of Thorns, and elevate thy hand with the Sponge between the skin, and draw out, as if thou art scraping it: and the quantity which thou shalt draw out shall be equal to the quantity of a nail, or thereabouts
Then perforate the sac, until it reaches Spatumile at a void place: and that is the place of water.
Then extract it, and introduce it into the opening of the instrument, which has this shape
It is like a cannula: it is made of silver, or brass, or gold, flexible, thin: which has in its lower part a small opening, and on its sides are three holes, two from one side, and one from the other side: and its extremity is cut off, according to the manner of the cut of a needle, like water: in its upper part is an armlet
For when the instrument reaches the water, then it immediately descends over the instrument, ergo it evacuates from the water in an hour the quantity of a middle
For if you evacuate from it more than is necessary, in an hour perhaps the patient dies from the resolution of the spirit of his animal: or it happens to him fainting which approaches death.
But evacuate from it according to the quantity of its virtue, and according to what is significant to you the state of the patient from the virtue of his pulse, and from his strength
Then extract the instrument, and retain the water.
For it is retained immediately because of the skin which retains the opening which is over the sac: of which I have spoken, that you must perforate it according to the light of the mode.
Then repeat the instrument every other day, if the water tolerates the patient: and extract also from the water the quantity that is appropriate. Do this every few days without fear, and take care from error: until there remains from the water nothing but a little bit.
If however you fear the patient, and you discharge from the water a great quantity: then take care of him with burial in warm sand, and with much sweating in the bath and in the sun, and expect upon the seat: and take care of him with physicians of experience, until he is healed: and cauterize upon the stomach, and the flank, and the spleen, after the extraction of the water: according to what I have said before
Concerning the care of infants who are born in the urinary tract areas which are not perforated.
Concerning the care of infants who are born in the urinary tract areas which are not perforated. When any infant emerges from the mother's womb, and the head of the fetus is not perforated, or there is a stricture or is out of place
When any infant emerges from the mother's womb, and the head of the fetus is not perforated, or there is a stricture or is out of place, it is necessary to perform an opening immediately when it is born with a fine needle, according to this method.
Then put in the hole a small lead weight, and bind it: and keep it closed for three days, or four
When it is time for the infant to urinate, loosen it, and mix it up
Then reduce it.
And if you do not put in lead, it is possible that the urine which passes over the place will not permit it to close
The one whose opening is strict is treated with lead, as we have said, for many days, until it becomes wide open.
The one in which the opening is out of place, they are treated with lead.
Because the opening is at the end of the fetus's head: which cannot mix forward until it raises the head upwards. Neither is there any generation, for this reason, because the sperm cannot pass beyond the matrix following a straight line: and it is a grievous wound of the needle.
And the method for doing this is that the infirmant is placed over his back
Then extend the head of the fetus with your left hand with stretching, and make an incision of the head of the fetus from the groin downwards, with a needle, or with a sharp needle like a chisel, as with the cutting of a nail, or as with the root of something, so that the middle of the wound may resemble the head of the fetus: and so that the opening may be in the middle as it should be
And take care that during your operation you are protected from the flow of blood.
Much of the time this happens.
Counteract this with that which binds the blood, and take care of the wound until it is healed.
Concerning the accidents which happen in the preparation of the wound and the head of the vein, and corruption, bruising, and adhesion.
Chapter LXVI.
Many of these accidents happen in the flesh, and are the prominence of the damaged flesh
And from these there are both malignant and non-malignant things
The malignant things must be suspended with a fine thread and cut away, until the whole thing is cleansed
Then put over the wound a covered bandage in Egyptian unguent Then take care of it with fine unguent until it is healed
If the accident is malignant, dark-red in colour, then it is necessary to administer cauterium on it after the incision and to know its cause
If, however, the accident is in the head of the vein, not circumcised, and is a part of the accident which is between the preparation and that which is outside: then it is necessary to ligate the accident which is inside first, until it is consolidated, and then take care of the outside: for when you take care of the outside while neglecting the inside, the preparation will be torn away
And also in the testicles, and blackening of the preparation and corruption
You must therefore remove all that is blackened and corrupted, or that wants to corrupt
Then the line above the navel with the honey which is consumed with barley flour and trefoil herbs which are crushed.
Then care for that with the rest of the treatment until healed.
If blood flow increases, then administer the cautery with a lunar cautery, according to this form.
The cautery is applied to two positions simultaneously, namely for the blood flow and for the swelling when the flesh is corrupted
If the head of the worm is eaten away and the whole thing is destroyed in an hour: then it is necessary to introduce lead into the meat of the worm so that the diseased part may mix with the wound above the wound
In the adherence of the belly with the head of the worm, and these adnexions do not take place except in that case where the belly is sound and the surrounding area does not require excision: and when these adnexions happen because of a wound or swelling: it is necessary to strip away the wound with blunt spatula until the ligament is severed and the head of the worm is freed from all parts.
If it is difficult to discern these subtleties, then it is necessary to strip away something from the head of the worm and from the belly
For the belly is subtle, perhaps it is perforated because of its slightness or quickly
Then separate the belly from the head of the worm with a fine linen cloth which has been made wet in cold water, so that they do not adhere again
Then care for it with vinegar plaster, until it heals. About the care of infants, and the treatment of errors and accidents.
Chapter LVII.
Circumcision is not a solution for the continuity of things like other wounds: however, when it is done by our operation, by our will, and when its use is in children of their own kind, it is necessary that we sign that we have done this operation for the better, and that we have not diminished the pain to the patient.
I say, that the ancients did not speak of circumcision in any of their books: for they did not use it in their laws, and there is no reason except that we have learned through experience.
Because I have found that the greatest part of artifices, and of phlebotomists, consists in making incisions with a knife and with scissors: and that they use ligatures with thread and needles, and make incisions with nails.
I have also tried all these methods, and I have not found a better way of making the wound than with scissors, and of tying up with thread.
For in making the wound with a knife, much skin is driven away.
For the skin of the prepuce has two tunics: therefore perhaps the upper skin is split, and the lower tunic is threatened: it is therefore necessary to make an incision in order to split the other, and to avoid future pain
And when the making of the wound is done by the fingers, that is, by the nails of the fingers, as the surgeons do, the incision is not secured at the extremity of the member: for perhaps it will enter through its hole
And in making the wound with a nail, perhaps the iron will slip, and will spoil your work: and the skin of the child is short in nature, and many are made like this, which does not befit the making of the wound: I say this indeed
But with the making of the wound with scissors, and the tying up with thread, I have found a good experiment: for the scissors are proportional to the incision: therefore, as the height which is above is like that which is below.
When you have done with your hand, the two acute angles proportion themselves, and they occur according to one operation in one time: and there is a compression similar in figure, containing the skin of the wound from every part, so that no error is left out.
The proper method of the operation is to make an excision, especially for the puerulus, if there is one who understands it well, because you must not leave it unless you ligate the thread in its place: and you dismiss it until another day.
Then make him rejoice and be glad in every way possible from this which he receives with his understanding.
Then insert your hand into the wound and blow on the skin, and draw it up, until the head of the wound comes out.
Then wipe away that which is gathered in that cavity.
Then ligate the marked place with double thread
Then ligate the lower part somewhat more loosely than the upper ligament Then hold with your index finger and thumb the place of the lower ligament securely, and cut between the two ligaments.
Then raise the skin up quickly, and pull out the head of the wound
Then let the blood run slowly (for it is better thus) and put powder on top: and put a bandage over the swelling which has occurred in the wound, which has been boiled in fresh water: and dismiss it over it until the next day: and care for the rest of the cure until it is healed
The shape of the knife for this purpose is like this.
There are two cutting edges at the extremities, and the handles: do not extend beyond the root of the claw: and let the length of the two edges be equal to the length of two thumbs together
Indeed, a falling away of the skin within is possible: for perhaps the entire intrinsic skin or a part of it has escaped at the incision. Therefore it is necessary to extend your hand with your finger before the retraction of the place: and make the incision according to the equality.
If you are unable to hold the hand with your finger, then extract the hand with the thumb, and make the incision
If, however, more than three days have passed, and what is under the swelling remains inflated, retract it: then loosen that which is swollen, and cleanse it easily, and make the incision as before: and be careful from the head of the swelling downwards.
It will not cause any harm to it.
Treat it like that which consolidates a wound from dust, as we have said in the treatise on dust: and if it happens from the skin above the measure, and goes up towards the higher parts, it does it no harm either
Treat it like that which we have said, until it is healed
On the extraction of a retained limb in a swelling.
Chapter 58
The retention of urine in the bladder is caused by a stone, or frozen blood, or pus, or native flesh, or like these things from the things which we have said concerning the methods of treatment in the case of a swelling.
If the bladder does not yield and the retention is attributed to a stone in the neck of the bladder, then it is necessary that it be flexed over its knee.
The legs are then flexed over the back, the belly is pulled down from the upper part of the back, and the painful area is grasped as much as possible
It is thought that thus, with the neck of the bladder turned backwards, the stone will be expelled: whereupon the bladder is relaxed
If it does not yield even thus, and if there remains something above the painful area: then it is necessary to draw it out with an instrument called a siringa, which is like a silver needle, fine and flexible, like a quill of a bird in the thickness of a barleycorn, with a fine needle at its head.
The way to drain the bladder is as follows: take a doubled thread and tie a knot at its extremity, either wool or cotton, a good ligation. Insert the extremity of the thread into the lower part of the siringa. Then pierce with scissors if anything remains of the wool, but really insert into the needle with force, like a thrust.
Then wash the siringa with oil, or butter, and vinegar. Make the patient sit on a chair, and support the bladder, and insert the needle with oil, olive oil, and warm water.
Insert the siringa into the bladder with ease, until it reaches the root of the bladder.
Then double the thread over the upper part of the belly. Then push the siringa into the bladder until it reaches the bladder wall, and the patient feels that the painful area has been relieved: do not do this in any other way, except when the pain is in the area where there is a curvature
Then extend the thread gradually with wool.
The thread follows the wool gradually.
Then draw out the thread, and make the urine run through the bladder: and repeat the needle, and do not desist from doing this until the bladder is evacuated and the patient experiences relief. Concerning the quality of the bladder with Clepshydra.
Chapter 59.</start_of_turn>
It is blunt, that is, closed.</start_of_turn
And there are three holes in it, two from one side and one from the other side, like urine.</start_of_turn
And the burnished area, in which that which drives it lies, should be according to the quantity which it desires without addition, until when it is drawn with it something is attracted from the humilities: and when it is driven out with it at length: according to what the Clepshydra does, which throws out pitch, that is, Greek fire in the battles.</start_of_turn
When therefore urine is thrown out from the bladder, introduce the extremity of the Clepshydra into the urine, and draw out with it what drives, and the urine is drawn into the concavity of the Clepshydra.</start_of_turn Then introduce its extremity into the bladder, according to what we have said concerning the needle.</start_of_turn
Then drive moisture with that which drives it; for moisture persists at the site immediately, as the ailing man feels. Form a soft enema so that the uterus is cleansed.
Then insert the strong thread firmly through those holes, as they are rolled up Then gather the circle, as is done with wool: when you have put in it that which you wish from moisture, and oil, and water.
Then bind it with an instrument: and do it like when you expressed the uterus with your hand, until the moisture reaches the uterus.
On the extraction of the Stone.
Chapter LX. We have spoken in the preceding discourse concerning the kinds of Stone and their treatment by physicians: and we have mentioned the difference between a Stone generated in the bowels and the uterus, and the signs of the whole: and we have mentioned the Stone in which the operation is performed with the hand and incision: and this is a Stone generated in the uterus itself: and that which is formed in the belly: and I am going to speak of this with manifest explanation and abbreviation.
I say therefore, that the stone which is generated in the bladder, happens mostly to children.
And from its signs it is known that the urine comes out of the bladder like water in its consistency: and there appears in it white sand, and it irritates the painful area of the bladder and works with it, and it hangs about many times And then it is raised up, and comes out with it the anus in many cases.
And it is easy to heal the children of it, from which until the age of fourteen years passes.
And it is difficult in old age.
In youth, however, it is middle-aged, in which there is between the two: and the greater the stone, the easier the cure: and if small, the less is its care.
When we come to the treatment, it is necessary at first to purge the sick person with a cathartic, which will extract all the stool that is in its intestines: which indeed often hinders the finding of the stone in the inquiry Then the sick person should be taken with his feet, and be shaken, and moved downwards: so that the stone may descend to the depth of the bladder, or come out from a high place somewhat.
Then let him sit down between your hands prepared, and your hands be under his hips, so that the bladder may be completely descended downwards
Then inquire about him, and touch him externally.
If you feel the stone in the space, then act immediately with a section above it
If it does not come under your touch at all, then you must remove the index finger with the left hand, if the patient is a child: or the middle finger if he is grown up: and introduce it into his rectum, and inquire about the stone, until it is under your finger: and gently move it to the neck of the bladder
Then first above all with your finger touch the exterior of the locus towards which you will make the incision: and command one minister to keep the vulva of your hand in place, and command another minister to extend the testicles of your hand to the exterior: and another hand to move the skin which is beneath the testicles in the part from the locus to the place where the incision is to be made.
Then insert the sponge into the wound, whose form is like this.</start_of_turn>
And find in that [wound] what is between the testicles and the anus, and not in the middle, on the left side of the navel: and let the incision be above the great toe, and your finger be in the anus: and make a transverse incision, so that the external incision is wide and the internal incision is narrow, as much as is possible so that there should be no egressio of the bone from that which is not greater.</start_of_turn>
Perhaps therefore the finger which is in the anus will be compressed by the bone at the incision and will go out without difficulty.</start_of_turn>
And you know that from the bone there are angles and margins which make its exit difficult because of that.</start_of_turn
And from that [bone] is soft, like a gland, and round: and makes its exit easy.</start_of_turn
Therefore for those which have angles and margins, add to the fissure.</start_of_turn
That if it does not go out like that, then you must know how to manage above all: or you will bind over it with a dressing which is like the moon, which will bind over the bone and not slip from it: or that you will introduce under it an instrument which is fine and flexible at its extremity.</start_of_turn
If however you are unable above with these things, then enlarge the opening a little more.</start_of_turn
If anything from the blood should trouble you, cut it off with a knife.
If there is more than one bone, then push in the first one to the hip bone first.
Then cut through it
Then push out the small one after that: do the same if there are more than two
If the large one is above, then ignorance is for it to cut above with a large section
For in a sick person either two things happen: or he dies, or there is an excessive concentration of urine: because the place is not solidified anywhere.
True is to give him an enema until it comes out: or to make an incision in his fracture with shears, until you have extracted him frustrated
When you have finished your operation, then put on a bandage, and aloe, and dragon's blood: and bind it up, and put over it a soaked sponge with oil and wine, or rose-water and cold water: so that the wound will be cool
Then rest the sick man on his side, and do not tighten the ligaments, until the third day
When you have finished with it, embroider the place with water, and much oil.
Then care for him with ointment of dyafinicon, and ointment of basilicon, until he is healed.
If, however, in the wound there is added a cold abscess, and pus, and similar things: thus also if blood is congealed in the bladder, and is prohibited from coming out: and it is known by the discharge of blood with the urine.
Insert your finger into the wound, and extract the clot of blood.
If it remains [of the wound], it promotes corruption of the cavity and its putrefaction.
Then wash the wound with vinegar, vinegar, water, and salt: and oppose all things which concur with this which is useful for the cure, until it is healed.</start_of_turn>
It is necessary in the course of treatment at every hour, that you join two thighs together, and bind them, because of the things which the physicians place upon the place.</start_of_turn>
If the stone is small, and is in the cavity of the bladder, and is fixed in it, and hinders the passage of urine: then treat it with that which I have mentioned before until you reach the section.</start_of_turn
Many are excused from the section because of this treatment, for I have proved it.</start_of_turn And it is necessary to take a perforator of iron, which is shaped like a triangle with acute extremities, fixed in wood.</start_of_turn
Then take a thread, and bind with it the bladder under the stone so that it does not return to the cavity.</start_of_turn
Then introduce the perforating iron into the bladder with ease, until the perforator reaches the stone: and withdraw the perforator slowly from the stone: and make the perforation of it, until you make it penetrate from the other side.</start_of_turn
The urine will immediately cease.</start_of_turn>
Then press your hand over that which remains from the stone from the exterior part of the bladder.</start_of_turn
It will itself break, and go out with the urine, and the infirm person will be healed.</start_of_turn
But if you do not prepare this treatment for him because of something which hinders it: then bind a thread under the stone, and a thread above the stone.</start_of_turn Then dry above the stone in the very vessel between two ligatures.
Then extract it.
Afterwards suture the ligament and bind the frozen blood which forms in the wound
And it is not necessary to pass a thread under the stone, except that it should not go back into the cavity: and another ligament must be passed above, except when the thread is withdrawn after the stone has gone, so that the skin should return to its place and cohere with the wound: for this reason it is necessary for you to pass the thread above when you elevate the skin to its proper position, so that the skin may return to its place along with the completion of your work, and cohere with the wound, as we have said.
On the extraction of a stone from a woman
Chapter LX.
Stones are rarely formed in women
If, however, it should happen to any of them to have a stone, then its cure is difficult, and is forbidden by many methods.
One of them is: a woman may perhaps be a vessel. And the second is that you will not find a woman who will confess to the doctor that she has a stone when she is chaste, or from her husbands.
The third is that you will not find a woman who is well-skilled in this art, especially in performing surgery with her hand
And the fourth is the distance of the stone from the place: because it requires a deep incision, and there is fear of that
If necessity compels you to do this, then you must take a medical woman, who is well-skilled: and few are found
If you prefer beforehand, then seek a skilled physician, subtle, and present a woman obstetrician who is well-learned in matters concerning women, or a woman who has learned a part of this art: do this immediately, and particularly tell her to do everything that is prescribed to her from the inquiry concerning the stone. Firstly, if she is a girl, let her insert a finger into her belly and search for the stone.</start_of_turn>
If she finds it, she should grasp it under her finger and then command the obstetrician to insert her finger into the lower part of her belly and inquire about the stone, after she has placed her left hand over the waist and applied good pressure.</start_of_turn> If she finds the stone, she should gradually move it from the opening of the uterus towards the lower parts with all her skill, until she has brought it down to the root of the hip bone.</start_of_turn>
Then she should cut above it at the middle of the belly near the root of the hip bone from whichever side is most convenient for her, and she will feel the stone in that place: and do not move your finger from the stone, holding it tightly under it: and make a small incision at first.</start_of_turn>
And then insert a needle over that incision.</start_of_turn>
If she feels the stone, then add to the incision according to the quantity that the stone comes out with.</start_of_turn
And know that there are many kinds of stones.</start_of_turn> Among them are small and large, smooth and rough, long and round having a branch.</start_of_turn
You know well the sort of it; for this indicates by this above what you desire.
If blood boils up, then add in the armpit some unguents, and keep it for an hour, until the blood is separated.
If blood flows too much, and you know that the evacuation of blood comes from the artery that has been cut: then put powder over the place, and bind it with threads of the thickness of a barleycorn: and do not stop it: and let the stone go, and do not pull it out
Perhaps the woman is weak.
Then care for the wound
When the pain of the wound has subsided after a few days, and the place is putrefying, then return to the operation until the stone comes out.
Of the incision for a herniated belly-ache filled with liquid.
Chapter XII.
The swelling of the belly is not from water, except for the gathering of moisture in the white membrane under the testicles which contain eggs: and it is called a hernia And when it is in its own sac in the belly, which nature has prepared for it in the part of the testicles until it is full: that is an egg, and is the membrane of the testicles between the white membrane which we mentioned: and it does not happen except rarely
And the generation of this swelling is from the weakness which happens to the testicles: whereupon this matter flows out to them
And when it happens from a blow upon the testicles.
And this humidity has many colors. Or it is of the color of the setting sun, or it is a reddish-brown, or greenish, black, or white, and the like is more
For if it is in the white swelling which we mentioned, then the swelling is round about the length like the figure of a pine tree: and the testicle does not appear, because the humidity contains it from all sides
And if the humidity is in the testicles themselves, then the swelling is round with a part like that of a pine tree, and on account of this the man knows that there is another one
And if the humidity is between the skin of the testicles and the white swelling, then it falls under the sense.
When therefore one wishes to know the color of the humidity, then to experience the color of the humidity in the swelling with the introduction of the quarter-square, whose form precedes.
According to that therefore which proceeds from the indication of the introduction, judge concerning that which is between that.
When therefore we come to the treatment with iron, then it is necessary to give the sick person rest, and to draw off blood from him if it is possible, and to fill his body with liquid
Then he rests upon his back upon a high thing, and places under him many cushions.
Then sit thou upon his left hand, and command the minister, that he sit on his right hand, who extends his palm of his hand towards one of the two sides of the skin of the testicles, and towards the part of the belly
Then take the broad sponge and dry the testicles from the middle towards the loin: and make an incision according to the rule of the equidistant line which divides the skin of the testicles, until it reaches the white layer which encompasses the testicles: and scrape it off and watch, or cut it out in this way: and let your scraping be such as you scrape the part which hangs with the testicles towards the greater part. And scrape cautiously according to the quantity which you are able.
Then pierce the bladder with a wide needle and extract all the urine. Then separate the two lips of the incision with hooks, and stretch the bladder upwards, and do not touch the testicles which are encompassed: and make an incision in the bladder as you consider possible, or with all its substance, or incompletely, especially its broad side superficially
For if you do not examine carefully, in making the incision there will be no security, for the urine will return.
If however anything external comes out from its place at the time of your operation: then when you have completed the incision of the bladder, reduce it.
Then join together the two lips of the skin of the testicles with sutures.
Then care for it like the rest of the wounds, until it is healed.
If you find anything corrupted from blackness else, then it is necessary that you bind the veins which are the source of the blood flow
Then remove the testicles with the suspension, and extract the urine: afterwards care for it as we have said before
If indeed urine is aggregated in two parts, then you know that there are two branches: dry therefore the other part equally as you did the other
And if it be equal with you, that the operation be one, then do this: afterwards withdraw the blood.
And insert the lancet beneath the skin in the belly, or in the groin: and put outside the lancet another lancet than that which thou didst submerge in the wine and oil, and expand the belly above two testicles, and open the belly: and place over it doubled layers of linen, and there will be nails: and ligate above with a ligament, which is having six according to this shape.
And then take away two cloths, and wash, and put in the carmine, according to this likeness: and let the extremities be those which are sent from the hip, or a wet lancet: and gather with the stricture in the lumbar region of the arms: and one extremity shall take upon itself over a knee until the back, and the second shall take upon itself to the part of the loin: and two extremities upon two lower thighs, and two extremities upon two buttocks, and gather the stricture throughout in the lumbar region of the arms.
And when it is necessary to treat this swelling artificially with a cautery in the place of the section with a knife: and it is that thou shalt take the cautery of a fine knife, and cut with it the skin of the testicles: and it is ignited, according as we have said: until it is discerned that there is white fat containing water: then take the cautery, according to this shape.
Thus are the Greek letters assimilated.
And then pierce with it that swelling, and it is ignited, until all the moisture has gone out
And then stretch out the swelling with hooks, and scrape with the cautery of a fine fire, and cut it through according to what is possible for thee, until thou hast cut through all of it
And take heed from the belly, let it not touch the flame.
And know that this operation is safer and more lasting than one with bleeding, and better than an operation with incision
If indeed it makes resistance in the hour of incision, or in the hour of cautery of the afterburn, or bleeding, or anything else: then it is necessary to treat that which makes resistance to it with the treatment which is fitting for it, as has been said before
But if the patient is timid and does not expect this operation on account of its horror: then I administer perforation according to that which I have said above: and thus
When you are certain with me about the signification of the aquosa [substance], which is poured out: then you must cause the patient to sit on a raised seat.
Then perforate the afterburn in the lower part of it with a broad spatula: and place the perforation according to the length of the body, and let the opening be wide open, until all the water has run out.
Then place over the place the heel, and bind it up, and let it run out the rest of the water: then care for it until the wound is healed.
If indeed resistance be found in the hour when you perforate it: and it is not because of that, because a white cobweb makes resistance in the mouth of the wound and hinders the issue of the water: then you must introduce a needle into the wound, or an instrument with which the water of life is extracted, whose form has gone before: or add in the operation of the wound a little piece of wool.
And know that the water returns and is gathered after six months, or thereabouts.
When the patient is gathered, he is then returned to the same manner, and the infirm passes over his days.
Regarding the care of the flesh-wound.
Chapter LXIII.
You know that in the section above this Ramus, there is fear that leads to perversion in many situations.
Therefore its dismissal from this [wound] is seen as a healing factor
And I am reminding you of the operation in this and of the kind of dressing
I say, indeed, that many abscesses happen in bodies, from which testicles are made up: and this is from many wounds, namely Or from acute or acrid moisture which flows to the testicles
Or from impact.
And the colour of the abscess is according to the colour of the body, and it is not found to be painful: and it is a serious abscess
And perhaps it is a stone abscess, whose colour is dark, and there is no feeling in it
And when it comes from the swelling of arteries, and the inflation of them: thus was its reminder mentioned above: or from the swelling of veins
Which indeed comes from the swelling of arteries, is known by the disposition of the abscess, when you press it with your fingers
And it does not behoove you to touch it directly
That which comes from the swelling of veins, is not dispersed by anything by the pressure of the fingers And it is possible that over this kind of abscess there should be a section, and over the rest of the flesh: and it is like cutting the skin of the testicles
Then extend the limb upwards, and extract it with a white sponge: and release the suspension from the belly, and ligate the belly: and cut off the suspension when you have released it from all parts of the limb.
If any limb is consolidated with those native bones, then it is necessary to grasp the limb and cut it off.</start_of_turn> And if there is an adhesion between some of the sponges, or in that which is between the belly: then it is necessary to free the whole adhesion, and cut it with a round incision.</start_of_turn>
But if there is a natural bone in the place of the adhesion which is behind: then it is necessary to cut through all of it, and extract the limb, as we have said.</start_of_turn> When your operation is complete, then put a bandage on the soaked lancet in rose-colored oil, and wine: then care for it with the remaining care, until it heals.</start_of_turn>
Concerning the care of limbs, which is with Vite.</start_of_turn
Chapter 122.</start_of_turn>
Uitis is swelling which involves the whole limb, like a bag, with softening of the testicles: and it makes difficult the movement and exercise of the infirm person, and walking.</start_of_turn
And in the care of this ailment is fear, because of which there is recollection.</start_of_turn
But it is necessary to say that in this case the operation must be performed as the first people did it.</start_of_turn I say therefore, that it is necessary to make the infirm person sit on a raised seat.</start_of_turn
Then make an incision with a sharp knife across the scrotum, until the testicles are revealed.</start_of_turn>
Then remove the skin from all sides, as we have said concerning the arteries in the groin.</start_of_turn>
Then dry it in the middle by a straight cut according to the length of the body, and remove what is gathered from the corruption of the bowels.</start_of_turn
Then care for the wound with the care of the rest of the wounds, in which oil is generated to bring about the healing of the testicles.</start_of_turn
There is no bad thing in that.</start_of_turn>
If, however, the veins should be injured in all the testicles, then it is necessary to remove them along with the testicles: so that they do not lose nourishment by the incision, and that they do not become gangrenous, and that they do not cause any damage to the surrounding parts.</start_of_turn
(This section is omitted from the translation.)</start_of_turn> (The translation continues with the next chapter header.)</start_of_turn>
Why do the intestines descend from the rupture to one testicle?
The rupture is either from a fracture or an extension of the latter.
These two kinds of rupture happen from many causes: from a blow, from a jump, from a scream, from the elevation of a heavy object, and similar things.
The sign is when it is from an extension of the fracture.
It happens slowly over a long time, and does not happen immediately: and it is equal in height to its depth because the fracture is compressing the intestine
The sign is when it is from a section of the fracture, because it immediately causes pain and swelling: and it is a different swelling, which appears close to the skin: and this is because the intestine has escaped through the fracture and is flowing outwards
And sometimes it escapes with the intestine: and this is called intestinal hernia, and swelling: and sometimes it happens with swelling.
And sometimes it runs into the intestine and remains there: and this is with great pain: because it causes pain to press, and especially when it is released
And in the treatment of this kind of ailment, fear of the fracture is great: therefore it is necessary to prevent its occurrence in this case.
The method of operation is to push out the main cause of pain in the patient, so that the intestine returns to its own cavity.
And then it is laid back over the collar of its column between your hands: and you elevate its limbs.
And then you spread the skin following the skin upwards, and dry the testicles completely along their length
Then fix in two holes the section of the bowels, according to what is necessary to open the section with the instruments: and the section should be according to the quantity, as much as is possible, that it may go out of it whole.
Then strip away the skin and whatever is under the testicles until the white belly of the intestines is seen: then insert your finger into the index of that which follows the testicle, in that which is between the white belly and the testicle, and between the intestines and the white belly, and hold together what is on the back of the belly
Then move with the right hand to the inside of the skin of the testicles: and with this extend the white belly upwards with the left hand: and elevate the gut with the white belly to the part of the section: and command the minister to extend the gut upwards: and you will solve the adhesion which is at the complete solution.
And inquire with your fingers that there be nothing there in the gut which is in the white belly or hard.
If however you find anything there: then push it downwards into the belly.
Then grasp the clamp, which has a thick thread made of ten threads: and insert it at the back of the intestines, that is, the layer which is under the skin of the testicles which follows the section: and cut off the extremities which project from the thread, until there are four threads left
Then make a loop with some of them over some with a shape like a cross: and ligate with instruments as we have said, because the ligament which we have mentioned is under the skin of the testicles, and it cannot have any nourishment which nourishes anything: so that there may not be any suppuration of the belly.
And place again a ligament outside the first ligament, which is longer than the two fingers by less than two fingers.
And after that, two ligatures must be let go from the siphons, which are under the skin of the testicles, as much as the quantity of the magnitude of a finger: and the rest must be cut through according to the roundness, and take out whatever remains.
And after that, the lower part of the skin of the testicles must be sectioned off, from which blood runs, and it must be healed: as we have said before in this matter.
Then apply a soaked bandage to the wound and put in a sponge: and manage the ligament which we have mentioned
And when the white siphons have been cauterized as we have mentioned, after the incision of it there is fear of the flow of blood.
It often happens like this.
And let go of the ligament, until it falls away by itself.
If, however, its case is delayed, it must be bound up with warm water: and put on top of it what we have mentioned, until it falls away
And then care for the wound with the rest of the treatment of wounds, until it heals.
Of a wound filled with blood.
Chapter LXVI.
In such a wound no one should dare to put their hand over its treatment with a knife.
And the first will say that it is like what we have narrated in the Ramis which is like with a Vite.
That is, as a ligature has been made after the section above it with ease: then cut through in the middle, and care afterwards with what opens it up until the ligatures fall away: and care for the wound, as we have said, until it is healed
On the disruption which occurs in the groin.
On the disruption which occurs in the groin.
When a rupture happens in the groin, as we have said, and the place is prominent, and does not descend to the testicles anything from the intestines: and if it descends, it is little, and returns in every hour: but if it is prolonged with this time, an opening is added in the groin, until the intestines descend into the groin.
And this happens from the extension of the groin, which is in the groin, as we have said
That is, because the groin is stretched: then it softens and relaxes the place, and the place becomes prominent.
And its care is with cautery, as it has been said before.
And sometimes it is cured with an iron, in this way: and the patient lies on his back between your hands
Then dry the place of the rupture after it has relaxed and become prominent, by cutting across the width, according to the quantity of three fingers wide
Then string the intestines and those which are under the skin, until the white fat is detected, which is under the skin following it
Then take the radium and put it on the place which is prominent from the groin, and press it down to the depth of the belly
Then sew up two places which are prominent at the extremities of the radium from the groin, and join them with a single suture: then withdraw the extremity of the radium
And do not cut through the intestines at all, neither draw out any hair or anything else, like I told you in the treatment of intestinal branches Then care for that of the wounds.
When the threads are cut, bind up that, and restore the wound, until it is consolidated
Let it not be beaten against, and do not add prominence to the rupture.
And the cautery is better in this place: because it is closer to the flesh.
About the softening of the skin of the testicles
Chapter LXVIII.</start_of_turn>
Many times the skin of the testicles is softened in some men, because the flesh which is between them is softened, and its aspect is spoiled
Therefore it is necessary for the one who is asking for its care, to make the diseased person lie upon his back, and to cut through the whole softened skin over the natural skin Then gather up two lips together with a suture: and if you will, sweat at first the superfluous of the softened skin by means of three sutures, or four, and firmly suture them.
Then care for the care of the remaining wounds, until they are healed, and the threads are cast off
About castration.</start_of_turn>
Chapter LXIX.</start_of_turn
You know that castration is excluded in our law: and for this reason I am not permitted to remind you of it in this book: and it is not necessary to remind you of it, except for two ways.</start_of_turn>
Of which one is that it should be in the science of medicine when it is asked about: and to know its treatment when it happens.</start_of_turn
And thus another method is that we often need to castrate some animals for our treatments, such as horses, asses, and cats, and those of the like.
I say therefore, that castration is done in two ways. Or by cutting off.
Or by incision and cutting through
And in that way which is done by attrition, the operation is this: we make the animal sit in warm water, until the testicles become soft and limp, and hang down: then we take hold of the testicles and draw them out until they break and do not appear under the touch
And in castration done by incision and cutting, it is necessary to hold the animal securely and grasp the testicles with the left hand.
And this method of castration is better than that done by attrition: for attrition may perhaps leave something behind from the testicles, which the animal may still desire for coitus.
Then care for the wound, until it has healed.
And for the care of hermaphrodites there are two methods.
Chapter 70.
A hermaphrodite is born from two parents.
One of them is that it appears in the space between the scrotum and the testicles, or in the area between the two testicles, a figure like that of a female vulva, in which there are hairs: and sometimes urine comes from the area between the testicles.
Among women there exists one kind, and the vulva of a woman is above the pubic bone like the testicles of a small man altogether, projecting outwards: of which one is like the penis of a man, and two are like two testicles.
And the care of the three kinds, of two from the men and one from the women, is: because it is necessary to cut away the added flesh until the impression of them is driven out.
Then the care of the rest of the wounds.
As for the second kind of men from which urine proceeds, which is in the belly of the testicles, there is no operation, neither is there any care for it whatsoever
Of the incision of the Tenticle, and the protruding flesh in the vulvas of women
Chapter LXXI.</start_of_turn>
The Tenticle sometimes adds itself above the natural thing, until it is fed and becomes ugly in appearance: and sometimes it swells in certain women so much, that it expands like in the men, and persists until coitus.
It is necessary therefore to cut away the superfluous Tenticle with one or two incisions: and do not finish by cutting through, especially at the root: lest there should happen the flow of blood
Then the care of the wound itself, until it is healed
The flesh which is born in the mouth of the womb, until it has been completed: and perhaps it comes out to the outside according to the form of a tail: and because of this some call it caudal fistula.
It is necessary therefore to cut away the flesh as we do the Tenticle, and to care for it, until it is healed
Concerning the care of the Alratica, which is a woman’s navel that is unpierced.
Concerning the care of the Alratica, which is a woman’s unpierced navel.
The Alratica is, as it is a woman’s unpierced navel, or a small hole.
It is either natural or accidental.
It is accidental from an injury that preceded it: and thus it is either born from the flesh added to it, or from a fine membrane, or from a hair: and it is either in the depth of the matrix, or in the sides of it, or in the upper part of it, or in the lower part of it: and it hinders coition and pregnancy, and delivery, and perhaps it hinders menstruation
And its knowledge is by the aspect of the obstetrician, if the visible hair is close at hand
If it is not visible, then seek for it with your fingers, or with an X-ray
If it is from a fine membrane, and is close to two teeth: then correct it, and break it up.</start_of_turn>
And it is like placing over two lips two little pins.</start_of_turn
Then place your thumbs of both hands together, and the woman sits with her back resting on her buttocks.</start_of_turn
Then stretch out two lips with force, until the fine membrane is ruptured, and the hair is opened.</start_of_turn>
Then grasp the hair, and soak it in oil, and put it in its place: and the woman should lie down every day, so that it does not harden in another place.</start_of_turn
If, however, the membrane is thick and tough: then it is necessary to cut it with a blade like a sickle leaf.</start_of_turn>
If, however, the swelling is from flesh grown, then suspend it with hooks, and cut it through: and let there be with you medicines which flow blood without biting, such as acacia, and dragon's blood, and thus aggregated with alum.
Then give a wide lead pencil made of lead, so that it does not harden too quickly, and keep it for a few days: and give an ointment of dry lint, then care for the rest of the treatment until healed.</start_of_turn>
And when there is born in the matrix the swelling of other tissues: it is necessary therefore that they be cut through in this way: for as long as there is no cancerous ulcer, there is no contradiction with iron in all things.</start_of_turn>
Concerning the care of hemorrhoids, Athehelil, and Bothor of the red ones in women.</start_of_turn>
Chapter 73.</start_of_turn
Hemorrhoids are indeed a bursting of the veins, until blood flows out excessively.</start_of_turn
When they are thus diminished, hemorrhoids become small: and I have already said in the discourse of their species and their signs: and I will say here what is taken from them for treatment, and what is not.</start_of_turn
I say, therefore, that hemorrhoids which are in the belly opening, and which do not appear to the senses: then there is no treatment with iron for them.</start_of_turn
Those which are however in the belly opening over which the sense falls, are those which are cured.</start_of_turn
It is necessary therefore that you admit the woman to a cold house.</start_of_turn
Then suspend the hemorrhoids with hooks, or with rough cloth, and cut them from their roots.</start_of_turn
Then powdered ochre above the ease [of bleeding] with flow of blood from one perforation without alteration: as acacia, and dragon's blood, and thus, and the like.
Then powder it upon the foot an hour together with the wall.
Then place it in cold water afterwards
If the flow of blood persists: then make the patient sit in a decoction of alum, and barley flour, and saffron, and the like.
Then take barley flour, and mix it with honey and vinegar, and make a plaster with it on his back.
If blood is thus shed with it, it is good: and if not, make it adhere to the wound edges, and blood clots, without cutting
Then take wool, and soak it in tarragon oil, or arnica oil, or almond oil, that is, alum, wine of potage, and make it adhere to the wound
When the swelling subsides, then care for the place with unguents until it is healed.
Although it is red like the heads of garlic, and has a rough appearance
It is necessary therefore that you cut off what appears from it, as I have said before: and care for the wound until it is healed
Of the perforation of the uterus which happens in the matrix.
Chapter 74.
Many kinds of swelling happen in the matrix, as cancer, and stone swelling, and ulcer, and tumors, and swellings, and herpes, and swelling of the spleen, and fistula, and hemorrhoids, and piles, and calculus, and cold swelling.
And I say moreover that I have mentioned all the diseases and their kinds, their signs and their treatments in this discourse: it is necessary that I speak in this treatise about the calcification that occurs in the matrix when it is separated from the other calculi which support health, and to describe how it is opened with an iron.
It is necessary to consider this matter carefully.
If the pain of a calculus in its inception is acute with percussion, fire and fever: and you see it become red: if it falls upon the senses, do not attempt to perforate it: care for it with that which helps the maturation of the calculus until the acute pain has subsided
Then it is necessary to make the woman sit upon a cushion which supports two cushions, and that she recline, or that she be placed upon her back, and that she bring her feet down to the lower part of the belly: and that her knees be spread wide, and that she rest her arms under her knees, and that she bind both ligaments conveniently to that.
Then let the obstetrician sit to the right, and administer the instrument with which the opening of the maternal orifice is opened.
Whose form comes in those things which are after.
And it is necessary that when you administer this instrument, you should hold the liver with a wide grasp at the root of the maternal matrix: so that it does not go deeper into the matrix than is necessary, and does not injure the lower part.
If however the instrument should be greater in size than the depth of the maternal matrix, then it is necessary to place sponges upon the covering of the profound matrix: in order to prevent the entrance of the whole instrument into the profound matrix: and it is necessary to place a sponge, which runs through the instrument, from the upper side: and to hold the instrument and to rotate the minister of the sponge until the profound matrix is opened
When the exit [of an abscess] appears, and it is grasped by the hand, and is soft and yielding: then it is necessary to cut it out from its root with a wide scalpel.
When the abscess has been evacuated, then it is necessary to place a swab dipped in vinegar or a green olive oil, which has some astringency, on the root of the excision: and lay the swab on, and extract the section from the depth of the belly.
And place externally over the abdomen and over the wound a wet wool blanket submerged in water, in which there are bulges of pus.
Then care for it two days later with an ointment which is suitable for this, until it is healed
And when the belly and the wound have been washed, it is to be bathed with water and honey: then with water in which the radix of lily or long asparagus is boiled: then return to the ointment.
If the wound has been hidden inside the belly, then it is necessary to prohibit treatment of it with iron, and treat it with that which we have said in the instruction.
Concerning obstetrical doctrine, how to treat the embryos of women, according to a figure not natural of the egress.
The provided text does not include the translation of the remaining portion of the sentence, so I am unable to complete the translation request.
It is necessary for the Obstetrician to first recognize the natural figure of delivery.
When a woman, during labor, is pressed downwards and desires to smell the air, and she lets out a sound over what is above her that is of delivery, and the fetus comes out: then you know that this delivery is natural, and that the head is coming out first, and the second with it: or suspended, or hanging from the navel. When these signs appear, it is necessary to compress the abdomen, so that the embryo may descend quickly.
Whoever is beyond this part is unnatural and harmful
For when the fetus comes out through the feet, and the body goes before the head, and the feet and hands together, or one foot alone: or the head and hands together: or the abdomen: or perhaps it turns over on its neck, and similar things happen with other figures which are harmful.
It is necessary therefore for the Obstetrician to be prudent and cautious in all these matters, and to beware of error and miscarriage: and I show all the figures of these things and how they are formed, and I indicate their significance, and I stand over them.
When the fetus comes out through the head naturally, and when it urges itself forward on the woman, and the delivery becomes difficult for her, and the signs of its weakness are seen: then let her sit down, or let the women hold her up: and let her breathe deeply with the smoke of rue and with fragrant oils.
Then let the Obstetrician insert his fingers between the toes of the heel and find the second one, and grasp it with his nail, until it comes out from the moisture: and press the woman's abdomen until the fetus comes down
If it does not come down, then it is necessary to instill the woman with the mucus of rue, with the addition of sesame seeds
Then command her to bear down forcefully: and make her cough with a spasm, and hold her hand and nose for an hour.
The fetus forthwith departs.
If two hands of the fetus depart at the outset, it is necessary to reduce them gradually with ease
If, however, they do not yield inwards, then place the woman over the seat and elevate her feet above: then press down upon the seat with the earth: and the woman should be held, lest she fall at the impact.
If the hands do not depart and the fetus dies, then cut down the hands and extract the remainder of the fetus: and bind the hand with a cloth and extract it with evenness: for it itself will depart.
The fetus emerges upon its feet
When the fetus emerges upon its feet, then it is necessary to push it upwards: then gradually bend the fetus: afterwards equalize it
Then grasp one foot of it and extend it gradually.
When they depart up to the hips, then command it to lie down, that it may be compressed, and make it yawn with force: it will depart if God wills it
And if it does not depart as we have said, then gradually reduce the fetus until you place it according to its natural form.
For it itself will depart at the time of delivery.
If it is hindered as to this, then take from the thick mucus of the navel-cord, and sponge it with oil, and gum dissolved: and pierce all through in the belly of the stillborn with a good blow: then bind it with the woman's urine, and the lower part of her belly.
Then make it sit in warm water, until the afterbirth follows naturally.
When the lower parts are swollen from heat, make for them a sieve of myrrh: and support them.
When the lower parts are swollen from heat, make for them a sieve of myrrh and support them.
Then make them lie down: and bind their limb and nose: and compress the lower part of the belly with ease
For the heat will go out immediately.
The heat goes out above the knee and the hand
When it has gone out in this form, then it comes inwards gradually touching the hand
Then the woman lies down on her neck, and hangs her feet downwards: and she lies down on the bed, and puts her hands together
Then compress the belly gradually.
Then draw out what is under her feet from the nails until it is prepared in the lower part.
If the heat does not go out, then grasp her feet and move them up and down with might
Then compress what is above the navel gradually, until the heat ascends to the upper parts
Then put your hands inwards gradually and equalize the heat gradually: and command the woman to compress, until the heat goes out.
The heat goes out laterally hanging from the hands
It comes down in the reduction of her hand.
If it is not possible to reduce it, then elevate the woman, and make her walk.
If she is unable to walk, then make her lie down on the bed: and bruise her limbs with a slight blow
Then apply the unguent which you prepared from mucilages.
If it is grasped by a part, then make it rest upon its seat
Then consider in reduction of the hand, and equalize the limb according to its natural shape: and make the woman groan, and command her to compress herself, until she is discharged
The limb comes out over its collar, with open hands, and its face is towards the mother's back
Let the Obstetrix grasp the limb, then gradually rotate it, and equalize it with ease.
When it is equal, then place upon its wound what we have mentioned from the ole and mucilages
Then command her to move slowly
When you have done this, then make her sit upon her seat, and command her to lean to the right side
Then command her to compress: and make her groan with concentration.
The limb is prepared to come out on the right side
When it has descended to the opening of the matrix in this way with the second, then split the second with your nail, until it is evacuated from the moisture.
If it is suspended upon the face of the limb, and the collar, then cut it from the navel: so that it does not remain and die
Then drive the limb inwards, until you place it according to what is necessary: and command the woman to compress herself somewhat: she will depart by herself through the easy exit.
The exit of twins, or many fetuses.
You know that twins are often born: sometimes three are born, and sometimes four.
It is indeed an unusual thing, and rarely happens.
Indeed, it is beyond nature for five to survive together: and they are separated by the navel-string of each of them.
Sometimes they come out like a single fetus through the natural outlet: easily. But sometimes they come out through an unnatural outlet, as we have mentioned. If some of them are difficult at the birth, and approach that which we have mentioned as unnatural, then care for them as we have said: and let the midwife be gentle and do as she does with ease and delay, and adapt to every figure as she is prepared for it from her skill and experience
When one, two, three, four, five, six, seven or more are formed in the womb: and indeed I have seen a woman who aborted seven, and another who aborted fifteen of them all formed
Which is the work of the measurement of a wise man
Therefore all this pertains to the science of Obstetrics. Perhaps therefore it will be like that: oppose it with that which pertains to it.
Of the extraction of a dead fetus.
When you care for a dead fetus with medicine as I said in the discourse and it does not come out, and you must perform an operation with your hands, then you must consider carefully
If a woman is of good virtue and is not suffering from any accident which would cause her to fear the loss of her life: then it is necessary that she lie down upon the bed, with her head inclined downwards and her legs elevated: and the attendants must hold her firm from two parts, or she must be bound to the bed, so that her body is not pulled out during the extraction of the fetus.
Then the moisture of the matrix is to be taken from olive oil with alum, fennel, and poppyseed. Then the obstetrician should wet his hand with these oils and mucilages: then he introduces the instrument into the matrix with ease.
Then he seeks the location in which the hooks of the fetus are fixed, and the convenient place for it
Consider then, if the fetus is prepared to descend upon its head: then fix the hooks in its eyes, or in its neck, or in its mouth, or in its palate, or under its beard, or under its chin, or in the neighbouring ribs, and under the hypopondria
If however the descent is upon its feet, then in the loin and the middle ribs
And it is necessary that the hook be held with the right hand: and put the curvature of the hand on that which is between the little finger and the ring finger: and introduce it with the hand with ease, and fix the hook in one of those places which we mentioned, until it reaches the navel
And be extended with an equal extension, and do not be extended only in a straight line, but move towards all parts, so as to relieve its exit: thus it is done with a tooth during its extraction.
It is necessary in this that which is between them, so that the swelling may be softened.
If that which is retained from that remains, then it is necessary that the physician apply some fingers with oil to that part, and introduce them from the side, so that it may recoil with that which is retained
If therefore the part of the fetus goes out, then change the nails to another place which is higher: do this until the whole fetus comes out.
If therefore the hand goes out before the other, and it is not possible to reduce it because of its adhesion: then it is necessary that it be covered over with a dressing
Then extract it until when the whole thing comes out, it hangs by the nail or at the ankle joint: and so it is necessary that you make the hand in the other place, and in two feet.
If however the head of the fetus is large, or if there is adhesion in its going out, or there is water gathered in the head: then it is necessary that the surgeon introduce between the fingers a Spatumile spinosum, and find the head with it, and extract the water: or break it with the instrument which is called Almisdac, which has a form like that of the other instruments in the following chapter.
Likewise do in the case of a fetus of large head, then it is necessary that the membrane be divided: or extract it with the placenta, as we have said.
Then draw out the bones with forceps.
If therefore the head goes out, and is caught at the ribs: then it is found until the moisture which is in the chest is drained out.
If therefore it does not complicate, neither obeys the going out: then cut off the head roughly, as much as is possible to you
If the lower part of the belly is affected with swelling, or is affected with water-retention: then it is necessary to drain it out until the moisture has subsided from it.
If the fetus lies upon its feet, then its traction is easy, and its direction towards the maternal bones is gentle.
If, however, it is closed up within the belly, or the chest: then it is necessary to pull it out with the hand which you put over your hand: and uncover the belly, or the chest, until the swelling has subsided from it
If, however, the rest of the limbs are raised up, and the head is returned: then the obstetrician puts in his left hand. If, therefore, the maternal bones are open: then he puts his hand into the depth of the womb, and grasps the head, and pulls it down with his fingers until it reaches the maternal bones: and then he puts in his thumb, or two thumbs, and pulls with them
If, however, the maternal bones are closed, because of a thick swelling which has happened to it: then it is not necessary to work over it, but it is necessary to administer an effusion of soft things: and administer plasters: and sit in waters which soften and moisten
If the fetus lies upon its side: it is possible to equalise it: then it is necessary to administer what we said concerning the present fetus.
If it is not possible to do this, then it is necessary to make an incision, and to extract it.
And it is necessary not to let anything escape from the second part altogether.
When you have completed your operation, then administer what we said concerning the postpartum swellings which happen in the womb
If blood flow increases, let it descend into the styptic aquas, and manage the rest of the treatment.
I have also seen a woman who had a dead fetus within her: afterwards she was impregnated above the former blood, then the other fetus also died.
It happened to her after a long time that she had a swelling in her belly, and it became inflated until it burst open: pus began to flow from it.
I was called to treat her and I treated her for a long time: the wound did not heal
I placed upon her from some strong sponges some attraction: and it came out from the bone place
Afterwards a few days passed, and the bone came out again.
I rejoice in this, because there is no longer any bone in the belly
I thought that there were dead fetuses' bones in her belly
I inquired about the wound and extracted many bones, the existing woman being in a better state: and from that time on she emitted little pus from the place
I did not confirm this to be foreign, except that there is art in it, and the aid of a skillful physician with his hands in treatment.
Concerning the forms of the necessary instruments for extracting the fetus.
Chapter 77.
Here below is the form of the Strictor, which is like a book, with two rings at the ends of two sticks being equal in number to two rings.
Indeed this vertigo must be finer than the strictor: or make it either of ebony or of seasoned wood
The breadth of every limb is like two fingers; and the margin of each side is like a single finger; and the length of each of them is palm and middle. And in the middle of the two limbs are two bulges of the same kind of limb which, having been fixed in both, have a length of middle palm and somewhat less; and the breadth of each of them is like two fingers, or less.
Two bulges intervene inside the bone of the matrix, so that it opens when two vertebrae are turned.
The form of the vertebra which opens the matrix
Another shape like that, thinner and smoother
It is made from Ebony wood, or ivory, according to the shape of pincers
In its extremity there are two bulges, like the two thumbs above: and the length of each bulge is like a palm; and the breadth of each is like two fingers
When therefore you wish to open the matrix with this, then make a woman sit over a bench, with her feet hanging down, and open that which is between her buttocks
Then introduce these two bulges together into the matrix: and you hold the lower end of the instrument between her thighs
Then open your hand with the instrument, like you do with pincers, equally according to the quantity of what you wish to open from the opening of the matrix, until the obstetrician does what he wants
The other form of the vertebra is called the driving force which drives out the fetus.
The form of the Almisdac which counteracts the head of the small bones The form of the neighbor having a single spine
The form of the neighbor having two spines
The form of the forceps which have teeth like sharp teeth, with which it counteracts the head of the fetus.
The form of the spatula having two extremities to bind the head
The form of two spatulas also of the hands
These instruments are used for all purposes, and the more various their kinds and the more they are prepared by the artificer, the faster is the operation and the greater is its success among men, because of their quantity.
Do not disdain any of these instruments because they are prepared for you
It is inexcusable for anyone to be without these things.
About the extraction of the second [tooth].
Chapter 78.
When the second [tooth] is retained at the root, then it is necessary to remove the lower teeth in order to retain the breath.
Then make a grasp with your thumb and index finger: and clench your hand over its bone, and cover its breath.
If it comes out by this, that is good.
If not: then grasp the root firmly, and pierce through the socket with a needle: and put in it herbs that open the womb, such as chamomile, rue, mugwort, mint, parsley, and acacia: grasp all these herbs, or some of them, and soak them in water, and put them over fire.
Then place an embolus of Arundis over the opening of the coopertor's vessel, and the other extremity in the bone of the matrix: and keep it in place until the vapor has passed to the cavity of the matrix.
Then make a mark as we have said before.</start_of_turn>
It will come out easily afterwards.</start_of_turn>
If, however, it remains after this treatment and does not come out: then command the Obstetrician to immerse his hand in the fat of sesame or high mucus.</start_of_turn Then he will introduce it into the belly and search with it.</start_of_turn
When he has found it, then grasp it and pull it out slowly.</start_of_turn
If, however, it is an appendix in the depth of the matrix, then introduce the hand again, as we have said above, until it has found the appendix, and then pull it out gradually in a straight line, so that the matrix is not torn by the pulling: indeed it is necessary to move it with ease to the right and left: then add in quantity the attraction.</start_of_turn>
It will obey you then, and will be cured, and will go away from the adhesion.</start_of_turn
As for the bone of the matrix if it is contracted, as we have said before: treat it with a mark and medication of the vessel with herbs.</start_of_turn>
If, however, it does not come out with all that we have said: do not be rash in your handling of it in your attempt to extract it.</start_of_turn
It is necessary, however, that what comes out of the matrix towards the woman's side should be bound to the woman's hip.</start_of_turn
Then anoint the cavity with unguent composed of four drugs.
It will putrefy the cavity within a few days, then dissolve and disappear.
Truly, when putrefying, it will emit a foul odor from the abdomen and head, and will bring about discomfort in that area.
Therefore, it is necessary to apply suitable fumigations for this purpose
Some of the old ones are experts in fumigation with mustard and powdered alum
The manner in which a woman is fumigated during her second stage and menstruation
It should be like a bath of urine, or from the horns of a wild ass: and put out wide extremities over the flame: and let the fumigation be placed over the loins: hold it until the fumigation is consumed: and do it again another time
For the treatment of an unpierced animal.
Chapter LXXIX.
There are many boys who are born with an unpierced nose, and whom I have seen to suffer from slight swelling under the tip of the nose
Therefore, the obstetrician must pierce it with his finger: and if not, pierce it with a pointed spatula: and take care not to touch it
Then put on it soaked wool in wine and oil
Then care for it with unguents, until it heals.
If indeed it is to be pierced, then put in the hole a lead cannula for many days, and take it out when the boy wants to breathe freely.
And sometimes the piercing of the nose is caused by the consolidation of a wound, or by a fistula.
It is necessary therefore that the incision be complete and the consolidation be removed, and then it is cured as we have said with the dressing and lead. Concerning the treatment of fistulas which occur in the lower part.
Chapter 8.
Fistulas which occur in the lower part are of two kinds: Nodatio and Grossitudo which occur close to any deformity: and are either one fistula or several
When the Nodatio has been removed, it is opened and white watery moisture or subtle pus runs from it
And when these fistulas are penetrating.
The fistula is from the worms when they are penetrating up to the rectum and even to the meat of the bowels.
And they are penetrating from the worms up to the joint of the hip, and up to the node of the tailbone
However, that which is recognized as a penetrating fistula until it reaches the bone, even if it is not penetrating, is when you introduce your finger into the fistula with an index of your hand: and introduce a thin needle into the fistula from the air, or from the iron, when there is no swelling
When there is swelling, then introduce into the fistula a thin needle from lead or a hair from a horse's tail, until you feel the needle, or the hair in your finger
If you do not feel the needle itself, or if there is no discharge from the wound, or swelling, or worms as I have said: then you know that it is not penetrating: so proceed with the treatment
When the fistula is penetrating as far as the bladder or the meat of the urine: then its signification is the outflow of urine from it, and its prohibition from this so that the place may be consolidated with the physicians.
When it is penetrating as far as the hip joint or the bone of the hip: then its sign is that the limb hangs there, if not with a twist as far as the bone: and the origin of pain in the circumference of the part, and that pus always comes out from it: and that no remedy is useful in it, neither is it consolidated with oil
And in all these penetrating fistulas there is no complete cure: the cure for them is toil and perseverance, from the stupid physicians who form them. But in those which are neither penetrating nor old, hope for healing is expected with rest: as I have said before and I will prove: and it is that the sick man should lie between your hands over his back: and lift his legs up to above his hips, and that his thighs should be inclined towards his belly
Then introduce lead, or air, if there is a twist in the fistula, until you know where the limb hangs
And if the sick man feels pain around the limb, then it is necessary to put your finger on the limb.
If you feel the limb trying to penetrate through itself that you have detected, besides that which you feel between your finger and the limb, and between the flesh: then you know certainly that it is penetrating: it is not useful to work on it, because its cure is not like that which we have said
They say that in some men the wound is healed by the carnation of flesh, and by the application of medicine which is expected to cause it to swell: that is, as before, to apply gentle fire under the circumference of the fistula, as has been said, and to introduce the flame into the fistula, until it hangs around the limb
Then repeat that twice or thrice until you know that all the added flesh has become soft, like the veins of a bird's wing.
Then deal with the wound covered with butter, until the added flesh comes out: then deal with it when the flesh has become soft.
If it is healed, that is good.
And if not, it will not heal with any other treatment
And if it comes out and does not reach until your finger which is in the year, and is between the thumb and the great toe, and there is thick blood from the flesh, or pus: then make an incision in that which follows the surface of the skin, then dry the skin from the start of the incision, and you dry with the finger which is in the fistula until the drying reaches the extremity of the finger, and the finger is freed and falls off
Then soften the soft flesh which has become like the veins of a bird's wing, so that nothing remains of it
If however blood has clotted between you and the operation, so that you cannot remove the flesh: then it is better to cauterize with fire or with acute medicine
For indeed cauterizing with fire unites good habits, brings together the added flesh, and stops bleeding, and dries moisture
Then deal with the wound covered with butter, or bruised stalks, until pus comes out, and the added flesh comes out with the pus.
Then deal with the wound with solid supports, consolidative unguents, which generate tough flesh: and these are medicines which have stypticity and drying power.
When restoration is complete, then healing follows: and not by repetition. When the fistula persists deep in the rectum and is prolonged by excess of body weight: then insert your finger into the rectum and inquire about it.
If you feel resistance, and between you and the fistula there is either fat or flesh, and it is close to the penetration: then there is no operation in that place, except as a last resort, with confidence and hope
For in that case one must administer three methods: either you cauterize the fistula itself, as we have said; or you dissect the vein, until you have reached its depth, so that you can afterwards introduce a ligature and effect a cure.
And do not proceed too much with the incision, lest you cut through the membrane of the rectum, and cause an excessive discharge of feces without their consent. Then care for it as we have said Perhaps indeed it will heal: or you will lengthen the vein, and cleanse it when dry until it is close to the rectum, as we have said, or with the finger or with an acute instrument.
Then remove the clotted blood which is in the incision, until it is firm with the touch of the finger.
Then attempt to restore the whole wound with the incision, and the upper orifice where it has been consolidated: and the fistula will remain open in the inner part of the rectum, and will be less painful
And when you suture the fistula in this way: that is when you insert your finger into the fistula: and it is at the side of the rectum around the surface of the body with skin and the margin of the rectum: then grasp the perforated extremity, which is like a needle with a head, that is, prepared for splitting the skin, according to this form.
And introduce into the loop five threads, and encircle them.
Then introduce a tensioner with a thread into the fistula, until its concavity follows it.
If there is a perforation in the inner margin of the anus near the root, then withdraw the thread from that hole: so that you can introduce your finger into the anus and withdraw the end of the thread, and join the two ends together: and tighten both of them, and let it go on the first or second day: and the more the thread has penetrated the flesh, tighten it well, until those parts of the flesh which are between the two ends of the thread have become soft and fallen away: then care for the wound, until it has healed and become whole again.
You must not make it penetrate because of the tear, so that you do not damage it
Then do as we said above, until it has healed.</start_of_turn>
Make the sponge of spicery which is found in the fistula, which has an acute curvature upwards, and the other part is not acute, so that it does not damage what is not necessary, like water.</start_of_turn>
As for the stitching of hemorrhoids from which blood runs from the incision of them: and care of the incisions.</start_of_turn>
Chapter 81.</start_of_turn>
There are hemorrhoids of two kinds.</start_of_turn
Or they are inside the anus, like the stones of a grape, or cherries: or they are like the seeds of a bean.</start_of_turn
There are both small and large ones among them: and blood always flows from them, and it is one, and there are many.
They are outside the body and at their extremities
Indeed, those that are outside the body are mostly small and moist, from which flows clear water, or rather blood that flows slowly: and they are according to the color of the body.
And the treatment of the one that is inside the body is that you must apply pressure to the wound: and express [the blood], until the anus comes out, and then appear the stitches.
Therefore, do the same with hooks and suspend with your finger.
Then cut at the roots of these things
If they do not remain in the body by their hooks, because of the moisture of these and their softening: then cover them with rough cloth, or with wool felt, and draw them out with your fingers
Then cut at the wound, and powder over the wound after cutting any warm powder, so that it stays in place like cautery
Or cauterize them according to what was said in the chapter on cautery
Then care for the wound until it heals.
If the anus does not come out, then instill the patient with a small enema in the rectum, so that it is washed with it when he defecates, and the wound will come out quickly, when the patient defecates.
If however the stitches are outside the rectum, then the thing is easy: and it is as if you were grasping them with your finger, or grasping them with a hook, and cutting them off
Then care for them until they are healed.
Whoever shuns incision with the sword, must now administer suture according to this method.
Take a prepared thread, and introduce it into the wound
Then draw out the needle to the upper part, and make it penetrate with the needle at the root from the other side: and pass through two extremities of the thread, in the lower part of the needle, and let them be lateral: and tighten the thread strongly.
Then knot the thread, and draw out the needle
Do this with all the wounds, and let go of the needle from one hand: and do not let it touch, so as to prevent excessive bleeding from it.
Then place over the wound a soaked bandage in rose-water, or vinegar, and put it over the wound: and command the patient to rest.
Then let go of it until it has healed.
When the wounds have healed, care for them with unguents, and remain with them until they are healed
(End of excerpt
Many times these occur from excessive straining of the bowels, and the nature of constriction.)
When these things have been done, and they do not yield in medicine: then it is necessary to make incisions with the point of a Spatumilian needle, or with your finger, until they become moist, and the outer layer which hinders consolidation be removed.)
Then care for them until they are consolidated according to what is necessary.)
If, however, they do not consolidate: then repeat the incisions with greater reason than before, until they bleed a great deal, and are afterwards cared for until they are healed.)
On the treatment of swellings of the limbs, and of those not in the limbs: and of bites of scorpions, and of ants.
Then care for it: and if you wish, cauterize it according to what is before mentioned in its chapter.
As for bites of scorpions, one of them is a small, rough, filtered, round elevation above the surface of the body
And they happen many times in the hands of children.
And the treatment of it is to extend the bite, and to cut it: or to tie it with a silk thread: or with a hair, until it falls out
And if you wish, cauterize it according to what is mentioned above with fire, or with acute medicine: and thus the bites of the inversed and the non-inverted scorpion will be eradicated with an instrument which I will tell you of And as for ants, it is also a small, filtered elevation, large, above the surface of the body, which swells inwards: and when it comes into contact with cold, it feels like the bite of an ant, and it happens throughout the body: and most of them happen in the hands
And the treatment of it is to take a needle from the beak of a sparrow, or a strong bristle: and put it over the ant, until a circle of the thread is contained from its parts
Then draw your hand back with the needle until you have severed what is around the ant: and place the needle deep into the flesh, and extract the ant from its root. Or if you wish, do this with an air needle, or a needle of iron, according to this fashion.</start_of_turn>
Let the upper part of the needle reach the tip of the thumb which is being grasped, so that it may relieve the tension of the thumb and its retraction.</start_of_turn>
Or if you wish, cauterize the ant according to what has been stated in the chapter on cautery of the Athelil.</start_of_turn

The needle, that is, the upper part of which is to which the uterus is bound, is to be broad according to this manner: and there should be a distinction so that the uterus is bound like water, and the lower part which enters the belly should be blunt, that is, not open, soft, flexible, drawing towards smoothness: and on one side there shall be two holes, and on the other side one hole.</start_of_turn
The breadth of the opening should be according to the length of the rays, less so the greater; and there should be a space in which to place the instruments from the belly of the beast: either from parchment of the beast, which is according to the form of the asofrat of the palm.
When it is thus placed in the space, the string is to be passed through the head of the clips between two distinguishing constrictions of strength.
Then clip with it.
This is the form of the circle which is here depicted, and of the holes The quality of the clipping with it is: to grasp both the belly or the belly from the medicine, which is warmed according to the quantity of the sufferer's tolerance: and take care that it is not too hot or too cold, or too cold.
Then the patient is laid upon his back, and raises his legs upwards: and place under it the leather, that is, the skin of men, or linen.
Then apply the extremity of the clip with fat, or with alum, or with mucilage of barley, or like these.
Then insert it into the hole with ease.
Then take hold of the belly with both hands and press it out with the thumbs until it has evacuated all that is in the clip into the intestine Then extract the Clistere, and elevate the patient's limbs towards the side. If the physician thinks it appropriate, then hold as much as you can
And if he sleeps throughout the night, this is the greatest aid of all
If, however, you put the Clistere into the solution of the belly, and the exit comes to an end: then repeat the Clistere until he is healed.
If there are hemorrhoids or apostemata of the buttocks, then let the Clistere be slight and soft, from the Clisteres which are given to children.
And this is the form of the gentle Clistere above that which is strict of the skin
Of the treatment of wounds of the head without fracture of the bone.
Head wound number 84
I have said in the discussion of the treatment of wounds that it agrees with the book, and I will say here the treatment of these with the hand and with the physicians according to the supplement.
I say therefore, that wounds are varied according to the thing which causes them, and according to the place where the wound falls
The things which cause wounds to be multiple are like the blow of a stone: or the incision of a sword or knife: or percussion with a lance, or wood, or arrow: and the like of these things from many causes
Wounds which are caused by the place of the body are like a wound which falls on the head, or the neck, or the chest, or the belly, or the genitals: and the like of these from the parts of the body
I am reporting on the treatment of certain wounds, in order to set forth a ratiocination and rule concerning the remainder of wounds.
I shall begin with simple head wounds: for the memory of compound injuries often arises at the beginning of the third chapter.
I say therefore.
When a simple wound occurs on the head, and there is no fracture of the bone: consider then, if there is any fragment of stone, or like things, and if the skin only is fractured: and the wound is great, and the pain is severe: then act promptly, and perform a cephalic bleed: do not delay this: and extract from him from the blood according to the quantity of his virtue: if there is nothing that prohibits it, especially if there is little blood issuing from the wound
And let the bleed be from the opposite side of the wound
And let the patient abstain from eating and drinking, and from great food.
If indeed anything hinders the decrease [of the bleeding], then let him abstain from meat and do not approach fish or eggs.
And apply over the wound if it happens to him a soft swelling, a poultice of fat infused in rose oil only, or with wine in which there is a styptic.
If indeed you are secure from the soft swelling, then apply over the wound, if there is any remnant of blood, and it has not changed its colour, the powder which I will speak of later: and if it has changed its colour, then place over it some unguent until it is healed
If indeed the wound is great, or is from a wound of the sword, and similar: and the edges of it do not adhere by means of little stitches, then adhere them together themselves, according as I shall speak in the wounds of the belly concerning the stitching of them
If, however, a bone has been detected as displaced and hangs loose, and its retention is not possible, except in a small suspension: then cut it off.
Care for the bone with the physicians, and restore it to its place in the skin, and command the patient to eat foods which are rough in texture, such as heads and cooked wheat, until the pulse is restored: and similar things.
If you find putrefaction in the flesh, and it does not adhere to the bone: then cut off the putrefied part entirely, and throw it away: then care for the wound
If, however, in his wound there is an artery, or a vein from which blood flows: and it is not severed by the physicians, then inquire about the artery.
If indeed you find it not severed, then cut it off with sponges or ligate it.</start_of_turn>
If necessity compels you when it does not agree with what we have said, then cauterize it until the bleeding is stopped.</start_of_turn>
Method of applying the powdered ochre.</start_of_turn>
Mix part one of olive oil, two parts dragon's blood, and three parts unburnt lime together: mix them all thoroughly, and make a paste: apply this to the wound, and bind it tightly, until it adheres well to it and clots with the blood.</start_of_turn
Then string it up with wool, and leave it, do not wash it until it has dried, so that it does not become softened.</start_of_turn
Until it is healed, it is not eradicated by medicine.
Until it is healed, it is not eradicated by medicine
Until it is healed, it is not eradicated by medicine.
Until it is healed, it is not eradicated by medicine
Until it is healed, it is not eradicated by medicine
Until it is healed, it is not eradicated by medicine
Until it is healed, it is not eradicated by medicine
Until it is healed, it is not eradicated by medicine
Until it is healed, it is not eradicated by medicine
Until it is healed, it is not eradicated by medicine
If the wound be deep, or if it happen to break into that sinus in the lower part of it, where pus is gathered, then perforate it in a depressed place in that.
If an artery be cut in the wound, and there follow a flow of blood: then separate it, or dry it up, and ligate it: or cauterize it if need be for that.</start_of_turn>
If indeed a piece of cartilage or the whole guttur is fractured, and the fragments are close together: then unite the edges of the skin with a suture over the neck of the guttur, and do not touch the guttur, rather equalize it, and reduce it to its natural figure.</start_of_turn>
Then bind it tightly with a bandage, and discharge it in a few days.</start_of_turn>
Then care for it with poultices which have styptic and drying qualities, until it is healed.</start_of_turn>
If indeed the wound has made an imprint in the bone, then inquire about it: then if there are fragments of bone in that, extract them all, or whatever can be extracted from it: and what cannot be prepared, discharge it, until the wound is healed, and the swelling is separated and diminished.</start_of_turn
If indeed the wound is fresh, then powder over it the powder which I have mentioned.</start_of_turn
If indeed bone is seen in the wound, and a fistula is formed: then care for it as is mentioned in its chapter.</start_of_turn
(End of the text.)</start_of_turn>
If any moisture issues out of a wound when the patient breathes, then you know that the wound is mortal.
If it does not reach deep, and it is merely accompanied by blood: then you do not put in it from the first hour any powder, neither do you tie it up, lest the blood remain in its depth and be lost. Return to the heart, and let the patient die: but put in it some absorbent dressing, and draw out the blood in two days.
If indeed the dressing is not present there, then put in the opening of the wound some coarse wool, so that it may absorb that which issues out of it from the moisture: and cause the patient to sleep over the wound, so that it may heal what collects in it.
If indeed more than three days or more have passed since the wound occurred, and the patient has neither spasm nor bad tremor of the heart nor bad constriction of the breathing, and all other symptoms have ceased: then you know that the wound is healed.
Treat it therefore with care and with medicines, and with the rest of the treatment, until it is healed.
If indeed the healing is excused, and it always opens up: then you know that a fistula has been made
Treat the wound from its head to its foot.
And if the wound is from a cut of a knife, or from a nail, and is simple on the surface of the chest or back: then treat it as if it were sutured, if it is large: or with powder if it is small
But if indeed it has made an imprint in the bone, and has burst from it: then inquire about the wound, and properly remove the bone fragments that are separated.
If they are not separated, then emit them, until the bone becomes rotten, and the enemy will be appeased by the extraction of them.
The remaining wounds of the accident are judged in the care of the rest of the limb, which is their judgment
Of the wounds of the belly, and the exit of the intestine, and the evacuation of the bowels.
Chapter 87.</start_of_turn>
The disruption which happens in the belly is great, medium, or small.</start_of_turn>
From the great (injury) sometimes the intestine comes out, or several intestines.</start_of_turn
Therefore the introduction (of the intestines) is difficult, and the suture is more difficult and arduous.</start_of_turn
And the small disruption is also difficult in another way.</start_of_turn
Therefore it follows, that the reduction (of the intestines) is more difficult, if you do not take proper care in the introduction of them to their place immediately: because it swells, opens, and thickens: and therefore it is difficult for them to enter.</start_of_turn
Therefore the medium disruption is better: because with it the reduction of the intestine is not difficult, as it is with the other two sorts.</start_of_turn
You know that the suture of the belly is done in four ways.</start_of_turn
Two sutures are common in the suture of the belly, and in the suture of the rest of the body: and two other sutures communicate properly with the rest of the wounds.</start_of_turn
But indeed there are other methods which are proper with the suture of the belly: and I will narrate one and the other with exposure and declaration.</start_of_turn Therefore I say, when a wound is small and something protrudes from it from the intestine, and it is difficult to reduce it: then that is because of one of two modes.
Either because of the smallness of the rupture, as we have said: or because of an inflation in the intestine caused by the cold of the air.
When it is thus, then it is necessary to heat it, so as to immerse a sponge or a wet bandage in lukewarm water alone
Or boil in water a little barley, some thyme, and pepper, and embrace with these the intestine, until the inflation is resolved.
When it makes a sticky liquid: it is better than plain water in resolving the inflation.
When the inflation has thus been resolved, then moisten the intestine with the lukewarm liquid in which it has been boiled, or with roughened linen
For thus it will soothe its entrance with something small.
But if it is expelled after this treatment, then find in the small rupture with the instrument with which hemorrhoids are cut.
The first treatment is better when prepared beforehand than by cutting: and it does not compel to cut after necessity and defect of the instrument
Let one part be acute and the other not acute, and the extremity soft not with the smoothness of asphalt, but rather somewhat obtuse: and that is like a wound, as is the liquid
When thus the wound is increased and the intestine enters, then it is necessary to reduce it according to its natural form in its own place, if possible over that: because that is better
When the disruption is wide in the lower part of the belly: then it is necessary that you make the patient lie on his back, and elevate his legs above his head.
And if it is in the upper part of the belly: then place his head low, and raise his chest above that which is below his waist
And in the same way if the disruption is in two parts of the belly: then place your attention and your care always in this, that the part which has the wound should be above the other part.
It is necessary in large wounds and in medium wounds to take this into consideration.
In small wounds, place this according to what is prepared for you.
Then make sure that there is present between your hands the minister who holds the entire disruption with his hand: and close his lips.
Then take out from it those who follow the suture one after the other: and this is the common method of stitching one
And it is necessary to take an awl, or the number of awls according to the quantity of the wound's amplitude.
Then take away from the edge of the disruption the quantity of an index finger, that is, the physician: and fix the awl one beyond which you put the thread into the skin at two extremities, with two extremities of the fat which is under the skin from the inside, until you have made the skin penetrate from another part, and you have gathered together two extremities of the skin, and two extremities of the fat: and there are four orders
Then suture with a double thread around the circumference of the awl several times until two lips of the wound are aggregated with a decent aggregation.
Release the breadth of the finger also, and fix in place an obtuse angle at another point: afterwards draw back the suture with the thread as you did with the first needle.
Do not cease to make it until you have completed the constriction of the whole wound
And let there be medium-sized needles between the breadth and the thickness: because the fine needles easily slip through flesh: and the large ones are difficult to pass through the skin: for this reason it is necessary that there be medium-sized ones in the thickness, and the breadth.
It is not permitted to pierce the skin at two adjacent extremities: so that the flesh is not easily pierced, and the wound does not open before its consolidation, and does not lengthen even with the suture, so that the wound is not obstructed from its consolidation
Then pierce the extremity of the needle, so that it does not wound the patient during his sleep: and place on the skin small cushions from the wool from all sides, which hold the extremities of the needles: and release them when you know that the wound has consolidated
And this is the kind of suture which is more suitable for small wounds.
For these wounds one, or two, or a few needles are sufficient for the suture.
The second kind of suture is common, so that the extremities are four: two of the skin and two of fat in one wound, with a needle in which the thread is even in thickness and breadth
Then when you have pierced with the needle the four extremities, reduce the needle from the part from which you began so that the thread which has been drawn back falls from the upper part of the wound: so that the suture is like the stitching of cloth, and put between every stitch as much of the thickness of the smaller finger
Men know this suture.
When such a suture has been made, men know that a wound has occurred in the belly which was caused by a knife, and that the wound was of great size, for it had burst open for two palms from the middle of the intestine, and there was a rupture in the middle of the belly.
And so he reduced it after he had put the intestine outside the wound at the end of twenty-four hours.
And it was consolidated in a space which lasted for about fifteen days: and I cared for it, and it healed: and he went on living for many years afterwards, living in his accustomed manner.
And the physicians judged that it would not heal.</start_of_turn>
And indeed, it was a miracle that it healed without ointment.</start_of_turn>
For I was in a place where unguentum could not be found, and no one among the physicians had it.</start_of_turn>
I put upon the wound a bandage twice a day, and I bathed it with warm water every day, until it healed.</start_of_turn
And there are two kinds of sutures which I shall relate according to the narration of the sermon.</start_of_turn
And thus you begin with a sharp suture: and you penetrate from the outside inwards towards the interior.</start_of_turn
When you have thus pierced the skin, and in the lacertum of the skin, according to the length and breadth of the entire body: withdraw the point of the needle in the side where you inserted the needle, and make penetrate from the inside outwards in the opposite side at the other end.</start_of_turn
When you have thus made the penetration, then make the penetration once more in this way in the same side from the outside inwards: and withdraw the point of the needle which is in this side, and make penetrate the needle from the inside outwards in the opposite side at the other end: and make penetrate with your penetration as you make the penetration in the point of the needle which is in the outside, until you have pierced the whole thing.</start_of_turn
Then commence also from this side likewise, and draw out the same with the extremity which is from the heel on the other side, and extract the point from the skin as it has penetrated.
Then reduce the skin to this side also, and draw out the heel which is on the other side with this extremity: and extract the point from the skin as it has penetrated, and make this part whole once more, and the other: make this part whole after the other, until the entire limb is according to this example
And the sum of all these sutures is like that of the sutures of the skin: thus that you draw out one part from one extremity of the skin, and draw out the other part from the other extremity, until you have completed it.
The second kind of proper suture which Gale has mentioned.
This is the explanation which Gale has said concerning the way in which some physicians join together every part in order to make it equal in proportion, and apply one extremity of the heel to the other heel, and the other extremity to the other heel.
And this is done according to what I have said.
It is necessary to bring the point of the awl close to the inner part of the heel from the outer side, and make the point penetrate inwards only in this place: and draw out the two heels.
Then draw out the point again, and make the point penetrate from the outer side to the inner side of the two heels, namely on both sides
And draw out both of them again, and make them penetrate from the inside to the outside in the two other heels which are on the opposite side
And this method of stitching is the best of all common sutures, and is the suture whose progress is remembered.
This is indeed the word of Galen.
Some have said this also
The gut suture is corrected with two cubes.
That is, introduce into the belly two threads: and begin with the needle which is beside you, and make it pass through until it reaches the other side, following the suture which is between the layers of skin.
And know that when the rupture is in the middle of the gut: then the suture of that is more difficult than the rest of the gut
The judgment of the ulcer of the wound is the judgment of the rest of the wounds
That is, because when you follow the wound along with its blood, before it changes itself: and you reduce the intestine, and bring the gut back in place: then you put on the powder of incense on the wound
For if the air has changed the wound: then put on over it some unguents which are to you present, until they make pus: and the thread will fall out, and the wound will be consolidated, and the pain will cease
Then care for this in the same way as for the care of the rest of the wounds, until it heals
But if there are no medicinal preparations with you: then put on over it immediately, from which it begins to emit pus, soft wool: and change it twice a day, as I have told you, until it heals
If however you fear that the wound communicates with the major limbs in the lesion: then you must immerse wool lint in lukewarm water, or in rose-water: and put it around the parts which are between the groin and the armpits
If he feels pain, or swelling, or putrefaction in his intestines (for this often happens to him), then let him drink a cluster of vinegar, black, warm: especially if the putrefaction has already penetrated into the intestine, and an opening has been made through to its cavity.
And know that that which is ex the great intestine is easier to heal: and that which is ex the small intestine is more difficult to heal.
The large intestine, however, which is called Ieiunum, does not suffer healing from a wound that has happened in it throughout: and this is because of the multitude of its veins, and the greatness of them, and because of the subtlety of its body, and for its nearness to its own nature of nerves
If, however, that which proceeds from the wound is a hernia, and you must reduce it: reduce it according to your reduction of the intestines equally.
If, however, it has passed beyond that space, and has become black, or dark: then it is necessary that you bind it up with a thread above the place which has become denigrated from it, so that the blood flow does not issue from it.
For in the hernia are veins and arteries.
Then cut that which is beyond that ligament, and put two hanging threads from the lower part of the wound outside of it: so as to alleviate the attraction of it, and the extraction of it from the case of the hernia, and the emission of pus from the wound.
Remember the wound that happened in the Intestine.
When a disruption happens in the Intestine, and it is small: then it is possible, in some men, that it may be restored: because I saw that which was wounded in the middle of the abdomen with the blow of a lance, and it was a wound from the right side of the abdomen, and it was old: and a fistula was made, and it went out from it egestion, and swelling
I undertake the care of him until I am relieved from his treatment: neither shall I cease to work subtily until he is healed, and until the place is firm and stable.
Once I have completed the treatment, I fear over the patient lest something else happen to him which might cause him further harm: and nothing of that kind has happened to him from me
I remain in better moods, eating and drinking, trusting and confident, having bathed and exercised in his diet.
And some physicians have said that when there is a wound in the intestines and it is slight: then it should be bound up in this way.
And it is like taking large ants.
Then join together two lips of the wound, and put an ant between the two lips of the wound which have the opening over the two lips of the wound.
When you have put the ant on top of that, and closed the opening, cut off its head, and bind it firmly, and do not unbind it
And put another ant beside the first one, and do not cease doing this until you have done as much as the whole wound
Then reduce the wound and its opening.
These heads remain annexed in the intestines until the intestines are healed, and are healed, and do not cause harm to the patient any further. It is also possible to bind up the intestines even with a fine thread: which has been taken from the intestines of an animal, and is annexed to this when it is introduced into the belly
And take the extremity of this thread from the intestine, and remove much of it.
Then the ligature in its extremity is taken up by a fine thread.
Then insert the thread into the knot, and pass it with it through the intestine.
Then draw it down to the disruption (of the tissue). And in this manner of suturing with hooks and intestine, there is no less need than with confidence and hope.
You know that which is great, wide, especially if it is in a slender intestine: then there is no skill except subtility, and no healing is to be found at all
Concerning the care of ulcers and fistula.
Chapter 88.</start_of_turn>
You know that every wound, or swelling when it grows old and decays, and becomes an ulcer, and does not consolidate, and always emits pus, and does not heal: then it is called universally in any part of the body a fistula, and we call it Zuchemen.</start_of_turn>
And a fistula is indeed according to truth a filtered knot, hard, white: with which there is no pain, which has the shape of a bird's wing: and because of this some call it Risati, that is, a wing.</start_of_turn
And sometimes in some hours it is moist, which emits pus.</start_of_turn
And sometimes the moisture may split in some hours.</start_of_turn
And when this moisture is much, and is little: and is great, and is soft.</start_of_turn
And as I have already said in the discourse, then when I said that every ulcer which does not heal, neither is born in that flesh, is not because of one single cause.</start_of_turn
When one is suffering from a lack of blood in the body: or from the malice of its nature: or because between the inner and outer lips there is a hard substance which hinders the natural growth of flesh: or because there are many ulcers and pus: or because an ulcer in itself is putrid and the matter which comes out of it is of bad quality: or because the medicine is inappropriate for its treatment: or because corruption is falling in the region, which is a kind of pestilence: or because of some characteristic of the region, as for example in Caesaraugusta, where digestion is difficult for patients and recovery from illness is delayed by nature: or because there is only one bone, or many bones.
I have mentioned all these causes and signs and their treatments with the physicians in discussion. It is necessary for you to write here the treatment for fistula and stone, which is done by one operation with the hand.
You know therefore that fistula can occur in all parts of the body.
There are various kinds of fistula which proceed from one great vessel or artery, or nerve, or sac: or intestine, or bladder, or some bone: or from some joint or composition of bones: such as the hand and foot. And there are those which arise from the proximity of a principal limb and of like things
Thus, the fistula of this kind is caused by difficult and incurable ailments, and is associated with laboriousness and ignorance
If, however, the depth of any fistula does not reach these places which I have mentioned, and if you hope and trust in its treatment, and wish to achieve knowledge of it, then attempt to draw out the matter by air or by instrument, if the fistula follows a straight course. Inquire about it with the physician concerning the matter itself
If, however, there is a twist in the Fistula, then investigate it with a fine lead weight.
For the lead weight, on account of its gentle weight, will adhere to the curve of the twist.
If the Fistula has multiple orifices, it is not possible to do this with a fine weight alone
So draw out the gut from each orifice of the orifices of it.
For the humidity which you draw out causes the gut to slip from other orifices, and runs out from them.
Then inquire carefully in what way it is possible: whether it is bone or nerve, and that the Fistula is long or short: or that the Fistula is one having multiple orifices, and is stretched over all of it, with the sum of your force: with your inquiry of the patient and the discovery of pain on compression with your hand over the place, and similar signs and symptoms following.
When you have stood at all these positions truly, then proceed to treatment with confidence: that is to say, you must consider whether the Fistula is near and apparent, or far from the junction, or from a nerve, or artery, or vein, or any place which I have mentioned: then dry the Fistula according to what has been said above from the narration, and take out what is in it from the filtration, and corrupted meat, which is born from the orifice in the meat, or pus, and similar things: and care for her until she is healed.
If, however, the Fistula is of great depth, and is according to the rule: then it is necessary to open her up as deeply as possible
And then remove from her all her corrupted meat
Then administer the round pills in acute medicines: and introduce them until you have encompassed the fistulous cavity with iron: do this with the former as often as necessary, until the acute medicine has eaten away the whole of what remains in the fistulous cavity from corruption.
Then restore it with the unguents which generate healthy flesh, until it is healed.
If indeed it does not heal by this, then cauterize it according to what we have said before
If indeed the cause of the fistula is bone, and you suspect that to be the case: then inquire about it, and dry it up according to what I have told you: if it does not prevent you from anything from the limb or from the bone or from any main nerve, as we have said
If indeed it is detected that the bone is there, and there is some corruption and blackness: then burn it out until the corruption of it is entirely gone.
Then care for it with that which nourishes it, until it is healed.
When if it does not heal, and pus comes out as before: then you know that you have not brought about the entire eradication of the corruption
Reveal it further according to this, and bring about an explanation of it, and an explanation of the surrounding area with your greatest diligence
Then restore it.
If indeed it heals, that is good: and if not, you know that that corruption is in a profound depth of the body, which you have not been able to overcome
It is not in this way that you will overcome it, except by leaving it to the natural course of things
If indeed the small bone is corrupted, and it is possible for you: draw it out with fine forceps which fit to it
If there are many bones, then make an exquisite attraction of them all, and do not send anything forth from your hand with your fortitude.
If indeed there is moisture in something and there is no fear of incision, or of error: then incise those moist parts and flesh, if there are any, and liberate the bones.
If indeed the bones are not prepared for extraction from your hand, then place upon it what will cause it to putrefy: and send it away, until it has putrefied what is around the bones from the flesh and moisture
And keep an ointment on it so that it does not harden.
And let the incision be as small as you made it in your operation
And put upon it, if necessary, a bandage soaked in sulfur dust with oil: or a bandage soaked in Egyptian unguent, or any other unguents of your desire.
For when they putrefy, these indeed are the moist parts, and they are separated from the bones, the bleeding will be alleviated from the extraction of them, and their attraction will be perfect
If indeed there is a large bone, such as a thigh bone or a hip bone, and the like of them, and what is corrupted from it is great: then take away that part with the utmost reason, until that black spot and corruption is gone
And then restore the wound.
If indeed what is corrupted is great, and the corruption has reached the marrow of the bone, then it is necessary to cut through it entirely, and to open it up to the depth where the corruption is: then care for it until it has healed And I tell you, what happened to me in my own leg: that you may take it as an example and an assistant for your operation.
A youth of about thirty years of age suffered pain in his leg, because something had moved above its middle within the body, that is, from within, until it reached the thigh, and there was swelling: and there was no external cause for it.
The swelling lasted for some time with the error of the physicians, until the abscess opened, and many materials came out with it.</start_of_turn>
And after that, the healing took place, until the thigh was bound up, and many holes were made in it: which all emitted pus and moistened the body.</start_of_turn>
The physicians treated him for two years altogether, and there was no knowledge of the art of the hand in it, until I was called, and I saw his leg and the materials which were running out of those holes: even all the men who saw him fainted, and his color grew pale.</start_of_turn>
There was an attempt to reach one of the holes with their hands, and the attempt reached the bone.</start_of_turn>
Then I examined all the holes: and I found that they all communicated with each other throughout the thigh.</start_of_turn I treated him accordingly, and I closed one of the holes, until I reached a piece of bone: and I found it corrupted: for it was broken, defaced, putrified, and perforated, until it had penetrated as far as the marrow.</start_of_turn
I saw what was detected to me, and prepared it from the broken bone.</start_of_turn
And I judged that there was no soundness in the bone except for that corruption, which I cut away and closed.</start_of_turn>
And I extirpated it.</start_of_turn>
Then I establish the restoration of the wound along with the consolidated physicians in a spacious place.
It is not consolidated yet.</start_of_turn>
Then I attempted to restore it.</start_of_turn>
It is not restored yet.</start_of_turn
Then I restored it with the physicians, and it was consolidated quickly, and healed: and no further operation was necessary for this purpose, except for the disposition of the weakness of the patient, and his little tolerance, and my fear of death for him, because he was suffering from all these things from excessive evacuation of the bad humors.</start_of_turn
He was healed completely: and was born in the place of the hard bone, and a good disposition was made in his body, and his spirit returned to him: and he recovered in his own dispositions: and he did not suffer from any obstacle in walking or sleeping ever after.</start_of_turn
But if the prominent bone in the body is fractured: then it is necessary to support it thus: take a ligament and bind the extremity of the prominent bone: and command someone to extend it upwards: and put another ligament from a thicker thread than the first.</start_of_turn Then bind the ligament over the flesh which is upon the bone: and extend the extremity of it, so that you draw the flesh downwards: and you will see the flesh above the place where you wish to cut, so that it does not damage the flesh.</start_of_turn
Place wood or a board under the lower bone in the center: since when you do this, it does not hinder that it will cut corrupted flesh.
The incision should be made close to the corrupted area, so as not to cause damage to the bone, and must not protrude excessively so as to cause pain or discomfort to the patient. If the bone is corrupted and does not protrude, the surrounding parts must be preserved with the part that is corrupted: and the corruption is in the middle or in that part: then remove the flesh from all sides of the entire bone
Then place a lower wood.
Afterwards make the incision from the first part where the corruption is, until the incision reaches the other side: and let the incision be of equal length to the corruption, as we have said before
If the corruption is at the junction, make an incision through the corrupted junction and cut the bone where the corruption continues on the other side
If indeed the corruption is in the continuation of two junctions, then it is not in that area except by abrasion.
If the corruption is in the palm of the hand, or in the sole of the foot: then the matter is difficult and dangerous
It is true that you must inquire about the nature of the corruption.
And abrade carefully the surrounding area as much as you are able, and remove the corrupted part according to any method that seems good to you: when it does not cause damage to the vein or nerve.
You must know that for the cutting of bones, and the making of incisions, there are many instruments, according to the position of the bones, and their preparation, and their length, and their breadth, and their thickness, and their rarity.
Wherever it is necessary, prepare an instrument suitable for each kind of operation.
Know that these operations are great and significant concerning the kind of instrument which is suitable for them, for they demand long experience in their study
And you will recognize the modes of this art by the evidence of the modes of the diseases: for then you will find that it agrees with them from the instruments in respect of all illnesses
The Shape of the Knife.
The Shape of the other Knife
The Shape of the other Knife again
The Shape of the Knife once more
This shape of the Knife is made with the blade slightly off-center Let its arch be above, its point from the steel: and its handle from the box, and let it be pyramid-shaped and off-center
The Shape of the Scissors for Sutures
Let the head of this Scissors be in the shape of the head of the stellate key: and its points according to the shape of the holes of the needle-holder
And it does not suit except when it is rough against that head of the sutures, when it is broken or when the bone is broad and large
The Shape of the larger Scissors
The Shape of the medium Scissors
The Shape of the broad Scissors
The Shape of the Scissors which have a concavity
The form of the rash is different from the others.
The form of the rash is different from the others in that it is more widespread on the extremities
The rash is small and faint in colour.
The rash accompanies bone fractures.
The rash is also large in size
This resembles a wound made by a knife, and the extremities are like mountains: it appears in many places because of the fracture of the bones.
The form of the rash agrees with the cause of the wound in the bones
The extremities are triangular in shape, and the edges of the extremities are acute
Like that of India
It is like that which we said of rashes, incisions and mountains
Concerning the incision of the extremities and the suture of the bones
Chapter 89
The extremities are putrefied, either by an external cause or an internal cause.
When therefore you have treated the disease with medicines, and the cure has not been effected: if you do not cut away the corruption of the limb which has not been remedied by the medicines, the patient will either die from the disease or from the defect of the limb itself
And the sign of this is that the limb becomes black, either because it is burnt by fire or putrefies after it has been blackened: until the putrefaction of the limb has advanced to such an extent that it extends throughout the whole body
So then you must make an incision in this case, and in the same way if the cause of the corruption is a wound from some venomous creature: such as a scorpion of the sea, a spider, a flea, and things of that sort
If there is any corruption, or percussion [of the bone] is at the extremity of the finger, then cut off the finger, and do not leave the space of the corruption, but cut on until the whole hand is done.
If the same happens in the hand, then cut off the hand from the root of the bone, and do not leave the space of the corruption, but cut until the forearm is complete.
If it happens in the forearm, then cut off the forearm at the elbow joint If, however, the corruption has passed beyond the elbow, and you go round the elbow: then that is the death of the patient.
And to administer besides this from care, is the quantity of blood.
And similarly do with the foot, when the corruption comes to the finger, then cut off the finger at one of the joints: and if it comes to the heel of the foot, then cut off the whole foot.
If it comes up to the knee, then cut off the leg at the knee joint
If the corruption has gone above the knee, then there is no recovery in this, except dismissal, and leaving the patient to die.
And the way to cut off a limb, or to preserve it, is to string the ligaments below, which you wish to cut: and string another ligament above the place.
And extend one minister ligament downwards: and extend another minister ligament upwards
And you separate the flesh which is between two ligaments, with a saw having a broad blade, until the whole flesh is gone.
Then cut or preserve
And it is necessary that you take away from all parts of the limb a strip of skin, and do not touch the healthy place: and you must add injury to the patient, and make the swelling cold.
If blood flow inside should increase while working, then cauterize the place immediately: or put above it some powder which will absorb the blood.
Return then to your medicine until completion is reached.
Then bind the wounded limb with a bandage suitable for it, and care for it until it heals
And I say that this happened to me in my foot, thus also happens to me.
That is, because it happened in my foot at night, with a burning which assimilates with the fire: and the corruption of that happened first in my finger, until the whole foot was affected
He therefore withdrew from himself, after he had cut away the corruption of the limb with an excision of its gangrene, which he found from pain and burning: and it healed at the junction of the bones
And after a long time had passed, the same corruption happened to him in the thumb of his hand again He came to me, and I attempted to restore his limb with the things which I placed on his hand by the physicians after the purification of his body: and the superfluity did not disappear, but it began to spread to another finger: until the corruption spread to his hand itself
He called me to cut off his hand: and I did not do it, hoping for the return of the superfluous limb: and I also feared for his life at the incision of his hand itself.
For the man's courage was great in this case.
When he had despaired of me, he went away from home: and he returned to me again from that place because he had become better, and he cut off his whole hand: and it healed
Neither listen to this narration, except that it be an aid concerning that which falls from the kind of this disease: and that it be meaningful as it is signified, and according to how it is done.
Neither heed this tale except that it be of service concerning the care of bones and the quality of blistering with the physicians.
Chapter 90.
When swelling happens in some limb by carnation, and the space of the swelling is prolonged until collection of pus has taken place: then it is burst or pierced, and what is in it is expelled, and the place is left empty as though it were a cavity: and the skin which is over it is like a membrane which has been stretched out: and it does not reach its ultimate corruption, neither does it reach the bone, nor the nerve, nor the ligament: it is called a sinus, and not a fistula, indeed if its space is prolonged until corruption affects some parts of the limb, then it is called a fistula, or swelling
And its care is that you cut through the whole skin as it is wrinkled: and especially when it has been stretched out like a membrane: and trust that it does not adhere to the place, because of its corruption
But if you hope that the skin will adhere and that no corruption will result from this: and if there is hardness in the skin from the flesh, then care for it with blistering: and consider it as a sinus
Then if it is large, and the pus which comes out of it has a foul odor: then blistering is to be done with Egyptian medicine, which is vinegar, oil, and saffron, equal parts, gathered in a cavity: and they are boiled over fire until the medicine boils: and it is added to honey
Then take out from it what you need: and dissolve it with water and honey, and blister with it the sinus: and close its opening, and give the medicine for two hours.
Then extract it with expression: do that every day until the sinus is healed and the stench is gone.
When it has been plastered with burnt lime, when it is not present, take burnt lime of wood or of ilex, and sprinkle it on water.
Then extract it, and plaster it with this, until you are confident that the sinus has been removed
If the patient does not tolerate the Egyptian medicine, nor burnt lime and water, then plaster it with water and honey, to which something of ground cinnamon has been added
Or plaster it with honey and wine mixed together, because honey has the property of healing and drying: and the wine makes the sinus adhere, especially when there is excess of astringency and dryness in it.
When you have done this a few times, and you are confident that the corruption of the sinus has passed away: then plaster it with something that makes flesh grow in it.
And it is good to take from the plaster diaphnesicon: and dissolve it with rose water and wine: or plaster it with some medicine, and anoint with others, of whose properties are written in the treatise on unguents
If the opening of the sinus is narrow, in which a canula of the plaster will not pass: then widen it with tin or put in the cavity a piece of lint soaked in Egyptian unguent, or in castor oil, until it is widened
And in like manner if it is also a wide opening, then gather its lips together with stitches: and withdraw from it as much as is contained in the plaster without adding anything.
If, therefore, the opening from which the pus runs out is elevated towards above: then dry it in the hollow place which is in itself, so that the pus may run out from that as far as below; for when the pus is collected in depth, it hinders the generation of flesh in it.
If it is not possible to dry the sinus somewhat below its lower part as desired: then try to prepare the limb with the preparation which will cause the pus to flow out more easily as desired
Try not to retain anything of the pus at all in it: and take solidifying medicines which are placed over the sign, suitable for this purpose
And extend them over the membrane of the skin.
And let the membrane be of such a quantity as to make communication of the whole sinus possible.
Then pierce with forceps directly at the opening of the sinus, making the opening of the sinus larger.
Then stretch out from fine threads over another membrane, according to the quantity of the hole: and place it upon that in a long position away from the opening of the sinus, so that it may alleviate the escape of pus from that: and do not make the membrane too large, except after a few days or so once a day.
He who is above the opening of the sinus should move in every hour, so that what is aggregated in it from the pus may go out: and you will know whether it is going out much or little, or digested or undigested.
And with this consider again the place of the sinus itself, whether it feels pain in itself, or whether there is no pain in it, or whether there is swelling in it, or whether there is no swelling in it
When you have thus completed your treatment in this way, and you have seen what comes out from the opening of the sinus: then you will know whether the sinus is still adhering, or has approached adherence: then you must remove it in the morning, or on the third day: and when you remove it, then renew the dressing. If, however, it escapes from the Sinus beyond a long space, do not despair of its adherence, for its healing approaches, because from men are those who delay the generation of flesh in their wounds, and from beasts are those who act contrariwise to that.
If, however, it escapes from the Sinus after many days with undigested pus, then you know that the Sinus does not adhere
If, therefore, the adherence of the Sinus is delayed and its condition is prolonged: then add in the treatment the physicians, who are indeed physicians, who make the substances both moist and dry: like unguentum dyafinicon, when added to it the excess of addition from the zega.
And from the last thing which is to be cured, that is, to take unguentum dyafinicon and dissolve it with rose water, and apply it over the old liquid equal in amount to the substance itself
Then mix it with this and use it.
And it does the same thing to this, when there is no unguentum dyafinicon present, honey, when you boil it down, until it thickens, and you use that with it.
Or take myrrh, and aloes, and olibanum: mix them all together, and grind that up over honey while it is over the fire.
Then apply on the surface of the wound, and bind it over the Sinus: and apply with the honey which you boiled down, until it has thickened: and grind over it the species, and put on the wound, and bind it.
And when administered in that aristolochia longa, and roots of lilium coelestis, and is lily: and barley herb, and centaurea.
Use simple or compound instruments, and these alone; and the chisel itself: and powder on wax as I have said, and use it.
If the matter of the sinus persists and does not heal with this treatment: then you know that there is corruption in its depth: either that it makes an impression in the bones, or in the other hard parts, or in the ligaments: then treat it as fistula, as has been said before. As for the treatment of panaritis and nail drawn out, and incision of the finger added, and section.
Chapter XC.
Panaritis is a swelling that arises under the nail of the thumb or finger of the hand, or foot: and sometimes it arises in the rest of the fingers.
When it persists, and is neglected, and the swelling grows, the nail becomes soft: or it is broken and pus comes out of it until it destroys the root of the nail: and sometimes it breaks the whole thing, and sometimes the corruption reaches the bone, and there is a foul odor: and the limb becomes wide, and its color becomes dark.
When you have treated it as we have said above, and the cure does not take hold: then it is necessary to cut away the whole superabundance that remains from the nail with a knife
Then cauterize the nail afterwards.
The cautery is to be used cautiously
If indeed the bone is sound, and the nail is also sound, and the fat of the nail is still adhering to the meat inside, and it is beginning to irritate itself: then it is necessary to place a piece of radium beneath the nail at an angle so that it presses down on the meat; and cut through the meat easily, and place over that which remains of the meat which has been burned by the doctors, corrosive and astringent, until it has vanished
Then care for it until it is healed.
If, however, corruption has set in the bone, then it is necessary to cut away the bone and extract it: for it will not heal as long as the corrupt part remains in it.
If you see the decay and corruption advancing in the finger, then cut it at one of the joints, as has been mentioned previously concerning its reminder
Then care for it until it is healed.
If, however, there should be attrition or concussion of the nail, or if there is pain in it: then it is necessary to bleed the diseased part at the outset.
Then dry the nail with a sharp spatula from above downwards to the tip
And take care, lest the cutting should penetrate the flesh under the nail, for thereby you will cause additional pain and swelling to the diseased part
Then care for the place with it which rests pain.
A finger which has been added which was born in the hands of men, perhaps is altogether fleshy: perhaps there is some bone in it, perhaps there is the nail in it: and sometimes some of them are born from the root of the joint, or the nature of it is in some node of the finger
He who is born in some node of the finger does not move: and he who is born near the joint of the finger, perhaps moves
He who is born of bone is easily cut
That is, as you would cut the nail with a broad spatula from the root downwards
As for him whose nature is in the root of the joint, the cure is difficult

Then draw the ligature around the limb from the upper part of the thigh down to the lower part of the knee with the gutta.
Then make a knot at one, two, or three wide places.</start_of_turn>
Then draw out the limb until blood has drained out as much as the patient's condition tolerates.</start_of_turn
Then bind the limb: and command him to abstain from foods that generate black bile: and repeat the evacuation and the phlebotomy, when the veins are full, and this will be beneficial for the patient.</start_of_turn
The elevation of the limb is to be done in this manner.</start_of_turn>
If there are many hairs on the limb, shave them off.</start_of_turn
Then immerse the limb in a bath: or bind it in the limb with warm water, until the veins become red, and swell: or perform an exercise of strength, if there is no bath available, until the limb is warmed.</start_of_turn
Then dry the skin along the line of the vein: or at the end of the limb near the knee, or at the lower part of the limb near the heel.</start_of_turn
Then open the skin with needles, and scrape the vein from all sides, until sensation returns: and it is at the return of sensation that the blood in the limb turns red from black.</start_of_turn
When it comes out of the skin, the blood is like a white cord.</start_of_turn
Then introduce the instrument under the edge of the radium, until it rises and emerges from the skin: suspend it with a single hook, firm.
Then perform another incision nearby, about the width of three fingers wide.
Then remove the skin from the upper part of the bone until it appears.
Then raise the instrument with the radium as you did before, and suspend it with another hook, as you did before
Then perform another incision, or several incisions, if necessary
Then raise it up, and cut the last incision at the heel
Then extract the instrument from the incision above the instrument itself
And do this until you have extracted the instrument from all the incisions, until the wound has healed: then make another incision
If, however, it does not yield to being extracted and raised: then introduce a strong needle with a double thread, and ligate the instrument, and extract it: or introduce the instrument under the radium: and move your hand over the whole, until it comes out
Take care not to cut through it
For if it is cut through, it is difficult to extract the instrument without causing damage to the surrounding area
When you have finally extracted the instrument: then place over the wound a bandage soaked in wine and rose oil, or oil: and care for the wound until it has healed.
If the vein is contracted, having a twist which involves parts, and is not as we have described according to the rule: then you must find on the instrument over all the twist of it, and the place of the twist itself
Then suspend the bowels with the hooks until the whole belly has been elevated: and be careful at the section above the belly that you do not cut through any blood vessels or wound them: for it is difficult to elevate or extract the bowels above.
Therefore be prudent.
The formation of the incision where life is healed.</start_of_turn>
The formation of the incision of the blind gut.</start_of_turn
It has no curvature like the other incisions, neither is it acute at the extremities, so as not to wound the blood vessels: and it is large in extent, gentle: for if it were slight, it would tear the blood vessels by its slightness. Indeed it is better to have a large extent than a slight one.</start_of_turn>
On the extraction of the vein of the thigh.</start_of_turn Chapter XCIII.</start_of_turn
This vein is generated in the thighs in warm countries, like Alizegi and the Arabs, and in dry, warm countries, few in number, that is, in which no herb or tree grows.</start_of_turn
And perhaps it is also generated in other parts of the body besides the thighs.</start_of_turn
And its generation is from the putrefaction that occurs under the skin, like that which occurs inside the bodies of serpents and worms ascarides, and worms generated between the skin and the flesh.</start_of_turn
And the sign of the beginning of this vein is that which occurs in the thigh inflammation and swelling.</start_of_turn
Then the place is dried.</start_of_turn
Then the vein is extracted from the place of drying, as if it were the root of a plant, or an animal.</start_of_turn
When therefore it appears from that extremity [of the limb], then it is necessary that you involve over the very body of the lead, whose weight is from a drachma to two drachmas and a nodus of itself: and discharge the suspended lead from the leg.
When therefore it appears from that extremity something outwards, involve that in lead and nod it.
If it continues for a long time, then cut off part of it, and involve the rest
Do not cut through the root before the whole thing has gone out.
For if you cut through, it contracts and goes into the flesh: and makes the swelling swell up, and brings about bad ulcers, and putrefaction in the place, and a bad ulcer.
Therefore it is necessary that it be gently pulled out slowly, until it comes out whole from its end: and nothing remains of it in the body: and from this it goes out through some vessel in a man which is equal in length to five palms and ten fingers
And so it has come to me, for it has gone out of the body for twenty palms.
If however it happens to you at the hour of your treatment: then introduce radium into its cavity and perforate it with a long hole, as with the body, until everything that is in it is evacuated: and administer the putrefaction of the place with the doctors for a few days. Then care for the swelling.
And this vein when it has many branches, especially when it appears at the junction of the foot, or in the foot itself: and there are many holes in it, and it goes out through every hole branch
Care for it as we said before, and as is prescribed
About the section above the worms generated under the skin, and it is called the bovine disease.
About the section above the worms generated under the skin, and it is called the bovine disease.
It is called the bovine disease in our land because it frequently happens to bulls; and it is a small worm which is born between the skin and the flesh.
And it goes throughout the body, ascending and descending: and it is perceptible to the sense during its walk from limb to limb, until it bursts wherever it bursts through the skin in the place, and comes out
And its generation is from the corruption of some humors.
Just like worms and serpents, that is to say, lice and roundworms in the belly
And they are feared for their malice
When it itself goes into the body, and ascends to the head, and persists in the place: then perhaps it bursts open there, and comes out, and destroys the eye: and this frequently happens.
When you want to cure it, and extract it, then it does not cease until during its walk and its appearance to the sense
It is necessary therefore to string that which is above it and that which is under it with strong ligature.
Then dry over it, and extract it.
If it has penetrated deeply into the flesh, and you do not find it: then put a cautery over the place with fire until it dies
And more than that, it is the corruption of it which corrupts the eye, as we said If, however, you see that the eye is still moving in the head near the eye, then string under it over the eyebrow a strong bandage.
Then dry above it and extract it.
And it is necessary that the patient should be bound about with salves that dissolve harmful humors.
And let him beware of foods that generate putrefaction.
Of the incision above the eye-brow Nakir.
Day XCVI.
This ailment is called Nakir in our land: and it is a pain which arises in some member: then it is transferred from member to member.
And indeed I have seen it myself, as I have told you.
I was called to a woman who was sick in some village
And I found her arm swollen and fluid in the vein of the arm
And after an hour had passed, I saw that another swelling was proceeding with worms, so that it went up to his shoulder as quickly as possible: as quickly as silver runs from one place to another.
The pain therefore departed from that place and settled in the shoulder
And after an hour it went away throughout the body, until it reached the other arm
And she told me that it had repeated itself throughout her whole body, as I saw
I was amazed at the speed of its change from member to member
And indeed I had never seen this ailment before like this before
Truly many are the people who suffer from pain that changes from limb to limb: and not the eye itself, like the eye in a woman.
I do not believe this to be the case, except in the case of women, from whom the swelling of the lower limbs is detected: hence it appears that the sense of touch is perverted by this displacement.
It is necessary that these things do not appear according to this reason in those who are delicate and have moist bodies, with hidden swelling of the veins
When therefore he has received treatment for this, and the patient feels that the pain has ceased: then, if it appears in the eye, as we have said, then grasp above and below the eye quickly: and dry above the eye until the swelling has gone: and cauterize the place.</start_of_turn>
If however you do not see the eye itself: then cure it with an outward application, and with that which expels the swelling, and anoint it with saffron and similar things.</start_of_turn>
(The provided text does not include information regarding the extraction of arrows, so I cannot translate this portion.)</start_of_turn>
(The provided text does not include a chapter header, so I cannot translate this portion.)</start_of_turn> Arrows are varied according to their kind, and according to the place from which they fall from the body.
Their variety is great: for some have large teeth and few, and some are concave and some are convex.</start_of_turn>
And there are those which have three angles.</start_of_turn
And those which have tongues.</start_of_turn
And those which have stars.</start_of_turn
The ailments that are beside the limbs in which they fall, are according to two modes.
Or else the limbs are from the principal limbs which are hollow, such as the brain, and the heart, and the liver, and the lung, and the kidneys, and the intestines, and the bladder, and the like.
When therefore it falls into any one of these limbs, and there appear to you signs of death, which I will tell you afterwards, then it is necessary that you extract the arrow from that limb, for death follows its course in that place in many positions.
And when these signs of sickness do not appear, and the arrow is not hidden in the depth of the limb, then extract it and care for the wound
From the signs then of the brain when it falls in this way, and the arrow penetrates the bone, and comes out upon the brain, is: because there arise from it soda which causes vomiting, and swelling, and dizziness, and redness of the eyes, and inflation, and redness of the tongue, and spasm, and mixture of the intellect, and vomiting of bile.
And perhaps blood comes out from the nostrils, or from the ears.
And perhaps speech is broken, and the voice is destroyed
And there comes out from the place of the wound a white moisture like pus
And there comes out from it like the blood of meat
If therefore these signs appear, then abstain from treatment, and extract the arrow if it does not come out.
The signs of the arrow when it falls in the heart are: that it is itself close to the left breast: and it feels as though it were fixed in something hard, not in something soft.
And perhaps the arrow's movement is like that of a pulse: it runs out of the wound of black blood.
And following this comes cold at the extremity, and cold sweat, and fainting
You know therefore that death approaches uncertainly
And a sign of an arrow when it wounds the lung is the exit of bloody foam from the wound: and the following swelling rises up and changes the colour of the patient.
And the great and high spirit departs: and it seeks the attraction of cold air.
If the arrow falls into the chest, which is in the belly: then it is near the flanks: and there is a great sighing with pain and fear, with gasping: and all the limbs of the arms move
If the arrow falls into the stomach: then perhaps it comes out of the wound with some indigestible food
If it falls into the belly and is fixed there: something of stool or urine or intestine which has been broken comes out of the wound
There is no hope in its cure, neither in the extraction of the arrow.
If the arrow falls into the bladder, and urine comes out: and something proceeds from it to the outside, and the pain is strong over the patient: then you know that it is mortal
The rest of the limbs, such as the face, and the neck, and the gut, and the upper lip, and the assistant, and the ribs, and the spine, and the shoulder, and the elbow, and the thigh, and the knee, and the heel, and those things which are like limbs are all affected according to many arrangements: when it does not find the arrow in the artery or the nerve: and there is no venomous arrow
I say that I have seen that these arrows are useful for your treatment.
Because they cure the eye by causing the arrow to penetrate the tear duct of the eye and the root of the nose.
I took it from the other side under the fat of his ear: and he was healed, and no wound remained in his eye
And I extracted another arrow from the Jew, which was embedded in the fat of his eye under his lower eyelid: and the arrow was already covered by the edge of the wood of the bow: it was a great arrow of the Turks, with a leaden head, in which there were no ears.
He was healed therefore, and no evil happened to his eye And I extracted another arrow from the belly of a Christian.
It was an Arab arrow, and that is the kind that has ears
And so over two ribs: and it was submerged in his belly
I held it there until I extracted it: and the Christian was healed
And I extracted another which had been embedded in his bowels: and we thought that he would die from it.
After that, when thirty days had passed and no change had appeared in his condition concerning the arrow, we thought that he would recover without it: so we extracted the arrow and he was healed, and no evil happened to him
I saw a man whose arrow had been lodged in his back, and the wound was closed with a bandage over the wound.
After seven years, the arrow was extracted from the root of his thigh
And indeed a woman came to me who had a sagitta lodged in her belly, and a wound had closed over it on the outside; and the sagitta remained inside: and it had not altered from its previous position, and the woman had no recollection of any natural operation having been performed on her.
And indeed another man came to me who had a sagitta lodged in his face; and a wound had closed over it, and it remained: and he found no great pain associated with it; and such things are frequent.
And I extracted a sagitta from the King's nose, which had lodged there in the middle of his face, and it had descended to the right side below: and the entire sagitta was hidden.
I was summoned to care for him after the incident of the sagitta for three days.
I found the wound of the sagitta to be strict and cold to the touch
I asked him about any tingling sensation there, and he did not feel any; and indeed he himself found the puncture mark and the pain on the right side
I hoped that this was the puncture made by the extremity of the sagitta
I applied plaster to the place where the painful swelling appeared, confident that the swelling would subside, and that the sign of the sagitta would reappear on the surface: and this did not happen in the place of the accident, indicating that the sagitta had not followed its course
I continued to apply the plaster for many days: and no accident happened, and the wound closed in the meantime: and he became conscious of the sagitta once more within his nose on a certain day
And he told me this.
I place therefore over that [area] a sharp knife, corrosive for many days, until it is opened: and when I grasp it with my hand, I note the tip of the arrow that is entangled in the wood.
And then I added to the opening of the wound the said sharp knife until we saw the tip of the arrow clearly: and I passed beyond that with it for about four months.
And when the wound had been enlarged, and I could insert my forceps into it, and move it, and it would not come out: then I did not cease to cauterize, and I applied over it as with the minds of engineers, until I completed over it on a certain day with forceps that I had made, as it happened in the end of the chapter, until I had extracted it
I restored the wound.
And the physicians say that the cartilage of the nose is not restored.
I restored it therefore, and the wound was consolidated and healed completely: and nothing remained of the illness
And I tell you the quality of the extraction of some arrows: so that you may know the rule and the signification of that which I have not said
For the parts of this art and their distinctions are not comprehended by the narration: neither does this book comprehend them, nor does the prudent artificer compare them with many, but rather with few; and because of that which is present, above all that which is absent: and he finds a new operation and a new instrument among the descent of all these arts when these things happen
I say therefore that arrows do not come out of the members in which they are fixed, except according to two ways. Or by extraction from the place from which it entered.
Or from the opposite part.
And that which goes out from the place from which it entered, or that is a proceeding arrow in the fleshy place: it is drawn out, and goes out.
If it does not yield to the drawing out at the time when it falls: then it is necessary that you delay its drawing out for some days, until the flesh surrounding it has become rotten: and then the drawing out will be easier, and will go out more completely
And in like manner if it is in a bone, and does not yield to you at the drawing out: then you must also delay it for some days: and draw out again every day with the drawing and the moving until it comes out completely
If it does not yield to you after days: then you must perforate all around the arrow in the very bone with fine silk thread, until the arrow is loosened
And then draw out the arrow and remove it
If however the arrow is fixed in the head of the bone, and has gone through one of the sinuses of the brain, and appears from the lower part of any of those wounds which I have mentioned: then you must abstain from the drawing out of the arrow, and simply let it go, until it has become equal in size to its former state after a few days.
For if the arrow remains fixed, the decay does not prolong itself to it
And if the arrow is not fixed, except in the body of the bone only, and does not penetrate to the marrow: and remains sick for some days, and no other accident has happened to it: then think of the drawing out of the arrow and its removal
If however it is fixed firmly, and does not yield to you at the drawing out: then apply poultice around the arrow as I have said: then take care of the place, until it is healed
If, however, the arrow is hidden in a part of the body, and is hidden and concealed from sense: then inquire concerning it with a hook.
If you feel it, then grasp it with some instruments which are suitable for its attraction.</start_of_turn>
If, however, you are unable to see above it, because of the constriction of the wound, and because of the length of the arrow in depth: and there is no bone, nor nerve, nor vein: then find above it until the wound be widened, and it is possible to extract the arrow.</start_of_turn>
Which if there be to them ears which hold fast to the flesh fixed in the bone from every part, every thought with which you can think to loose it, and to loosen, if you cannot over the evacuation of the flesh in the fracture of the ears, and the twisting of the ears, until it yields.</start_of_turn
And you when you administer the extraction of the arrow, in whatever place it is, then utilize the twisting of your hand with scissors to all parts, until you make the arrow go away: and with the last little effort, that the arrow does not break, and that it be difficult for you to grasp it, and for its extraction.</start_of_turn
If you are unable to see above it from an hour hence, then leave it for a few days, until the things which are around it have become putrid.</start_of_turn
Then repeat it: for it will be useful to you if it does not make the flow of blood worse. Then administer what we have said in the chapter concerning the care of wounds: and guard your virtue from the incision of the vein, or nerve, or chord.</start_of_turn
And administer skill in every way that you can in order to facilitate the evacuation of the arrow: and let it be with ease, and tranquility, or slowly, and firmly, as I have told you.</start_of_turn
It is necessary that you make the patient conform to the shape of the arrow as it is in the case of an arrow wound.
It is necessary that you make the patient conform to the shape of the arrow as it is in the case of an arrow wound.
If it is not possible to make the patient conform to the shape of the arrow, then do what is possible from the figure.
The arrow which comes out from the opposite side, or which proceeds from that to the outside: make a bulge at the tip of the arrow by means of the sense of the upper part of the skin near it, and remove the surrounding tissue. Dry the wound above and let the section be according to the quantity that they grasp in their forceps.
Then draw out the arrow: it will come out easily by itself
If it remains in the bone, then turn your hand according to the roundness, until you press the arrow into the bone, and expand it: then draw it out
And if not: leave it for a few days: then try it again, until it comes out.
If the arrow is embedded in wood, then drive it out with that.
If the wood breaks, and you wish to administer a drive: then introduce an instrument with a concave edge into the wound so that the concavity of the instrument will be in the heel of the arrow: then drive out the arrow with that
If the arrow is concave, then drive out the arrow with an instrument entering the wound.
The arrow will be driven out by that.
If the arrow is poisonous, then it is necessary to cut away the whole flesh in which the poison is: if this is possible
Then care for it as is fitting.
If an arrow has fallen into the chest, or in the belly, or in the bladder, or on the side: and it is close to what you touch with your hand, and you can cut over it: then cut, and cauter from the incision of the belly, or the nerve, and extract the arrow.
Then apply a bandage, if necessary, and care for it until it is healed.
This is the form of forceps with which arrows are extracted
There are two similar extremities like the beak of a bird, which are made like iron: when they grasp the arrow, they do not slip from it
There are many kinds of forceps, great, small, medium, according to the quantity of the magnitude of the arrow, and its thinness, and the breadth of the wound, and the constriction of it.
Concave Impelling Form
And the Surd Impelling Form
This is the shape of the extremity like a Radius, so that its entrance into the concave arrow is alleviated, and it is driven with it
This concave extremity is concave like the beak of a bird: so that the entrance of the arrow into itself and the driving of it is alleviated
On Phlebotomy of Veins
Chapter 127. The veins that are usually phlebotomized in the body are thirty in number.
Of these, there are six in the head: two pulse veins, which are behind the ears, called the two Herbes: and two arteries which appear in two temporal regions: and two veins which are in the two tear-ducts of the two eyes, which are called Aspicientes: and a vein prepared in the middle of the forehead: and a vein which is at the extremity of the nose
And two guides, which are in the cheek.
And two veins which are in the upper lip of the mouth.
And two veins which are in the lower lip.
And these are the veins which are called Algecherich.
And two veins which are under the tongue
And the veins which are phlebotomized in the arms are five in every arm.
One of them is the Cephalica, and it is from the lateral aspect of the shoulder: and it is called the vein of the head
And the Fusca.
And the Media is composed of the branches of the basilica and the cephalic vein: and it is called the vein of the body
And the Basilica, which is situated in the domestic side: and it is also called the Titillicaris
And it is called the vein of the belly
And the Funis brachii, which is situated above the elbow: and it is in which phlebotomy is performed, and which appears above the thumb in the manifestation of the apposition
And the Saluatella: and it is a vein which is between the annular and the radial: and there are two branches to it
And in the leg and in the foot there are three veins.
One of them is which is under the curvature of the thumb from the lateral side of the shoulder
And the second is the Saphena: and its location is at the ankle from the lateral side of the foot
And the heel: its place is at the heel from the side of the heel.
And in the other leg are three similar bones like those.
About the cutting of the two bones after the Aures
The cutting of the two bones which are after the Aures is an antidote for ancient cataracts, headache, swelling, ulcer of the head and other old ailments.
And the quality of the cutting must be according to what is said
It is that the head of the sick person be shaved: and the bone of his head be fractured in the place of the two bones with rough cloth friction well done
Then let the patient hold his neck with his hand, until two bones appear
And their place is after the Aures in two depressed places of the head
Inquire therefore easily with your finger, and where you feel the pulse of them under your finger, there is the sign with the scar
Then take the cutting knife, which is called Incidens
Then introduce it under the bone into the hole, until the phlebotomist reaches the bone.
Then lift up your hand with the bone and the hole towards the upper part, and cut the bone with the incision of the phlebotomist
And let the length of the incision be equal to the quantity of two joined fingers, or about that: and let blood flow out as much as you wish
Then bind the limb with bandages, and let go of the limb, until it is healed
And previously in the book it was mentioned that the incision of the ears and their cauterization are among the initial procedures.
And concerning the phlebotomy of the two arteries in the temporal region
As for the two arteries located in the temporal regions which are to be phlebotomized, this is done for an ancient migraine: for a sudden severe headache, and for persistent vomiting: and for a course of acute discharges reaching the eyes And the quality of the phlebotomy which is to be performed must be carefully considered according to what you have narrated to me
The patient should tightly clench his neck for a long time until two veins become perceptible to the touch: and the pulse of the ears should be demonstrated under your finger.
Then the sign with the cautery is given.
Then elevate the skin above the vein with your index finger and make the incision of the phlebotomy beneath it, and elevate the vein above.
And make the incision as you did in the two veins above: and let the blood run out according to the quantity that you deem necessary Then loosen the patient's bandage, and place your finger over the vein for an hour
Then place on the limb and the pulse, and bind it tightly above the constriction: and let it go when it is healed
And previously in the book it was mentioned that the recollection of the ears, their incision, and their extraction are among the initial procedures
And concerning the phlebotomy of the front vein after the phlebotomy of the Cephalic vein
The phlebotomy of the front vein after the phlebotomy of the Cephalic vein is done for ancient facial ailments: and for a migraine, and for redness: and for ulcers and wounds.
And what is the quality of his phlebotomy, according to what I have said.
The patient should steady his neck with his hand until the vein becomes visible.
Then grasp the instrument which is called the Fossorium.
What is its shape like?
Set the prominent point at the head of the Fossorium over the vein, and pierce over it with a needle, or in any other way like this: and let the blood flow out according to the quantity you wish
Then close the perforation of the patient, and tie it off, until it is healed.
And when it is opened with the phlebotomy hook
It is not proper that the phlebotomist should be of acute temperament, like the rest of the phlebotomists, but rather of gentle temperament
And the phlebotomy should be performed according to the course of the blood vessels: because the bone is close by: and perhaps the phlebotomist will break when it is slight.
About the phlebotomy of the veins in the two lacrimal bones.
The nourishment of the two veins which are in the two lacrimal bones of the two eyes is to the eye from scabies and redness: and to the eye, and the itching and pains of the face.
And the quality of their phlebotomy is that the patient should steady his neck with his hand
Then the phlebotomy is easy: and you are standing over his head
And do the phlebotomy according to the course of the blood vessels to a small length, with a small phlebotomist, wide rather than narrow, for in this place there is no bone
If the phlebotomist is unskilled at the extremity, he may break it.
Then let him run from the blood as much as is necessary for you
And place over the wound a cushion, and bind the wound once at night, and solve the wound.
Regarding the phlebotomy of veins of the nose
The veins of the nose are phlebotomized for acute fever, excessive sweating, facial pain such as migraines, and redness of the face, especially when it is long-standing
And the quality of the phlebotomy of it is that it tightens the patient's neck
Then take the thumb of your left hand and grasp the phlebotomy slightly low, long: and fix it in the middle of the nose itself, between that which distinguishes the nose according to its straightness.
Because the vein does not appear to the sense there, and because the blood begins to flow immediately.
And it is necessary that you should keep your last hand with the phlebotomy close: and let the blood flow according to your need
And bind it once at night
The wound itself will soon recover
Regarding the phlebotomy of veins of the guide (carotid
The phlebotomy of the guide veins is indicated for constriction of the breath, and the inception of leprosy, and melancholic diseases, and swelling and ulcers of the malar, and corrosiveness, that is, herpes of the arteries of the face
And the quality of the phlebotomy of these is that it tightens the patient under both cheeks in his neck with a ligature: and let the artist stand over the head of the patient, and the patient should be sitting on a seat
Then the vein is to be cut to the width of the wide phlebotomy.
Then draw out from the blood the quantity deemed suitable, or according to that which is required for the purpose.
Then do likewise with the other vein.
Then close the ligament and bind the two veins with a middle clamp: so that the diseased part is not injured
And let it rest until morning
The wound will heal by itself.
Regarding the phlebotomy of veins, Algeberich.
Veins, however, according to Algeberich, are phlebotomizable: because they cause swelling in the throat, corruption of the gums: and bad ulcers: and fissures of the lips, and bad ulcers, even those which are in the nose, and in the vicinity of it
And the quality of the phlebotomy of these veins is that you make the patient sit before you: and bind his neck with an awl
Then turn his lip up, and look at two veins: one of which is on the right side of the lip, and the other on the left side of it: and their demonstration is by the blackening of both of them.
And this is true: because in the vicinity of them are small veins, black.
Cut therefore both of them with the incident incision But if there is doubt in your mind, and you do not know which of them it is: then you must resort to the incision of the greater of them, and their demonstration
And do likewise with the two veins which are in the upper lip: and most frequently runs with it: and cut two veins which are in the lower lip
From the vein under the tongue after the cephalic vein has been bled.
From the vein under the tongue after the cephalic vein has been bled.
And the quality of the bleeding should be such that the patient sits between your hands facing the sun: and lift up the tongue and look under the tongue from one side of the tongue to the other side of the tongue: and the color of both should descend towards blackness.
The bleeding should be complete on both sides: and take care that you do not put your last hand in the bleeding.
For under the tongue are arteries, and perhaps blood flows out from those arteries
Of the three veins in the elbow.
And the three veins which are bled in the elbow are such that their bleeding is customary in all men
And their bleeding is done in two ways.
Either by pressing with a blunt needle: or by using oil to reduce the bleeding: or by drying with a knife, which is Alnesil
And this is its form
Thus Alnesil is suitable for the section
And there are various kinds of needles, both broad and narrow according to the width of the veins and the tension of their form. The form of the needle for bleeding from a blunt needle is broad like water
And it is suitable for opening wide veins, filled, protruding, apparent, large, and those which contain thick blood, turbid
And this needle for bleeding is smaller in width and has a finer extremity
It is suitable for phlebotomy of the fine veins which contain slight yellow blood.
It is suitable for phlebotomy of the fine veins which contain slight yellow blood.
However, those veins which are three in number which are called "Basilicae" are an excellent phlebotomy. Because they draw blood from the swellings which are under the throat and the collar, from the loin towards the chest, and from the groin: and it is suitable for phlebotomy with the vein and not against it, as it may cause harm if it is done otherwise.
If it is done carelessly and the needle pricks the vein, the blood flow will be interrupted
Therefore it is necessary to dry the area around the puncture with Alnesil.
If these veins do not appear clearly, then it is necessary to seek another one, or ask for another branch of it: or to phlebotomize in another place, such as the branch of the forearm
Since it is clearly visible, and dry the vein with Anesil as we have said before
If you wish to phlebotomize the same vein again, then it is necessary to first tighten the forearm, so that you can recognize the place, until you know the exact place of the pulse
Then mark the place with the thumb, afterwards the forearm, and dry the vein with a concave incision with the needle and Anesil as we have said before
And take care not to puncture too far from the place of the artery.
When you go, when you tighten the ligature, the inflation in the place which you marked with the thumb, then that inflation is the inflation of the artery: you must therefore stop there
If the blood spills out at the phlebotomy, like the urine of a boy, and is thin and red: then you know that it is from an artery.
Then it is right, and place your finger upon the place where it is longer, then remove your finger.
If the blood is shed (and it is often shed) then tighten the arm and let go of it: and let the patient beware of its movement: and be above its fear
Do not move it for a few days until it is healed.
If, however, the blood does not shed, and it increases for you: and you perceive it not in your moment of medicine, then cut the artery if you see it.
For its extremities are stretched and the blood is shed.
Or take the bark of a quince, and find its middle: take one half and tighten it above the place of the narrowest part with ligament and veins until the next day.
Then if the blood is shed, that is good.
And if not: then care for it as for one whose pulse has been cut off by the flow of blood: and the cutting of the blood in these matters is not difficult on account of the smallness of the wound and the possibility of the ligament from the arm.
Of the phlebotomy of the forearm.
The veins of the forearm are used for phlebotomy, because they draw blood from the upper part of the head and the lower part of the body: because they are composed of the branches of the basilica and cephalic veins, as we said.
It is convenient for the phlebotomist that there be above his fear of phlebotomy, for under it is a nerve
If, therefore, anything is added to the puncture of the phlebotomy, and it encounters nerve, it will cause swelling in that place, and the healing will be difficult, and it may not heal entirely.
And that nerve appears very sensitive to the sense.
But if it is hidden in some people, and is slight, and is not evident: then you must take care that you do not perforate the vein more than is necessary, section it with Alnesil, and take out the nerve with your skill
If there is a vein between two nerves, then find the vein in length
About the cephalic vein.
The punctures of the cephalic vein, however, are useful, because they draw blood from the head, and confer it to the ailments of the eyes.
And it is proper in this vein, if you will, to puncture it with the needle of the olive, or with the needle of Myrtle: because it is safer for all the veins, because it is neither an artery nor a nerve It is true that it is proper to touch the head with the puncture of the phlebotomy, and that you seek a softer place: and it does not harm it, if it is not found with the first blow, as it will return on the subsequent puncture. Perhaps sometimes it is delayed in some people when it is not punctured on the first blow, but it does not harm them that delay in anything
## On the usefulness of phlebotomy, and the precautions to be taken in observing it.
The quality of phlebotomy, and the accidents which accompany it, in the rectification of which you must consider
Firstly, know this, that phlebotomy is not to be administered except in the conservation of health, and its preservation, and caution against the coming of illness.
And let phlebotomy be done in a vein of the cubit, namely the Cephalica, and the Fusca, and the Basilica
And let phlebotomy be done at the beginning of spring after fasting, in summer, and autumn, and winter after meals, when there are signs of repletion.
And let phlebotomy be done on the first or third day after three hours have passed
Phlebotomy, however, which is administered in illnesses, has no fixed hour: but when it is expedient and necessary for this, in the night or day, and at every hour, and at every time.
And it is not fitting that phlebotomy be done in children until they are more than fourteen years of age.
Neither should phlebotomy be done in a pregnant woman except from the fourth month until the seventh
Neither in old men who have passed their sixties years
When, however, anyone wishes to undergo phlebotomy for whatever reason: it is necessary to cleanse the intestines beforehand with a mild enema, if there is much retained stool: that the veins do not become irritated by the evacuation of putrid matter from the intestines to the principal parts
Neither should phlebotomy be done in a patient who is suffering from excessive nausea, nor in a drunkard, nor in a euphoric state, until this has been remedied by the passage of time from the underlying cause
Neither in a patient suffering from hydrosis
And let a bloodletting be repeated after a colicky passion, omitting it, and the flow of the belly, and the multiplication of coitus, and work, and exercise, and drunkenness, and eating, and all that dissolves virtue from the body or animal.
Consider then in the subtlety of humors before this, whether the blood is thick with food and drink, and the physicians: if it is possible for it.
Then introduce a poultice, if it does not prohibit it: or perform some exercise, so as to make the blood finer.
And perform a bloodletting of it in the chest, around the third day: as we have said: and endeavor that he evacuate his belly of all the bad things of the animal: such as envy, and anger, and fear: and from all bodily things, such as work, and pain, and excess, and such like these.
And make his food present things which are with the use of men from fragrance, and smell, and joy and such like these in quantity as is possible
Then let the blood-letter sit above the pillow, which is higher than the blood-letting hand: then draw out his arm, and wipe it with the hand of the blood-letter twice or thrice
Then bind the ligament with a bandage, and wrap it twice.
And let the binding be temperate, because when the binding is unequal, or by excessive force in the binding, it hinders the course of the blood: or in softening, then it hinders the course of the blood also
Then after the binding let the blood-letter wipe his hand together until the veins are filled and the senses are relaxed.
Then the phlebotomist should withdraw blood from the vein with little pressure, as was formerly.
Then he places his finger on the mark of the left hand above the vein at the place where he wishes to perform the phlebotomy, slightly: so that the vein does not slip away, and that the percussion is certain
For indeed from the veins is more difficult than from the arteries as concerning the fleeing of the vein during the phlebotomy: and from the inside is that which is filled with air: and when one places the phlebotomy on the vein, it contracts under the phlebotomy, and the phlebotomist is struck, and the vein does not open: and if it does open, it is tightly closed: because of this therefore it is necessary that the phlebotomist should be firm and attentive in all these matters.
Then he lays the phlebotomy aside.
And if not, then repeat it with the other side slightly below or above with speed: if the place does not recover
Which if it recovers, or if the patient is faint, then let him go home on the first or second day: and do not tighten the ligamentum
Perhaps indeed the swelling will go down.
Neither must he put in a poultice.
Then he will repeat the phlebotomy if he wishes.
And if the opening is small, or blood runs slowly: and you are afraid lest it should go outside the quantity which you wish: then repeat the phlebotomy in the same place according to the rule, and add a little more to the operation
And do this with great care, before the incision is made, for in many people the place is sore already from the operation.
If therefore you see that the place has already been sore, then you must not go over it any more, for this will not excuse you from your duty And put something soft of oil over it: because it will soothe the course of the blood.
It is better in this place than pure oil, and than any other oil.
And do the same with the application of oil in all your bloodletting, which you do by prohibiting the course of the blood: and they make this like turmeric, saffron, and alum, when one of them is put on the place with the other
The blood will then become thin and dissolve, when it is thick
If this happens in the place of bloodletting there will be great swelling, for this happens very often, especially with those who are not bled except with oil, or with a slight opening of a vein: then cleanse and put over the place a sponge soaked in water and salt, warmed up: and bind for an hour: for it will dissolve.
And it is necessary that you do this after the blood has been let from the vein, with the completion of its course, or from another vein.
And many swelling and eminences happen in bloodletting at the Basilica.
Put your hand over it, then if you find softness under your compression of it, then that swelling is bad
Therefore, as we have said, you must put something upon it from this.
For perhaps blood will flow from that artery.
But make a plaster over it with something which has styptic properties, so that the place is bound up.
Then take care of the rest of the treatment until the wound is healed
And it is necessary to draw out every man from blood in proportion to his virtue.
And that which appears from the colour of the blood over the blood.
For blood which is black, then send it away to go, until it becomes red: and in like manner if it is thick: then send it away until it becomes thin: and in like manner if it is acute: until its sharpness is gone
And it is necessary for him who is full, strong, and indigent to draw out blood little by little, so that he strengthens the phlebotomy by doing so, and that the phlebotomist be wide: and in him who is weak, let it be the opposite of him
And it is necessary to draw it out in small quantities, and that the hole be strict: and it is better that it be administered in phlebotomy by a cut, not by a puncture
And this method of phlebotomy is safe from the flow of blood, and from a cut: and is more laudable and safer than phlebotomy by breadth and length.
And to whom it has happened to faint during phlebotomy, it is necessary to give him before phlebotomy a spoonful of bread soaked in pomegranate juice: or vinegar, if he is feverish: and draw out from him blood in three or four quantities.</start_of_turn>
If the complexion is cold, then take before the phlebotomy a loaf of bread infused in myrrh, or in scented honey syrup with spices, or in scented syrup with a strong odor.
If syncope occurs during phlebotomy, and its cause is the excessive discharge of blood: then it is necessary to drink in the water of meat, and a mild aromatic syrup: and to flavor it with algae, and to support the chest with these. And do all that we said in the chapter on syncope concerning evacuation.
Whoever wishes to evacuate his arm and stop the bleeding: let him who has had a phlebotomy because of excessive evacuation, and his blood is weak, let him gradually dissolve the blood with the measure of his ability in continuous days.
Whoever wishes to evacuate his arm and stop the bleeding, and his body is strong: let him do this after seven hours, or nine from his first phlebotomy
Whoever wishes to draw blood from his body towards the side which is inclined downwards: let him do this in the second or third day
In whom there is much hot and acute blood, and who causes a fever: let him evacuate from this blood in one vessel, and draw from this quantity greatly: and increase the opening until syncope occurs: after which you must restore all the conditions of the phlebotomy: and put your hand over the pulse of his wrist at the course of the blood, so that there is no risk of syncope in that place.
Many times this happens when the phlebotomist is ignorant and neglectful.
And it is not right when one wishes to evacuate the arm and solve the blood when the orifice of the vein is closed and there is a difficult discharge of blood, as if it were premature over that which is excessive, and the head is thrown back too quickly.
It is bad that it is delayed, indeed let it go forth, until it is bled in the second [attempt].
Remove it with speed when the bleeding has ceased from the orifice of the vein, and place upon it some saline dissolved in water.
Place upon it some alum or saffron, and compress it gently, until the blood has drained out
If indeed the vein has been severed, then let it go forth, and do not grasp it, until the swelling has subsided
When necessity compels to drain the blood in the second [attempt], and it is not excused, then either perform the phlebotomy above the place [of the wound] or in another vein in the arm or in the other vein.
The veins of the arm which are to be bled are those of Fusca and Basilica, which are not to be found, because they are composed of bones.
The quality of the phlebotomy is that the sick person should immerse his hand in warm water, until the flesh turns red and the vein becomes visible
Then bind upon it with a bandage of moderate constriction.
Then perform the phlebotomy in a transverse direction gradually, not longitudinally, and do it not too widely: and let the opening be wide, and let your phlebotomy be as close as possible to the edge of the wound
Many times, the flow of blood is put into warm water in wintertime.
Phlebotomy of this limb is safer for all limbs, because there is no pulsation under this limb, neither nerve
Phlebotomy of the right hand is useful in treating liver diseases
The quality of this phlebotomy is that you must tie the wrist with a ligament or your hand, after you have inserted your thumb into the warm water, until the limb swells and the patient feels cold
Then the phlebotomy is transverse
And if you cut the vein completely, it will not cause him harm in any way
And be careful, do not touch your hand with the phlebotomy.
Under that there are the nerves of the fingers stripped of flesh from the bone.
Then put the hand back into the warm water, and let the blood flow out of it
For if you do not put the hand back into the warm water, the blood clots in the opening of the vein, and is prohibited from flowing
When you have taken out the necessary quantity of blood, then put oil and salt on the vein: so that it does not clot too quickly
And in the same way it is necessary to do with all branches that are tight
The dressing for this phlebotomy is from the left hand: because it is useful for the treatment of spleen diseases: and do the same in this phlebotomy as you did in the second one equally
The saphenous veins of phlebotomy are useful for treating diseases which are in the lower parts of the body, such as diseases of the uterus, and retention of menstruation, and weakness of the kidneys, and ulcers of the buttocks and thighs of old age, and similar diseases.
And the quality of the phlebotomy is such that it makes the patient immerse his foot in warm water: and perform over it friction until bubbles appear: and ligate above the junction of the foot with a bandage.
The bubbles will appear at the heel, visible beyond the thumb: and they are driven out from it on the face of the foot in many places.
The phlebotomy is therefore better in the broader branch of the vein, or at the heel in its collection: because it is better and safer
If the phlebotomy is made on the face of the foot, then it causes damage to the nerves that are under it over the face of the foot.
And place your phlebotomy thus that the phlebotomy comes from the transverse vein, like the one you would make if you were to cut the vein: and let the phlebotomy be of Nesil.
If, however, the discharge of blood is prohibited, then repeat the foot in warm water: and prevent the blood from running in the vein until it is evacuated
If the vein of the phlebotomist is mistaken in the first attempt, then repeat with the phlebotomy to the upper parts, for the place is safe, and not to be feared, when you cause damage to the nerves, as we have said
And in the same way as the other foot's saphenous vein is equal.
The veins of the sciatica are located, as we have said, at the heel from the side of the heel bone.
The advantage of the phlebotomy is against the pain of the ankle, when it is due to warm blood.
And the quality of the phlebotomy is such that it makes the patient immerse his foot in a bath, and festinate: and bind the ankle from the side of the ankle up to the heel four fingers, with a fine tape: for without that it will not appear unless for that.
When the situation demands, a bloodletting is to be performed according to whatever faculty is possible, or according to the changing of the pulse. It is better either to cut with the knife or to perform an incision.
The situation is in this place more beneficial, and it is hidden in many men
If you do not find it and it does not appear to the senses in any way: then let a bloodletting be made of some part of it, as that which appears in the heel and near the ear: cause it to flow from the nerves, and let run out an amount of blood as much as you desire
Then loosen the tension, and place over the place of the bloodletting the skin, and bind the place.
It heals quickly in this way.
On Ventosation and the quality of its supply.
Chapter XCIII.
Ventsations arise from the bowels, and from the air, and from the outside
And the ventilation is performed in two ways.
With incision and extraction of blood: and the other is ventilation without incision And this ventilation which is without incision is done in two ways
Or with fire
Or without fire
And the ventilation which is administered with incision and extraction of blood is performed in fourteen places of the body
Of which one is the Ventosatio Alnocrati, and it is behind the head: and Alkehel, and it is in the middle of the neck: and the uentosae Alhagdahim, and they are two layers of the neck from two parts together: and the uentosae menti, and it is under the jaw in the lower part of the mouth: and the uentosae duarum spatularum: and the uentosae Alachosos over the end of the tail: and the uentosae duorum focilium, and they are in the middle of the two arms: and the uentosae duorum brachiorum: and the uentosae duorum crurium: and the uentosae duarum cauillarum.
The wind of evacuation does not pull blood out of small pores scattered throughout the flesh, and because of this it does not cause a loss of vital force, just as is the case with phlebotomy.
Neither is it necessary to administer the evacuation with fire or without fire in any ailment that arises from congestion, until the whole body has been evacuated.</start_of_turn>
If need compels evacuation from an ailment, or by custom, we administer it at every hour in the beginning of the month, at its end, and in the middle of it, and whenever necessary.</start_of_turn
For in men, when their blood has multiplied in them, until it necessitates its evacuation by evacuation, it finds its way into their head and causes them harm.</start_of_turn
And from this is that it causes congestion and redness in their face, head, and neck.</start_of_turn
And from this is that it causes itching in their face, forehead, and eyebrows, and darkness and blurring in their eyes.</start_of_turn>
And from this is that it makes the place of evacuation sore.</start_of_turn> And from this is that their laughter multiplies.</start_of_turn
And from this is that it causes a taste of blood in their mouth: either the tongue becomes dry and expels blood.</start_of_turn>
And from this is that their sleep multiplies.</start_of_turn
And from this is that they urinate in their sleep blood and redness, and emissions, and swellings, which are like these.</start_of_turn When therefore we see any of these things, and especially if it is in the middle of the month: we order that evacuation be performed immediately, after two or three hours have passed.</start_of_turn The application of the Ventosation of the Neck is: because it itself contributes to the gravity of the head, and what flows down to the eyes.
