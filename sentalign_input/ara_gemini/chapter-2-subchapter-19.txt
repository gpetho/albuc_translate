Chapter nineteen on returning the feather to the nose.
Doctors call the fistula a fistula.
If you treat it with cautery or with a sharp, burning medication as described previously, and it does not heal, then there is no remedy for it except to incise the swelling when it ripens and extract all the moisture or pus in it until the bone is exposed.
So when the bone is exposed and you see corruption or blackness in it, scrape it with an instrument like this:
And it is called the rough-headed one, made from Indian iron, and its head is round like a button, engraved with the engraving of a file or scalpel, a fine engraving.
You place it on the site of the corruption in the bone, then rotate it between your fingers while clenching your hand slightly until you know that the corruption has been scraped away.
And you do that repeatedly, then you dress the place with drying, astringent medicines.
If the place is sealed and flesh grows in it, and the pus flow stops and it remains for forty days, and it does not regenerate, nor fester, nor does anything happen to it, then know that it has healed, otherwise there is no solution except to return the fistula to the nose opening in this way, which is to expose the bone again with iron or with a sharp medicine.
So, when the bone is exposed, take a branched instrument like this image:
The tip of the instrument should be triangular, and its shaft conical, brought to a point, as you see.
Then place it on the bone itself, and this should be near the suture, and keep your hand a little away from the eye.
Then turn your hand with the instrument until the bone is pierced, and the patient feels it by finding air coming out of it when he holds his hand over his nose.
Then at this point, treat the area with astringent and drying medications, as I have taught you.
So when the flesh grows and the place hardens, the matter that was flowing outwards will return to the nose, and this will be easier for the patient, God willing.
