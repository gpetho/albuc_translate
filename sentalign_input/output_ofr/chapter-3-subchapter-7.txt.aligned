of the fracture of the breastbone/sternum	On the repair of a fracture of the breast.	0.4325534
The breastbone/sternum is sometimes broken in the middle, but this happens rarely; but it often breaks lower down.	The breast is sometimes fractured in the middle but this happens rarely; more often it is the extremities of it that are broken and comminuted.	0.8605739
And when it is broken in the middle, it sinks downwards, and the patient feels great pain, and shortness of breath, and coughs, and perhaps vomits blood, and the displacement is visible in the broken bone, and one can feel it well.	The symptoms that occur when it is broken in the middle are that he bows downwards and suffers violent pain, difficulty in breathing, and coughing, and sometimes he vomits blood; and there is an obvious and palpable concavity in the bone.	0.7830316
And the restoration is as follows: the patient often lies on his back, and you place a cushion between the shoulder blades, then press the shoulders, and bring the ribs of the two sides together with your hands, and be careful to set it evenly in all the ways that you can, so that the shape of the bone is as it should be;	Now the way to mend it is for the patient to lie on his back, and you place a pillow between his shoulders; then his shoulders are squeezed, and with your hands you press together his ribs from both sides and skilfully try to equalize them in any way you conveniently can, until the bone is reduced to its proper form.	0.85207605
then apply plasters and compresses on a thin splint of wood, or other light wood, and wrap it in a cloth, and tie it over the broken bone, so that it does not move; and wrap the bandage around the back, and tighten it appropriately, and check the bandage every hour, and if it loosens, tighten it;	Then apply over it a plaster and a pad and place over that a splint of thin willow board or brier or similar light wood, first wrapping it in cloth; then gently bind this upon the fractured bone so that it does not slip; and carry your bandage round about the back several times, tying it firmly; then inspect it constantly, and whenever it loosens tighten it.	0.85577965
and if it needs to be untied, because of corrosion or itching that occurs at the site, or pain or abscess, then hurry, and untie it, and scrape the plaster, and address what has appeared there by means of treatments;	If you are compelled to loosen it on account of itching at the place, or pain or swelling, loosen it quickly and remove the plaster and correct whatever has occurred with the appropriate treatment.	0.7937521
then reapply the plaster, and tighten it until it is healed.	Then renew the plaster if you think fit, and keep it bandaged until it heals.	0.7712201
