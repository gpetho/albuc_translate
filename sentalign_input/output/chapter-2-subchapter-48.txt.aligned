And some of them contain moisture; and those that contain moisture should be incised with a lunar cut in this form: from line .G. to line .B. And when all the pus in the abscess is evacuated, then you fill it with old cotton and leave it until the next day.	Some contain humidity. Those that contain humidity should be opened with a semicircular incision like this, from b to g. When you have removed all the pus that had been in the tumour, pack the wound with teased-out cotton wool and leave till another day.	0.7679763
Then the cotton is removed and treated with a suitable ointment for that until it is healed.	Then remove the cotton wool and dress with a suitable ointment until healed.	0.89614534
And if the abscess is of the type of nodes and scrofulas, then you incise over it as we said in the section on scrofulas likewise.	If the tumour be of the nodular scrofulous kind, cut directly down on it just as we prescribed for that kind.	0.6250708
But if the wound extends to where there is decay, then apply the cautery as we previously said.	If the wound continue to discharge pus, apply the cautery to it as prescribed before.	0.7508493
