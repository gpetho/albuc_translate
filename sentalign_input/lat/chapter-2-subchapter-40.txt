On the opening of abscesses, and their incision and treatment in general.
Chapter 40.
There are many types of abscesses, of many kinds, as has been remembered here, namely one by one in this book; and they differ in their perforation and incision according to two methods.
One of these is according to the type of abscess itself and what it holds in terms of humors.
And the second method is according to the location in the body where it occurs.
For an abscess occurring in the head is different from an abscess occurring in the anus; and an abscess occurring in a fleshy place is different from an abscess occurring in the joints, and each one of them has its own treatment according to its procedure.
And of the abscesses, there are those that should not be perforated until the pus has matured in them and reached completion, and of these, there are those that must be perforated while they are still raw and do not mature fully.
Like abscesses that are close to the joints.
For when an abscess occurs near a joint and is prolonged until the surrounding tissue rots, the ligaments or nerves of that joint may become damaged, which is a cause of contraction in that limb.
Or the abscess is near a principal organ: for if you delay perforation until it matures, it will harm either that organ or the primary member near it.
Or if it is near the anus, perforate it while it is immature; it is not necessary to perforate an immature abscess that has not fully digested except when it is near the anus, so that the depth does not rot and extend to the interior of the anus, creating a fistula or leading to a condition that cannot heal.
You should know the proper time for perforating an abscess that has matured fully, which is when pain subsides, fever decreases, and redness, pulsation, and the sharpness of the abscess's head lessen, along with other signs.
And you must make this perforation at the lower part of the abscess and the area of greatest prominence; and the perforation should follow the length of the body if the abscesses are in the parts of the hands and feet, and in the places of muscles, tendons, nerves, and arteries, and ultimately in all smooth areas without bends.
In those that bend, however, make the perforation according to that limb.
But when an abscess is in fleshy places, then it is better to delay its perforation until its digestion is fully confirmed, as we have mentioned.
For if you perforate it before this, the flow of fluid will prolong, and there will be much filth and discharge, and perhaps its edges and depth will harden.
And certain abscesses are perforated across the width of the body as necessary, or according to the needs of the limb.
And you must administer a small perforation in small abscesses and a large perforation in large abscesses, or make multiple incisions proportional to the size of the abscess.
And there are abscesses where the skin must be hollowed out and incised when it has become like a cloth and has reached a stage where it is dead tissue, as often happens with boils and swellings.
And some of them are cut with an incision having three angles.
And some are incised in the shape of a myrtle leaf.
Such as an inguinal abscess.
And some have a round incision, a crescent incision, and similar types of cuts.
As for those without a head, such as mild, superficial abscesses, you should perforate them with a superficial or flat perforation only.
And it is necessary, when an abscess is large and has collected much pus, and you perforate it, not to rush and extract all the pus at once; rather, extract part of it.
Then cover the abscess until the next day.
Then draw out some of the pus again.
Do this gradually, repeatedly, until it is expelled, especially if the patient is of weak strength, a pregnant woman, a small child, or an elderly person; for the animal spirit often dissipates with the release of pus, and the patient may die without you realizing it.
Therefore, handle this matter with great caution.
And after your perforation, with which you pierce these abscesses, it is necessary to clean the wound and observe it.
If the wound of the abscess is small, or the incision is flat, then apply lint from linen or old cotton.
And if the abscess is large and there are many fissures from the perforation, then you must insert lint into each fissure until they meet each other.
And if you have cut away part of the skin from the abscess or hollowed it out around the edges, then it is necessary to fill it with old cotton, or as cloth is woven, or with lint from linen without moisture; and secure it until the third day.
Then remove it, and treat it with the appropriate ointment until it heals.
If bleeding occurs during your procedure, then apply cold water and vinegar, after soaking a cloth in them, and place it over the site of the bleeding multiple times.
If the bleeding persists, then you must apply the regimen, treatment, and powders that I have described in many places in this book and in the separate sections.
If it is in winter and the site of the abscess has many nerves, then it is necessary to soak pads with warm wine and oil and place them on the area.
And if it is summer and the areas are fleshy, then you should place pads soaked in water and oil, or in wine and oil, and make sure everything is cool.
Until, when the third day comes, as we have said, it is then necessary to loosen the abscess, clean it, and administer treatment appropriate to it until it heals.
This is what is necessary for knowledge of the general treatment of abscesses.
Following the path of distinction, I have already described each abscess, how its treatment proceeds step by step individually.
