Chapter Twenty-Five on Cauterizing the Armpit
If the head of the humerus is dislocated due to slippery humors, or it does not stabilize when it is reduced from its dislocation until it becomes habitual for it to be reduced and then dislocated at the slightest movement, as we have witnessed it,
then the jaw should be reduced first.
Then the patient lies on his back or on the healthy side.
Then the skin inside the armpit is lifted upwards with the fingers of your left hand, if the joint is dislocated inwards.
Then heat the cautery with two skewers, whose image is this:
Then the skin is cauterized with it until it penetrates to the other side.
And the shape of the cauterization becomes four cauterizations.
And it may be cauterized with a cautery iron having three blades, so the shape of the cauterization then will be six cauterizations.
And the blades should be of the thinness of a file.
And this is a picture of the cautery iron with three blades:
And one may be added to this number, making the cauterizations eight.
Then the crushed colocynth is applied to the cauterization with salt.
Then the patient must rest and not move the limb for a while until it strengthens.
And if the dislocation is upwards, and this rarely happens, cauterize it above the shoulder with one good nail-shaped cauterization or many cauterizations by dripping/dotting.
For the joint will strengthen, the moisture will go away, and the patient will recover.
