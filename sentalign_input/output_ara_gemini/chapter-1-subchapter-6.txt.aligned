The facial paralysis that is treated with cautery is of the type that arises from phlegm, as I mentioned in the classification of diseases.	The twisting of the mouth which is curable with the cautery is of that nature which arises from phlegm, as we have already noticed in the sections on sicknesses.	0.7476913
And avoid cauterizing the type that arises from dryness and nerve spasm.	But cauterization is to be carefully avoided in that type which is due to dryness or spasm of the tendon.	0.6636627
When you treat this type of facial paralysis with errhines, sternutatories, and gargles, and your treatment does not succeed, then it is necessary to cauterize the patient with three cauterizations: one at the base of the ear, the second a little below his temple, and the third at the joining of the lips.	When this kind of deformity has been treated with electuaries, errhines, and gargles, and your treatment is ineffective, you should use three cauterizations: one at the root of the ear; the second a little below the temple; and the third at the junction of the lips.	0.8731359
And make your cauterization on the opposite side of the affected area, because the relaxation occurs on the side that appears healthy.	Let your cauterization be on the opposite side to the affected side, for the relaxation will arise in the side which seems normal.	0.81934035
And the method of cautery is to cauterize with a cautery opposite the upper tip of the ear, a little below the horn of the head, and another on the temple, and its length should be the length of the thumb. Apply the cautery down with your hand until you burn half the thickness of the skin.	The form taken by the cauterization is that you burn him a little below the frontal prominence, on a level with the upper tip of the ear, and also on the temple the length of the thumb; carry the burning to a depth of about half the thickness of the skin. The shape of the cautery.	0.8152628
And this is the image of the cautery instrument, and it is a type of scalpel-like instrument whose image has been presented, except that it is a little gentler, as you see.	The shape of the cautery. It is a variety of the bladed cautery such as has already been described, but is rather more slender as you see.	0.61286145
And the knife should have a little extra thickness.	Its blade should have a certain thickness.	0.67710763
Then treat the area with what was mentioned previously until it heals, God willing.	Then dress the place with what we have mentioned till healed.	0.6888617
