 CHAPTER FORTY-FOUR.
On cauterization of gout and pain in the joints.
 When there are pains in the joints from cold humidities flowing into whatever part of the body it may be, and specially when there are pains in the feet, doctors are in the habit of calling that 'gout'.
When gout due to chill has been treated with the various treatments mentioned in its section, and the pains remain, the cautery will remove them.
That is, you cauterize the patient with multiple burns around the joint of the foot, after he has been purged.
The cautery should be a middle-sized olivary one, thus.
If you need to make punctate cauterizations round the front of the foot, use the punctate cautery; and if the pains go up to the knee or other joints, which often happens, burn each knee with three or four cauterizations on every side with the same olivary cautery.
And if you require to cauterize him more than this, do it, but do not go deeply but only about the thickness of the skin.
If the pains go up to the hip joints or the back, employ those cauterizations that we have mentioned in their own chapter.
And if the pains are in the hands only, pierce a double line all around the wrists.
If the pains remain in the fingers, pierce them once over each joint and once on the metacarpus.
And if after some days the pains go up to the elbows or shoulders then cauterize both on each side.
And keep the patient to good habits and taking of medicine; for if his regimen be good and the phlegm got rid of, he will be cured with this cautery.
