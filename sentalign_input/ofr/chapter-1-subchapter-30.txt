about the spleen
When you treat the disease of the spleen with what we have discussed in the sections on treatments, and it is not effective, then there are three types of cautery that are all good.
One of these methods is to make three or four cauteries, in a line along the length of the spleen, similar to the shape of the cautery for the liver that we discussed before;
and do not press your hand hard during the cauterization, and have the patient lie on his back;
And another method of cauterization is to heat the cautery that has two prongs, as we have shown in the dislocation of the shoulder;
and lift the skin that is next to the spleen, where the patient's ribs are on the left side, and the elevation with which you lift the skin should be lengthwise along the body, and the cauteries should be across the width of the body.
Afterward, insert the two heated prongs until the skin is pierced on the other side, and then pull out the cautery, and thus there will be four (marks).
And if you wish, cauterize with the three-pronged cautery.
Treat it afterward when it has discharged pus for a long time, and this is better than the other treatments mentioned before.
