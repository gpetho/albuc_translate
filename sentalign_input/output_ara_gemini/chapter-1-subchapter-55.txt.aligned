Therefore, upon their first appearance, it is necessary to cauterize the head of each pustule gently with an aloeswood stick, the tip of which has been ignited by fire, or with the root of long birthwort, or with a lentil-shaped cautery iron.	When they first appear you should cauterize the head of each one lightly with myrtle wood whose tip has been lighted in the fire; or with the root of the long birthwort; or with the lenticular cautery.	0.77341664
Carbuncles may also be cauterized in the same manner upon their first appearance, so that they do not increase, and the causative excess dissipates, and the patient recovers.	Sometimes furuncles also are cauterized in the same manner when they first arise; then they get no bigger and the superfluity originating them is dispersed and the patient is cured of them.	0.7317951
However, it is necessary that this be done after the patient has been evacuated by bloodletting.	But before you cauterize these, the patient must be depleted by bleeding.	0.7223774
