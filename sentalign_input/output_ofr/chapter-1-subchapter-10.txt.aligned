Of epilepsy	On cauterizing for epilepsy.	0.5388549
The epileptic should not use cautery except for one who is phlegmatic, and it is necessary to first purify the brain with herbs and other treatments that we have mentioned in the section when the patient is old enough and able to take medicine.	The epileptic who may be cauterized is he whose epilepsy arises from phlegm. When the patient is an adult and can stand taking the drugs, he should first purify his brain by great electuaries and the rest of the treatment mentioned in that section.	0.767579
And if it is a child who cannot tolerate it, have them gargle and chew things that purify the brain often, along with good foods;	But if it be a boy unable to tolerate the drugs he should employ gargles and medicaments to chew, to clear his brain, for several days beforehand, with an improvement in his diet.	0.596806
afterwards shave the head in the middle, and make a cautery there according to what we have said before, and a cautery on the forehead, and on each temple; and if the patient is strong and able to bear it, cauterize them as I have said for one who has paralysis and softening of the body, on the spine of the back and neck, and let the cautery be olive-shaped according to the method I have described.	Then let his head be shaved and burn him with the single cauterization on the middle of the head in the manner described before, and with one cauterization on the occiput, and one on each frontal prominence; and, if the patient be fit and able to bear it, add those additional cauterizations on the cervical and dorsal vertebrae that we have already described for paralysis and for flaccidity. The cautery should be olivary, the shape before described.	0.866839
