of urinary retention
Urinary retention is caused by a blockage from a stone, or congealed blood, or pus, or dead flesh, or similar things, as we have said in the classification;
and if the urine is not released, and you see that the retention is due to a stone which is located at the neck of the bladder, then the patient must be bent over his knees;
and his feet should be placed on his back, and extend his belly from the top toward his back, and the patient should hold his breath as much as he can;
and then the neck of the bladder is forced to expel the stone upwards, which allows the urine to be released; 
and if it does not come out, as we have said, and the patient feels great pain, then you must administer extraction with the instrument called "syringe," of which this is the form:
and it should be made of thin, light silver, shaped like a bird's feather;
and the cannula should be a palm and a half long, and thin at the end.
And the way to release the urine is this: you take a double thread, and tie a small piece of wool or cotton to the end, and put the end of the thread inside the syringe;
and cut the excess wool and push it up to the end of the syringe, then anoint the syringe with oil or butter and egg white, and have the patient sit on a seat, and sprinkle the bladder and penis with warm oil and olive oil and lukewarm water;
then gently insert the syringe into the penis, until it reaches the base of the penis, then bend the penis over towards the buttocks;
then push the syringe forward to the bladder, and the patient will feel it reach the empty space, and this is not done according to this order except because the passage where it goes is twisted;
then pull the thread with the wool little by little, and the urine will follow the wool, then pull it out, and let the urine flow;
and reinsert the syringe until the bladder is emptied, and the patient is relieved.
