Chapter Forty.
On Cauterizing Hip Dislocation.
Viscous humors may settle in the hip joint, causing it to be displaced. A sign of this is that one leg will be longer than the other when they are measured against each other, and you will find a gap at the site of the dislocation.  The patient should be cauterized right on the hip itself, with a semi-circular cautery.
After marking with ink around the joint as it rotates, so that the joint itself falls in the center of the circle. And the cautery iron should be the one whose form was presented in the cauterization of the stomach. If this cautery iron is not available, then cauterize with three burns using the large olive-shaped cautery iron.
Make the cauterization as deep as the entire thickness of the skin. Then treat him until he recovers, God willing.
