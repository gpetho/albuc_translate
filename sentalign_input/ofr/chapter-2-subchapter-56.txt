of pustules of the penis
Many times these sores appear on the penis, and it is an appearance of ugly flesh;
and some are malignant and some are not malignant; (or, and there are malignant ones and non-malignant ones)
so you should take them with a fine hook, and cut and clean them all, then apply cotton moistened with Egyptian ointment;
then treat it with diafinicon ointment until it is healed.
And if the sore is malignant, of a foul color and suppurating, then you must apply cautery to it.
When you have cut it, and if the ulcer is at the tip of the penis, and part of it is inside the skin and part outside, you must first remove the ulcer that is inside; 
and when it is stitched up, then treat the outside.
For when you treat it all together, the head of the penis is not protected from being pierced, and blackness and corruption comes into the penis and into the testicle;
so it is necessary to remove everything that is black and corrupted, then apply a plaster of honey and flour made from pomegranate peel and vetches, then treat it with other remedies until it is healed.
And if bleeding occurs, apply the lunar cautery in this way:
The cautery helps with both conditions together:
that is, the bleeding and the corruption;
and if the head of the penis is corrupted and retracted, you must insert a lead tube into the urethra, and the patient should urinate through it;
and when the skin is tight at the head of the penis, which happens to those who have not been circumcised, or it occurs due to a wound or an abscess, then you must peel it back with a pointed instrument, until the ligament is loosened, and the head of the penis is freed on all sides;
and if it is difficult to separate this, then you must peel it back with a spatula a little from the head of the penis and the skin;
then gently separate the two, and insert a thin linen cloth soaked in cold water, so that it doesn't tighten again.
