When a chronic migraine occurs, and acute catarrh, due to the moisture of tears and heat in the temples and chronic raging dizziness and similar things, and it is treated by various medical treatments and all this is of no benefit, we should then open the arteries of the temples and cauterize them, as we have described.	When a man has a chronic migraine or acute catarrh, on account of acrid humidities and heat in the temporal muscles, or a violent chronic headache, or the like, and he has been treated with various medical treatments without success, we have sometimes in these diseases tried extraction of the arteries from the temples or cauterization of them, already described.	0.74035573
And the method of their extraction is that the patient should shave back the hair from his temples, and locate the artery that is visible in the temple, for it is easily visible by its pulsation, and is rarely hidden except in some people who are excessively cold; and if it is hidden, the patient should tighten his neck with some cloth, then rub the area with some rough cloth, and sprinkle the area with hot water until the artery appears clearly; then take the scalpel which has this shape:	The manner of extraction is for the patient to shave the temporal hair; then you press upon the artery appearing on the temple; for it will be manifest to you by its pulsation, and is rarely invisible save in a few people or on account of severe cold.	0.7591437
then lightly score the skin until you reach the artery, then pull it up with forceps, and separate it well from the tissues that are underneath it on each side; and if the artery is thin, turn it with the point of a hook, then cut it from that side to the length of two grains of wheat.	But if it is not plain to you then let the patient bind his neck with the end of his garment; then do you rub the place with a piece of cloth or foment with hot water, till the artery is obvious to you; then take a scalpel shaped thus; then with it gently scrape away the skin till you come to the artery, then stick a hook in it and draw it upward till you extract it from the skin and free it all round from the membranes that are beneath it.	0.62908
For if it is not cut, the blood will not completely flow out.	But if the artery be thin, twist it with the tip of the hook and cut out enough of it for the two ends to be well separated from one another and contract so that no haemorrhage occurs; for if it is not divided and cut it will not let blood flow at all.	0.5565202
And draw from six hundred to three hundred drops of blood; and if the artery is large, you must tie it in two places with a strong double silk thread, so that putrefaction does not occur before the wound heals, and bleeding occurs; then cut the excess between the two ties at that very moment, and then, if you wish, cauterize it with a bladed cautery down to the bone until the ends are cauterized; and this is the better practice, if the patient does not have a fever and he has a warm complexion.	Then let blood, from six to three ounces. If the artery be large it should be ligated in two places with a strong double thread; the threads should be either silken or lute-string, lest corruption attack them before the wound is healed, and haemorrhage occur. Then cut away what remains between the two ligatures; do that immediately or later. If you wish, you may cauterize it down to the bone with an edged cautery so that the ends of the artery be divided; for this will replace that operation.	0.8777565
For when the instrument is too thin, it holds its heat less well. And there should be a finger's width of space between the two blades, and then when you have marked the two places with ink, you put the burning iron on it until it reaches the bone, and cut the vessel in two places; and let there be space between the two ends for it is not completely sealed with this cautery; and this is the form of the cautery:	Less serious and easier than excising the artery is to cauterize the vessel with this cautery provided with two blades, having first marked both places with ink. Bring it down, very hot, till it reaches the bone and the artery is cut in two places, so as to put some distance between the two ends, for it will certainly not unite after this cauterization. This is the form of the cautery. It should have two sharp blades like two small paring-knives, but they should be much less sharp than a knife, for if they are as sharp as a knife they will quickly lose their heat and the flesh will be slow in cutting.	0.75841063
