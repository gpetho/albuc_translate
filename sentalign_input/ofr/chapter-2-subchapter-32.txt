When the tooth appears not according to the natural body, and the form is ugly, and especially in young women, then you must know if the tooth has grown behind the (other) tooth, and is not in the right place, and it cannot be filed or polished:
then scrape it;
and if there is space beside the tooth, then take this instrument whose form is here, and is similar to a small beak, and let it be made of Indian steel, sharp at its tip:
And cut it little by little over several days, due to the hardness of the tooth, and so that you do not move the others, and if it is apparent that it can be filed, then file it with such a file as is shown here:
and it is like the file with which needles are made;
and file the tooth little by little over many days, lightly, so that it does not move until it falls out;
then smooth it at the end with some kind of scraper, and if the tooth is too sharp and injures the tongue, it should be filed down until it is even, so that it does not injure the tongue or corrupt speech.
