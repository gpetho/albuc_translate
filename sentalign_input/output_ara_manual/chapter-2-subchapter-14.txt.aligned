On the treatment of ectropion that occurs in the lower eyelid.	On the treatment of entropion of the lower lid.	0.770632
This ectropion, which occurs below, is what is truly called ectropion.  It may be natural or accidental.  The accidental type occurs from a wound, a laceration, cauterization, or the like.	This inversion in the lower lid is that which is truly called entropion; and it is either congenital or acquired. It is acquired by injury or incision or cautery or something like that.	0.7806392
The method of operating is to take a needle with a double thread and insert it into the flesh, passing it from the left canthus to the right canthus, until the thread is at both edges of the flesh. Then pull the flesh upwards with the needle and cut it with a wide scalpel.	This is the method of operating for it: you take a needle through which has been passed a double thread and you run it into the flesh, making it penetrate from the left angle of the eye to the right angle so that the thread is fixed in flesh both ends. Then with the needle stretch the flesh upwards and make an incision with a broad scalpel; and if the eyelid returns to its proper shape, well and good.	0.83597803
If the eyelid returns to its proper shape, then [stop]. Otherwise, take a probe, place it on the location of the incision, and turn the eyelid with it. Make two incisions on the inside of the eyelid, with the ends of the incisions starting from the corners of the cut that you made, until they meet, forming an angle. So that when they are joined, their shape resembles this form:.	But if not, take a probe and put it on the site of the incision and with it turn back the lid. Then make two incisions on the inner side of the lid; the two incisions should begin from the angles of the incision already made and run together making an angle so that when they join they are like this.	0.7483891
Which is the Greek letter lambda. Then remove the flesh, making the acute angle lower than the eyelid. Then join the separated parts with two sutures using wool thread. Then treat it with the softening medications and bandages we mentioned until it heals.	It is the Greek letter lambda. You remove that flesh in proportion as the angled side is lower than that adjoining the lid; then bring the divided parts together with two sutures made with a woollen thread. Then treat with the relaxing medicaments and dressings we have mentioned, till healed.	0.8749001
If the ectropion resulted from an incision, a suture, or cauterization, it is necessary to make a simple incision, again below the eyelashes as described before, then separate the two lips [of the wound] with bandages as we mentioned.	But if the inversion is acquired, from incision, suture, or cautery, you should make a simple incision below the eyelashes, as has been described, then bring apart the two edges with a packing, as we have said.	0.8230053
In summary, the treatment of ectropion, whether upper or lower, should be carried out according to the form the ectropion takes, as it can vary greatly in appearance.  The experienced practitioner will devise a strategy by whatever means possible.	The sum of what there is to say about the treatment of inversion, whether it is in the upper or the lower lid, is that you should make your procedure follow the actual lines of the inversion itself ; for this is of varying shape. The experienced practitioner will make use of his skill in any way he can to re-establish the natural form or approximate to it.	0.69887054
Until the form is restored to its natural state, or close to it.  The condition itself, in most cases, will guide you to the appropriate action and instrument.	The experienced practitioner will make use of his skill in any way he can to re-establish the natural form or approximate to it. The disease itself will generally indicate to you the appropriate operation and instruments.	0.60559165
