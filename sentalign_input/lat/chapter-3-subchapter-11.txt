On the restoration of a fracture of the elbow.
Chapter XII.
The elbow is that which lies between the forearm and the top of the shoulder blade.
If it breaks, then its restoration is according to one of two methods.
One of which is: to take a flat piece of wood of medium thickness, in the following shape.
And two bands are tied at both ends.
Then it is hung from a high place, and the patient sits on a seat.
Then he stretches his broken arm over the wood until it reaches its middle, where the wood is curved.
Then hang something heavy over it so that the assistant stretches it downward.
Then the doctor aligns the fracture with his hands until the bone returns to where it should be.
The other method is that the patient lies back on his neck, and his hand is hung from his neck with a band.
Then instruct two assistants: one to hold above the fracture with his hands, and the other to hold below, and each stretches in his direction.
And if you want the extension to be stronger, then tie a band below the fracture and another above, and each of the two assistants stretches in his own direction.
If the fracture is near the end of the shoulder, then one band should be placed below the middle, and another below the fracture toward the forearm.
Similarly, if the fracture is near the elbow, then a band should be placed on that spot and on the elbow itself.
Then align the fracture with ease, without effort, until the fracture is aligned as it should be and applied well; then secure it, if there is no warm swelling.
If there is a warm swelling, then release the binding until the seventh day.
And place soft wool soaked in vinegar and rose oil on it until the swelling subsides; then secure it: the method of securing it is to place a plaster over the fracture.
Then place a wrapping of new cloth over the plaster.
Then the arm is set over the elbow, and the patient places his open hand on his shoulder.
And place a cloth, and bind it over the elbow, so that the arm stays in place instead of splints, unless something prevents you, nor is anything altered by the broken bone.
If you fear something may be altered by the broken bone, then use splints: place over the fracture a splint that is wider and stronger than the other splints.
Place a finger’s width between each splint, and the length of the splints should cover the fracture with an addition of three fingers on each side.
Then bind tightly over the splints with the binding mentioned at the beginning of the chapter.
And make the binding tighter over the location of the fracture.
And the farther the fracture extends, the less tight the binding should be.
If therefore you see the position of the splints and the binding as we have said, at the time when you immediately restore the limb, then do so; and if you fear a warm swelling, then release the binding and splints until the seventh day, as we have said.
Then examine the binding every three days to ensure that no itching or swelling occurs, or that food is not prevented from reaching the limb due to the excessive binding.
Therefore, correct everything according to what we have said.
If, however, you have confidence that nothing will happen as a result, then do not loosen the binding until after three days or more.
Let the patient sleep on his back with his hand on his stomach, and place a cushion filled with wool evenly under his elbow.
And monitor every hour of the night or day to ensure that the shape of the broken limb is not disturbed or that the binding does not loosen.
Therefore, correct it all with your skill.
And provide the patient’s food in the order we prescribed, so that at first it is light food, until the bone begins to heal; then it is appropriate to increase his food.
For it is customary for the elbow and leg to be secured for forty days; then it should be loosened, and a bath given, and treated with ointments that restore it.
But if the fracture is severe or rough, then do not loosen the binding and splints for fifty days, or even up to two months.
