This illness which is below, which is truly called "axacrati," and is natural and accidental.	This inversion in the lower lid is that which is truly called entropion; and it is either congenital or acquired.	0.44948626
The accidental comes from wounds and fissures and cauterization and similar things; and the method of working on it is that you take a needle, which has a double thread, and stick it in the flesh, and make it pierce from the left tear duct to the right, so that the thread comes out on both sides of the flesh; then stretch the flesh above with the needle, and cut it with a wide spatula.	It is acquired by injury or incision or cautery or something like that. This is the method of operating for it: you take a needle through which has been passed a double thread and you run it into the flesh, making it penetrate from the left angle of the eye to the right angle so that the thread is fixed in flesh both ends. Then with the needle stretch the flesh upwards and make an incision with a broad scalpel; and if the eyelid returns to its proper shape, well and good.	0.8420886
