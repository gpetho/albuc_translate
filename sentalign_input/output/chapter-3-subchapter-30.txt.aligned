On the dislocation of the spine of the back	On the treatment of dislocation of the spinal vertebrae.	0.7260479
When the spine of the back or neck is dislocated, or if there are several dislocated, there is no cure, for death quickly takes the patient.	When any of the vertebrae of the back or the neck are completely dislocated or a number of vertebrae are displaced, there is no treatment in this case for death is hastening toward the patient.	0.85889876
And the sign is that the excrement comes out involuntarily, and cannot be held, and often some limbs are weakened, either both thighs or both arms or one.  And often the spine is distorted in four ways; that which is distorted backwards is called "gibbosity": the treatment is that you see if the gibbosity has come from childhood: if so there is no cure or healing at all.	The sign of this is that the injured man passes a motion involuntarily, being unable to hold it back; often too some of his limbs go limp, either both legs or both arms or one of them. If, as often happens, a single vertebra is displaced, the displacement may be in any of four directions. When there is a displacement backwards it is called 'curvature of the spine'. As to its treatment: examine it; if the curvature dates from childhood then there is no treatment or cure at all for it.	0.835485
And that which comes from a fall or blows or similar things, the ancients spoke of methods of treatment with grand words, where there is not much benefit in any of them; but I have shortened it according to my understanding, and have designed instruments in various ways.	As for the sort that occurs from a fall or a blow or the like, the Ancients indulged in lengthy dissertations thereon, giving many kinds of treatment, the greater part of which is of no use. But I have abbreviated from it, making a little which will serve in place of their much, consisting in my clarification and exposition of the sense. I have also depicted the instrument differently from their account and their explanation.	0.81476295
And if it does not return with this treatment, then take a board three cubits long, and wedge it under the wall, and the patient should be on their side, and put the end of the board under the wall, then place the middle of the board on the spine; and the physician places his feet on the other end of the board, and presses well, until it returns to place; and if you wish, do it with a winch that turns by hand.	But if it does not go back under this treatment then let a board be taken, about three cubits long, and let a place be hollowed out in the wall, which, as we said, should be near the patient, into which you put the end of the board; then place the mid-point of the board upon the hump, and he—the doctor—should place both his feet on the other end and strongly thrust upon the spine until it is forced back into position.	0.8825153
