Chapter eighty-three on images of the instruments that use cupping glasses in diseases of the anus, diarrhea, and colic.	CHAPTER EIGHTY-THREE. On the kinds of instrument for administering enemata in diseases of the rectum, and in diarrhoea and colic.	0.75375605
The syringe may be made of silver, or of Chinese porcelain, or of cast or hammered copper.	A clyster may be made of silver or of Chinese alloy or of cast or hammered bronze.	0.89061207
And this instrument can be made small and large, according to those who use it. So those used in the treatment of young boys are small.	Large and small varieties of this instrument are made, to suit those on whom they are to be used; those for the treatment of children will be small.	0.72536665
And those whose anuses are narrow or painful, their syringes should be very gentle.	Patients with stricture of the anus, or pain, will have very slender clysters.	0.6524302

Its upper funnel, where the wineskin is attached, should be wide in this manner. It has a barrier where the wineskin is attached, as you see.	The upper end of the funnel to which the membrane is bound should be broad like this; it should have a rim where the membrane may be bound down, as you see.	0.8117333
And its lower end, which enters the anus, should be solid, very smooth, and thin; on one of its sides are two holes and on the other side is one hole. The width of the hole should be the thickness of a probe or a little thicker.	The lower extremity, which is introduced into the anus, should be closed and smooth, and on one side of it should be two holes, and on the other, one; the width of the holes should be about that of a probe or a little wider.	0.8696036
And the wineskin, in which you put the medications, should be made from an animal bladder or from thin sheepskin, made in the shape of a small round tablecloth, its diameter a span, pierced with many holes all around.	The membrane to hold the medicament is made out of an animal's bladder or of parchment, made up in the form of a small bag, a span in diameter.	0.61006105
And the distance between each hole should be the width of a finger, then you insert into those holes a strong thread of two-ply yarn of ten strands or so. And you gather the wineskin with it like the tablecloth, so when the medication is placed in it, tighten the top of the syringe between two stones tightly, then inject with it.	It should be pierced with a number of holes in a circle a finger's breadth apart; and into these holes pass a strong thread of yarn, twisted of ten or so threads, and with this gather up the skin like a bag; and when the medicament is placed in it tie it down firmly between the two rims on the upper end of the clyster; and then give the enema.	0.8021939
And this is a picture of the circle of the wineskin and the hole:	This is the figure of the circle of skin with the holes.	0.519099
The method of enema is to fill the leather or bladder with the medication, warmed to a degree the patient can tolerate. And beware that it be too hot or too cold.	Now the way to give an enema with this instrument is for the parchment or bladder to be filled with the medicament, which should be warmed so as to be tolerable for the patient; but beware lest it be too hot or too cold.	0.81431204
Then the patient lies on his back and raises his legs up, and a mat or blanket is placed under him.	Then let the patient lie back and raise his legs; and put under them a leather mat or a blanket.	0.8663742
Then the tip of the enema syringe is lubricated with oil, or egg white, or fenugreek mucilage, or similar. Then it is inserted into the anus gently. Then the attendant takes the syringe with both hands and squeezes it firmly until all of its contents are emptied into the intestine.	Then anoint the tip of the clyster with oil or egg-white or mucilage of fenugreek or the like; then gently pass it into the anus; then let an assistant take the membrane in both hands and together firmly squeeze it until all the contents are squirted into the bowel.	0.91463894
Then the syringe is removed, and the patient raises his legs against the wall. If the medication stimulates him to defecate, he should hold it as long as he can. And if he sleeps with it the whole night, it is most effective in benefit. If it is administered for diarrhea and its expulsion is hastened, the enema should be repeated until he recovers.	Then the clyster should be removed and the patient should raise his legs against the wall. If the enema stimulates him to evacuate, let him hold it as long as he can; if he delay all night long, it will be all the more efficacious. If the enema be given in a case of diarrhoea and he has to evacuate hastily, then the use of the enema should be repeated until he is cured.	0.9067541
If there are hemorrhoids or painful swellings in the anus, the syringe should be very smooth, smoother than the syringes used for children. This is a picture of a smooth syringe with its leather tightly stretched:	If there be haemorrhoids or painful tumours in the anus, the clyster should be exceedingly slender and smooth, of the sort employed for children. Here is a figure of a fine clyster with its skin tied on.	0.7643083
