Chapter Forty-Five.
On Incising the Types of Tumors.
Tumors have many types, and I have mentioned all of their types in the classification, and it is necessary for us to describe here the difference between the tumor and the abscess, as it is problematic.  So I say that the abscess comes with heat and fever and terrible pains until the boiling of the excess subsides.
And the putrefaction is completed, at which time the fever and the sharpness subside.  And the tumor does not come with heat nor fever nor pains, and a peritoneal sac contains it, which is its specific container, and it is the color of the body, and its beginning is like a chickpea, and it becomes like a duck egg, and larger and smaller.
And it is of two types: either fatty, or it contains moisture, and the colors of the moisture are many, as I mentioned in the classification. So it is necessary, when you proceed to the treatment of the tumor, that you probe it and examine it first with the instrument that is called the probe, as its image will come in the chapter after this.
as large as the tumor, then remove the probe and look at what comes out after it. If flowing moisture comes out, whatever color it is, then incise it with a simple incision, as I have mentioned in the other tumors. But if moisture does not come out after the probe, then know that it is fatty.
So make a cruciform incision on it in this way, as I have shown you, and suspend it with hooks, and gently peel the skin from every side, and preserve the sac, if you are able to do so, to remove it whole with the tumor.
If the sac is ruptured during the operation and you cannot remove it whole, then this often happens, so remove it piece by piece until nothing remains of it, for if anything remains of it, little or much, the tumor will return, most commonly.
If it overcomes you and a little of it remains, then cauterize the wound when you are finished with some of the sharp, corrosive powders and tighten the wound and put on top of it what soothes the hot swelling and treat it with all other treatments until it heals. If the tumor is large, then suture its lips and treat it with what causes it to heal.
If you encounter a pulsating or non-pulsating vessel and bleeding occurs, then quickly cauterize the area with ground vitriol and leave it bandaged for two or three days until the wound putrefies and the boiling of the blood subsides, then return to cutting what remains of the tumor.
