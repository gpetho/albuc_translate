When someone experiences acute episodes affecting the eyes or the chest, and this becomes chronic, and drug treatment is ineffective, the most effective treatment in this case is the incision of these two arteries.	When a person gets painful defluxions into the eyes or chest which become chronic, and medical treatment is ineffectual in this case, then section of these arteries will be the most efficacious treatment.	0.85295665
So, if you want to incise them, you should shave the patient's head with a razor, then rub the area with a rough cloth so that the artery appears, then tie the patient's neck with the edge of his garment, then look where the vessel pulsates, and their two locations are the two lowered areas behind the ears, and they are rarely hidden except in some people.	When you decide on section, you should shave the patient's head with a razor; then rub the place with a rough cloth to show up the artery; then bind the patient's neck with an end of his garment; then you will observe where the artery is pulsating (the sites of both are the depressions behind the ears) for it is uncommon for them to remain hidden, except in a few persons.	0.79887164
Then mark them with ink, then cut them with the lancet to the bone, and that should be across the head, and if you wish, insert the lancet from under the artery and lift it upwards by cutting, and the length of the cut should be about two closed fingers.	Then do you mark with ink over both; then cut with a hooked scalpel, cutting down to the bone; the incision should be lateral to the head. Or if you prefer, introduce the scalpel beneath the artery and make a thrusting cut up at it. The incision should be of about two fingers' breadth.	0.821617
For when the vessel is severed, the blood comes out in a pulsating gush, spurting forward with repeated spurts.  If the artery does not appear to the touch, then you should measure about three fingers from the ear, then mark with ink and incise to the bone, and what is necessary is to...	When cut, the artery gives out a pulsating jet of blood spurting intermittently. If the artery is not discernible, you should measure three fingers' breadth from the ear, than mark with ink, and cut down to the bone.	0.77778244
Let six ounces of blood flow, on average, and perhaps you will let more or less than that, all according to what you see of the patient's strength and the fullness of his arteries. Then look at the wound, and if any membrane remains on the bone, cut it away.	The quantity of blood that should be let is six ounces on the average, but often more blood, or less, is withdrawn; all in proportion to the strength of the patient and the fullness of the arteries as they appear to you. Then examine the wound and if there remains on the bone any part of the membrane cut it off to avoid a haematoma.	0.8841017
So that a hot swelling does not occur, then pack the wound with a wick of linen cloths, then treat it with ointments until it heals.	Then bind up the wound with a bandage of linen cloth and dress with ointments till healed.	0.6647612
