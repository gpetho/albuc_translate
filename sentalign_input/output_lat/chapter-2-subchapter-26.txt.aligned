Be aware that when a separation occurs in the continuity of one of these cartilages, treatment is only sometimes effective, depending on the person.	You should know that when discontinuity occurs in one of these cartilages, treatment of them rarely does any good, except in a few people.	0.8017541
Therefore, when an injury like this occurs, assess whether it is a fresh wound with blood present. If so, bring the two edges of the wound together with a suture, and then treat it until it heals.	When such a thing happens to anyone, look carefully, and if the wound be fresh and bleeding, bring the edges of the wound together with a suture, and dress them till they are healed.	0.67612326
If the edges of the wound have already separated and each part has healed, you must abrade each side until it bleeds. Then bring the two edges together with a suture, tighten them, and sprinkle ground dragonâ€™s blood and frankincense onto the wound. Apply a piece of diafinicon plaster or another healing plaster over the powders, and leave it bound for two or three days. Then unbind it and change the medicine; leave it until the stitches fall out on their own. Finally, treat it with ointment until it heals.	If the discontinuity has separated the edges, and both edges have healed, it is necessary to scrape both edges on the external skin till they bleed; then bring the edges together with a suture and dust over it dragon's blood and olibanum; and put over the powder a plaster of Palm ointment or some other of the regenerative ointments, and leave bandaged for two or three days; then unbandage and change the medicine, and let the sutures come away of themselves; and afterward dress with ointment till healed.	0.8905261
The method of suturing is to bring the parts together either with needles, as we described in suturing the abdomen, or with thread, as I have taught you.	Now the manner of suturing is to close the discontinuity, either with a needle, as we describe for suture of the belly, or with a thread as we tell you there.	0.76460445
