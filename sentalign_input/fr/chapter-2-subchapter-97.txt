Leeches are only administered in members where cups cannot be placed due to their small size, such as lips and gums, and similar places;
and in places bare of flesh, such as fingers or nose, and other similar places;
and the procedure of their use is that when you find leeches in clean fresh water without rot, take them;
and place them for a night in fresh water, until they are hungry, and have nothing in their bellies;
and then bleed the vein and the cup, then rub the member until it is red, and place the leeches on;
and when they are full, and fall off, if it is a place where you can put a cup, place it, because it is very beneficial after.
If not, clean the place with wormwood, and then with water, very well, and then press it;
and if the place bleeds too much after the leeches, soak a linen cloth in cold water, and place it on, until the blood is stopped;
and if the blood increases, place powdered vitriol, or galls, and similar things, until it is stopped;
or place peeled fava beans on the place, and leave them until they stick to the place, and it will stop immediately;
and if you need more, take other leeches.
And if the leeches do not want to attach, rub the place with fresh blood, or prick it with a needle until the blood flows,
and then place them on, and as soon as they smell the blood, they will attach;
and when you want them to fall off, sprinkle a bit of powdered aloe and salt, or ash, and they will fall off immediately.
