On lifting hair irritating the eye with a needle.	On the removal with the needle of irritating lashes from the eye.	0.7398341
If there is a hair or two, the procedure is to take a thin needle and thread it with a smooth, thin silk thread. Then, bring the two ends together and tie them in a very delicate knot. The length of the thread should be about a span.	If it be one or two hairs the operation will be to take a fine needle, thread it with a fine smooth silk, bring the ends together, and knot them with a tiny knot; the thread should be about a span in length.	0.8774993
Then, attach to the loop another thinner thread, shorter in length, and tie its ends if you wish. Then, have the patient place their head in your lap, close to the sun so that the work is clear, as it is delicate work. Then, insert the needle with the loop at the root of the extra hair.	Then in the loop insert another fine thread, shorter than the first, and join the ends with a knot if you wish. Then let the patient put his head in your lap in full sunlight, so that the operation may be clearly seen, because it is very fine work.	0.86905694
And quickly pass it through the eyelid until you bring it out above the natural hair. Then, pull the thread over the loop and insert the extra hair(s) into the loop, whether one, two, or three, no more.	Then introduce the needle with the loop to the root of the superfluous hair and run it quickly through the eyelid till you make it come out above the natural hair. Then draw the thread to the top of the loop and introduce that hair into the loop if it be one, two, or three, but not more.	0.806659
Then pull your hand with it until the hair comes out with the loop in the eyelid, along with the natural hairs. If you pull the loop and the hair does not come out with it, pull the loop down with the thread that you attached to it until the loop comes out of the upper hole.	Then draw away your hand with it until the hair emerges with the loop on the eyelid among the natural hair. If you pull the loop and the hair does not come out with it, you draw the loop down by means of the thread which you have previously passed through it, until the loop comes out at the upper perforation.	0.915087
Then replace the hair in it and pull them both. Do this until it rises in the upper hole and you can see it clearly. Then, release the loop and thread and remove them. Tighten the eye and leave it tightened for two or three days until the hair takes hold in its place and the flesh grows over it.	Then put the hair back in and draw them both up; keep on until the hair rises up in the upper perforation and you can see it. Then extract loop and thread and take them both out, and bind the eye and leave it bound for two or three days till the hair be fixed in its place and there is regeneration of flesh over it.	0.9299066
If the hair is short, you can either add a long natural hair to it so it rises with it, or leave it until it grows longer after a while, at which point you can lift it.	If the hair be short, put with it a long natural hair so that it may be raised together with that; or let the hair grow till it reach a greater length, then raise it.	0.87506217
