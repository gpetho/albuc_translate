When someone trembles from coldness of the nerves, or from quartan fever or other, then you must make four cauteries or four on the spine of the back, one cautery between each vertebra; and one cautery on the feet, and one on the stomach with olive cautery; thus the trembling will cease, and the health of the cold illness will hasten.	When someone has a tremor, either from chill in a nerve or quartan fever, or from some other cause, you should cauterize him four or five times over the vertebrae of the back, one between each vertebra, and one on his breast and one on his stomach, with an olivary cautery. Thus the tremor will be stilled and the dispersal of the cold distemper will be hastened.	0.8954288
