Oh, children, since I have completed this book for you, which is the last of the science of medicine, and because its conclusion lies within it, and through its expositions and declarations, it seems fitting for me to complete it for you with this treatise, which is a section of surgical practice.
For surgical practice is widely spread in our region and in our time, almost entirely lost, to the point that the science of it is greatly endangered, and its traces are diminished; and only a few small descriptions in the books of the Ancients remain, which have confused the methods and led to errors and hesitations, to the point that the understanding of it is obscured and its force and art are lessened.
And it seems to me that I shall revitalize it [surgical practice] with the organization of this treatise, in accordance with the method of exposition, declaration, and abbreviation; and in order that it might be accompanied by the forms of cautery tools and other instruments of the craft, by adding to its explanation, and by preparing it, which is necessary.
However, the reason why a skilled craftsman with his own hands is not easily found in our time is that the art of medicine is extensive, and its practitioners must first be versed in the science of anatomy, which describes the limbs and their forms, their connections and separations; and must have knowledge of bones, nerves, and muscles, their numbers and distribution; and of pulsating and still veins, and the locations where they branch.
And therefore Hippocrates said that a name is a word, but small in work, and even more so in the art of the hand.
But we have already mentioned this in the introduction to this book; for whoever is not knowledgeable about what we have said concerning anatomy is liable to fall into errors that will cause the death of people, as I have seen many such cases, for some are trained in this science and abandon it without understanding and without experience.
For I saw a foolish and inexperienced physician attempt to lance a scrofulous abscess on a woman's neck, and cut some of the neck's arteries so that much blood flowed until the woman died in his hands.
And I saw another physician who attempted to remove a stone from a man who had suffered with it for a long time. The stone was large, and he came and pulled it out with a piece of the bladder, so that the man died on the third day.
And I myself, having tried to avoid that, saw that because of the size of the stone and the condition of the patient, I knew that he would die.
And I saw another physician, who received payment from a duke in our land for surgery, and he went to a blacksmith whose thigh was fractured.  This physician, with his ignorance, set the fracture by binding the wound with pads and splints with too much tightness, and did not allow the wound to breathe.
Then he loosened it according to his desires, and then he bound it, and then he left it for several days and commanded that we loosen the bandage.  And it remained this way until the thigh and the leg were abscess-ridden and led to ruin.
And I was called to him, and I prepared to loosen the bandage, and thus tranquility was achieved and he was relieved of his pain.
But meanwhile, corruption had already taken hold in the limb, so I could not stop it, and the corruption continued in the limb until the patient perished.
And I saw another physician who opened a cancerous abscess, and it festered for a few days, until its malignancy was greatly magnified by the owner of the patient.
Because cancer is pure melancholy humor, it is not appropriate to treat it with iron at all, but rather it should be on a limb which has the capacity to endure being completely removed.
And therefore, children, it is necessary for you that the surgical operation be divided into two parts: one being the operation that is associated with health, and the other being the work which is dangerous in the greatest of conditions.
And I have already explained this throughout this book, where there is mention of surgery in which there is error and fear; therefore, it is necessary for you to guard against this and leave it behind, so that foolish things will not find a way to speak and dishonor you.
Therefore, take your weapons with diligence and with God's protection, and your patients with kindness and firmness.
And use the best path, through God's grace, achieving health and praiseworthy success, and leave behind the terrible illnesses that are difficult to cure, and remove from your weapons that which causes you fear, so that the trust in your faith and your name does not abandon you: for more remains for your glory, and higher in the world and behind your holiness.
Guilia already said in some of her teachings/instructions: Do not treat a serious illness, so that you are not called bad doctors.
And I have divided this book into three chapters.
Begins the division of the book, and first of the first part. The first chapter, ordered from head to foot, deals with the forms of instruments and the tools for cauteries, and what is necessary in the operation.
The division of the second part. The second chapter, on incision and perforation, and on cupping, and on wounds, and on the extraction of arrows and similar things,  is entirely cataloged and ordered according to the forms of the instruments.
The third chapter, on restoration and dislocation, and on the treatment of twisting and similar things; a chapter ordered from head to foot, and concerning the forms of the instruments.
It is necessary for me to describe the benefits and harms of this cauterization, and in which constitution cauterization is forbidden.
Therefore I say that the discourse on the benefits and harms of cauterization is long and verbose, subtle in science, and hidden in secrecy; and many wise men have already spoken of it, and they have disagreed, and a small part of their discourses suffices for me, fearing to prolong it.
And therefore I say that cauterization benefits all constitutions universally, whether with or without matter, except for two constitutions, which are hot constitutions without matter.
In the hot and dry constitution with matter, there is disagreement; for some say that cauterization is helpful in that case, and others say the opposite, that cauterization is not suitable in an illness that is characterized by heat and dryness, since the nature of fire is heat and dryness, and it is inappropriate that a hot and dry illness be cured with something that is hot and dry.
And those who say the opposite argue that cauterization provides benefit in all hot and dry illnesses that occur in the human body, because when you compare the human body and its humors to the constitution of fire, you find the human body to be cold.
And I say, based on that argument, that experience has shown me this in some instances.
However, this should not be taken by those who are already skilled and experienced in the chapter on cauterization through prior practice, and who have understood the diverse constitutions of people, the nature of illnesses themselves, their causes, their symptoms, and the timeframes of these illnesses.
But in other constitutions, there is no need for hesitation, and especially in cold and moist illnesses, because all physicians have reached agreement on these, and are not in disagreement about using cauterization in them.
And know, children, that the secret of curing by cauterization with fire, and its efficacy, is due to the simplicity of fire, whose action affects only the part being cauterized, and does not harm other parts connected to it, except for minor damage.
However, the action of a burning medicine reaches parts distant from it, and easily causes a difficult-to-heal illness in the affected area, and it easily causes it to worsen.
But fire, due to its subtlety and the goodness of its substance, does not do this except incidentally.  And this is known to us through experiment and a long period of study of the art, concerning the truth of causes; therefore, I am excused from a lengthy discourse.  And if it were not for the fact that this topic, concerning the secret use of fire in medicine, and the nature of its action on the body, and its expulsion of illnesses, is already contained in my book in this section, I would have presented you with a philosophical demonstration of the subject, which would be more fitting for your comprehension.
And know, children, that they disagree on the time when cauterization is most appropriate, and they consider the best time to be springtime.
And I say that cauterization is appropriate at all times, because the harm caused by accidental timing is outweighed by the benefit derived from the cauterization, and especially if the cauterization is for intense and immediate pains or necessary pain, which cannot tolerate delay, because the danger of a greater harm from delay, outweighs the slight harm from the time.
And this, children, is not understood by those of you with discernment, or by foolish physicians.  It is that the cure for an illness treated with cauterization is not always immediately effective, and they, therefore, disregard this consequence.
And the reason isn't what they think, because cauterization isn't just any medicine; it alters the constitution and dries out the humidities that are the cause of the pain.
However, cauterization is superior to other medicines due to its potency, effectiveness, and the greatness of its effect.
And it is possible that the illness might return at some time, depending on the patient's constitution, the location of the illness, and the patient's resilience, as well as the accumulation of excess fluids within them, and the acquisition of these things through food and similar causes.  However, if the illness for which cauterization is administered is a minor illness in a limb with few excess fluids and humidities, like a toothache and similar ailments, it is possible that the pain will not return, but this occurs in minor cases.
And the common saying is that cauterization is the last resort in medicine, and it's a truthful statement, not what they perceive.  For they believe there is no cure that helps as much as cauterization.
However, the opposite is true. The idea that cauterization is the last resort in medicine is only true when the methods of treatment in certain illnesses have failed, and those treatments aren't effective.  Then, at the end of the process, cauterization is used, and it may be successful. Therefore, the idea that cauterization is the last resort in medicine is not as understood by the common people and many foolish doctors.
And the ancients said that cauterization with gold is better than cauterization with iron, and they said this only because of the preciousness and superior nature of gold's substance.
And they said that the location of the cauterization doesn't matter, but this isn't absolutely true.  I have proven this and found that this is only true in some bodies, not all. Cauterization with gold is good and better than with iron, as they said; however, when you use gold in a cauterization, it's not entirely up to you. The effect depends on the amount of gold used, and because gold is resistant to heat, it's hard to properly heat. If you apply the flame directly to the gold, the gold will melt, and the craftsman might burn himself due to this.
Therefore, cauterization with iron is done more easily and more directly with regard to the procedure.
And I have organized this chapter on cauterization by sections, and have arranged them from head to foot, so that the seeker may find what they want.
The first chapter.
This cauterization is applied to the moisture and coldness affecting the brain, the causes of which are twofold: one is the cause of cold and copious rheumatic flux, called 'corissa', flowing from the head to the eye and ear areas, along with excessive sleep, toothache, and sore throat, and generally any illness arising from coldness, such as paralysis, stroke, and apoplexy, and similar ailments.
The method of this cauterization is this: first, you order the patient to be purged with laxative medicine, emptying the head for three or four nights, according to the strength of the patient, their age, and their usual constitution.
And then you command him to shave his head, and then place him on a smooth bench with your hands under his head, and let him rest his hands on his feet.
And then place the blade of your palm,  near the bridge of his nose between his eyes. However, when the middle finger has reached the spot, mark that area with a probe, and then apply the olive cautery, the method for which is as follows:
Then place that [cautery] over the spot marked with the probe, so that it descends, with your hand being gradually constrained, and you turn it.
Then slightly raise your hand and observe the area, and if you see a significant amount of bone exposed, about the size of a grain of millet, then lift your hand; and if not, then turn your hand with that iron (or with another, if it is cooled), until the bone is as I've told you.
Then take a little salt and dissolve it over the area, and leave it for three days.
Then place a cloth soaked in broth over it and leave it until the scab from the fire is destroyed. Then treat the area with tetrafarmacon ointment until it is healed.
And if they say that while the wound remains open, it is better to remove the arm, for that is better and more helpful.
And some of them say that the bone should be cauterized down to the bone, and the cautery should be held until some part of the bone's substance has been burnt.
And then that which is burnt off from the bone should be scraped away, and then it should be treated.
And others say that with the cautery, they should go to the back, until it strongly penetrates into the bone, until the bone yields, and this is the manner of the small alphecati: And they believe that vapors from the head are expelled from that area.
And the wound should be kept open for a long time, and then treated until it is healed.
But I have not seen these two types of cautery in all cases, only in some individuals due to fear; and leaving that aside, in my view, it is better to use it with caution, when appropriate; for the head is weakened by the disruption of its continuity, just as we have observed in other parts of the body, and especially when the patient's head is of a frail nature.
And the first type of cautery is safer and better in my opinion; and using it with this method is good.
Second Chapter.
Of cautery of the head.
When chronic and prolonged pain affects the entire head in a prolonged illness, and various remedies such as leeches, cupping, head purges, plasters, poultices, and similar treatments have been used, but none of these treatments are effective, then consider this: if the patient's head is strong by nature, and not frail, and exhibits significant coldness, then apply another cautery beneath the first one. And then cauterize that area on the patient's head with a cautery until the pain is gone. Cut through the pain and reveal the amount of bone we have described, and cauterize that area with a cautery on the back of the head, in the location called the "vas" (a blood vessel) – and that is the spot where a cupping device is applied. And ease your hand in this, and do not expose the bone, for the patient will experience intense pain different from the pain of all other head cauteries.
And I would place this cautery in its proper location, because the cautery used for cauterizing the temples and the back of the head needs to be a more delicate cautery than the one used to cauterize the middle of the head.  This is the correct procedure.
Chapter Three.
Of the cauterization of recent migraines.
When there is persistent pain in the head, or pain extending to the eye, the head should be cleansed with medicaments, and other treatments, which I have described in the descriptions of illnesses, should be administered.  If this proves ineffective, then cauterization in that location can be done in two ways: either with a burning medicinal agent, or with iron.
But cauterization with a burning medicine is when you take a clove of garlic, and scrape and cut the ends of both ends of it. And then you make an incision in the painful area of the temple with a sharp lancet, until a cavity is made below the skin, until it is hidden.
And then apply pressure to it with a bandage to constrict it, and leave it for three hours.  Then remove it and discard the garlic, and leave the wound for two or three days, and then apply a cloth soaked in water until the wound is healed.
And then treat it with ointment until it is healed.
And if you wish, do this with some burning medicines that I have written about in the second treatise on burning medicines.
But the cauterization with iron, according to this method:  heat it with a cautery iron, of which this is the form:
and it is called a 'nail' or 'small nail,' because its head is shaped like a nail, which has a slight curve, and in the middle of it there is a small prominence.
And then place it on the painful area, and hold your hand – so that the surrounding area isn't burned – and turn the small iron slowly and steadily.
And if the amount burned by the intensity of the cautery is like half of it, then lift your hand so that the underlying artery isn't burned, to prevent blood flow.
And then soak cotton in salt water and place it on the area, and leave it for three days; and then apply cotton soaked with butter, and then treat with ointment until healed.
And if you wish, cauterize with the blade of the scalpel according to the cautery method, and be careful to avoid cutting an artery in this particular, not-ancient, procedure.
Fourth Chapter.
On the cauterization of ancient migraines.
When you treat a migraine with what we have described in the previous treatment, and what we have said in the divisions of diseases, and the treatment doesn't work, and sometimes due to the illness the patient cannot tolerate what we have described about the first cauterization with medicine or cauterization with fire, then you must heat the scalpel cautery until it is white hot, and then apply it to the painful area in a line the length of which is half a finger's width, or a little less; and apply pressure with your hand once, and hold it firmly until you cut the artery and reach the bone.
However, it is necessary for you to be mindful of the continuity of the jaw, which is strained by chewing, and that the muscle is not injured, and the nerves which control it, and that a spasm does not occur.
And if it is about the care and caution of the flow of blood from the incised artery, because in its incision there is fear, and especially for those who are ignorant of what they are doing and are not skilled and experienced; and leave the operation incomplete in the beginning.
And I will come back to the topic of the treatment of accidental blood flow from the artery, in its own manner, in its proper place in this book.
And if you see that this treatment with this cautery is not effective, and you see the patient's condition is tolerable, cauterize the area in the middle of the head as we have described, and treat the wound until it is healed.
And if you wish, administer the cautery which we mentioned in the chapter on artery constriction using a cautery with two blades.  This is a better and more effective cauterization.
Chapter 5.
Of the cauterization of earaches.
When pain in the ear comes from cold and is treated with laxatives and the other treatments mentioned in the division, and the pain is not relieved, then apply the cautery, and this is the one called "puncta", whose form is:
And then, apply the cautery, using the ignition point, and move it around the entire ear in a circular motion, or around each affected area, if the pain is localised. Move the cautery slowly along the base of the ear, after you have marked the location with a probe.
And if the cautery has ten points across the entire ear, apply those, then treat the affected areas until they are healed.
Chapter 6.
Of cauterization of tumors.
Tumors that are cured by cauterization are only of the types that arise from phlegm, as we have stated in the divisions of illnesses.
Avoid cauterization of the type that arises from dryness or spasm of the nerve.
When you treat that type of tumor with poultices, purges, and other remedies, and your treatment does not work, then you should cauterize the patient with three cauteries: the first at the base of the ear, the second a little below the temple, and the third at the junction of the two lips.
And place your cautery opposite the diseased part, for softening only occurs in the part that appears healthy.
And the method of cauterization is to cauterize with the cautery at the right of the ear's extremity, a little above the corner of the head, and another at the temple, whose length should be according to the length of the fingertip.  Then apply your cautery until the quantity of half the thickness of the affected area has been burned.
And this is the method of cauterization, a type of surgical procedure, the method of which is described previously. However, it is more subtle than what you have seen; and it is necessary to cut away a little of the superfluous fat/thickening there.
And then treat the area with what has been previously described until it is healed.
Chapter 7.
Concerning cauterization of ancient apoplexy.
When apoplexy is longstanding, and you have treated it with what we have described, but your treatment is not working and the patient does not have a fever, then cauterize the patient with four cauteries:  on both temples of the head; with one cautery on the middle of the head, as we have previously described; and with one cautery on the throat. And the method of cauterization is done according to what has been previously stated.
And it has already been cauterized on the mouth of the stomach; and further back; and then it should be treated with what follows.
Chapter 8.
Concerning cauterization for forgetfulness caused by flame.
Large jars and pills should be given to the patient at the beginning, to cleanse the brain.
And then shave the entire head of the patient and place on their forehead a plaster of cedar, as described in the treatise on plasters.
And apply that several times, for that is a method of cauterization. And do this according to the same order that I have already described.
And if that works to heal him, well and good; and if not, then apply three cauteries to the back part of his head, extending from the highest part of the head down to the lower part of the neck. And place the width of a finger between each cautery, and then treat the cautery with whatever has been previously mentioned.
But if you are adding more, and the patient can tolerate it, then apply a cautery to the middle spot; and if you wish to add even more, then cauterize that area above the two horns.
Then treat that until it is healed; and let the cautery be oiled according to the form previously given.
Chapter 9.
Concerning the cauterization of paralysis and the softening of the entire body.
You should proceed with cleansing the head with herbs and what we have said; then shave the patient's head, and then cauterize it with a cautery in the middle of the head, and with cauteries above all the horns of the head, and with cautery on its back part, and with three cauteries on the vertebrae of the neck.
And if it is necessary in the illness of softening of the body, if it is severe and the patient is tolerating it poorly, then cauterize it with four cauteries on the vertebrae of the back, and continuously with a cautery until it is somewhat softened from the pain, and remove your hand. And then treat it until it is healed, and this should be an olive oil cautery.
Chapter 10.
Concerning the cauterization of epilepsy.
The epileptic is not cauterized unless the epilepsy is due to phlegm.
Therefore, it is necessary to treat the brain at the beginning with herbs and the other treatment that we have described in the section when the illness is severe and can tolerate the exclusion of medicines.
And if it is a child who cannot tolerate the medicines, then give remedies and mastics that treat the brain, doing so for many days, along with good food.
And then shave the patient's head, and then cauterize it with a cautery in the middle of the head according to the previous method, and with another cautery on the back of the head, and cauterize on each temple. And if the illness is severe and can tolerate it, then cauterize it with the cauteries mentioned, having previously performed paralysis and softening of the body on the vertebrae of the neck and the vertebrae of the back.
Let the cautery be olive-shaped as previously described.
But if the patient is a child, then place a subtle cautery according to this method.
Chapter 11.
Concerning the cauterization of melancholy.
When the causes of melancholy are corrupted humidity and a large flame, then cauterize that with the cauteries which we have described in the previous section on paralysis.
And if the cause of melancholy is an excess descending into melancholy, and the patient's body is moist, then give him to drink what cleanses his brain, according to what has been said before in the division.
And then shave the patient's head, and then apply a properly made tourniquet around the head, and then place it in the middle of the head.
And the patient should be seated upright, and be held securely in all parts.
And then apply a liniment; and an old sheep's fleece is even better. And heat that over a moderate fire, to the degree that the patient can tolerate it when applied to them. And then place that in the middle of their head, within the circle, and leave it until it is cool.
And do this once a week with the patient, along with their other treatment until they are healed; or if you prefer, cauterize the area with small punctures according to their ability, holding a cautery tool in place.  This type of cautery moistens the brain evenly.
And then place that cotton, soaked in wool or hen's droppings.
Chapter 12.
Of cauterization of descending water in the ear.
When you observe the beginning of water in the ear, according to the signs I have described in the division, then begin giving the patient something that will dry their head and protect it from all moisture.
And make them sweat in a bath for a few days.
And then instruct them to shave their head, and cauterize it with a cautery in the middle of the head; and then cauterize with two cauteries on both temples if the beginning of the water is in both ears, or on one side if the water is beginning in one ear.
Cut with a cautery all the veins and arteries that are beneath the scalp; and let the cauteries be at that length, in the breadth of the temples.
And watch out for blood flow when cauterizing; and if you see blood flowing, stop it with some medicine, as is possible for you.
And I will come with skill in the extraction of arteries and with their excision and caution regarding blood flow.
And sometimes it is cauterized on the neck between two bones with two cauteries placed directly there.
Chapter 13.
Concerning the cauterization of old wounds.
When wounds on the face are chronic and run along the veins and arteries evident on the outside of the head, and it is verified that this is caused by superfluous cold phlegm, then cauterize it with the cautery we described in the chapter beginning with hot water on wounds, and with a cautery in the middle of the head and with two cauteries on the neck below the two temples, and with two cauteries on the neck below the two bones. And if further treatment is needed, then cauterize the area along the entire length of the wound edge, near the eyebrow's edge, using a small cautery.
Chapter 14.
Concerning the cauterization of nasal foulness.
If your treatment using the methods described in the division proves ineffective, then prepare and give the patient a decoction to drink for three nights; afterward, shave the patient's head and cauterize it with a moderate cautery, and with an olive-oil cautery. Then cauterize the area with a rose-tipped cautery, using two cauteries slightly above the two eyebrows beneath the hair.
And be careful not to set the area on fire.
And this is the method for the rose-tipped cautery.
Chapter 15.
Concerning the softening cautery for eyelid ulcers.
When the eyelid of the eye is softened by illness or moisture, then cauterize that eyelid with a cautery using this lunar cautery; and this is the method for it:
And if you, cauterize that just above the two eyebrows a little with two cauteries in all directions, and let them be elongated away from the temples. And let the length of each cautery be according to the size of the eyebrow.
And do not press your hand with the cautery too much, but according to the amount required for a third of the eyelid to be adhered.
Chapter 16.
Of cauterization of the eyelid of the eye when the lashes have turned inwards and prick the eye.
When the lashes of the eye have turned inward, so that they prick the eye, cauterization in such cases is done in two ways: either with cautery or with a burning medicine.
If with a cautery of fire, first command the patient to remove their lashes as those who clean them, until they are lengthened and straightened; and if he pricks them near their origin, then you should bind his eyes with a bandage so that they are not harmed until the lashes grow back.
Then, once they have grown back and straightened, place the patient's head on your lap, and then gently draw a line on the eyelid with a probe, using a mark in the shape of a myrtle leaf, and the start of the mark should be close to the lashes.
And then place cotton soaked in egg white or in ptile mucilage over the eye.
And then apply the cautery, of which this is its shape.
And then cauterize over the shape you have drawn, little by little, many times, until the surface of the skin, which is like a myrtle leaf, is completely burned.
A sign of success in your work is that you see the eyelid already contracted, and the lashes raised towards the puncture of the eye.
And then lift your hand and leave it for three days, and then place cotton with a bandage over it until the scab is removed. And then treat it with ointment until it is healed.
But if, due to any cause, the hair regrows near its origin and the eyelid is softened, then apply the cautery again in the same way as you did before.
But if the hair is under the eyelid, then cauterize it until it is raised to its natural place, and is healed, and the hair no longer irritates the eye.
But the cautery with burning medicine is that which you command the patient to cut the hair until it is extended and healed, and then a leaf-shaped piece of cloth should be made in the shape of a myrtle leaf.
And then take known salve and a living vine sap, or something similar, and thoroughly mix these things quickly so they don't get cold; and then spread this mixture over the cloth shaped like a myrtle leaf, and place this over the affected eye or both eyes; and place a cloth soaked in egg white under the eye, and the patient's head should be supported by you.
And place your finger on the medicine and gently press it, but do not remove it until the patient feels the medicine's warmth, for the effect should be like a burn.
And thus, when the patient perceives the warmth, then remove the medicine and wash it off with your finger; then, when the warmth ceases, remove the medicine, and wash the eye with water; then see if the eyelid has already been lifted, as if it has been freed from the pressure of the fire or incision, because then it is well; and if not, return to that medicine on the spot where it didn't get applied, and don't let it fester until your treatment is healed and the eye has healed.
And then apply a bandage to it until the burn's effects are gone, and then treat it with a definitive ointment or something similar until it is healed.
It is necessary for you, after your treatment, to be very careful that no medicine gets into the eye.  And if, after a few days, the eyelid is softened, and some of the hair is stuck in the eye, then re-apply your medicine to the softened area of the eyelid, precisely as you did at the beginning, and continue treating it until healed.
And this is the method/treatment for eye inflammation.
And know that human eyes vary in size and smallness, and thus, your treatment is determined accordingly.
And the path to recovery for the one who is being studied in this art will not be hidden.
Chapter 17.
Concerning the cauterization of fistulas in the tear duct of the eye.
When you treat a fistula using the methods discussed in the divisions of diseases, and your treatment proves ineffective, then you must cauterize it in this manner:  tell the patient to rest their head on your lap, and have another assistant hold the patient's head firmly between your hands, so that it is not moved or agitated by their own head movements.
And then place a piece of lint, soaked in egg white or gum arabic, over the patient's eye.
And then apply the cautery, whose form is as follows:
which should be concave, like the shape of a reed or a vulture's feather, at the end used for cauterization.
And if desired, it should be pointed to the other end. And if you want, it should be slender, like a probe.
However, the concave one is better for your work.
And then press on the fistula if it is open, and drain and dry it. And if it is not open, then open it and remove the pus from it.
And then place the cautery, which is well-heated, on it, and hold it with your hand a little away from the cautery's hot part, near the nose, so that your hand does not err or the patient is not disturbed. Then place the cautery on the edge of the wound and cauterize it.
And so, if at the beginning your cautery penetrates into the bone, it is good; and if not, then repeat the cautery one or two times, if necessary.  Leave it like that for three days, and then place a bandage with lint over it and surround it with a drying ointment until it is healed.
But if more than ten days have passed and it is not healed, then apply a sharp, corrosive medicine until the bone is exposed and is smoothed as is appropriate in its section/chapter.
And there is another way of cauterizing a fistula, which some earlier physicians described:  cut into the location of the fistula and then put into that fissure a thin piece of metal, whose form is as follows: and place into it a quantity of melted lead; hold it with your hand, firmly, so that the patient is not moved, lest the melted lead run into the wound; and you must place over the wound a bandage soaked in egg white or water, for lead adheres to the location of the fistula and heals it with remarkable healing.
And if the fistula is healed by what we have said about the cautery and treatment, it is good; and if not, then it is necessary to administer a nasal passage and return the fistula to the nasal cavity, in its proper place.
Chapter 18.
Of cauterization of the fissure of the pit/well.
Often fissures occur in the lips, and more commonly on the lips of children.
Therefore, if you treat those fissures with what we have said in the divisions, and your treatment is not effective, then heat the small knife cautery according to this form that is described:
And let its concavity be according to the sharpness of the knife.
Then carefully place that heated cautery on those fissures until the cautery reaches the bottom of the fissures.
And then treat that with a plaster until it is healed.
Chapter 19.
Of cauterization of fistulas in the mouth.
When in the root of the uvula or on the palate or in the roots of the teeth, an abscess develops, then forms a boil, then bursts, and then becomes chronic, and a fistula forms, and you treat it, but the treatment is ineffective, then you should cauterize the fistula with an appropriate amount of heat, and then place that heated cautery in the opening of the fistula, and hold it there until the heated iron reaches the bottom of the opening, and do this one or two times; and then treat it as we have previously described for healing until it is healed.
And therefore, if the pus is removed and healed, it is good; but if not, then it is necessary to expose the area and remove the corrupted bone, as will be described in its appropriate chapter.
Chapter 20.
Of cauterization of the teeth and softening of the gums.
When the gums are softened by moisture and the teeth are loose, and treatment with medicines does not improve them, then place the patient's head on your lap, and then heat the cautery, the shape of which will be shown here. Then, place the cannula over the tooth and quickly insert the heated cautery into it, and hold your hand there a little until the patient feels the heat of the fire reaching the root of the tooth.
And then remove your hand, and repeat the cauterization several times, as desired.
And then have the patient fill their mouth with salt water and hold it for an hour, and then spit it out, for the loose tooth is fixed, the softened gums are strengthened, and the corrupt moisture is dried out.
Chapter 21.
Of cauterization of toothache.
When toothache is due to coldness, or there is a cold or worm there, or you do not consider medication to be the cure, then cauterization in that area is done in two ways: either with a cow's brand cautery, or with a fire cautery.
Cauterization with a cow's brand is done by taking cow dung, boiling it in an iron pot, then taking cotton, wrapping it around the end of a probe, dipping it in the boiled dung, and quickly placing it on the aching tooth until it cools down.
And repeat this several times until the heat's effect reaches the root of the tooth.
And if you wish, soak wool or cotton in the aforementioned dung, and place it on the aching tooth, and place a heated iron upon it until the iron reaches the base of the tooth's cavity.
But however, cauterization with fire involves using a hollow tube of iron or bronze, ensuring there is some thickness within it so that the intensity of the heat does not reach the patient's mouth.
Then heat the cautery iron, place it on the tooth, and hold it until it cools; repeat this several times until the pain subsides either on that day or the next.
And it is necessary that, through the application of this cautery, the patient fill their mouth with good dung and hold it for an hour, then spit it out; and this is the method of cauterization.
And cauterize whatever extremity you deem possible.
And this is the method of using the cannula:
Chapter 22.
Concerning the cauterization of extrophy.
When extrophy is caused by phlegm and cold humors, and it is not yielding to digestion through medicine, and you desire to expedite the digestion, then you heat the cautery, the shape of which is as follows: having two open ends so that smoke escapes from one end, and place this heated cautery on the abscess once, and again if necessary, until it penetrates to the base of the abscess.
And if the abscess is small, then place the cautery according to the size of the abscess, and then leave it for three days, and place over it a cloth soaked in a mixture until what the fire has burned is healed.
And then treat it with ointment, dressings, and cloths until it is healed.
Chapter 23.
Concerning the cauterization of throat irritation and constriction of the esophagus.
When moisture gathers in the airways, especially if it's due to a cold constitution, then the patient should initially be treated with laxatives, and subsequently, cauterize the affected area near the base of the throat where the pressure is greatest.
And be careful not to extend the cautery too far down the throat, nor to burn the delicate lining too much, but only a little.
And cauterize that area with another cautery near the juncture of the neck at the back of his spine. And the cautery should be a sharp, pointed blade, in the manner described previously.
And then treat it with what has been prescribed until it is healed.
Chapter 24.
Of cauterization for lung ailments and coughs.
When coughs and lung ailments are caused by cold dampness and the patient has no fever or consumption, and the ailment is long-standing, then cauterize the patient with two cauteries on the furcula in the deepest, farthest, and hollowed-out spots; and with another cautery in the middle of the chest between the two breasts; and let the cautery be pointed, according to the previous method.
And if you wish, your cauterization can be done with a pointed cautery, the method of which is described in the section on treating earaches.
And make punctures near those places; and then treat the affected area with the same methods as before until it is healed.
And the cautery should have three prongs, for cauterization is performed with it in this way:  with one application you can make three cauteries according to this method:
Chapter 25.
Of the cauterization of the testicles, which is the head of the treatment.
When the head of the testicles is dislocated due to lubricating humidity and is not held firmly at the time of its return from the dislocation until it is fully back in place, and then, by a small movement, it is displaced again as it should be, as we have testified, then it is necessary to first reduce the dislocation, and then the patient should be turned on their back or side; and then lift the scrotum, which is in the part within the testicle to the parts above, using the fingers of your left hand, if the joint is dislocated inwards.
And then apply the cautery with two heads; and this is its method:
And then cauterize the scrotum until it penetrates from one side to the other; and the resulting cauterization will have the figure of four-headed cauteries.
And sometimes it is adjusted according to this count, and therefore there are eight cauteries.
And then place salt-infused poultices on the cauterized area, and then keep the patient still, and do not move the limb for some time until it is healed.
And if the dislocation is in the upper parts and this is done late, then cauterize the muscle with a pointed or many-pointed cautery, because the joint will be strengthened, the moisture will be removed, and the patient will be cured.
Chapter 26.
Of cauterization of the stomach.
When cold and excessive moisture enter the stomach, causing it to depart from its proper constitution and multiply within, and if you continue the treatment methods and do not succeed, then the patient should be placed on their back, extending their arms and legs.  Then, cauterize the area with three cauteries: one beneath the foot, about the size of a fingertip, with a pointed cautery; and two more beneath the sides of the first, creating a triangular cautery shape.  Lengthen the cauteries where they are not meeting to ensure penetration.
And if the depth of the cauterization is two-thirds the thickness of the skin.
And let the cauterization be in this shape, without additions.  And if you wish, cauterize with a large cautery in the middle of the stomach, in this shape; and this cauterization should be in the shape of a circle, in this manner:
And cauterize the stomach by pricking it at the area where the cautery has caused a reaction:  You should prick the stomach with a tool, in the area of the desired size, and then cauterize those pricks with a cautery. Then treat it with the previously described treatments until it heals.
Chapter 27.
Of cauterization of the cold liver.
When pain in the liver arises from coldness, moisture, or excessive wind, until its normal condition is restored through the expulsion of excess, and the patient is treated as we have described and without success, then the patient should be laid on their back, and three cauteries should be applied in this shape and size to the liver, below the ribs, in the region where a person's body lies when recumbent.
And the space between each cautery should be the width of a finger, and the cauteries should be the length of the right hand.
And do not press too hard with the cautery.
And if the amount of cauterization is half the size of a fingernail, and no more, and if the patient is standing on their feet, or if not standing, then lying down, with their legs spread and their arms raised.
And you are able to cauterize these areas with a knife cautery, if you have skill and prudence in the art.
And be careful not to over-cauterize, and cauterize only the area of a fingernail, so that the entire body is not cauterized and it reaches the intestines, since the area is delicate here; and know this.
Chapter 28.
Of the perforation of a liver abscess with cautery.
When an inflammation or abscess is suspected in the liver, and you want to know if the abscess is in the liver tissue or in its covering, then if it is in the liver tissue, the patient will experience severe and sharp pain.
And if it is in the liver's covering, the pain is sharp and severe, and sometimes the doctors have already exhausted the treatment for it.
Therefore, the patient must be turned onto their stomach; then locate the abscess with a probe; and then apply the cautery, which is shaped like a rod, the form of which is shown on the previous page. And cauterize with that cautery until all the pus is consumed, until it reaches the core, until it heals.
And then treat that, along with other abscesses, until they are healed.
And only use this type of cautery that is well-studied in the art of medicine, and in which many ailments have found remedy; however, sometimes this, through experience, may be risky for this operation.  But still, let that be left to others, and it is better.
Chapter 29.
Of the cauterization of pleurisy.
The ancients said that cauterization of the roots of the plant *aristologia* is effective against cold pleurisy in this way: take a long, dry root of *aristologia*, if one is found, and it should be the thickness of a finger.
Then, immerse it in oil and heat it in the fire.  Then, cauterize with a cautery in the area between the continuation of the collarbone and the neck; and with two small cauteries below, slightly inclined towards the area under the chin, and with two cauteries in the area sloping between the fifth rib and the sixth, slightly inclined towards the back; and with another cautery in the middle of the chest; and another on the stomach; and with three cauteries in the back areas; and with one cautery in the area between the two shoulder blades, and with two cauteries on both sides of the chest below the cautery between the shoulder blades.
And it is not necessary for you to hold your hand with the cautery; rather, let it be in the manifestation of the hand in action.
And some ancients said that some men use a cautery of iron resembling a ray, and ignite it.  Then they place it in the area between the ribs until, with it, they reach the abscess and cause it to discharge pus, just as we described for an abscess of the liver.
However, this cauterization is not without risk, for one might accidentally cause an incurable fistula at the site.
Chapter 30.
Of the cauterization of the spleen.
When you treat spleen disease with the methods we've discussed for division and don't see improvement, then cauterization there is done in three ways, all of them correct. One is to make three or four linear cauteries, following the length of the spleen, mirroring the shape of the liver cauteries described previously.
And the distance between each cautery should be the width of a finger or a little more, and the method of cauterization should be the same as that described for cauterizing the liver.
And do not press your hand down on the cautery; and let the patient lie on their back.
And another way of cauterizing is to ignite the cautery using two flames, as explained in the chapter on muscle dislocation, and raise the cautery to the spleen's location, directly above the left side of the patient.
And the elevation should be such that you raise the cautery along the length of the body, so that the cauteries are made across the width of the body.
Then, quickly insert the two flames, very hot, into that area so that with these, you penetrate the cautery on the other side.
Then, remove the cautery; and thus four cauteries have been made.
And if you wish, cauterize with a cautery having three flames.
And now you treat the cautery, since it has stopped emitting sparks after many days, for this is more important than the other preceding treatments in the cure.
Chapter 31.
Of cauterization of hydrops (a water-filled swelling/dropsy).
Cautery is not used on hydrops, but only on specific cases of ascites (accumulation of fluid in the abdomen).
When you treat dropsy with the methods of treatment we have mentioned in the division and your treatment does not improve the condition, then it is necessary that you cauterize with four cauteries around the navel, and with one cautery on the stomach, another on the liver, another on the spleen, and with two cauteries between the spinal vertebrae of the back, and one cautery on the right side of the chest, and another cautery on the stomach. And the depth of the cautery should be proportionate to the severity of the condition.
And leave the cautery open so that it [the cautery's effect] expels pus for a long time.
And do not evacuate the patient's illness near the cautery with whatever is necessary, because doing so adds two intentions to it, and this will hinder the healing process.
The shape of the cautery used to cauterize the abdomen should be wedge-shaped, following the shape of the previous one; and the shape of the cautery used to cauterize the back should be olive-shaped, following the shape of the previous one.
Chapter 32.
Of cauterization of the feet and thighs.
When the feet are inflamed with dropsy and filled with yellow water, it is necessary to cauterize the feet on the back of the foot, in the area between the auricular and annular (tendons/ligaments?), raising your hand with the cautery and not twisting it; and then lift your hand, but do not completely retract it, for the yellow water will retreat.
The cautery should be of this shape:  Then make two cauteries on the two thighs, and on each thigh, use a knife-shaped end of the cautery. And let the cauterization be along the length of the thigh: one below the knee and the other below the middle of the thigh; and on each thigh, two cauterizations.
And leave the wound open without treatment for a long time so that any remaining water drains from it.
And then treat it with the methods we have described.
Chapter 33.
Of cauterization of the abdominal region.
When the abdominal region is affected by cold and dampness, weakening the digestive and retentive powers—which reside in the stomach and intestines—it is treated by the usual methods of care.  However, if the patient tolerates it and the cauterization is to expose the affected area, then cauterize that region with a large cautery on their stomach, as was done previously for stomach cauterization, using the circular cautery and four smaller cauteries in a circle around the navel, with a small, pointed cautery, and/or a cautery on the flank or with two cauteries.
And if the excess moisture is apparent and the patient tolerates it, then cauterize the area over the groin and intestines, and place two cauteries close to the stomach and near the groin, for this is a complete cure of the ailment—from which there is no error.
Chapter 34.
Of cauterization of chronic hemorrhoids.
When the nature of chronic hemorrhoids involves thick, cold humors or corrupted moisture, and the treatments mentioned in the previous sections are insufficient, then cauterize with three cauteries on the pus beneath the small spine and a small triangular cautery, and with a cautery above the navel that reaches to two fingers' width.
And if you fear the patient's stomach is cold and their food is not being digested, and their face appears inflamed, then cauterize the area over their stomach with a large cautery, as previously described; and with one cautery over the liver, and another over the spleen using a wedge-shaped cautery. Leave the cautery open for some time, and then treat it until it heals.
Chapter 35.
Of cauterization for the removal of the boil.
When you remove a boil, then you ignite the cautery that is shaped like a ray. Then place that heated cautery on the excised boil, and continue holding it until the cautery reaches the opening of the vein from which the blood comes.
And do this once or twice, for if there are many boils, then cauterize each of them as we have recounted, and then treat them with the ointments you apply until they are healed.
And if you cauterize with a large cautery on a large boil, it is more likely to cause harm.
Chapter 36.
Of the cauterization of fistulas that are formed naturally in the body's parts.
When nature does not respond to the treatment we have described in its place, and the patient is distressed by this, it should be healed with cautery.
Therefore, when someone has a natural fistula in the back, and it is old, containing corrupted pus and moisture, and consequently this requires it to be treated, the best course of action is to probe it gently and then determine the depth of the fistula with the aforementioned probe.
Then heat the cautery iron, which should resemble a ray. And then place that heated cautery iron into this fistula, according to the depth the probe reached.
And repeat applying the cautery to that area until those corrupted tissues are burned once, twice, or three times, according to the necessary extent.
And be careful not to burn any nerves or veins; or if the fistula is near the bladder or bowel, then avoid these areas.  Do this only if the fistula is in a fleshy area and you judge that it is not penetrating deeply.
And then treat the area until it is healed.
And if the area is sealed shut, and the matter has been cut away from it, and it remains like that for a long time, then know that it is now completely healed.
And if the matter has not been removed from it, then know that it is penetrating, or is in the depth of the corrupted tissue, or that this condition will return due to those causes.
Chapter 37.
Of cauterization of the kidneys.
When the kidneys ache due to cold or excessive wind, and because of this the patient's waist is inflamed, then it is necessary to cauterize that area on the kidneys with a cautery iron, a specific cautery tool,  for each kidney, from which a recurrence is anticipated.
And a second one is lightly cauterized slightly lower, so that there will be three cauteries in a line, and thus, they will be more effective in their treatment.
Chapter 38.
Of cauterization of the bladder.
When weakness and softening of the bladder occur due to cold and moisture, so that the patient cannot retain urine, then cauterize the affected area below the bladder, where the pubic hairs begin, and cauterize with one cautery on the right side and another on the left side of the area.
And the length of each cautery should be according to the size of the affected area; and cauterize it with one cautery at the lowest point of the back, or with two cauteries if necessary.
And let the cautery be a wedge-shaped one, as is customary.
Chapter 39.
On the cauterization of the uterus.
When cold and dampness are present in the uterus, and therefore pregnancy is prohibited, and her menstrual flow is corrupted, and the onset of it is delayed, and pain occurs before their appearance, then the area should be cauterized with three cauteries around the navel, as we have described for cauterizing the bladder; and with one cautery on the lowest spot of the back, or with two cauteries, and let the cautery be wedge-shaped.
Chapter 40.
On the cauterization of a dislocated ankle.
When mucous moisture is discharged at the point of the ankle, and this causes the joint to leave its place, and a sign of this is that one part of the ankle is extended over the other when they are compared. And the location of the dislocation is found where it is swollen.
Then it is necessary to cauterize the patient on the ankle joint with a circular cautery, after you have marked the area with a probe around the dislocated part, so that the part falls back into the middle of the circle.
And let the cautery be of the form previously described for the cauterization of the stomach.
And if this cautery is not available to you, then cauterize it with three cauteries of a large, olive-shaped cautery.
And let the cauterization be performed according to the amount of inflammation throughout the entire area; then treat it until it is healed.
Chapter 41.
Of cauterization of the sciatic vein.
When pain occurs in the area of the back, and it is caused by cold and moisture, the patient is cured by what we have said and not otherwise, and this is old practice, then it is necessary that you rid the patient of heavy humors with fetid pills or artificial pills or similar; and then cauterize it.
And the method of cauterization in that case is in two ways: either cauterization with burning medicines, or cauterization with fire.
There are two known methods, one of which is to cauterize that area of the patient's back with three triangular cauteries according to this form; and make a good depth with those. And let the spaces between each cautery be the width of a finger, whether the cautery is small or large.
But sometimes, the cautery should be placed over the middle of the back, above the spine, for which there are four cauteries.
And if you wish, cauterize with the circle, the form of which is prescribed in the cauterization of a displaced back, making it a continuous circle and burning the entire affected area.
And this is the method of cauterization for sciatica when the pain is localized to the back and has not spread to the thigh.
But if it has spread to the thigh, then cauterize that area with two cauteries on the thigh, over the spot where the patient feels the pain; and with one cautery on the calf, about four finger-widths towards the outer side.
And if the cautery is a knife, the depth of the cauterization should be in proportion to the extent of the affected area.
And if the patient feels the pain extending to the area near the toes, then cauterize that spot with a cautery, using three or four points, or more if necessary.
And if the patient feels pain below the groin near the thigh, then cauterize that area with a knife cautery.
And be careful in every cauterization to avoid burning nerves or large arteries, lest you cause the patient further harm or contraction.
And I have seen others who cauterized the ankle, and in the cauterization, the leg became so inflamed that the swelling reached the foot, and the foot was perforated and corrupted. And then severe abdominal problems ensued, and consequently death.
And if the pain is in two areas simultaneously, cauterize each area according to this method.
And some learned people say that for ankle cauterization, the method is to make a cautery iron shaped like a circle, whose circumference is half a palm, and with a hole about the size of a date stone, or slightly smaller.
And within that circle, place another circle, and let the space between them be the size of a date pit; and let those circles be open in two parts; and let the length of those sections be one or two date pits, and make suitable iron bars fitting within the circles; and this is the form of it:
Then heat it in the fire until it glows red and throws off sparks, and then place it on the affected area of the ankle, with the patient lying on their side. And thus cauterize that area with three round cauteries at one time.
And then leave it for three days; then apply a poultice with a bandage, and leave the wound open for several days; and then treat it with ointments until it is healed.
Albucasis says:  Oh, children, we have used this type of cautery little due to the fear of its appearance, and because we have found few who look upon it favorably.
But for those who endure the pain, it is the best cauteries, and it brings about healing of that area.
However, a cautery using adhering medicaments is to make two circles using a perforated instrument, in which you leave a hollow space shaped like the opening of an iron gate; let the length of the sides be equal in height; let them be two nuts or wedges.
And if the space between each is the thickness of a finger; and let them be open below and above, and let them contain each other in this shape:
And then place the sick person on their right side, and place your hand on the affected area of the hip; and then take warm water and pour it between the two circles, and let its temperature rise slowly with a small fire, and hold it for about an hour, and let the patient endure the burning and scorching of it—for it produces a burning sensation like that of fire—until the burning subsides.
And then, raise your hand with the instrument and wipe away the hot water from the entire hip with fresh water.
And then leave it for three days and apply a bandage until the blackness of the burn has subsided, and leave it for several days, and the resulting soreness will diminish; this is the final part of the treatment.
And then treat it with ointments until it is healed.
And if the pain extends to the thigh or leg, apply a poultice there containing water, in the same manner as was done to the hip.
And this is the method of applying hot water, and I have already written about it in my treatise on the rectification of medicines. Take a portion of ashes and a portion of unburnt lime, both equal, and grind them.  Place them in a new, unglazed earthenware pot with a small hole in the bottom, sized to fit the patient's wound.
And place another unglazed earthenware pot underneath the bottom of the first pot. Pour fresh, clear water over the ashes and lime, using a finger to control the amount, and gently mix the mixture with your hand until it is well mixed. Let the dripping water, which will now be somewhat acidic, drain into the lower pot.
Then collect all of that liquid, and add more fresh lime and ashes, for this mixture will now be intensely acidic.  This is used in many medical procedures and cauterisations for other parts of the body, as it creates a burning effect.
Some of these medicines used for cauterization include resin, honey, and powdered lime with spices, all mixed together.
And Galen recounted a method from ancient times for treating pain in the chest and sciatica, praising its effectiveness.  He said that no further treatment was needed, and that it was a single cure as he described it, for a strong bath easily relieves such ailments.
And it is to be taken from fresh green nettles, or if no green nettles are found, fresh fig leaves should be used.  They should be thoroughly crushed with a little bit of bark, and placed over the painful area, either the chest, thigh, or leg, and bound in place.
And it should be left on for three hours, or until the patient feels the burning sensation subside.
And then put him in a bath, and when his body is flushed, put him on the ground, for the pain will cease and he will be cured.
And know that no one should use cautery with these remedies except after the body has been purged.
However, Eschirides says that when a vein, constricted by a goat's wound, is cauterized, it is very beneficial; and the cautery should be applied in this way: take wool, soak it in old oil, and place it between the foot's tendons and the bone.
Then take a dry piece of goat's hide and scorch it with fire until it is charred; and then place it on the wool and leave it until it has spread out. And repeat this, and do not stop doing this until the sensation of the bite reaches the chest and the pain subsides.
And this method of cauterization is called "cautery of the goats".
Chapter 42.
Of cauterization for pain in the two.
Sometimes pain in the back is due to various causes, such as injury or impact or excessive evacuation, and similar causes,  due to the infusion of cold and damp matter.
And cauterization is only effective in this particular type of pain, which is caused by the outflow of cold matter.
Therefore, it is necessary to evacuate the patient with pills and similar remedies, making them on the back where the pain is located in three lines according to its width.  Then place, in each line, 5 cauteries or more, depending on the patient's tolerance and their strength.
And let the cauterization be done with a pointed cautery.
And if you wish, cauterize with three or four cauteries using a medial, wedge-shaped cautery, following this method:
Chapter 43.
Of cauterization at the beginning of a swelling (or tumor).
Often this illness affects young children; and a sign of its beginning in children is that it causes difficulty in their movement and posture, and in raising and moving their limbs.
And you find that the vertebrae at the end of the spine, and the lower vertebrae, are already beginning to protrude over the other vertebrae.
And therefore, when you see this and want to prevent it, then cauterize it with a cautery iron that is circular in this shape: that takes the cautery iron over the entire area of the vertebra evenly.
And if you wish, cauterize along the circumference of the vertebra with the pointed cautery iron two or three times. And let the points be close together.
And then treat the area until it is healed with what we have said.
But be careful that the cautery is not applied to a swelling caused by nerve spasms.
Chapter 44.
On the cauterization of gout and joint pain.
When joint pain is caused by cold humors that spread throughout each part of the body, and when pain occurs in the feet, it is customary for physicians to call this gout properly.
And therefore, if gout caused by cold humors is treated with other healing methods, and the pain persists, then cauterization should be applied.
And you cauterize the area around the joint of the foot, approximately where the evacuation occurred, using several cauteries.
And the cautery should be an olive-shaped one, of which this is the form:
And if it is necessary to make punctures on the surface of the foot, then do it with a pointed cautery. And if the pain ascends to the knees or other joints, and this often happens, then cauterize each knee with three or four cauteries from all sides, using this olive-shaped cautery.
And if many cauteries are needed, then cauterize the area, but do not press your hand too hard with the cautery beforehand, only just around the skin's surface.
And if the pain ascends to the knee and thigh, then apply the cautery which we have described in its chapter.
If the pain is only in the hands, and it is called gout, then make punctures along the lines of the veins in the shape of a spiral, puncturing along those two lines.
And if pain remains in the fingers, then puncture along the lines of the veins on each finger and on the base of the hand.
And if the pain extends to the thighs or muscles over a few days, then cauterize each affected area from all sides.
And do not abandon the patient to a good regimen and the reception of medicines, for if a good regimen is followed and the inflammation is evacuated with this cautery, he will be healed, God willing.
Chapter 45.
Concerning the cauterization of ruptures.
When a rupture occurs in the groin, and the intestines are protruding outward near the opening (inguinal hernia), and this is a recent development, then you must order the patient to stop eating on that day and to use soothing remedies to help the rupture decrease from his/her abdomen.
And then, hold the patient between your hands on his/her back and order him/her to hold still until the hernia or intestines are fully extruded.
Then, gently return it [the hernia/intestines] with your fingers and firmly hold the rupture against the pelvic bone, with a hand positioning the extremity of it, making a semicircle shape similar to the upper parts of the body.
And then, apply the cautery, of which this is its shape:
until it is very red and emits sparks. And then, return the intestine or hernia to its cavity, and then place your hand over the area so that the intestine does not come out again.
You have already separated the patient's thighs and placed a cushion beneath them, and another attendant is holding the patient's legs, and another is holding their chest/shoulders, holding their hands.
And then, place the cautery over that mark using your hand, holding the cautery steady, and hold it until you get the bone of the shin (or patella) to the middle of the kneecap; and repeat with that cautery again if you have not reached the bone in the first attempt.
And carefully observe the intestine during your cauterization, so that you do not burn the intestine, lest the patient suffer death or another serious harm.
And know that if you do not reach the bone with the cautery, your procedure is not effective.
And the cautery for children should be subtle, according to their size and measure.
And then treat the cauterized area for three days with a poultice until the burn's scab is removed.
And then treat it with other remedies until it is healed.
And the patient should lie on their back for 40 days until the area and wound are sealed.
And you should regulate their diet according to the length of their treatment, which will line their stomach, and prevent the intestine from coming out due to the healing effort.
And then, when approximately 40 days have passed, apply a properly made bandage, and keep it on for another 40 days.
And avoid strenuous work, overeating, drinking, and shouting, for if they follow this regimen of complete healing, they will be cured.
And I will describe the treatment for ruptures in other parts of the abdomen, and if, at the beginning, you want to prevent them from rupturing, cauterize the rupture with a round cautery according to its size, and let it be as dry as the third part of it; then treat it as described, and it is not appropriate.
And some earlier practitioners would say that a rupture should be cauterized with a triangular cautery, according to this form, since it is marked with a probe.
And a line is placed along the widest part of the rupture, and another line above it; and place your hand with a wedge-shaped cautery, but the first, lighter cautery is better.
Chapter 46.
Of the cauterization of twisting (or torsion).
When pain arises in certain limbs due to injury or impact, and that pain persists for a long time and you do not find a cure with medicine, then it is necessary to cauterize with a pointed cautery.
And let the cautery be of every limb according to its size and smallness, its strength and weakness, and the location of the twist and pain.
Therefore, if it is healed by the first cautery, good; and if not, then repeat the cautery on it; for it is customary for such pains to be punctuated in the limb nearest to it, so that it is necessary to cauterize those until the patient is healed.
Chapter 47.
Of the cauterization of leprosy.
Some lepers receive great benefit from cautery, especially if the type of leprosy is caused by the putrefaction of phlegm and melancholy.
And therefore, when you wish to cauterize that, consider if the leprosy is recent and can be cured with what we have said in the division (and not otherwise), and fear that the corruption may affect the entire body and constitution of the patient; then cauterize the area on the head with five cauteries: one in the middle of the head, a second below that, near the forehead and at the end of the hair; and two on the temples/ears, and one at the back of the neck or nape.
And finally, press the cautery slightly into the bone to create a small impression, and thereby detach the scabs, so that the expulsion of thick vapors can be relieved; and cauterize the spleen as necessary.
And if the leprosy has already spread throughout the patient and is clearly visible, then you should cauterize with those cauteries we mentioned for the head; and with a cautery on the tip of the nose, and with two cauteries on each cheek, and with two cauteries on two vertebrae of the neck, and with six cauteries on the vertebrae of the back, and with one large one on the vertebrae near the hip, and one on the hip itself, and with two on each hip, and one on each hip joint, and with two on the knees, and with two on the muscles, and with two on the tendons of the feet; and cauterize on all the joints of the fingers and toes, and on each heel of the feet, and on the insides of the hands.
And be careful of the nerves that are near the heel so that you do not burn them.
And sometimes it is cauterized with one cautery on the hip bone, and another on the opening of the stomach, and another on the liver.
And know that the more cauteries you apply, the more helpful and beneficial it is; and know that the patient feels no pain from the cauterization, just as they do not from incisions, because the patient's body is already numbed.
And it is necessary that the cauteries be large or small according to the limbs and joints, according to what precedes the species of the instruments.
And then treat the cauterization with flour of barley cooked with honey and with the other treatment until it is healed.
Chapter 48.
Of cauterization for numbness.
When any limb is numb or asleep and is treated with medicines, oils, and plasters, and is not healed, then you cauterize that numb limb with cauteries according to the size of the limb.
And let your cautery penetrate the skin a little. And then treat it with ointment until it is healed.
And sometimes numbness affecting the hands and feet, and the spinal column, and the nerves which supply that limb, is cauterized, and the numbness is removed.
But do not presume upon this unless one is knowledgeable about the anatomy of the limbs and the course of the nerves throughout the entire body.
Chapter 49.
Concerning the cauterization of whitlows, which are morphea.
When a whitlow is chronic and you cannot help it with any of the remedies of medicine, then you cauterize the area with a cautery, a little at a time depending on the severity of the infection, until the whiteness and its color are gone, and its color is changed.
And then treat it with flour of barley and lentils, with warmed oil and arnica leaves, and with the blood of a dove or a swallow, a portion of each, all mixed together, then a cloth is moistened and placed on the area until healed.
Chapter 50.
Of the cauterization of cancer.
When cancer is beginning and you wish to remove it, then cauterize it with a circular cautery around it, as it is twisted.
And the learned say that it should be cauterized with the posterior cautery in the middle place; but to me, this is not seen, for I fear it might become ulcerated, and I have already seen this happen several times.
And it is more correct that it be cauterized around it with a circle, as we have said, or with many cauteries.
Chapter 51.
Of cauterization of tumors.
When a tumor is delayed in maturation, and this is due to excess [humors] creating it, or because the patient is old and decrepit, with little blood, or because of time, and you want to hasten the maturation of the tumor, then cauterize around it with many small, pointed cauteries; and then leave it, for it will hasten in maturation.
But if you want to pierce it with a cautery, then you heat the cautery, of which this is the shape: and place it in the middle of the tumor until it penetrates the skin.
And if the cautery is in a lower place, so that the arm's condition is alleviated; and then treat it until it is healed.
Chapter 52.
Of cauterization of the corroding [condition/wound].
A corrodent is a wandering corruption in the member, which corrodes it as if a fire consumed dry wood.
Therefore, if that corrodent is in a place that suffers cauterization with fire, then you should use cauteries with very small, or large, points according to what is appropriate for the location where the corrodent is.
And then cauterize it from all sides until you eradicate all the corrosion and no cause of it remains.
And then leave it for three days, and place dressings soaked in mixed oil on the cauterized areas until the scabs are completely eradicated and all the corruption is gone.
And then treat it with a flesh-generating ointment.
But if after three days the healed flesh appears healthy in the areas where there is no corruption, it is good; but if not, then repeat the cautery on the remaining corrupted areas.
And sometimes the corruption is treated with a sharp medicine, for that acts as a substitute for cautery. But however, cautery with fire is a more rapid cure.
And I have already described the treatment with sharp medicine in the division, therefore use it when you have need of it.
Chapter 53.
Of the cauterization of abscesses and similar conditions.
Often in the parts beneath the sick foot there is an ailment called an abscess, a large, festering one that pains the foot; and cauterization for these is done in two ways, namely cauterization with fire and cauterization with hot water.
But cauterization with fire is to heat a concave cautery resembling a small wing, made of iron according to the size of the abscess in every part, and made of thin, sharp points.
And then place this heated cautery on the abscess, and then turn your hand with the cautery in a circular motion around the abscess until the cautery reaches the depth of the abscess. And leave it for three days until it begins to drain pus. Then apply a poultice of crushed wild mallows with salt, and leave the poultice on it for one night, for that will eradicate it from its roots.
And then treat the area with a healing ointment until it is healed.
And if this doesn't work, and this often happens on the surface of the body, especially in the hands and feet, then you should apply cauterization with water.  Take a cannula made of bronze, iron, or a bird's feather, and place it on the abscess.  Pour a small amount of hot water into the cannula, and hold your hand steady.  Using the hand, rotate the cannula around the abscess's base, pressing the cannula's edge into the abscess root.  The hot water will reach the abscess root.  Allow the patient to endure the hot water's effects for an hour, then remove it, for the abscess and its roots will be eradicated.
And thus do with those and then with the others until you have dealt with all of them in the body.
And then treat those pus, since the roots of the abscesses have been eradicated with this, with ointments that promote the generation of healthy flesh.
Chapter 44.
Of cauterization for tremor.
When someone has tremor caused by cold in the nerves, or by a cold fever, or by another similar cause, then it is necessary that you cauterize that person with four cauteries, or five, on the vertebrae of the back, one between each vertebra; and with a cautery on their feet, and on their stomach, with an olive-oil cautery.
And the tremor will cease, and the health of the cold illness will be hastened.
Chapter 45.
Of cauterization for white spots (or blemishes) on the body.
When white spots, and pustules appear on the body, which are caused by corrupted, thick matter; then at the beginning, as soon as they appear, it is necessary to cauterize the head of each fistula with a fine cautery made of myrtle wood, whose tip is heated; or with long roots of erest (probably a plant), or with a lens-shaped cautery.
And sometimes a cautery is used at the beginning of its expulsion in this manner; and if it is not successful, the superfluous matter is broken up through these treatments, and the condition is cured.
However, it is necessary that this be done alongside bloodletting.
Chapter 56.
Of the cauterization of accidental blood flow by archery incision.
Many times there is an archery wound that is incised toward the affected area, which then emerges externally, or towards the incision of abscesses or cauteries of the limb, and similar situations, and it is difficult to stop that.
Therefore, if this happens to someone, then you should press with your hand at the opening of the arrow wound, and place your index finger over that, pressing it many times until the flow of blood under your finger is stopped, and it does not reappear.
And then place the olive cauteries, small and large, in the fire, many of them, and blow on them until they are quite ignited.
Then, take one of those cauteries, small or large, depending on the location and the wound where the artery is ruptured, and quickly place it over the affected vein after you have stopped the flow with your finger, and apply the cautery until the blood is cauterized and constricted.
And if blood is expelled from the artery's opening when you remove your finger and apply the cautery, then take another cautery quickly from the ones prepared in the fire, and do not stop doing this one after another until the blood is constricted.
And be careful not to burn the nerve that is here, and that some further harm comes upon the patient.
And know that when blood flows from the artery, it is not possible to constrict it, especially when the artery is large, without one of four methods: either with a cautery as we have said, or by extraction if it is not already extracted, because when it is extracted, the extremities of the patient are burned and the blood is constricted, or by tying it with a strong thread or bandage, or by applying medicines whose virtue is to constrict the blood, and they are pressed down with a cushion with a suitable constriction.
However, the one who uses a bandage and constriction with cloths or by applying burning substances and similar things, will not succeed as quickly.
But if this happens to someone and the doctor is not present nor medicine available, then apply pressure with the finger on the opening of the vein as we said, and strive for great constriction until the blood is stopped from its powerful outflow, and the finger on the artery is not removed. And over the artery, pour cool water of very great coldness until the blood is congealed and thickened.  And afterwards, consider whether cautery or medicine is needed.
Of incision and perforation and cupping and phlebotomy and wounds and their like.
We have already said in the first chapter all illnesses in which cautery with fire is appropriate and with burning medicine, and the occasions and causes of it, and the instruments necessary in them, with the forms of the cauteries; and I have ordered the chapters from the supremacy of the head down to the feet.
And I will proceed in this chapter in the same manner, so that the seeker of this may be relieved, then upon what he has inquired.
And before I begin this, children, it is necessary that you learn that in this chapter this is similar to the first chapter on cauterization.
And for this, great caution is required, for in the operation that is in this chapter, many times evacuation occurs that is with blood, with which life is near, through the incision of a vein or the incision above an abscess or the incision to allow the discharge of matter or the cleaning of a wound or the removal of an arrow or the incision of a stone, and similar cases. And with all of those things comes fear and trembling, and in their hands lies death.
And I warn you that this, in which there is hesitation, should not fall upon you, for sometimes you will encounter many sick people with many diseases. And of them, some will be angry with their illness, and death is near to them, and this is because of the intensity of their illness, and because of the length of their illness, and with illness comes fear which signifies death.
And of those, some who give you their wealth and say, "You will recover," and their illness is harmful.
Therefore, you should not consent to those who come to you with this condition;  let your caution be greater than your greed and your recklessness.  Do not presume any cause upon this unless a certain scientific knowledge confirms it for you, and for which a praiseworthy outcome is foreseen.
Use in the treatment of all your patients prognostication and indication of the path to health, for in that lies your aid in acquiring fame and memory, praise and glory.
O, children, may God inspire your understanding and not withhold direction and protection from you, for that is in His power.
And I have ordered this chapter, distinguishing it by chapters, following the previous chapter on cauteries, concerning the care from head to foot, so that what you seek and have need of regarding this may be made easier for you.
First chapter.
Of the treatment of water that is contained within the heads of children.
Know that this illness often affects children during or after childbirth, and when the nurse holds the child's head tightly without gentleness.
And sometimes it arises due to hidden causes that are unknown.
However, I have only seen this illness in children; and in all those I saw, death resulted, and therefore, I have left their work undone in them.
And I have seen a child whose head was filled with water, and the size of their head was continually increasing until they could no longer support themselves because of its enormity, and that the moisture continued to increase until death occurred.
And this moisture is either collected between the cartilage and the bone, or it gathers beneath the bone on the spine.
When the operation in this case is for moisture between the cartilage and bone, and the abscess is small, then you should make a cut in the middle of the head, a slit in the width, and the length of the slit should be about two inches, until the moisture flows out.  This is the method of the "sputum".
And therefore, if the moisture has increased more and the abscess is larger, then there are two slits made in this manner:
And if the moisture is beneath the bone, a sign of it is that you see the seams of the head open on all sides, and the water is squeezed out when you press on it with your hand in different parts, and this is not hidden from you. You should cut in the middle of the head with three slits in this manner:
Then, remove all the moisture from the incision.  Then, compress the slits with cloths and bandages.  Then, apply wine and oil to the wound until the fifth day.  Then, untie the bandage and treat the wound with dressings and ointments, and bandage the head evenly.  The patient should eat dry foods low in moisture until the limb is strengthened and healed.
And there is another method of incision, considering where the size of the abscess and the collection of water appear, for sometimes it is more in the occipital region, or in the front part, or on the right, or on the left; and therefore, make the incision where the abscess and the collection of water appear, and do so as best as possible for you.
And be careful not to cut the artery, lest blood flow out and the patient die from that blood loss with the expulsion of moisture.
Second Chapter.
When there is persistent catarrh or sores on the eyes or feet, and the usual medicines are not effective, then the final cure in this case is the incision of those two arteries.
And therefore, when you want to incise them [the arteries] if the patient raises their head, rub the area with a rough cloth to show the arteries, and then tie the patient's neck with a cloth; then consider where the vein pulses; and the locations of each one, those near the ears, must be pressed, and so they are hidden in some men.
And then mark the artery with a probe, and then incise each with the sharp instrument of its respective incision, penetrating into the bone, and that should be done according to the width of the head.
And if you wish, insert the instrument under the artery and sever it at the incisions on the parts above.
And the length of the incision should be about two fingers wide, because when any vein is cut the blood comes out with a pulsating flow, which jumps out frequently with a pulsating motion.
But if the artery is not visible, then you must measure the distance of three fingers from the ear, and then mark with a probe, and penetrate into the bone.
And the amount of blood that needs to be let out is about a wine unit, and it may be more or less, depending on the strength of the patient and the fullness of their artery.
And then consider the wound, and if any bone material remains from the fractured area, then remove this, so that it doesn't become a suppurating abscess.
And then bind the wound with strips of linen and cloth bandages, and then treat it with ointments until it heals.
Chapter 3.
Of the extraction of arteries located in the temples.
When an old migraine or severe headache occurs, caused by acrid humors and a quality in the temples' tissues, or if it is an old, severe, and similar pain, and the usual medical treatments are not effective, then we have found that in these conditions, the extraction of arteries in the temples, or cauterization of them as we have described, is a useful measure.
And the method of the operation and extraction of those (arteries) is that the patient shaves the hair in the temples; and the surgeon should locate the artery that is visible in the temple, since its pulse will show it, and it is hidden from view except for a few people because of the force of its throbbing.
And if it is hidden from view, then the patient's head should be held firm with a cloth; and then rub the area with a rough cloth or apply warm water until the artery becomes clearly visible. And then you take the instrument, of which this is the form: And then, using that instrument, you gently scrape the skin until you reach the artery; and then, carefully and precisely, you excise it from its surrounding tissues until you remove it completely from the skin and expose the underlying layers of tissue on all sides.
However, if the artery is delicate, then you wrap it with the tip of the instrument, and then slice a portion from it according to how far its ends are stretched and contracted, and there will be no blood flow, because if not sliced, the blood will not fully drain.
And then evacuate the blood by one to three ounces.
And if the artery is large, then you should tie it in two places with a strong double-stranded linen bandage or cord, and do not cut it to cause putrefaction before the wound heals and further blood flow occurs.
And then cut away the excess tissue that lies between the two ligaments; and do this at this time or another time.
And if you wish, cauterize it with a cautery until the bone is reached, with a knife-cautery until its ends are severed, and it will remain in place with the same effect.
And it is a better course of action if the patient does not have a fever or is not of a hot temperament; for cautery is of those things that help to finish off the humors, and therefore is better in a healing process.
And after the extraction of the arteries, the area should be filled with old cotton, and fine powders should be applied, and then treated with dry medicines that promote flesh growth and with cauteries until healed.
And if, while working, there is a renewed flow of blood from the artery, then you must try to stop that blood, either with cautery or by filling the area with cotton, and pressing firmly with your hand until the blood is stopped. And if none of those things are available to you, then place your finger on the area until the blood has clotted, and apply water of intense coldness to the area until the inflammation subsides, and it is bound up as needed.
And the easiest way to extract an artery is to cauterize the vein with this cautery, using two knives.  First, mark the two locations with a probe, and apply each, very hot, until they reach the bone and divide the vein in two places, so that the part between the ends is lengthened, as it is not completely consolidated by this cautery.
And this is the form of the cautery:
And the sharpness of the two knives is important. However, if the sharpness is less than that of two knives, it is better, for if it is sharp like two knives, it will approach the flesh with each stroke, and will not cut through the flesh quickly.
Therefore, since there is some thickness in those places, the heat of the fire is contained within them, and the flesh is cut cleanly.
And this method is better than any other method and quicker.
And let the space between the two knives be the width of a finger.
Fourth Chapter.
Concerning the treatment of acute and acrid inflammations of the eyes.
When the eyes are acrid, and the inflammation is in the veins that run above the forehead, and you find no medicinal cause for treatment, and the patient's face starts to redden, and they feel a crawling sensation on their forehead, like ants, and the eyes are inflamed, moist to the point that their eyelids are swollen, and the eyelids are irritated by the acridness of the tears, the old healers, in the treatment of these cases, used a particular method, and called this treatment "spassa".
And you command the patient to shave the hairs on their forehead, and then make three equally spaced incisions on the forehead, along the length of the forehead. And if the length of the incision is two fingers, one incision should be the same distance from the length of the nose, in the middle of the forehead; the second should be a short distance from the movement of the eyelids which are on the tear ducts; and the third should be on the other side.
And be careful not to cut the arteries that are on either side, and keep your hand away from the area between both jawbones. And if the space between each incision is the size of three fingers.
And if you have a piece of prepared sponge or very dry cloths with which you absorb the blood.
And now insert the spatula with two sharp ends, of which this is the shape of the incision: which is from the temple area to the second incision. Scrape away with that all the flesh that is between the two incisions, along with the tissue covering the bone, and then do this from the middle incision to the second incision. And then remove this spatula and insert into the first incision again another instrument called a scalpel, sharp on one side and blunt on the other.
And place the sharp edge of that against the flesh attached to the tissue, and the blunt edge against the bone, and push it in until it reaches the middle fissure, and sever with that all the vessels that descend from the head to the eyes.
But let the incision continue in that way through the tissue, and then do this in the middle fissure up to the other fissure.
And since a quantity of blood flows, squeeze the locations of the coagulated blood clots.
And then place in each fissure some old lint, and put on those powders mixed in wine, oil, and vinegar, and watch that it does not become a hot abscess.
And on the third day, loosen the ligament and administer a large infusion of hot or lukewarm water, and then treat it with basil ointment with rose oil and others until the wounds are healed.
Chapter 5.
Concerning the treatment of sores, especially those descending from parts inside the head.
When a person has sharp and persistent sores, and the patient's skin is weakened and thinned, and the look of them is impaired, and the eyelids are ulcerated, and the hair is falling out, and there is intense pain and subsequent exhaustion at the crown of the head, then know from these symptoms that the matter and sores do not come from anything other than from many veins originating from the parts inside.
And the best treatment in these cases is this: command the patient to shave their forehead, then make a small incision in the middle of the forehead, extending from the left temple to the right temple; and the incision should go down to the bone; and be careful not to lacerate the temples, which are near the jaw).  Until the bone is exposed.
Dry all the blood with a sponge or a dry cloth, and then fill the gap between the two edges of the incision with old cotton or linen cloths. And then apply a powder mixed with wine and oil over it, to prevent a hot abscess from forming.
And when you see that the abscess has diminished, then you must cleanse the bone until new flesh begins to grow.  Then treat it with a drying regimen that promotes flesh growth.  Do this by mixing two parts wheat flour and four parts colophony.  Form a poultice from this mixture and apply it to these wounds for flesh regeneration.
Chapter 6.
Of the treatment for what afflicts the ears.
Every affliction in the ears is one of four kinds: either a mineral or something similar to a mineral, such as iron or glass; or from a plant, like a thorn or bean; or from a flowing substance, such as water, sour wine, and their similar liquids; or from an animal.
And therefore, when a stone or similar object lodges in the ear, and if applying the ear to the sun causes the stone to shift, then drop some violet oil or sesame oil into the ear.  Then assist its removal.  Make the patient sneeze with [a specific] medicine, and keep the nostrils plugged until the sneezing occurs. Then place some pieces of cloth or wool around the ear, and gently pull the ear upwards, for often it is ejected outwards by these means.
And if it is not expelled, then administer its removal with the instrument called a *gesti epicicarios* (a subtle/small extraction tool), of which this is the form:
And if it is expelled by the instrument, it is good.  If not, then administer its removal with a thin, slightly curved instrument (a small hook/tweezers).
And therefore, if it is not expelled by that, then make a copper cannula and insert the end of the cannula into the ear canal, and seal around the cannula with softened wax and oil, so that only the cannula is open. Then pull it out with a strong pulling motion, for this often works as we've described.
But if it is not expelled in this way, then take a lighted lint or a previously prepared bundle, a small amount, and place that on the wound's edge, then carefully wrap it over the suitably placed lint. And then gently insert that into the ear canal, and then dry the ear of moisture.
And therefore, if it is not expelled by all the methods we have described, then you should consider cutting it out before it becomes a festering boil or spasm.
And the method of cutting it is that you first bleed the patient from the cephalic vein and extract blood according to its virtue, then make a cut between your hands and turn the ear outwards, making a small incision at the base of the ear towards its fat tissue in the well-pressed area. Let the incision be crescent-shaped until it reaches the stone, and once the stone is found, remove it if possible with appropriate instruments; then quickly close the incision, and treat it until it is healed.
And if the cause of the ear ailment is one of the growths that have swollen, then administer the treatment and extraction of it; but if it does not yield to your efforts, then take a fine, thin spatula, in this manner: and with this, administer the removal of that growth which has fallen into the ear.
And do not do this if you think that it is already softened by the ear's moisture, but rather, place it in small pieces, and remove them with tweezers or with gentle care, or with an incision, as we have described, since this method makes the removal easier.
But if water has entered the ear, the patient should first use sneezing motions, and fill their ear with old cloth, lying on the affected side. If this expels the water, it is good; if not, then take small, smooth stones the length of a finger, warm them slightly in fire, and the patient should place one in the ear canal.  They should then jump on one foot on that side, and strike the stone inside the ear with another stone. Thus continue this with the stone until all the water is expelled.
Thus continue this with the stone until all the water is expelled. And once the water is expelled, take some paper or linen, place one end in the ear, and hold the other end to a fire until the majority of it is burned.
And then put more linen in and do this repeatedly until all the water is expelled, and remove it with a cannula, as described above for removing the stone.
However, in removing an animal that has entered the ear, if it is small, treat it as described in the division; but if it is large and the cause is evident during the examination, then administer its removal with instruments and hooks, and its cause is easier than any other condition that affects the ear.
But in removing a worm that has grown in the ear, when you treat it as described in the division and in the treatise on distillations, and your treatment is not effective, then you should expose the ear to sunlight.
And therefore, if any worm is apparent, then remove it with a small instrument or hook; but if no worm is visible, then take a cannula that is narrow at the bottom and wider at the top, of which this is the shape: And insert the narrow end into the ear according to the amount the patient can tolerate; then, with strong suction, suck repeatedly until all the worms are expelled.
But if it doesn't respond to this treatment, then you should seal the area around the cannula with wax as described; then, administer distillations that the ancients have proven useful in treating worms, and you will find these in the treatise on distillations.
And let your application be with the use of medicinal oils in the ear using this instrument, of which this is the shape: Make it of silver or brass, narrow at the bottom, with a small hole and a flat top.
And therefore it should be like a piston, within the cavity of the cannula, wherever necessary. And if you wish, take a rod, and wrap its end properly with cotton.  Then pour oil into the concavity of the instrument, or the juice of any herb, or whatever medicine you want, into the cannula – which is in the ear – then insert the rod with cotton on top and gently squeeze with your hand until the oil is pushed into the cavity of the instrument, and the patient feels the oil inside.
And whatever is placed in the ear should be warmed slightly with fire. And be careful that the substance you distill into the ear is not too cold, for ear medicines cannot tolerate that.
Chapter 7.
Of the treatment of ear blockages.
Sometimes children inherit this from their mothers' wombs, and this happens to some men, a blockage in the ear canal caused by a pimple or a lump of flesh; and this blockage sometimes occurs in the area near the opening of the ear which prevents the passage of sound, and sometimes it is in external parts.
And that which occurs near the opening, preventing sound from passing, is in the most difficult situations to cure.
And in cases where sound *can* pass, you should place the patient's ear in the sun and observe it. And therefore, if a blockage is apparent, open it with a subtle instrument, of which this is the form:
If its extremity, where the width is small, has one sharp part and the other not; and the instrument has two thin ends, so as not to damage the ear.
And therefore, if the blockage is due to flesh growing in the ear or its canal, then remove it with thin forceps, and cut away that flesh with vigour until all of it is removed.
And if the blockage is in the doorway of the ear, then take a thin, sharp reed, and slightly warm it with fire, and then gently place it in the ear canal.
And therefore, if you have sensed a blockage that the patient finds difficult to hear because of the weight of it, relieve the pressure gently; and be careful not to injure the ear nerves.
Then place a cloth over the ear, sized according to the width of the opening you have wrapped with Egyptian ointment; and do this for several days, until you are certain of the wound's healing, or take some [substance] and grind it in water and sprinkle it dryly on the area and use it; and if the ear seems to be festering, then it is necessary to remove the substance and replace it with another substance wrapped in a bandage made from heated oil, until the abscess subsides; and then treat it until it is healed.
But if bleeding occurs, then soak a sponge or cloth in cool water and apply it to the ear, and use another treatment that restricts the flow of blood, which is described in the treatise on distillation.
Chapter 8.
Of the treatment of the swelling which occurs on the eyelids.
Swelling that occurs on the eyelids of the eyes sometimes is moist, sometimes dry.
Therefore, you should hold them with tweezers or forceps, and separate them from their roots with a scalpel, then apply a poultice to the areas.
But if pain with blood flow occurs, then you should cauterize them with a small, lens-shaped cautery.
And the best cauterization is close to the incisions, and often they return when some root cause remains; and when they are cauterized with fire, those roots are burned and do not return.
Chapter 9.
Treatment of swelling that comes to the eyelids.
Often, in the eyelids, a cause exists resembling a swelling in its strength and hardness, and therefore it is called swelling.
And it is an accumulation of thick moisture on the eyelid above and below.
Therefore, the procedure in these cases is to consider if the swelling is originating from what appears on the eyelid and is spreading in all directions; and the cause of it is slight.
Therefore, make a cut along the swelling's breadth, and then gently scrape it from all sides until it gives way, and then suspend it with a bandage and cut it off.
And if the figure [swelling] is large, then you should close it with sutures; and treat it until it is healed.
And if it is small, no harm will come to you, because the ointment will restore it and cause it to heal.
And if the swelling is extending towards the inside of the eyelid, from the surface inward, then open the eyelid, and suspend the swelling with a bandage, instead of making an incision, and press it from all sides. And if the eyelid is stretched by incision, this will not cause any harm.
And after the incision, wash the wound with salt water; and treat the area with something that promotes healing until it is healed.
Chapter 10.
Of the treatment of an abscess on the eyelid above the eye.
An abscess is a serious condition that develops within the tissues of the eyelid above the eye, and is particularly common in children, irritating their eyes and making it difficult for them to open their eyes in the morning; they cannot bear the sunlight, as tears are drawn to it.
And therefore you see them lying on their faces at all times, sleeping on their faces; and the eyelids below their eyebrows are wet, which have already been covered by inflammation, and the appearance of an abscess is imminent in the eye; and when you press the area with your fingers, you feel an abscess there.
And a certain method of operation is that the patient places their head on your lap, and you then place a cloth over them and heat it, and make a circle around the abscess on all sides, and then place that over it and press with your fingers all around so that the abscess is contained within the circle.  Then, in the center of that moist area, make a small incision with a lancet, and the incision should not be larger than the incision made in a bloodletting procedure.
However, in the beginning, you must cut through the skin completely until you reach the abscess, because in most cases the abscess progresses by a fissure, following the form of white pus.
Then remove that [pus] with cloths which you have wrapped between your fingers at the edges, and rotate between your right and left hand until it is gone.
And be careful not to press too hard on the incision, so that with the lancet you do not pierce the abscess and damage it.
But if an abscess does not appear at the beginning of the incision, but you press slightly on the incision gently until pus comes out; and then remove that as we have described; and then submerge cloths in water and wine and apply them to the area and press them with powders.
And some sprinkle salt and place it in the cavity of the incision so that any remaining moisture is absorbed.
And then treat it until it is healed.
But if a pus-filled boil occurs in the area, then treat it with soothing plasters until it is healed.
Chapter 11.
Concerning methods of treating the eye.
When, in the eyelids of the eyes, there appear swellings beneath the natural skin and become hardened, they press on the eye and cause various illnesses, such as constant tears, softening of the eyelids and surrounding tissue, until it becomes a cause of destruction of the eye, which is called "tactility" of the eye.  It is treated in four ways: either by cauterization with fire; or with a sharp medicine, as previously mentioned in the chapter on cauterization; or the "tactility" is addressed by incision and suture; or by means of applications as I will describe.
And therefore, you should place the patient's head on your lap; then gently hold the eyelid with your left hand, and if it is already turned out, fine. Otherwise, insert a needle into the part that is most swollen under the eyelid.  Push the needle through with the pus from above, making sure it's close to the edge of the eyelid where the hairs grow—right by the hairs—then draw out the pus upward with the eyelid, and reposition the eyelid with a spatula.
Then, using a spatula, make incisions in the part of the eyelid below the hardened skin, from the larger tear duct to the smaller one.  Then draw out the pus and place small powders of cotton or cloth under the eyelid. Then gently press the eyelid with a probe, shaping it like a myrtle leaf.
However, the shape must be adjusted to the amount of swelling of the eyelid, for this varies from person to person.  Some require incision of the eyelid in proportion to how much the eyelid is swollen.
Then, using the spatula, make incisions along the two lines you marked, starting from the larger tear duct and moving towards the smaller one. And if your incision is near the natural hairs, as wide as the king's finger.
Then, place the forceps in one of the two corners of the wound, and scrape the entire area.  Then, use stitches to draw the two lips together with a thin wool thread or a thread of pus, and clean the blood.  Make the excess pus stick to the two eyebrows using any readily available means, if you wish; otherwise, disregard this step.
Then, leave the thread sutures for three or four days, and then treat the wound.
And if you wish, leave the wound without stitches, and treat it with things that dry and constrict, because the eyelid is raised towards the sealing of the wound and its adhesion; however, stitching is better.  And thus, the ancients of this practice say so.
However, there should be care given to the patient, and this is a good procedure, and there is no fear in this.
And there is another method in this practice, which is to apply a shape to the eyelid, like a myrtle leaf, and then lift the eyelid with three forceps separated and brought together according to this form:
But if that isn't possible, to use the forceps, and it is not appropriate, then take a needle with thread and place it in the middle of the figure.  Then place the other thread close to the larger tear duct, and the second thread close to the smaller tear duct, and, holding the threads evenly, lift your hand, with a skillful lift, raising the entire eyelid over which the shape was marked, as we have described.
And then close the two edges of the wound with stitches, and treat it until it is healed.
But if an abscess occurs near your incision or fissure, treat that abscess with poultices and similar things, and with ointments.
And sometimes the hairs on the eyelid need to be removed, in which case you should use what we have said about incisions; however, stitching in this case is more skillful.
To treat with canes is according to this method: and it is that you turn the eyelid inside out and cut the figure within as I have described; and then skillfully make two thin canes or strips whose length matches the eyelid's length and whose width is less than the width of the gap. And you have already incised at the extremities of each part, where you have the threads.
Then carefully attach each [thread/cane] to the superfluous part of the eyelid, and firmly bind the canes in each section. Leave it for a few days, for the [extra/excessive tissue] will die off and become detached and soften until it falls away on its own.
But if it has taken too long, then break it off with forceps, and then treat the wound until it is healed.
Thus, when it is healed, the eyelid is raised and the skin is not punctured.
And this is the method of two canes which you will do according to this form: and have the quantity of the length and width neither more nor less.
Chapter 12.
Of the raising of punctured skin in the wound with a needle when the skin is hard.
When the hairs are unnatural, hard and rough, and pierce the wounds, then the operation on them is that you take a fine needle and place it in that fine silk thread, and gently adjust the ends of it and knot each one very subtly. And the length of the threads should be about the length of one palm.
And then you attach another fine thread beneath it briefly, and knot the ends of that if you wish.
And then place the patient's head on your lap, and let it be close to the sun so that your work is clear, for it is a subtle and delicate operation.
And then insert the needle into the root of the attached hair, which requires skill, and make it penetrate the eyelid swiftly until you extract it from above the natural hair.
And then pull the hair out from above and insert it into a small container, and let there be one, two, or three hairs, and no more.
And then pull your hand with it until the hair is expelled along with the ointment from the eyelid, from above the natural hair.
However, if the ointment is drawn out but the hair is not expelled, you will draw the ointment in the parts below with the lye which you have prepared with it, until the ointment is expelled from the hole above.
And you will see the hole, for then you will have expelled the ointment and the lye, and everyone will close and bandage the hole, and leave the bandage for two or three days, until the hair adheres to its place and a good flesh grows on it.
And if the hair is shorter, then you should take a long hair from the natural ones, and lift with that, or let it be until it's lengthened somewhat, and then lift that.
Chapter 13.
Of the treatment of a sore which comes on the eyelid above.
When a sore appears in the eye, and it is a contraction of the eyelid when it is constricted upwards, either on the right or left side, due to poor healing of a wound, incision, or cautery, and is called leporine; and this sore or ulcer is either natural or accidental, and is caused by poor healing of a wound, incision, or cautery, or similar poorly treated ailments.
The method of treatment in this case is to break apart that scar tissue and separate its edges, and place between them a piece of linen cloth, and bind them together until they are healed.
And you should not use treatments that dry or constrict it, for if you do so, the sore will return worse than it ever was before.
Use remedies that soften it, such as fenugreek, and apply a poultice made with water in which marshmallow and linseed are steeped, or diachylon ointment, which is liquefied with one of the oils, and soak the cloth in it, and treat with that.
And the key to your treatment is that you should break up any scar tissue that is not healed in the original form.
And this operation, which we have described, is simply a correction of a wound that does not return the area to its original shape.
Chapter 14.
Of the treatment of a wound that affects the lower eyelid.
This wound, which is made on the lower eyelid, is truly called a wound; and it is either of a natural or accidental origin.
But accidental wounds are caused by a blow, or a cut, or a cautery, or other similar causes.
And the method of operating on it is that you take a needle with a double thread, and insert it into the flesh, and make it pass from the left tear duct to the right tear duct, until the thread reaches both extremities of the flesh.
And then, pull the flesh apart slightly with the needle and sew it together with the needle, and cut it open with a wide spatula. And then, if the eyelid returns to its proper form, that is good; and if not, take the thread and place it in the cut, and with it bring the eyelid together, and close the two slits at the lower eyelid.
And let the extremities of the two slits be at two angles of the incision you have made until they meet, and let their meeting be an angle, so that when they come together they form a figure.
And this figure is the Greek letter: lambda.
And then, remove the flesh that is at the sharp edge below it, what is the eyelid.
And then bring together the separated parts and bind them with the wool thread; and then treat them with what we have said about softening medicines and poultices until they are healed.
And if it needs to be treated by slit, suture, or cautery, then it is necessary that you make a flat incision on the skin of the eyelid, as previously described. And then separate with a poultice between the two lips, as we have said.
In summary of the treatment of alxacrati, whether it is above or below, let the operation be carried out on him, according to the form of alxacrati, and that is in various forms.
And the skilled craftsman always prepares a device in every possible way until he restores the figure to its natural form, or as close as possible to it, and the sick person, according to what is appropriate to him, with the operation and the instruments in the best arrangements.
Chapter 15.
Of the adhesion of the eyelid to the conjunctiva or to the cornea.
When this adhesion occurs in many people, so that the eyelid is stuck to the white of the eye, and is prevented from its natural movement and functions, you must then insert the tip of a tool (ray) underneath the eyelid and lift it up or extend it with a hook.
And then you cut the adhesion with a thin blade, without the sharpness of incisions, keeping it blunt a little so that the patient is not disturbed by the operation, and leave the blade so that it does not injure the eye with its sharpness.
And your incision should easily remove that adhesion until the eyelid is returned to its natural form and all the adhesion is healed.
And then you put salt water into the eye with which you wash it; or distillate of lead dissolved in the water.
And then separate the eyelid from the eye with care, and place on the eye wool soaked in egg white, and then on the third day use healing agents until it is healed.
Chapter 16.
Of incision of the nail and the protrusion of flesh from the tear ducts.
Know that a nail is of two kinds: either it is nervous, and is similar to a hard, subtle splinter; or it is non-nervous, similar to frozen white moisture, which when touched by a file, or if forced to be taken with tweezers, is detached and the tweezers are not stuck in it.
And both types originate from the major tear duct, gradually growing to cover the eye and blocking the light and movement of the eye.
But the method for its incision is that the patient should place their head on your lap, and then open their eyes, and lift the eyelid with your hand, and then grasp the nail with tweezers of little curvature and pull it away from the surrounding parts. Then take a needle, and thread a horsehair, or oxhair, or cowhair, or something similar, or strong thread, or make the needle point smaller and smaller, and place that into the middle of the nail, and pierce through it with the needle, and tie the nail with thread; and pull it away from the surrounding parts, and scrape with the hair the nail's edge which obstructs the pupil. And thus you pull that with the hair until behind it.
And then you cut the remainder at the root of the tear duct with a sharp scalpel or small scissors, and leave the natural tear duct tissue so that from the incision there will not be a continuous flow of tears.
And sometimes the nail, with just the tweezers, or with thread, as we have said, is then scraped with a lion's tooth scalpel, of which this is its shape:
And be careful that with the scalpel you do not touch the cornea and cause a rupture, and that the pupil is pierced.
Then, put a little finely ground salt or a prepared powder into the wound, and leave it there until the next day; and then treat it with what is appropriate until it is healed.
And if the nail is not sensitive, and you cannot insert the needle, nor is it impacted by the tweezers, then many times this type of nail is cured with medicines, and is healed thus, as I have recounted in the section.
And if you want to incise it, then you open the wound of the patient and take a sharp, thin lion's tooth scalpel of this form: with precision. And if it is often inflamed and hardened, and there is a pustule in it, then drop some prepared powder, or rose water, or powdered salt into the wound, and cover the wound until the next day.
And then repeat the operation until everything that is there is removed, unless a hot abscess is present in the wound, because if so, leave it, and first treat the abscess until it is healed.
And then repeat your operation on it with care until it is healed.
If the lacrimal flesh, if you see it in the wound, is causing great harm, suspend it with a bandage; and cut it away from the wound in one part, and do not complete the incision so that you do not cause a flow of tears.
And then instill into the lacrimal wound rose water and prepared powder until it is healed.
Chapter 17.
Of the incision of a boil and of that which has arisen from adhering flesh in the wound.
Sometimes in the wounds of some, red flesh grows, and it is overlaid until it covers the pupil, or it approaches or presses on the eyelids and forcefully compresses the eyelids to the outside parts, and is assembled like a row of small pillars.
But the operation on him is that the patient rests his head on your lap; then, open the wounds of that area and collect all the flesh with instruments suitable for this, and hold it with forceps or a pair of tweezers; and then cut the flesh at the beginning until everything is finished with the scalpel, and watch that you don't damage the wound during your procedure.
And your incision be made with a knife which you use for cutting as we have described in the incision of the fingernail, or with small forceps with which the flesh is collected according to how the form of it is described in this chapter.
Therefore, when your incision is complete and all that flesh has been removed, then fill the wound with fine salt, or put in reddish powder similar to that of corrosive medicines, and place a cloth with egg white over the wound until it is protected from a suppurating boil.
And if any source of inflammation remains and a feverish discharge of blood arises, and you fear a suppurating boil, then leave the wound and treat that boil with whatever makes the boil yield, and then repeat the operation on that spot until it is healed, and similarly do on the adjoining flesh that occurs within this sort of wound.
However, you should avoid all treatment of the wound through a natural or accidental route, acting with iron, and do not place your hand on any of these operations until you see that the member is enduring the operation.
Chapter 18.
Of the collection of knowledge about the wound.
Knowledge of the red veins that are formed over the wound and prohibit its healing process, and the wound must be treated for a long period of time.
Therefore, it is necessary at the beginning that you consider whether the wound in which there is pus is strong and has only pus, then you collect that pus.
And you order the patient to place their head on your lap, and then suspend those veins with an ounce or two, according to your judgment; and let that ounce be of a thin doubling, in this manner:
or two ounces gradually in one piece according to this form:
And then collect those veins with gentle force, subtly, and wipe the blood away hour by hour, until you see those veins have receded from the wound and are rolled back.
And be careful not to injure the wound with the edges of the spatula; and if your operation is in the middle of the day before the sun, and be very firm in your operation so that you only cut those veins.
And when you have finished, then you distil into the wound either green or red juice so that with its sharpness it corrodes that which has receded from the wound.
But if that is not possible for you to collect it all at once, then you plaster everything with what relieves their pain, and leave it for a few days until the pain is lessened and a hot abscess is assured.
And then repeat this according to the same method until it is healed.
And this is the form of the forceps:
Chapter 19.
Of the reduction of a nasal injury.
When you treat a nasal injury with a cautery or a sharp, burning medicine, according to the narration preceding it, and it is not healed, then there is no use in it, but rather you should make incisions around the abscess, before it reaches maturity, and remove all the moisture and pus until the bone is exposed.
And thus, when the bone is exposed and there is corruption or blackness in it, then you scrape it with an instrument whose form is this:
And it is called a "sharp head," and it is made of iron, and the head is round like a knob, which is made pointed by the puncture of a file or by finely scratching (as in the following form).
And place that on the corrupted part of the bone, then rotate it between your fingers, and gently press with your hand little by little until you know that the corruption is scraped away.
And this is done several times, then restore the area with drying and astringent substances.
Therefore, if the area is consolidated, and good flesh has grown there, and the body is free of pus, and it remains for 40 days, and it is not renewed or festered, and no accident occurs there, then you know it is healed.
And if not, then it is not a natural healing, but you must reduce the fracture to the shape of the nose, and in this manner:  you must uncover the second bone with iron or with a sharp medicine, and when you have uncovered the bone, you then take a drill in this shape:
The end of the iron should be triangular, and the shaft should be thin and tapered down to the end like this.  (the phrase "like this" likely refers to a specific shape or demonstration)
Then place that on the bone, and let it be close to the lacrimal (tear duct) area.  Extend your hand a little from the eye, and then rotate your hand with the drill until it pierces the entire bone.  The patient will feel the air escaping because of this when you move your hand.
Therefore, then restore the area with astringent, drying medicines, as I have taught you.
Therefore, when the flesh has healed and the area is hardened, the matter that spread outwards to the sides returns to the nose.  This is thus easier on the patient.
Chapter 20.
Of the reduction of the eminence of the eye.
When the eye protrudes completely and you don't notice any harm or diminution in vision, then you should leave the patient alone, and then follow it, and then place leeches on the neck without making any incisions, and let them suck well; and then put on the eye a liniment made of acacia, aloe, incense, and sarcocolla, and then firmly bandage the poultice over the eye with many powders.
And the manner of the powders is that you take fine linen cloths, and each cloth is folded into four pleats; and make many of these.
And then place those cloths one over the other, according to the amount the eye needs. And then press over those with a hard cloth with strong pressure; and repeat the leeches with suction without incisions; and then remove the leeches and leave the eye bandaged day and night.
But if meanwhile the swelling is softened, then it should be very tight.
And then remove the bandage day and night, just as we have said.
And if the eye is already reduced, it is good; and if not, then repeat the plaster with powders, pressure, and leeches until it is healed.
Chapter 21.
Of the incision of the eminence of the uvea tunic.
When there is a rupture in the uvea tunic, and it is prominent, protruding outside the eyelids like a bunch of grapes, and the shape of a human eye is distorted because of this, and you want to incise it, then the operation there is as we have described, that you insert the needle into the roots of the uvea from the lower part to the upper part, and then insert another needle which has a double thread from the tear duct side, and make that penetrate and leave the first needle in its position; and then you incise the area of the double thread, and with it remove the portion of the uvea in the circumference of the needle, and hold it tightly.
And then remove the needle and place on the eye wool soaked in egg white and leave it until the thread with the grape (uvea) falls out.
And then treat the eye with this, which will soothe it until the wound is healed.
And sometimes, in cases where a large protruding area is present on all sides of the eye, and it has been perforated with a thin probe that reaches the front of the eye, and the albuginea (conjunctiva?) moisture flows, then the eye will descend and enter quickly into place.
And then hold it until it is healed.
Chapter 22.
Of the treatment of hawks.
This illness, called "alconati," is nothing but a fluid that collects in the eye, resembling descending water, but it is not that.
But the method of treatment is to have the patient sit on a prepared and straight seat, and then hold their head in your two hands and gently turn it until you see the fluid descend to the lower parts, then it should be dried and not descend further.  The light should be blocked, and the patient should see things in the same way as they did before.
And if it doesn't descend further, know that it is water.
But if the descent of the fluid is not prepared as we have said, then make the patient sit between your hands, and then take a thin, fine spittle and apply it to the membrane (covering) just next to where the conjunctiva meets the cornea (in the empty space), until the fluid is expelled.
Therefore, once it is expelled, then you instill warm water into the eye, in which you have mixed honey, or water in which you have boiled fenugreek and honey.
And then treat with the other remedies until it is healed.
Chapter 22.
Of the treatment of water descending from the eye.
We have already described the types of water in the division, and which ones require puncturing with a lancet, then according to the health.
Now you should place the sick person between your hands on a cushion, and tightly bind their eye socket.
And then place your left hand near the eyelid of their affected eye if the eye with the water is the left eye; or with your right hand if the eye is the right eye.
And then, with your right hand, take an almond if the eye is the left eye; or with your left hand if the eye is the right eye.
Then place the end of the almond near the edge of the brow, across the thickness of the eyelid, towards the smaller tear duct of the eye, and then gently press the almond and rotate your hand with it.
And then penetrate into the white of the eye and feel that the almond has reached the empty cavity.
And it should be that the distance traveled by the almond to the point is the same as the distance between the pupil and the edge of the dark area, which is the brow of the eye; for you will see with the pupil, through the clarity of the cornea, the vision of the eye.
And then place the almond into the location where the water is, and then you pull it down once or twice, and if the water descends immediately, then you see the patient's vision is improved immediately, and the almond is in its place in the eye.
And then rest for a little while; if the water has descended, then you should press it again before the almond is thrown out.
And then, when it is dried and does not descend, you extract the almond with ease, and rub it with your hand slowly, then dissolve a little white gem salt in water and wash the eye with it; and then apply a compress of cotton or cloth or wool infused in warmed oil and egg white to the eye, and bandage it securely.
But we and those of our time use a mixture of this and egg white over the affected area.
And if you cannot place the almond inside the eye due to its hardness—for some people's eyes are very hard—then you should take a substance called *alberid*, which is prepared in this way:
And then pierce the conjunctiva with it, but do not press your hand into the hole,  only to create a small path for the almond to enter.
And then insert the almond, as we have described.
And after your work is complete, the patient should be placed in a properly prepared sleeping area where they sleep on their back in a dark room, and any movement should be prohibited.
And place this upon the patient's nature so that their nature may be calmed, and do not allow their head to turn to either the right or left side at all.
And the bandage should remain in place according to its placement for up to three days.
And then remove it from that dark room and allow the patient to see something, and then reapply the bandage until the seventh day.
And you should not do this during the time of the treatments or immediately after the infusion. Having said that, you should avoid this because the water can easily become too strong and forceful from excessive attention.
However, if a hot abscess occurs, then it is necessary to remove the dressing before the seventh day, and treat it with something to draw down the abscess.
Then you remove the dressing from his/her face and place a bandage over it, so that the patient's eyes are covered by it for several days, while he/she remains in the dark room.
And gradually he/she should be brought out of that room and returned to his/her usual activities.
And know that in an emergency, the student is not excused from visiting [the patient] several times, and then you should be bold in your approach to the operation.
And we have heard from some of those who were at Artach, and some said that a fire was made in the Ayrac, a large hole that was dug and from which water was drawn.
However, I have not seen anyone in our land who has accomplished this, nor is it found in any of the books of the ancients; and it is possible that this is something new.
And these are the forms of the types of magdaam so that whoever is ignorant of them may understand them:
And they should be made of earth or iron, properly, and have their extremities with this triangular subtlety, the sharp end like that which is the form.
Chapter 24.
Of the treatment of flesh growing in the nose.
When various types of flesh grow in the nose, some of which are caused by a condition similar to a scorpion's tail, or a sea polyp; and this ailment is called polyps because it resembles that sea creature. And of it is cancerous flesh, ulcerated, of dark color; and of it is flesh that is lion-like, not of a dark color.
Therefore, for those fleshy growths that are neither fraudulent nor cancerous, you should have the patient sit between your hands, exposed to the sun, and wipe their nostrils, and pierce those fleshy growths with your lancet. And then remove that to the outside, and then cut away what you have grasped of those with a sharp, thin spatula from one side until you know all the flesh has been removed; if any part remains which can be cut off, then cut it away with one of the fine instruments with ease until nothing remains. But if it is accompanied by blood or a hot abscess, then you apply what is necessary; or if it is a malignant abscess, then you cauterize it until the blood is drained and all cavities are removed.
And then place a mixture of vinegar and water or wine in the nose near the incision. But if the nose is open and moisture flows from it to the palate, then you know it is healed.
But if the moisture does not penetrate as it should, then you know that within it is still unremoved flesh, or pus, over the bones of the nose, to which the incision has not reached.
Therefore, it is necessary to insert a piece of lint, which has some thickness, and place several pieces, with the space between each piece being the size of a finger or less.  Then, have the patient move and insert one end of the lint into the nose using a rod or any other suitable instrument.
And after this has been done, have the patient inhale it [the lint] until it reaches the nasal passages, and it is expelled into their throat.  For many times children, during lessons, do a similar action, and it is a simple task for one who wishes to do it.
Then place the two ends of the lint, one end protruding from the nose and the other remaining inside, and apply a flesh-cutting instrument using the lint pieces. Do this until you are certain that the flesh is now contained within the lint.
Then remove the lint, and place a poultice near the nose, close to where the blood was drawn, and do this for three days or more, until the ointment has consumed all remaining flesh.
And finally, place a lead cannula in the nose for several days until healed.
But if you need a more thorough cure, use this method.
And this is the form of the nasal cupping instrument with which oils and medicines are instilled into the nose:
Make this of silver or brass, resembling a small, open lamp or a small shell, and similarly shaped at the opening.
And if you wish, make a closed cannula like a tube, and the cannula of the nasal cupping instrument should be flat, open; with a handle at the back of it, with which you will hold it when heating oils or whatever liquids and substances you want within it.
Chapter 25.
Of the ulcers that appear at the extremities of the nose.
Often, an ulcer forms at the extremities of the nose, and it grows larger and worsens over several days until the sight of it is quite distressing.
And therefore, you should cut it open at the beginning of its appearance, and remove everything. And then apply a cautery or a burning medicine to the area.
However, if its incision is delayed until it has grown large, then consider if it is hardened, hard, dark-colored, and insensitive to the touch.  If so, do not touch it with iron, for it is a deep-seated abscess; because often the one who cuts this abscess risks great harm to the person it affects.
If the abscess is soft to the touch, not dark-colored, and incision is possible throughout, then evacuate the patient and cut it open without fear.  Treat the area with things that dry and constrict it until healed.
Chapter 26.
Of the suturing of the nose, lips, and ear, when the continuity is dissolved by plague or similar causes.
Know that when you encounter a break in continuity in one of these cartilages, little success will come of this operation except in some men (or, perhaps more literally, a few skilled individuals).
Therefore, when a cause of those conditions arises, consider whether it is fresh plague with its blood.  If so, you should bring together the two sides of the wound with stitches, and then treat it until it is healed.
And if the edges of the break in continuity are already separated, and each is made healthy, then you must scrape each part of its apparent scab until blood comes. Then bring together the two edges with stitches and tighten them.  Over these, sprinkle powdered dragon's blood and crushed [unknown herb or ingredient].  Place a piece of a diafinicon plaster, or some other consolidating plaster, over the powder, and leave it bound for two or three days.  Then loosen it, change the plaster, and leave it until the pus is discharged.  Then treat with ointment until healed.
But the method of stitching is that you join the break in continuity either with needles as we have described for suturing the belly, or join the break in continuity with a bandage as has been shown to you.
Chapter 27.
Of the extraction of those things that arise between the two edges in the interior parts.
Often in the inner parts of men's lips, some hard abscesses resembling pea-sized lumps appear, and some of these are smaller, some larger.
Therefore, you should turn back the lips and, cutting away each of those hardnesses on every side, then fill the place with crushed sage until the blood is stopped.  Afterwards, wash the area with sour wine and treat it with something that stops the flow until it heals.
Chapter 28.
Of the incision of flesh adhering to the gums.
Often, flesh adhering to the gum, which the ancients called "albulus," appears.  Then, you should lift it with forceps or scissors and cut it off at its base, allowing the pus or blood to drain.
And then apply crushed sage or other styptic or drying powders to the area.
And if that flesh returns, then cut it again, and cauterize it, for the cautery will prevent it from returning.
Chapter 29.
Of toothache with iron.
When on the surface of the teeth, on the inner and outer parts, and between the gums, rough, hard, and sometimes blackened, yellowish or greenish scabs form, so that the gum becomes corrupted by this, and the teeth become hard.
And therefore, you should place the patient between your hands, resting their head on your lap, and scrape the teeth where these scabs and similar things appear like sand until no trace remains, and do this to remove the blackness, yellowing, and other things until they are cleaned.
Therefore, if what was initially addressed by the treatment is removed, it is good; and if not, then you repeat the treatment on those parts again the next day, and the second and third, until it reaches the desired state.
And know that teeth require many types of scraping tools of various shapes, according to what is needed for your procedure. And for this reason, the scraper with which the inner part of the tooth is scraped is different from the scraper used for scraping between the teeth, according to other forms, and these scraper forms should be prepared by you, which you will see shortly.
Chapter 30.
Of the removal of teeth.
You must treat the tooth's pain with every means and be cautious in its removal, for there is no remedy that compensates for the loss of the tooth when it is extracted, for it is a sublime substance, until it is removed during extraction.
However, when the patient insists on removing that tooth, you must be firmly certain which tooth is the diseased one, for many times the pain deceives the patient, appearing to be in a healthy tooth, and you extract that one.  Then, the pain does not cease until the diseased and painful tooth is extracted, for we have seen this by the operations of barbers.
Therefore, how must you be certain which is the painful tooth, and that you know it well?  Then, you must scarify around the tooth with a substance in which there is some virtue, until it is dissolved from the tooth and the gum on all sides.  Then, carefully remove it with your fingers, or with fine forceps, little by little, until you extract it.
And then, if the tooth is firmly held, use large forceps, with firm grip or leverage, and place the patient's head between your arms, so you firmly hold it so it doesn't move.  Then, extract the tooth in a straight manner, so you don't break it, or cause the patient further pain.
And if it is not easily extracted, then take one of those instruments and place it underneath it from every side with ease, and apply force to remove it, just as was done at the beginning.
But if the tooth is cracked or decayed, then you must fill that cavity with cloth and tighten it with a thin, sharp tool, so that it is not broken during the time you are using forceps to remove it.
And you must carefully cut around the entire gum with incisions, and be very careful with your strength so you don't break it and leave part of it, and return to the patient with more harm than the first pain.
And be careful not to do what some ignorant barbers do in their haste and boldness when extracting teeth, without administering what we have described; for often they bring great illnesses upon men that are more difficult to cure, and the roots of the teeth remain, some or all of them, or they pull out the teeth along with some of the jawbone, as we have often testified.
And after the extraction, the mouth should be rinsed with warm wine or vinegar with salt.
And if blood flows from this, as often happens, then apply a small amount of alum and sprinkle it on the wound, and if that doesn't stop it, cauterize it.
The shape of the forceps and fine pliers with which the tooth is initially removed should be long at the end, short and thick in the handle, so that they do not bend when using them.
And they should be like the handles of large tongs, so that when you grip them, they do not bend, and have short tips.
And they should be made of well-forged Indian iron with straight tips, and on the tips of these there should be teeth that interlock and grip tightly with a strong constriction.  Sometimes the tips of these are shaped like the beak of a stork (or heron), that is, a kind of hooked shape, and they are very strong in their constriction.
Chapter 31.
Of the removal of teeth and the extraction of bones from fractured jaws.
When you need to remove a tooth that has a remaining piece, you should first apply a compress with wool for a day or two until the area is softened.  Then, insert forceps, the ends of which resemble the beak of a bird called a stork or heron (like forceps):
The ends of them (the forceps) are made pointed, like a file or rasp.
And if you cannot remove it with these forceps or pliers, you must then dig around the root and expose all the flesh, and insert the instrument called *atalí* (a small lever with this shape):
And it should have a short, thick end, a little bit, and not be too blunt so that it does not break.
So if by this the root is completely exposed, good; and if not, use these other instruments, of which these are the shapes: the shape of the first instrument is a triangular end, with some thickness:
The shape of the second instrument is that it should be triangular, but with a more slender end.
And having used this instrument, you are now assisted by another instrument with two ramps, of which this is the shape, roughly speaking: and with other instruments, which will be described later, when dealing with tooth removal; for this instrument, resembling a large pliers, is useful, and this is its shape:
of a triangular, bent, or short end, which has some thickness, and is not rounded, so that it is not broken.
And further know that the instruments for teeth are very similar to the other instruments.
However, the skilled and astute craftsman in the art finds for himself, according to what the operation and the various illnesses signify to him; for there are illnesses for which the ancients did not devise or prescribe a specific instrument, due to the varied forms of the ailments.
But if the bone of the jaw or other bones of the mouth are fractured or decayed, then the fractured part should be set back into place with what is appropriate for it from the instruments and forceps mentioned in the extraction of tooth roots, and use a technique whose form is as follows:
And let there be some small, gradual pressure, and let it be held or tightened with the mouth to prevent it from shifting or escaping until the bone is firmly set; and then restore the area with appropriate medicines.
However, if there is a small swelling on the bone, then remove that swelling and its blackness, and treat it until it is healed.
Chapter 32.
Of the treatment of teeth that protrude above the others.
When teeth protrude beyond their natural alignment, the shape is unattractive, especially in women, and particularly in young ladies; therefore, you must consider: if a tooth is directly adjacent to another and no removal or ligature is possible, then extract that one; but if it is not attached to another tooth, then you cut it with this instrument, whose shape is like a pig's snout, made of Indian iron with a very sharp tip.
And make your incision slowly, over several days, due to the tooth's hardness, and so that it doesn't damage other teeth.
And if the protruding tooth is exposed for filing, then file it with an Indian iron file, which has this shape:
And it should be made entirely of Indian iron, and easily shaped; and it should have very small points, like the file used to make needles, with which the tooth is filed little by little over many days with ease, so that no other tooth is damaged or broken. And then, finally, bind it and extract the root with some razors.
And if a tooth is fractured and the tongue is irritated, then you must file it until the roughness of the fracture is removed and smoothed, and filled, so that the tongue is not injured and speech is not impaired.
Chapter 33.
Of the restoration of broken teeth with gold or silver filings.
When, due to blows or impacts causing the teeth to fracture and be displaced, the patient cannot bite down on anything, and you have treated it with astringent remedies, and your treatment has not worked, then, because they don't fall out, they should be reinforced with gold filings, and not silver filings; for silver turns green and may decompose in a few days, but gold never changes.
And the filings should be of such fineness and thickness, according to the amount that can fit between the teeth; and the method of application is to take the filings and place twice that amount between two sound teeth, and then fill in with two curving lengths of filings between the broken teeth, or if there is one or more, until the material reaches the sound tooth on the other side. And then repeat the filling until you reach the starting point, and tighten your grip with ease and care until it is not broken.
And your grip, with which you press the filings against the roots of the teeth, should be firm but not excessive.
And then, with forceps or scissors, you cut off any excess filings, and gently place them in each spot, and shape them and conceal them between the sound tooth and the broken tooth, so that they do not injure the tongue. And then leave it like that, tightly secured.
However, if it is loose or broken, tighten it or them with more filings in such a way at all times.
And this is the method for teeth, and the illustration of the restoration of two healthy teeth and two broken teeth, just as you see these joined together:
And when one or two teeth are returned to their proper sockets, and they are restored as we have described, and remain fixed.
And only skilled and wise craftsmen can do this.
And sometimes a piece of cow bone is prepared in the form of a tooth and placed in the missing tooth's socket, and is tightened as we have said, and remains and serves for a long time.
Chapter 34.
Of the constriction of the ligament which is in the tongue and prevents speech.
This ligament, which sometimes lies beneath the tongue, is either natural, present at birth, or accidental and caused by a wound that has healed.
And the operation on it is to open the patient's mouth, their head held in your grasp; then elevate their tongue and carefully cut that nervous ligament along its length until the tongue is freed from its restriction.
But if there is any hardness or knotting in it, due to the healing of a wound, then apply a forceps and cut through it along its length until you have severed the ligament and the knot is dissolved.
And be careful not to create a tear in the flesh and cause a severe cut and a flow of blood.
And then wash the surgical area with warm water or vinegar or cold water; then place a linen pad under the tongue, which is a type of bandage that the patient will keep under their tongue each night to prevent re-adhesion.
But if you encounter a flow of blood, apply powdered vitriol to the area; however, if the bleeding persists, then cauterize the area with a blunt cautery appropriate for that purpose. And then treat it with the other remedies until it is healed.
Chapter 35.
Of the removal of a ranula (a cyst) under the tongue.
Sometimes, a boil resembling a small tumor forms under the tongue, hindering the tongue's natural function; and it grows quickly, filling the mouth.
And the treatment for this is to open the patient's mouth, seated in front of the sun, and examine the abscess.
And if you see it of a dark color, or black, hard, and the patient feels no sensation in it, then do not touch that area, for it is a cancer.
And if it has turned whitish, in which there is moisture, then you apply an ointment there, and cut it with a very thin scalpel, and dissect it from all sides; and if blood comes during your operation, then you place crushed alum, that is, vitriol, on top to stop the bleeding.
And then return to your work until you have completely removed it, until it has been washed with vinegar and salt; and treat it with further remedies until it is healed.
Chapter 36.
Of the extraction of abscesses from the two ears, and from that which is in the throat, and of other abscesses.
When a swelling occurs in the throat, these are glands that are clustered together, that become inflamed and protrude, and are called the tonsils.  When you treat them with what we have mentioned in the division, and they are not healed, then consider if the abscess is hard, dark-colored, and insensitive.  In that case, do not touch it with an iron.
And if it is reddish in color and the root is thick, then do not touch it with an iron for the flow of blood; rather, let it mature, and then either you will drain it, or it will break open on its own.
And if it is white, smooth, and its root is thin, then it is appropriate to make an incision.
And the procedure for it is that you should consider, before your operation, if the abscess has already subsided from heat with complete rest, or if it has lessened with some diminution; and then have the patient sit in the sun, and let their head be in your lap, and open their mouth. The attendant should take between their hands, and press down the patient's tongue with a very noble instrument, the form of which is this:
And it should be made of silver or bronze, and be thin like a knife.
So, when you press with that instrument and the abscess is revealed to you, and you see it through the opening, then take a lancet and insert it into the abscess, and draw it out to the sides as far as you can. After this, if you draw out any of the tissues, then cut that with an instrument whose form is this:
After this, if you draw out any of the tissues, then cut that with an instrument whose form is this: and it is similar to forceps, but the ends of it are curved, so that the opening of each is in the direction of the other, very sharp, which should be made of tempered iron.
But if this instrument is not available to you, then cut it with a scalpel of which this is the shape: And it should be sharp on one side, blunt on the other side.
And after you have incised one opening, cut the other in the same manner of incision, and after the incision the patient will be healed from the cold.
However, if there is bleeding, stop it with a decoction of pomegranate bark or myrtle leaves, and similar astringents until the bleeding is controlled, and then treat it until it is healed.
And sometimes other abscesses appear in the throat or near those two ears, and cut them according to what I have said about the incision of two openings likewise.
And I once treated a woman with an abscess that had developed in her throat. This abscess was a dark colour, with little sensation, and it had already closed off her throat, making her breathing very difficult.  Food and water had been forbidden, and she was close to death if it had persisted for another day or two.
And the abscess had grown so much that it had created two channels before it emerged through two openings.
So I incised it fistulously and placed a lancet in one of them, and pulled out a large portion.  Then I incised the area where I understood the other opening to be, and then I opened her mouth, and held her tongue, and then I inserted the lancet into that abscess.
And then I cut away a large portion of it, and only a little blood flowed from it. Therefore, the woman's throat was clear, and she began to drink water, and then she ate food.  Then I continued to cut into the abscess many times over a long period, and another abscess developed in the place of the first, which I had to cut into until it was resolved.
Therefore, I cauterized the woman's throat, then applied a dressing; and then I walked away, and did not know what God had done with her in my absence.
Chapter 37.
Of the incision of a boil when it is abscessed.
When a sore develops on the uvula, and it is abscessed and long, then it is called a perpendicular sore; and if it is in the lower part, thick and round, then it is called a boil.
But when it is treated with what we have said in the division, and you do not confirm your cure, and sometimes the abscess has already been removed and is small, then you should incise the one that is thick and round; and if it is long, and bloody, of dark or black color, and is not tender to the touch, then you must test the incision, for in that case there is fear for the patient.
And when you see it according to the way I have described, by its whiteness and length, you should make the patient sit up and press the patient's tongue with an instrument that facilitates its form and then take the probe to the wound and draw it downward, and incise it with one of two instruments that are described in the incision of abscesses.
And you should only incise what is adhering to the natural boundary without excess, for if you incise more, you will impair their speech.
And after the incision, use what we have described in the incision of abscesses, and treat it until it is healed.
But if the patient is frightened by the incision, you should use cauterization without fear, and the method of cauterization is only with sharp water.  You should place the patient's head in your lap, then press their tongue with the instrument we mentioned, and take the water we described in the chapter on cauterization, and use it to cauterize the living tissue. The cautery should not be thick nor thin; and fill the concavity of the instrument, the shape of which is described as follows:
Let the tip of the concavity where the medicine is placed be similar to the concavity of a spoon.  Place the instrument with the medicine onto the wound.  The patient should lie on their side so that any saliva or phlegm from the mouth is drawn away from the medicine, so that no substance from the medicine drips down the patient's throat and damages it.
Then, hold the medicine with your hand, and apply pressure to the uvula for half an hour until you see it blackened and softened by the medicine's action.
And if you wish, take a piece of cloth, wrap it around the tip of the instrument, soak the cloth in the medicine, and insert the instrument wrapped in the cloth into a tube until the cloth adheres to the tube.  Do this many times until you achieve the desired cauterization of the uvula.  Then leave it until it dries and falls off in about three to four days.
If you need to repeat the medicine, repeat it.  Then, after the cauterization, clean the area around the uvula with a cloth dipped in wine.  Clean the area around the medicine.  Wash with cold water, and treat externally with an ointment, and internally with remedies until healed.
And this type of treatment is safer than incisions and less likely to cause fear.
Sometimes the uvula is treated with something more subtle than cauterization or incisions, as it is cured by fumigation in this way: take mint, yarrow, oregano, rue, Arabic gum, chamomile, and similar herbs, and mix all or some of these ingredients in a pot.  Soak them in sour wine and boil. The pot must be securely sealed, and a hole placed in the middle, over which a hollow copper instrument is placed, either silver or copper.
And insert the tip into the patient's mouth until the vapor rises to the uvula through the tube, until the uvula is significantly darkened.
And repeat this many times until it is dry.  Beware that you do not perform this treatment at the beginning of an abscess, for it would worsen the abscess, and you should not do this without the confirmation of an experienced person regarding the abscess's heat.
However, if this instrument is not available, then take a reed and place a chicken egg shell at its end, so that the patient's mouth is protected, as the egg shell prevents the vapor from burning the mouth.
And this treatment is good for health.
Chapter 38.
Of the removal of thorns and what adheres to the throat, and other similar things.
Many times thorns or fish bones or some other thing adhere to the throat.
Then you must remove what is clearly visible, focusing on it,  while pressing the tongue with an instrument in front of the light, so that what is in the throat is revealed to you.
And what is hidden and unknown in the throat, you must make the patient vomit before the food has been digested in the stomach, for a foreign object adhering to the throat is easily expelled by vomiting; or have the patient swallow a piece of bread or lettuce root or a piece of dry bread; or have the patient take a piece of dry sea sponge, bind it tightly with a bandage, and then the patient will swallow it, for as it reaches the place where the thorns are, it will be expelled. And further, take an eel and drink it wrapped in a bandage, and it will be inserted and quickly extracted; or take a leek and put it in quickly and quickly take it out.
But if it is not expelled by those methods we have mentioned, then use a lead instrument in this way:
And let it be slightly larger than a fingernail, and at its end be a cavity that you can easily insert into their throat.
And have the patient raise their head, and be careful not to touch their throat bone, so that you don't hurt them, and with this you push the bone or thorn, or the physician does it with their hand.
But rather that the patient himself insert it is better, by his knowledge of the cause's location and push it downwards, and pull their hand with the instrument upwards, all according to the amount prepared until it is expelled.
Chapter 39.
Of the removal of bloodsuckers attached to the throat.
When a leech is medicated with what we have said in the division of treatment with medicines and not otherwise, consider then, in the throat of the patient, in the sunlight, after you have pressed the patient's tongue with the instrument we have described to you.
Therefore, if you see the leech, remove it with a small hook or with delicate, suitable gestures.
And if it is not possible for you to remove it with that, then take a concave cannula and insert it into the patient's throat, and then place a heated iron into the concavity of the cannula, and do this as many times (until the leech is dead and removed from the throat), and keep the patient away from water all day.
And then take a vessel full of cold water, and open the patient's mouth into it, and rinse the mouth with it; and let him not swallow anything and keep the water there for another hour, near by, with your hand, because the leech, as soon as it feels the water, will fall off.
But if it is not expelled by what we have described, then fumigate the patient with cyperus or asafoetida using the instrument we have described for the fumigation of the uvula.
Do this, so it falls away.
And there is another method of fumigation for that, which is that you take a bowl in which there are burning coals, and the bowl is covered with a cover in the middle of which there is a hole, and the end of the instrument is placed in that hole; and then you should perform the fumigation from above; and the patient should place his mouth on the end of the cannula, and close his mouth so that the fumigation is not expelled until you know that the fumigation has reached the leech, for the leech will fall off immediately.
And if it does not fall off, then you repeat the fumigation many times, and prevent the patient from drinking, and let him eat salty things and other things, and do not let him drink water, and thus it is necessary that with this treatment it be expelled.
And this is the form of the instrument with which the leech is treated when it is seen; and it is similar to forceps in some ways, but it has a slight curve in some places. which is placed on the leech, and its end is like a stork's beak, which is leathery, in which a file is fitted, so that when we grasp anything, it does not slip.
Chapter 40.
In which is the summary of the discourse on the appearance of abscesses and the incision of them.
Abscesses are of many types, in many ways, according to their appearance, each of which is described in this book.
And they are diverse in their puncturing and incision, in two ways, of which one is according to the nature of the abscess itself; and by the things we grasp about the humours.
And the second way is according to the locations on the body where they occur, for an abscess in the head is different from an abscess in the buttocks; and an abscess in fleshy areas differs from one in a joint; and each of these has its own treatment by operation.
And some abscesses should not be opened until the pus has matured within them, or they are fully formed.
Other abscesses, which need to be lanced when they are inflamed and not yet fully formed, such as abscesses near joints, for when an abscess is near a joint, its presence extends until the surrounding area is affected, and the ligaments or nerves of that joint are easily corrupted, which causes contraction of that limb; or the abscess is near a vital limb, and if you delay opening it until it is mature, you may harm the vital limb; or it is near the anus, so lance it while still unripe.  And you should not lance one that is inflamed and not fully formed except for an abscess near the anus, because otherwise you might rupture the rectum and cause a fistula or further damage to the area that will not heal. But you must know the time to lance the abscess, and that is when it is mature.
And you know it is mature when there is a cessation of pain and fever, and a decrease in swelling and throbbing, and the sharpness of the abscess head, and the other signs.
And because the incision should be made in the area of the pus, below the abscess and from the pus coming from the swelling.
And the incision should always be made along the length of the flesh or limb, if the abscesses are in the extremities, like hands or feet, and away from the joints, tendons, nerves, and arteries; and, finally, in all similar areas where there is no reflection; for in those that have reflection, use an incision appropriate to that particular limb.
But when the abscess is in a fleshy area, it is better to let the incision be until the digestion of it is confirmed, according to the completion, as we have said; for if you incise it before this, the body of the pus is prolonged, and a lot of impurities, and the edges of the pus are hardened and deepened.
But some abscesses are incised according to the width of the flesh or limb, as necessary, or according to the needs of the affected limb.
And it is necessary to make a small incision in small abscesses, and a large and wide incision, or multiple incisions, in large abscesses, according to the different sizes of the abscesses.
And others are abscesses in which the pus-filled cavity must be opened and incised, when it has been done in such a way that it can be completely drained, like those that occur in the case of boils and buboes.
And some are incised with a three-angled cut; and some are incised in the shape of a myrtle leaf, like abscesses of the groin.
And some are incised with a round incision, a crescent-shaped incision, and similar ones.
But those that are not like this, such as superficial abscesses, need to be opened with a superficial or flat incision only.
And when the abscess is large and has collected much pus, you should puncture it and not try to remove all the matter at once; having extracted a portion, close the abscess until the next day, then extract a larger portion, and do this many times according to the degree until it is completely drained.
And especially if the patient is weak, pregnant, a small child, or a decrepit old person, because the animal spirit is often weakened by the discharge of pus, and the patient frequently dies quickly, and you must be careful with the operation.
Observe great caution in this chapter, and when you make the incision to open these abscesses, you must cleanse the wounds and then consider if the abscess wound is small, or is a flat incision, then apply some lint or old cloth; but if the abscess is large, and the openings of the incision are many, then you must place a medicament in each opening until they are joined together.
If in the abscess a portion of the skin has been cut away or has been hollowed out around the edges, you must fill it with old cloth or linen thread, just as when you pull out bread or roots, without moisture; and hold it in place until the third day; then continue to treat and heal it with appropriate ointments until it is healed.
But if blood flows during your operation, then apply cold water and vinegar to which you have placed a linen cloth, and place this over the site of the blood flow many times.
But if the flow of blood continues, then you must apply the regimen and treatment and powders that have been discussed in many places in this book and in previous sections.
But if it is wintertime, and the area of the abscess is a place with many nerves, then you must soak powders in warm wine and oil, and place those on the affected areas.
And if it is summer, and the areas are fleshy, then you must place powders soaked in water and oil, or in wine and oil, and all of this should be cool until the third day, as we have said, and then you must drain the abscess, clean it, and apply the appropriate treatment until it is healed.
And this is what is necessary to know about the treatment of abscesses universally, but according to the method of distinction I have already discussed, each type of abscess is treated in a specific way, in separate chapters.
Chapter 41.
Of the incision of abscesses that occur in the nape of the neck.
Small abscesses in the nape of the neck, and some are of a kind of nodes containing tissues that adhere to them; and their types are varied.
And some of them are pustules, and those contain a moisture similar to lime. And some contain a moisture resembling dust, and similar to them; and some are stony, hard.
And in the incision of all of them, and in the extraction of those, there is no fear, as the extraction of those does not cause counteracting archery.
And the surgical procedure for cutting into them is that you probe them with an instrument whose shape is roughly like this, which is called a probe, until you know what they contain.
If what it contains is moisture, then you cut it with an incision along its length, through a superficial incision in this shape:
And begin the incision along the line of B to the line of G.  Then, when the moisture has been evacuated, you scrape off the skin that contained that moisture, and leave no part of it whatsoever, for the moisture frequently returns if any part remains.
Then soak a cloth in Egyptian ointment, if available, and otherwise in water and salt; and fill the wound with that and leave it until the next day, for with this you corrode any remaining skin.
And then repeat the application of Egyptian ointment to that cloth a second and third time if necessary, until you are confident that no part of that skin remains; then treat the wound with ointment until it is healed.
And if the abscess contains fatty nodules, then you incise it according to this method: with an incision shaped like a cross, and place hooks between the two edges of the incision and scrape it from every side, and exert your skill in extracting the membrane that contains it.
But if your efforts are unsuccessful, then do what I told you initially.
And similarly, do the same for a calcified abscess in terms of incision and treatment as we have described; and incision of a calcified abscess is easier, for it has little blood and little moisture.
And sometimes some of these abscesses, which are on the head in some men, have no moisture at all; the reason is that I incised an abscess on the head of an old woman and found the abscess like a hard, rough, white stone, which could not be broken, and if someone were struck by it, it would hurt.
But in other abscesses of the head, other than this, this is not the topic, such as the abscesses that come to the heads of children and near the roots of the ears, but the incision of all these should be a superficial incision.
And make the perforation in those from the lower part, so that the body is relieved of the pus to the lower parts.
And then treat them with what is appropriate for that type of treatment.
Chapter 42.
Of the incision of scrofulas that occur on the neck.
Often these abscesses appear on the neck, under the arms, and in the groin; and sometimes they occur in other parts of the body.
And those that occur on the neck, and many are generated among them, and every scrofulous swelling is within its own proper tunic, and thus like the nodes and abscesses of the head, as we have recounted.
And the types of these scrofulas are many, for some of them are stony, and some contain moisture, and some are malignant, which do not yield to treatment.
Therefore, in that one which you find to be well-disposed in the Touching, of which the visible color is similar to the color of a scab, and it is swollen throughout, and is not attached to the neck's nerves, veins, or arteries, and it is not deep, you should incise that with a superficial incision from the upper part to the lower part of the body along the line of G to the line of B, and drain it completely, and separate the edges of the scab with forceps, or several pairs if necessary, as we have described for abscesses of the head, and extract it bit by bit.
And it is more important that the vein or nerve not be cut.
And if the swelling is not very acute, do not apply your incision with force, or disturb the patient, and do not cut what is not necessary to cut; for if you cut a vein or artery and your procedure is thus impeded, then apply crushed vitriol or other powders that stop bleeding, and compress the wound, and leave it until the abscess's severity subsides and the wound becomes softened and begins to fester. When the blood is drawn/separated.
Therefore, return to your procedure until you have completed it.
And then examine with your index finger if there are any other small scrofulous causes; therefore, cut open and clean them.
And if a large vein is at the root of the swelling, you should not cut that swelling from its roots in that case. Before that, you must tie it with a tightly folded bandage and leave it until it falls off by itself without harm.
And then fill the wound with old cotton that you have already soaked in Egyptian ointment, and then treat it.
And if you cut the entire swelling, then you must bring together the two edges of the wound and stitch them up as soon as there is no more excess fluid remaining.
However, if you see that excess fluid remains due to the size of the swelling, you must intend to cut the root of that, and extract it and administer sutures and whatever else is said.
And that swelling which contains moisture, pierce it with a superficial perforation where the location of its maturation appears to you, and make a perforation at the spot where the pus is lowest on the body, just as we have said.
And then apply a perforation, perhaps with ointments and similar to those, so that it corrodes what remains of the corruption. And then, when you see the wound already cleansed, then treat it with a flesh-generating ointment until it is healed.
Chapter 43.
Of the incision of the boil of an abscess occurring within the throat.
The ancients said this incision in the boil, and no one has been seen in our land who has done that.
And this is the writing of the speech of those.
But in cases of back pain, the extraction of the boil should be avoided, because it will not be beneficial; for all the veins and major arteries of the patient are located there.
But in those who have hot abscesses in the mouth or throat or ears, when the illness is not in the jaw, it is necessary to use the incision of the boil, to avoid the destruction caused by burning.
Therefore, when we wish to do this, we should incise the boil beneath the three or four circles of the boil with small incisions along the line between two circles, so that the incision is in the skin, not in the cartilage.  This area is suitable for incision, because it lacks flesh and the blood vessels are further away.
And if the physician is hesitant, then he should carefully dissect the tissue of the throat with a scalpel, and then cut through the tissue until he reaches the channel, but he must avoid the blood vessels if he sees any.
And then he should make the incision in the skin, as we have described; and the incision of the channel is signaled by the pus that comes out along with the broken tissue and by the cessation of the voice.
And leave the wound open for some time.
So, when the time has come in which a perforation is feared, bring together the two sides of the tissue of the wound and stitch them together, excluding the cartilage.
And then administer medicines that promote the growth of flesh until it is healed.
And Albucasis says that the summary of the discourse we have recounted, the exposition, is nothing but to see that some of these abscesses have already blocked the patient's airway, and the patient is close to death, and the patient's breath is cut off, and some people go to incise the epiglottis so that the patient breathes over the site of the wound to allow some breathing, and thus be saved from death.
And therefore I command that the wound be left open until the malignancy of the illness is consumed; and its malignancy lasts for three days; and then I command to sew the wound, and treat it until it is healed.
And this I myself have witnessed, that a servant took a knife and put it into her throat and with it cut a part of the lung's airway, and I was called to treat her.  I found the sound of her breathing like that of a dying person, and discovered the wound and found little blood issuing from it.
Therefore, I was told that she had not cut a vein or artery, and air was coming from the wound, and I treated it until it was healed.
And it did not happen to the servant unless it affected her voice, and after some days she returned to a better state of health.
And now I say that there is no fear in the section of the epilepsy.
Chapter 44.
Of the incision on an abscess which occurs outside the throat, and is called a throat hernia.
This abscess, called a throat hernia, is a large abscess, depending on the color of the body, and is common in women.
And it is in two ways, for it is either natural or accidental.
And in the natural case, there is no way to cure it.
And the accidental case is in two ways, of which one is similar to greasy lumps, and the other way is similar to an abscess caused by the inflammation of an artery, and in that case, there is fear (of complications). And one should not apply pressure with iron except in the case of a small one (abscess). And you should try and investigate it with a probe, and if you find it similar to a fatty lump, and it is not connected to any of the veins, then you should incise it as you would with lumps, and remove whatever it contains from the skin and pouch; and if not, then the whole condition should be examined, and afterwards the area should be treated with whatever treatment is necessary until it is healed.
Chapter 45.
Of the incision of the types of lumps.
There are many types of lumps, and I have already described all their types in the division.
And it is necessary that I recount the difference between a lump and a swelling, as there might be doubt.
Therefore, I say that with a swelling, there is heat, fever, and intense pain until the ebullition of the excess is calmed; and when putrefaction is complete, the fever, pain, and heat cease.
But with a lump, there is no heat, fever, or pain, and it resembles that lion-like lump which is in the groin itself.
And it is according to the color of the body, and its beginning is like a seed and is made thus like a cavity, whether larger or smaller, and there are two types, for either it is fatty and contains moisture, and the colors of the moisture are many, as I have said in the division.
Therefore, when you come to the treatment of a lump, you must probe it and investigate it at the beginning with an instrument called a probe, as its form will be shown in the chapter which is near this one.
And it is a way of investigating abscesses and all lumps, and you should take this instrument and insert it into the most moist spot you find in the abscess, and you should turn your fingers with that little by little until you know that the instrument has penetrated the skin.
And finally place your hand according to the size of the abscess, and then pull out the probe and consider what has come out on its surface.
And if the flowing moisture, of whatever color it may be, has been expelled, then you should incise it with a superficial incision, as I have said in other abscesses.
And if there is no moisture on the probe's track, then you know that it is fatty (or greasy).
And dry it with an incision in the shape of a cross, in this way: As I have shown you, and suspend it with forceps, and carefully scrape off the scab from all sides, and if possible, preserve the skin or sac over it and remove the pus with a probe.
However, if it breaks during the operation, removing the pus is not possible, and this often happens, and then you remove it in pieces until nothing remains.
For if any part of it, little or much, remains, the probe will return in the same way.
And if you see that any small part remains, then fill the wound with some sharp, corrosive powders, and tightly close the wound, and apply a hot poultice over it, and treat it with the other treatments until it is healed.
And if it is a large probe, then you stitch the two edges of it together and treat it with something that promotes healing.
However, if there is a pulsating or non-pulsating vein near it, then you cauterize and fill the area with crushed vitriol, and leave it there for two or three days until the wound can heal and the blood ceases to boil; and then return to dissect what remains of the probe.
Chapter 46.
Of the forms of instruments necessary in surgery and perforation.
Of those, the forms of instruments are of three types, some are large, some are medium-sized, and some are small.
The form of the large instrument is this:
The form of the small instrument is this:
They should be made of iron, or bronze, with sharpened ends, so that they can easily penetrate abscesses.
And these are the forms of the instruments, and they are called probes, and one of them is called a lancet.
And they are of three types, for some are large, medium, and small.
The shape of the large instrument, its form:
The shape of the medium instrument, its form:
The shape of the small instrument, its form:
It is appropriate that they be used for abscesses, ulcers, fistulas, and buboes, because within those are bones and other things.
And they are made round, thick, sharp, like large needles with which the seams are sewn, and they are made of citrus wood, or of horn, or of iron, or of silver.  And the best are when they are made of citrus wood.
And the instruments are made of black lead, which is believed to be suitable for opening fistulas, whose cavities contain reflections, which are reflected by their lightness with those reflections.
And they are of three kinds, for some are long, others medium-length, and others short, according to the extent of the fistula's width and its constriction.
Shape of the large lead instrument:
Shape of the medium-sized lead instrument:
Shape of the small lead instrument:
The shapes of the probes are of many kinds, for some are simple, having only one curve, and these are of three types: large, small, and medium.
And of them are some probes without gold, and these are of three types.
And of those are probes having two curves, and these are of three types.
And of them are some having three curves, and these are of three types.
And all of these are necessary in their proper place.
Shape of a small simple probe, its form is:
Shape of a large probe having two curves: Shape of a medium-sized probe having two curves: Shape of a small probe having two curves:
Shape of a large probe having three curves:
Shape of a medium-sized probe having three curves:
And these are the shapes of the scalpels with which the nodes and abscesses are cut and cauterized, and they are of three kinds, for some are large, medium, and small.
Shape of a large scalpel:
Shape of a medium-sized scalpel:
Shape of a small scalpel:
The edges with which the incision is made are sharp, and the other edges are blunt, and they are not placed in such a way as to facilitate the excoriation of the nodes without risk of cutting a vein or nerve, so that the patient is healed and finds a little tranquility due to the cauterization which it finds near the excoriation of the abscess.
And these are the forms of lancets, and they are of three kinds: large, medium, and small, as you will see.
They are made of iron and are similar in shape to a saw, with which alcohol is made.
And it is at the pointed end covered with a hidden spike, and in that [area] it runs [or moves] to the inside and outside parts, as you wish, just as you see.
The forms of lancets, which are hidden amongst the fingers for the puncturing of abscesses and not perceived by the patients, are of three kinds: large, medium and small. And these are the forms of those:
The forms of cupping glasses, with which the flow of blood is separated, are of three kinds: large, medium, and small; their shapes are:
They are made of citrus wood, round with some length, and are thin.
And it is necessary that these types of cupping glasses, large, medium, and small, be available, so that through them the flow of blood can be separated quickly when needed, and otherwise they are of no use as medicine.
However, do not use these to draw blood from everywhere on the body; use them only on fleshy areas, such as the muscles of the legs and thighs, the muscles of the arms, breasts, abdomen, and knees, and similar fleshy, moist areas.
And sometimes other small instruments similar to the skins of bladders are made in this form, through which blood is drawn when it is taken by phlebotomy, or by incision of a vein or artery.
And sometimes they are made round in this shape:
Chapter 47.
Of the treatment of male breasts that have grown like women's.
Sometimes the breasts of some men swell during sleep as they begin to grow hairy, and then the breasts swell, and resemble those of women, and are sometimes inflamed, painful.
And whoever sees this, should cut the breasts with a lunar incision following this shape, from line B to line G, and then remove all the excess tissue, and then fill the wound with a flesh-healing medicine.  Then, stitch the two edges of the wound together, and treat it until healed.
But if the breast descends and becomes softened by its size, similar to women's breasts, then it should be cut into two parts, with two semi-lunar incisions, each contained within the other towards the end of each one, until the larger line contains the smaller one, following the shape of lines B and G.  Then, remove the excess skin between the two edges of the wound, and remove the fat.  Apply the previously mentioned sutures and powders as needed for healing, until the wound is healed.
And if you do not complete the incision as needed due to the patient's discomfort or bleeding, then fill the wound with cotton soaked in a corrosive ointment, leaving it until the remaining fat is corroded away, and then treat it until it is healed.
Chapter 48.
Of the lancing of abscesses that arise below the armpit.
These abscesses that arise below the armpit are a type of scrofulous, hard swelling, containing a pouch-like skin.
And some of these contain moisture; and those containing moisture should be incised with a lunar (crescent-shaped) incision along this line: from point G to point B.  And when all that is in the abscess of the pus has been evacuated, then you fill it with old linen/cloth and leave it until the next day.
And then the cloth is removed and treated with a suitable ointment until it is healed.
And if the abscess is of the types of nodes and scrofulous swellings, then you should cut into it in the same way as we described in the section on scrofulous swellings as well.
If the inflammation has spread to the point of suppuration, then apply a cautery to it as previously described.
Chapter 49.
Of the incision of abscesses that occur from archery or vein-related injuries.
When an arrow wound is healed, and the associated swelling has formed, then an abscess often arises.  And the signs by which one knows that inflammation and abscess are from the artery or vein are these: for when an abscess is from an arrow wound, it is located longer and deeper within the body; and when you press on the abscess with your fingers, you feel a rattling sound in the affected area.
And that which is from a vein is round and readily visible on the body's surface.
And making an incision on this abscess is a mistake, especially in those located under the armpits, in the knees, in the neck, and in many other parts of the body. If it is large, then its treatment with iron should be avoided.  And that which is in the extremities or head should be avoided.
However, regarding an abscess arising from inflammation of the wound opening of an arrow wound, make a lengthwise incision in the swelling.  Then open the incision with hooks and draw out the arrow, and free the surrounding tissues until it is exposed.
Then place a needle on that spot and push it through to the other side, and tie the arrow with a doubled thread in two places—which I experienced myself in removing two arrows lodged in the Templars.
And then pierce the area between the two ligaments with a spatula until all the blood that is there is released, and the abscess is dissolved.
And then administer a treatment in which pus is generated until the ligaments fall away; and then treat it with appropriate ointments until it is healed.
And if the abscess is due to a cut vein, then you must hold with your hand what you can of the abscess with a dressing, and then insert the needle beneath the area you held under your hand, and push it through; and tie it with a doubled thread until you pull it out from the other side, and then bind the abscess with a strong ligament as I have told you regarding the grape-like ligament of two parts with two ends of the thread.
But if you fear pulling out the thread, then insert the thread with the needle beneath the entire abscess, below the initial puncture, and tie your threads in four places.
Then dry the abscess in the middle of it until what is within it comes out, then you cut away the excess dressing, and leave what is tied there.
And then place on it a poultice that you have soaked in wine and oil, and then administer the treatment made with herbs and ointments until it is healed.
Chapter 1 of the abscess which occurs due to the twisting of nerves.
Thus, as abscesses occur in the arteries and veins, similarly abscesses occur in the nerves when they are injured by blows or excessive strain, and similarly in other cases.
And it [the abscess] is most often found in the areas of the tendons or the heel, or in any place where the joints are injured.
And it is a serious abscess, and it resembles the color of the rest of the body, and is in the majority of cases positioned without swelling, and when it is tight with violence, the patient feels a sensation similar to stupor.
And it is not an abscess that spreads through the body, and therefore it is below the skin, and it is bruised in all directions but does not move to the front or back areas.
Therefore, those that are in the joints should not be incised with iron, for a strong contraction will easily result.
But that which is on the head or forehead should be opened with a lancet. But if the abscess is small, then you should take it with forceps and cut it away from its roots.
And if it is large, then you should lift it with forceps, and scrape it off, and then remove it; and close the wound with sutures, and treat it until it is healed.
Chapter 11.
Of the incision of an abscess which occurs in the area of the abdomen.
Often, in the abdomens of some men, and in other parts of their bodies, there are growths called fungi due to their resemblance to fungi, with a fine root and a thick head. The edges of these growths are turned inward, and some are small, while others are greatly enlarged.
And I have seen one, and in his abdomen there were two growths, which were more like fungi, and there was no difference between them, being white and having fine roots.
And the edges of these were turned inward and cracked open, and moisture flowed from it constantly.
Therefore, I incised them and found one to be eighteen ounces, and the other six ounces.
And the procedure for their incision is that you should consider whether the patient is humid, and if the growth's color is white, moist, with a fine root; then you should cut it with a broad spatula, and have cauteries at the ready in the fire, because frequently much blood is expelled during its excision. If you notice blood, cauterize the area.
And if the patient is fearful and timid, beware of incision with iron; but then take fresh lead solder, and press it against the growth, in the manner we have described; and leave it for two days.
And then adjust the tightness of the lead thread; therefore, do not cease to press the lead firmly onto the growth until it is severed and falls off by itself without effort.
But if the growth has a thick root, then its excision causes some fear and anxiety, especially when it is located in the belly.
But it is possible that you sever half of it, and then cauterize the area to prevent it from returning.
And then treat it until the wound is healed.
And be careful not to presume to excise a growth that is dark in color, with little sensitivity, and easily overlooked, for such a growth may be cancerous.
And I will bring a remedy for cancer to this.
Chapter 52.
Of the treatment of a protrusion of the navel.
A protrusion of the navel is caused by various things; either by fissures in the fascia covering the abdomen, and in this it is like other ruptures, where the tissue or intestine protrudes; or by blood that flows from a vein or artery as previously mentioned, or by trapped wind in that area.
However, if it is due to a fissure in the fascia and the protrusion of tissue, then the color of the abscess is similar to the color of the body; and it is painless, and it appears in various locations. And if it is due to the emergence of the intestine, then its location differs from what we have described, with much greater variability.  When you press it with your fingers it is hidden, and then returns; and it is very light there, and greatly elevated near the entrance of the bath, and causes much struggle.
But if it is due to humidity, then it is painless and is not hidden when you press it with your hand, nor is it constricted, nor is it believed to be creased.
And if it is due to blood, then with these signs the abscess appears with a darkening.
But if it is due to raw flesh, then the abscess is serious, large, and hard, and is fixed in a quantity (or fixed in place according to a fixed amount).
But if it is due to wind (gas), then the touch of it is painless.
And the operation on it is that you should consider if the swelling from the umbilicus is due to blood from an artery, or a vein, or wind; then you must be prohibited from treating it, because there is fear and danger in it, just as it was taught to you in the chapter where I spoke of abscesses from an artery and a vein.
And if the swelling of the umbilicus is due to the intestine or a hernia, then you must instruct the patient to hold their breath and remain standing and stretched out.  Then probe the area surrounding the umbilicus with a probe, and have the patient lie on their back between your hands.  Then, using a spatula, circle the area around the umbilicus at the spot marked by the probe;  then lift the half of the abscess upwards using a large forceps. Then tie the area around the wound with strong thread or bandage in a proper way.
Then, cut open the middle of the swollen abscess along the ligament, and insert your finger into that opening and search for the hernia.  If you find or have located the hernia through the ligament, then you should gently pull and push the hernia back into the abdomen.
And if you have found the hernia, then grasp it with forceps and cut away any excess tissue.
However, if it is an artery or vein, then carefully circle that area, and return to your initial procedure.  Take two needles and thread them with strong thread.  Insert the needles into the surrounding area around the abscess in a cross pattern, passing them through the tissues. Then gently compress the abscess into four sections over the needles.
If you wish, remove the needles and leave the area until the swollen tissue can recede and fall away on its own. Or, if the tissue is softened and easily pulled away, cut it away, and then treat it with the appropriate ointments until healed.
If the swelling around the navel is caused by a growth or excessive moisture, then you must drain the abscess as described and remove the blood or moisture found there.  Then treat the area with appropriate remedies to promote healing and tissue consolidation.
Chapter 53.
Of the treatment of cancer.
We have already discussed, in the division [of topics], the types of cancer and how to treat them with medicine.  We have said that surgery is a poor choice because it will not heal a cancerous lesion, and we have discussed cancer that originates in the breast and the precautions to take in its treatment.
And the ancients said that sometimes cancer is in a place where it is possible to remove it, like cancer in the breasts or the thigh, and similar locations on the limbs, where you can remove everything, especially when it is small and beginning.
However, when it is old and severe, you should not attempt to treat it yourself, for I have not been able to cure any such case, nor have I seen another who has succeeded in doing so.
And the operation in such a case, as we have said, is that you should first treat and purge the patient of black bile on some occasions, and then bleed them if a clear excess of blood is found.
And then prepare the patient with the preparations appropriate for the operation, and then insert hooks into the wound that are suitable for the purpose; and then scrape around with a good, sharp curette to examine thoroughly, until no trace of the cancer's roots remains. And let the blood flow, and do not cut it off lightly, and squeeze the affected areas, and cleanse away all the thick blood with your hand or with an instrument that you have available.
However, if you encounter difficulty with thick blood, either in a vein or artery, then cauterize it until the blood flow stops, and then treat it with the other methods until it is healed.
Chapter 54.
Of the treatment of dropsy.
We have already recounted, in the division, the kinds of dropsy from water, and the signs of each kind, concerning the treatment of them with medicines.
And that which is cured with iron is only the kind of dropsy from air, and it is not treated with iron in the case of tympanites or hypospargia, for that is deadly.
And when you have treated this kind of tympanites dropsy with medicines, and your treatment does not succeed, then consider, for if the patient has already been weakened, or is suffering from another disease or other dropsy, such as if it is in his chest or abdomen and similar to those, then beware that you do not treat it with iron, for there is danger in that.
However, if you see the patient with exuberant strength, and there is no other ailment but dropsy alone, and neither a child nor an old person, then the method of operating on him is that you lift the patient between your hands, and the attendant should press the patient's belly with his hand, driving the water toward the lower part of the chest, and then take a pointed spatula in this manner:
It should be of two sharp parts, long, with a sharp tip like a spatula; but nevertheless, it should have some small shortness, little by little, so that in the operation with it you do not go into the intestines and injure them.
And then consider if the dropsy originates from the intestines, for then you must, with the incision, move away from the navel by the amount of three fingers to the lower parts, to the right side over the chest.
But if the dropsy originates from a liver ailment, then your incision should be to the left of the navel by three fingers.
And if its origin is from the spleen, then your incision should be to the right.
And your incision should not be on the side on which the patient is lying, so that the superfluities do not rush to that confined place.
And then pierce with the instrument all the membrane, and then insert into that incision, and lift your hand with the spatula between the membrane and the flesh, and scrape that; and if it is the quantity of a fingernail or thereabouts.
And then pierce the flesh until the spatula reaches the empty space, which is the space of the water. And then extract that and insert an instrument of which this is the shape: and it is similar to a fine silver cannula; it is made of silver or brass or lead, on which, at its lowest part, is a small hole, and on its sides are three holes: two on one side and one on the other side; and its tip is cut in the manner of a feather, like this:
And at its highest end is a ring, for when the instrument reaches the water, then that immediately closes onto the instrument, thus evacuating a moderate amount of the water, for if you evacuate more than is necessary at that time, the patient will likely die from the resolution of their vital spirit, or the approach of death.
But evacuate that according to the quantity of its virtue and according to the indications given to you by the patient's condition, the strength of their pulse, and their well-being.
And then withdraw the instrument, and retain the water, which is why it is immediately retained by the cord that holds the hole over the tip of which, and I have told you, that you should perforate it in that manner.
Then repeat the procedure on the following day, if the patient tolerates it, and extract a small amount of water, and do this for several days with caution, and be wary of error until little water remains.
However, if you fear for the patient, and leave a large amount of water, then cure that with burial in hot sand, and induce sweating in a bath, and wait in the sun for a long time; and cure that with drying medicines until it is healed.
And cauterize on the stomach, and the spleen and liver, after the extraction of the water, as I have described in what has preceded.
Chapter 55.
Concerning the cure of children born with unperforated urinary passages.
Sometimes a child is born from its mother's womb and the opening of its urethra is not perforated (or is too narrow or not in its proper place).
Therefore, it is necessary to attempt to perforate it as soon as it is born with a very fine instrument, following this method:
And then place a small lead peg into the opening, and secure it, and keep it in place for three or four days.
And when it wants to urinate, let it urinate; and then return the peg.
And if you do not place the lead, it is possible that the urine, which flows over the area, will not allow this opening to close.
But that of which the opening is narrow should be treated with a lead peg, as we have said, for many days until it is enlarged.
But those in which the opening is not in its place, as said, and the cause is that of those whose opening is at the end of the head of the penis so that they cannot urinate properly, until one elevates the penis with their hand upwards;  and it is not a generative condition, because the semen cannot reach the female according to its proper trajectory, and is a very slow illness.
And the method of the operation in this case is that the patient be placed on their back, and then pull the head of the penis out forcefully with your left hand, and cut the head of the penis from the opening of the foreskin with a sharp scalpel, like a feather-shaped incision, or remove some part, so that the middle of the penis matches the head of the penis and the opening falls in the correct middle position.
And be careful during your operation, for often blood flows, so apply pressure to stop the bleeding, and treat the wound until it heals.
Chapter 56.
Of the white film that occurs on the foreskin and the head of the penis, and of the corruption, blackness, and adhesion of the foreskin to the head of the penis.
Many times this white film occurs on the penis and is a protruding growth of loose flesh.
And of those, one is malignant and the other is not.
For the non-malignant one, you should suspend it with a fine thread and cut it off completely; then apply a piece of cloth soaked in Egyptian ointment; and afterwards, treat it with diachylon ointment until healed.
And if the white film is malignant, of a foul color, then you must apply a cautery near the incision and the root of it.
But if the white film is on the foreskin of the uncircumcised penis, and one part of the film is inside the foreskin and another part is outside, then you must remove the film that is inside first until it is consolidated; and then you treat the part outside, because when you treat both at the same time, you risk tearing the foreskin.
And if you observe darkening and corruption in the genitals and foreskin, then you must remove all that which is blackened and about to corrupt, or which is already corrupted; and then apply to it a mixture of honey, ground pomegranate bark, and crushed and sifted herbs.
And then treat it with the other remedy until it is healed.
But if there is a flow of blood, then apply a lunar cautery according to this method:
for a helpful cautery is for two conditions at once, that is, for a flow of blood and for a sore when it is corrupted.
And if the head of the penis is corroded and completely destroyed at once, then you must insert a lead cannula into the opening of the foreskin so that the patient can urinate through it.
In the adhesion of the foreskin to the head of the penis (and this adhesion only happens in those whose foreskin is healthy, and circumcision is not required; and when adhesion occurs due to a sore or abscess) you must scrape with a blunt spatula until the ligament is dissolved and the head of the penis is freed from all parts.
And if it is difficult to distinguish them precisely, then you must scrape with a spatula any cause of adhesion between the head of the penis and the foreskin.  This is because the foreskin, when thin, is easily perforated due to its delicate nature.
Then separate the foreskin and the head of the penis with thin, supple strips of cloth, which have already been moistened with cold water so that they do not adhere again.
And then treat it with astringent wine until it is consolidated.
Chapter 57.
Concerning the cleansing of children and the treatment of complications arising from circumcision.
Circumcision is not a simple break in the skin like other wounds; however, since it is a procedure we perform deliberately and specifically on children, it is necessary for us to take the best approach and the easiest path toward health in that operation.
Therefore, I say that the ancients did not mention circumcision in any of their books, because they did not use it in their laws, and it is only because we have acquired this knowledge through experience that I have found most craftsmen and barbers using circumcision and cleansing with a razor and with cauterization; and they use ligation with thread and incisions with the fingernail.
And I have already tested all these methods, and I find no better cleansing than with scissors, with thread ligatures, than with fingernail incisions, for frequently the foreskin, having two layers, the inner layer remains and a further incision causes unnecessary pain. And with the cleansing done with a scalpel, a digital method used by cobblers, the incision of the male member's extremity is not secure, for it easily enters the opening.
But in the procedure with the fingernail, you easily cause damage and spoil your work. And the foreskin of a child is naturally short, and often they are born in such a way that no cleansing is needed, and I have seen this.
But the cleansing done with scissors and thread ligatures, its goodness, experience has shown me, for the scissors are for a proportional incision, because the sharpness on top is as sharp as that underneath; and thus when you press your hand, there are two proportionate sharpnesses, and it cuts in proportion and at one time; and a compression of the thread, enveloping the foreskin of the penis from every side, is made, with which there is no risk whatsoever.
And the first method of the procedure is that you should have the child mostly still, if it is one of those who understand a little, and you should only tie the thread to its penis and leave it until the next day.
And then do that joyfully in every way possible, considering its understanding. And then have the child remain between your hands, carefully positioned, and do not be hesitant; and hide the scissors in your hand or under your foot, so the child doesn't see them, nor any other instruments.
And then, place your hand on the penis and blow into the foreskin, pulling it back until the head of the penis is exposed, and then cleanse it of any dirt adhering to it.
The shape of the scissors for cleansing, this is the shape:
One end should be blunt and the other sharp, so that the nail's root doesn't come out, and the length of the two blades should be similar to the length of two handles together.
But the mistake in cleansing is that you forcefully pull the foreskin entirely, or part of it, away from the incision.
Therefore, you should spread it with your fingertip before the suppuration of the area and cut it along an equal length.
And if you can't hold it with your fingertip, then extract it with forceps and cut it.
But if three days have passed, and this inflamed area beneath the penis remains suppurating, then you leave it until the pus has subsided, and carefully scrape away the area, and cut it according to your preparation.
And be careful of the head of the penis, for it will not harm him.
And therefore treat it with that which consolidates wounds from the powders that we have described in the treatise on powders.
And if the incision of the scrotum is excessive and you injure the surrounding areas, that will not benefit him.
And further treat it with what we have said until it is healed.
Chapter 58.
Of the treatment of urine retained in the bladder.
Retention of urine in the bladder is caused by blockage due to a stone, or congealed blood, or pus or, or similar things to what we have said about methods of treatment in the division.
And if the urine is not dissolved with what we have said, and a strong cause is affecting the patient, then it is necessary to administer extraction of it with an instrument called a syringe, of which this is the form: It should be of silver, and have a thin, concave shape, like a bird's feather cannula, with a slender, long ray about a palm and a half long, to which there should be a thin tube at its head.
And the method of extracting the urine with this is to take the folded linen and tie wool or cotton to one end for a good binding; and insert the ends of the linen into the part below the syringe, and cut with scissors any excess of the wool, but insert it into the cannula with force.  Then lubricate the syringe with oil and egg white.
And have the patient lie on their back, and lubricate their bladder and penis with moist oils, olive oil and other soothing liquids.
Then insert the syringe with ease until it reaches the root of the penis; then bend the penis upward toward the navel area; then push the syringe into that; and then push it further until it reaches the bladder.  And that will indicate the patient has reached the hollow space. However, if this procedure isn't successful, the opening through which the urine passes may be tortuous.
And then pull out the linen with the wool little by little, for the urine will soak the linen.
Then remove it and collect the urine as a cure.  Continue using the syringe until the bladder is emptied and the patient finds relief.
Chapter 59.
On the quality of bladder irrigation with a clamp and similar instruments suitable for that purpose.
When an ulcer, abscess, or congealed blood occurs in the bladder, or it is constricted by a calculus, and you want to instill liquids and medicines into it, then use an instrument called a clamp, and this is its form:
but its end is blunt, that is, closed. And in that (end) there are three openings: two on one side, like the letter "V".
At the beginning, there's a concave space, in which that which is pushed is contained, and be according to the quantity that obstructs it, without addition, until when some cause is with that drawing out the moistures, it is drawn out, and when it is expelled, with it is drawn out, and when expelled far away, according to what a clamp does, with which naphtha is used in naval battles.
Therefore, when you want to introduce liquids into the bladder, insert the end of the clamp into the liquid, and draw with it that which is pushed towards the upper parts, for the liquid is drawn into the concavity of the clamp.
And then, insert the end of the clamp into the penis, as we have recounted in the surgical procedures; and then push the liquid with what you are pushing, for that liquid will reach the bladder immediately, and the patient will feel relief from that.
Shape of the thin instrument with which the bladder is incised, and this is the shape:
And it should be made of silver or lead, of which the topmost part resembles a small feather, and below that a hollow channel within the binding.
And then take the bladder, place the liquid you want to inject into the bladder in it, and then tie it between two things with a strong double-string bandage, and heat that liquid over the fire.
And then insert the tip of the instrument into the penis.
Then press your hand down on the bladder with the liquid with a squeezing motion until the patient feels that the liquid has reached the bladder.
But if you don't have a bladder, then take a piece of parchment and make a circle out of it; and pierce it all the way through its roundness; and then insert strong string through those holes, so it's tied together; and then attach the circle as if it were attached to a funnel, and then put in what you want of the liquids, oils, and waters.
Then tie that to the instrument and use it just as you did with the bladder, and squeeze with your hand until the liquid reaches the bladder.
Chapter 60.
Of the extraction of stones.
We have already discussed in the division the types of stones and their treatment with medicine, the difference between stones formed in the kidneys and those formed in the bladder, and the signs of each.
And we have discussed stones in which manual or surgical intervention is necessary.
And the stone formed in the bladder is properly that which is lodged in the bladder.
And I am narrating this with clear exposition and brevity.
Therefore, I say that stones formed in the bladder mostly affect children.  The signs include that the urine expelled from the bladder is like water in its subtlety, and sand appears in it.  The patient frequently rubs their genitals, often cries, and subsequently is constipated.  With this, the anus is often strained in such cases.
And the cure is easier in children before they reach fourteen years of age; and it is a difficult cure in the elderly. But in young people it is more easily done because it is among them. (or... amongst those.)
And of that in which the stone is larger, the cure is easier; and if it is small, it is the opposite of that.
Therefore, in approaching the cure for this, one must first cleanse the patient with clysters which remove all the inflammation in their intestines.  For this inflammation sometimes prevents the stone from being expelled from the body by investigation of it.
And then the patient should be placed with their feet raised and gently shaken and jostled so that the stone descends to the bladder, or changes position.
And then perform this operation between your hands, and the patient's hands should be under their thighs, so that the entire bladder is made to descend downward.
And then search for it [the stone] and remove it completely.
Therefore, if you feel the stone in the space, then you immediately proceed with incision over it.
And if it does not completely descend under your touch, then you must anoint your left index finger (if the patient is a child) or middle finger (if the patient is a full-grown youth) with oil, and insert it into their anus. And search for the stone until it is under your finger. And gradually move it towards the neck of the bladder.
And then press on it with your finger, and expel it outwards from the place where you made the incision.
And instruct the attendant to press the bladder with their hand; and instruct another attendant to, with their right hand, pull the genitals upwards, and with their other hand, hold the [possibly "cord" or "ligament"] which is below the genitals, in the area of the incision.
And then proceed with the incision, the form of which is as follows: And make the incision in the area between the anus and the genitals, not in the middle, but along the side of the left thigh; and let the incision be over that [bone/area] and your finger be on the anus, and let the incision be transverse, so that the incision externally is wide and internally narrow, according to the quantity that the protrusion of the stone permits, and no more, for if you press your finger in the anus too hard, the stone may be forcefully expelled without relief.
And know that there is some part of the stone with its angles and edges, making the removal difficult because of that.
And that part, which is like a testicle, and is round, is easily removed.
Therefore, if it is the part with angles and edges, it fits into the fissure.
And if it is not expelled outwardly, then you must gently press or firmly press it with a suitable instrument, the end of which should be like a file pressing on the stone and not moving, or you must insert a thin curved instrument beneath it.
But if you cannot press it, then you enlarge the hole a little, and if you see blood flowing, firmly cauterize it with crushed vitriol.
But if the stones are more than one, then at first you press your hand against the mouth of the bladder, and then cut into it; and then press slightly on it; and similarly, do so if there are more than two.
And if the stone is very large, then it is foolish to cut it with a large incision, for you will cause the patient one of two things: either death or a continuous leakage of urine, because the area is not completely healed.
But administer methods to expel it until it is expelled outwardly, or try to break it with forceps until you extract it in pieces.
So, when you have completed your operation, then fill the wound with aloe juice and dragon's blood, and seal it. And place over it a cloth soaked in oil and wine, or in heated oil and cold water, so that a hot abscess might be lessened.
And then lay the patient on their back, and do not loosen the bandage until the third day.
And when you have removed the bandage, anoint the area with water and a little oil, then treat it with diafinicon ointment and diabazilicon ointment until it is healed.
But if in the wound a hot, painful, and corrosive abscess develops, resembling the freezing of blood in the bladder, which prevents urination (and this is known by the blood mixing with the urine), then insert your finger into the wound and extract that blood, for if it remains, it will cause corruption of the bladder and its putrefaction.
And then wash the wound with vinegar, water, and salt, and with whatever else is appropriate for its treatment until it is healed.
And during all the treatment, you should bind both thighs and adjust the medicines placed on the area.
And if the stone is small and is in the urethra, and urination is blocked, then treat it with what I have recommended before getting to surgery, because many times this treatment is accused of causing surgery.  I have tested this, and you should take a sharpened iron drill, of which this is the shape:
of triangular tip, sharp, fitted into a shaft.
And then take a bandage and tie the penis below the stone so that it doesn't return to the bladder.
And then insert the iron into the penis, piercing it easily until the drill reaches that stone. And turn the drill with your hand on that small stone little by little, and you widen the hole until you make the other part penetrate; for then the urine is released.
And then press your hand on the part of the stone that is protruding from the penis, because that is broken and is pushed out with the urine, and the patient is cured.
But if this cure is not suitable for you for any reason that prevents it, then tie a bandage below the stone, and another bandage above the stone. And then cut onto the stone on that penis between the two bandages. And then extract it. And then untie the bandage and cleanse the congealed blood, which is formed in the wound.
And a bandage below the stone is not necessary, except to prevent it from returning to the bladder, and the other bandage above it is only to prevent it, because when the bandage around the stone is loosened, the kidney returns to its place and heals the wound.
And therefore, when you tie the bandage above, it is necessary for you to lift the kidney upward, or it will return to your treatment, and heal the wound, as we have said.
Chapter 61.
Of the extraction of stones from women.
Stones in women are rarely generated.
However, if a stone is found in any of them, then the cure is difficult, and there are many methods for its treatment.
One of them is if the woman is very young (or still a virgin).
And the second is that you do not find a woman knowledgeable enough to reveal herself to the physician when she is chaste, or is a married woman.
The third is that you do not find a woman well versed in this art, especially the procedure involving manual manipulation.
And the fourth is that the location of the incision on the stone in women is distant from the location of the stone itself, requiring a deep incision, and that is a cause for fear.
But if necessity compels you to do this, then you should take a knowledgeable female physician, and such a one is rarely found.
But if you are deprived of that, then seek a skilled and subtle male physician, or present a matron well-versed in the treatment of women, or a woman who has specialized in this art.
Therefore, present her, and command her to do everything you order, from the examination for the stone at the beginning; this is to see if the woman is a virgin, and therefore she must place her finger into the woman's rectum and look for the stone.
Therefore, if she finds it, she should gently hold it with her finger, and then command that an incision be made upon it.
But if she is not a virgin, then command the matron to insert her finger into the woman's vagina and search for the stone, while placing her left hand on the bladder, and pressing it firmly.
Therefore, if it is found, then it must be gradually drawn out of the bladder opening and towards the lower parts, using the force of its own weight until it reaches the base of the thigh.
And then make an incision at the junction of the vagina's midpoint towards the base of the thigh, wherever the stone is lodged, and hold the stone in that area, and the person's finger shouldn't be removed from the stone while holding it there.
And the incision should be small at first; then insert a probe into that incision, and if the stone is felt, then widen the incision according to the size needed so that the stone can be removed from it.
And know that the types of stones are many: for some are small and large, and sharp and rough, and long and round, and having edges.
Therefore, you know how many kinds there are, so that you can indicate what you want about them.
And if you see a flow of blood, apply powdered vitriol to the area and keep it there for an hour until the blood is stopped, and then resume your operation until the stone is expelled.
And ensure you have prepared the instruments necessary for the extraction of stones in men, so that you are assisted by them in your operation.
And if you see a flow of blood, and know that the expulsion of blood is from the wounded artery, then you place powder on the area and compress it with bandages and a downward constriction, and do not repeat this; leave the stone and do not extract it, for a strong, sudden death will befall the patient. And then treat the wound.
Therefore, when the flow of blood has subsided after a few days, and the area has healed, then you resume your operation until the stone is expelled.
Chapter 62.
Of surgery concerning a strangulated hernia.
An acute hernia is nothing more than a collection of moisture in the white sac, which is below the groin, containing the testicle, and is called the sac.
And sometimes it is in the proper pouch which nature prepared in the area of the testicle, even if it is already apparent there is another testicle; and it is the groin area between the white sac we mentioned, and this is nothing but a bulge.
And the generation of this hernia is due to weakness that affects the groin, causing this material to seep into it, and sometimes it arises from a blow to the groin.
And this moisture has many colours, for its colour is either tending towards yellowish or bloody, or red, or black, or thick-ish, or watery and white, and that is the extent of them.
And the signs by which the accumulation of water is known are these: for if it is in the white sac we mentioned, then the swelling is round, sloping slightly lengthwise, like an egg shape, and the testicle appears, for the moisture surrounds it completely.
And if the moisture is in the proper pouch, then the swelling is round with a portion like a testicle, and for this reason one thinks it is another testicle.
And if the moisture is between the groin and the white sac, then it presses down on the groin.
And if you want to know the colour of the moisture, then you probe the colour of the moisture in the swelling with a pointed instrument whose form has been seen earlier; and based on what comes out in the trace left by the probe, judge what's inside it.
Therefore, when we come to treating it with iron, then it is necessary to order the sick person to be bled, if that is possible, and to observe if their body is full.
And afterward, lie him on his back on some raised surface, and place soft cloths beneath him.
And then, sit on the patient's left side, and instruct the attendant to sit on the right side, who should extend their rod to one or both sides,  at the groin and the lower abdominal area.
And then, take a sharp knife and cut the groin area from the middle, lengthwise, towards the pubic region.
And make the incision according to a straight line equally distant from the line where you should cut the skin of the groin, until you reach the white tissue encompassing it.
And scrape away that tissue, observe, and be careful not to cut into it; and your scraping instrument, with which you scrape it, should be held up and subtly scrutinized with the scraping instrument according to the quantity possible for you.
And then pierce the water-filled sac with a wide opening, and remove all the water.
And then separate the two flaps of the incision with forceps, and spread the sac outward; and do not touch the groin area encompassed, and cut the sac in a way that is possible for you. And cut it [the sac] completely or in pieces, and especially its thin sides, for if you do not meticulously examine the incision, there is no guarantee that the water will not return.
However, if the sac protrudes from its sheath during your operation, then when you have completed the incision of the sac, return it inside, and then bring together the two flaps of the groin sheath with sutures, and then treat it like any other wound until it is healed.
And if you find the sac corrupted by another illness, then you must tie off the vessels that are supporting it, remove the sac, and then treat it as we have described.
But if the fluid is collected in two separate areas, for example, know that there are two hernias; therefore, make an incision in that area as you did in the other part; and if it appears to you that it is one operation, then perform it as one.
And then you cleanse the blood, and interpose wool soaked in oil or in olive oil; and place another layer of wool soaked in wine and oil over the groin and the lower abdomen; and place over it folded cloths and powders, and bind those together with a bandage according to this method:
And then take two cloths, fill them with folded wool according to this pattern; and have the edges bound with cotton or damp wool, and attach them with a tightening to the undergarment, and one end reaching from the buttocks to the other, and the other end reaching towards the thigh region, and two edges beneath the thighs and two other edges above the knees, and all of these tightenings be fastened to the undergarment.
And sometimes this hernia is treated artificially with a cautery instead of an incision with iron; and you should take a sharp, knife-like cautery and cut the skin of the groin area with it, and cauterize it as described until the white membrane containing the fluid is revealed; and then take a cautery according to this method: And it resembles a Greek letter.
And then pierce that membrane, and cauterize it until all the moisture is expelled.
And then spread the membrane with hooks, and scrape it with hooks, and scrape it with a hot, thin cautery; and cut it as best you can until you eradicate everything; and be careful that the egg (scrotum) is not touched by the fire.
And know that this operation is safer and further from blood loss, and better than an operation involving an incision.
However, if you encounter an abscess, cauterization, or blood loss during the incision or cauterization, then you must treat whatever difficulty arises by using the appropriate treatment, as previously described.
But if the patient is fearful, and does not tolerate a second operation due to its harshness, then perform the perforation as I have recommended; and this is when you are certain, based on what we have said about the symptoms, that the hernia is acute.
Then you must position the patient on a raised surface, and carefully pierce the abscess at its lowest point with a wide spatula, and place the puncture along the length of the body.
And keep the opening wide until all the fluid drains out.
And then apply a compress to the area, and bind it tightly, leaving it for the remaining fluid to drain. And then treat it until the wound is healed.
But if there is resistance to the fluid draining at that time, you pierce it again.  This is done because the white membrane at the wound's opening resists and prevents the fluid from leaving.  Then you must apply a poultice or instrument used to remove water from hydrops,  of a form previously described, or apply a small pressure to the wound.
And know that the fluid returns, and gathers again, approximately within six months or thereabouts; and when it gathers, then it should be pierced again in the same manner, so that the illness will pass its course.
Chapter 63.
Of the section on fleshy hernia and its cure.
Know that in the operation on this fleshy hernia there is a fear of harm in the most serious cases; therefore, to me, the abandoning of it and being saved by that means seems the better choice.
And I am remembering the operation on that and the types of abscesses.
Therefore, I say that abscesses arise in the bodies of those whose genitals are inflamed, and this is caused by many things: either by a sharp, harsh superfluity, which is discharged into the genitals, or by a blow.
And the color of the abscess is according to the color of the body, and if there is no pain in it, then it is a serious abscess.
And a hard, stony abscess is light, whose color is dark, and there is no feeling in it.
And sometimes it is caused by inflammation of the arteries, and by the swelling of those, which is already perceived in the memory of it, or by the swelling of the veins.
But that which is caused by the inflammation of the arteries is known by the scattering of the abscess when you press it with your fingers; and it is not appropriate to touch it.
However, that which is caused by the inflammation of a vein is not scattered by any cause from compression with the fingers.
And it is possible that on this type (of abscess) a section can be made, and on the other flesh; and it is that you cut the skin of the genitals, and then spread the wound outward, and extract the white material from the cyst, and release the suspensory ligaments, and tie them, and cut the suspensory ligaments further than you release them from all parts of the wound.
Therefore, if the abscess is already with those inflamed tissues (or flesh), then it is necessary that you extract the abscess and cut it open.
And if there is adhesion to any part of the cyst, or between the vessels, then it is necessary to separate all that adhesion and cut it with a circular incision.
But if there is an abundance of flesh in the area of the adhesion, which is behind (the cyst), then it is necessary that you cut away all of that, and extract the abscess as we have said.
So, when your operation is complete, then fill the wound with wool infused in rubbed oil and wine; and then treat it with the other remedies until it is healed.
Chapter 64.
Of the treatment of inguinal hernia.
The inguinal hernia is an abscess enclosed by a swelling, similar to a boil, with softening of the testicles.  It makes difficult movement, exercise, and walking for the patient.
And in the treatment of this illness, it is important to fear what has preceded, remembering it.
However, it is necessary to describe the operation in the same way as the first one.
And I say that it is necessary to have the patient sit on a raised board; then, gently pull the suspensory ligament of the testicles downwards; then, grasp the scrotum with your fingers and the instruments designed for the penis; and let another assistant do the same, and extend them with strong traction.
And then, carefully cut with a sharp, pointed scalpel in a transverse direction along the vessels, until the vessels are exposed.
And then, scrape away all the parts, just as we have said in extracting arrows from the temples.
And then, insert a needle with a double thread, and tie it at the first location where you made the incision, and tie it again at the back of them. And then, incise them in the middle, in a straight cut along the length of the body, and extract whatever is accumulated of the foul and corrupt humors.
And then, treat the wound with a treatment of other wounds where you want pus to be generated, so that the vessels which nourish one of the two testicles are opened, for that is not harmful.
But if you injure all the vessels, then it is necessary that the testicles be extracted, or that the testicles be cut off along with the vessels, so that they are deprived of all nourishment because of the incision of the vessels, and that they are withered, or that they are cut off so that they are no longer nourished.
Chapter 65.
Of the treatment of intestinal hernia.
The occurrence of this hernia is due to a rupture in the extended diaphragm over the abdomen, on the part of the ligaments of the abdominal muscle, causing the intestines from that rupture to be displaced into some other part of the intestines.
And this rupture is either of the diaphragm or of an injury to it, and these two types are caused by many things: either by a blow, or by a fall, or by shouting, or by lifting something heavy, or by similar things.
And the sign of this, when it's due to an extension of the diaphragm, is that it happens gradually over a long time, and not suddenly, and it is a swelling that gradually develops toward the groin because the diaphragm compresses the intestines.
And the sign of it when it is due to a rupture of the diaphragm, is that initially it causes a sudden violent pain; and it is a different kind of swelling apparent beneath the rib cage, and this is due to the extrusion of the intestines, and its body is in parts outside the diaphragm.
And sometimes the intestines are extruded along with the mesentery, and this is called a visceral intestinal hernia.
And sometimes it is caused by flatulence, and sometimes a tear in the intestine occurs, and it is trapped there, and this causes great harm to the patient, and sometimes it produces severe pain, especially when pressed.
And in the treatment of the species of this illness with iron, there is fear, for it is necessary to avoid contact with that.
And the method of the operation for that is to order the patient to return the intestines with their hand to the interior of its cavity if you observe its return, and then place it over their abdomen between your hands, and elevate their legs.
And then hold the scrotum, which is the skin of the testicles, above, and cut the skin of the testicles all along; and then separate the two edges of the incision with forceps, as needed to open the incision with them.
And if the incision, according to the amount that is possible for you, causes the testicle to be expelled.
And then scrape off that tissue which is under the skin of the testicles, until the hard white tissue of each part is exposed.
Then you insert your finger into that which is the testicle, into the white tissue which is beneath the skin of the testicle, and separate the adhesion that is on the back of the testicle.
And then, hold the skin of the testicles outwards, and with that, extend the white tissue upward with your left hand, and raise the testicle with the tissue towards the incision; and instruct the assistant to hold the testicle up, and you dissolve the adhesion behind with a suitable solution.
And check with your fingers that there is no cause of the intestine being wrapped in the hard white tissue. But if you find any cause, then you push it back into the abdomen.
And then cut into the area below the testicles, causing blood and pus to flow as we have described in the previously mentioned section.
And then apply wool soaked in oil, and place it on the wound; and apply the ligature that we have described (and sometimes the white tissue is cauterized, which we mentioned near the incision to prevent blood flow, because this happens often); and leave the ligature until it falls off by itself.
However, if the healing is delayed, then apply warm water, and keep it on there until it falls off, as we have said.
And then treat the wound with other wound treatments until it is healed.
Chapter 66.
Of the wind-caused hernia.
In this hernia, I have not seen anything that was helped by burning it with iron.
And the first ones said that it's done like we described in the hernia that is with wine; which is that you tie the vessels near the incision gently; and then dry the middle area around the abscess with what opens it, until the vessels fall away.
And treat the wound as we have described until it is healed.
Chapter 67.
Of the dislocation that occurs in the joints.
Sometimes there is a rupture in the joints, as we have said, and you should remove the affected area.
And do not leave any cause of the intestines at the groin; and if they do, that is little; and it returns at all times.
But if the time is prolonged with this, a fracture is made in the hip joint until the intestine descends into the hip; and this happens because of the stretching of the hip joint, as we have said, which causes the hip to be stretched, and then it is softened, and the place is inflamed and removed.
And the cure for it is with a cautery, as was previously narrated.
And sometimes it is cured with iron according to this method: the patient lies on their back between your hands, and then the area of the rupture, the inflammations, is dried with a cut across the width, according to the amount of three days.
And then tighten the white hip that is under the thigh until it is uncovered.
And then take the rod and place it on the prominent area of the hip, and press it against the front of the belly.
And then stitch the two prominent spots above the hip's protruding edge together, and join one with the other by means of a suture.
And then pull out the end of the rod, and do not sever the hip completely, nor extend the wound, nor anything else, as I have shown you in the treatment of an intestinal hernia.
And then treat it with the treatment for wounds, and as you would dress an incision, cleanse it and restore the wound until it is healed; for the hip is constricted and the prominence of the rupture has not been corrected.
And cauterization is better in this location, for it is more conducive to health.
Chapter 68.
Of softening the hardness of the testicles.
Often the hardness of the testicles in some men is softened by this, because the tissues surrounding it are softened, and this is a reliable approach to look to.
Therefore, it is necessary for the one tasked with his care to have the patient lie down according to their side, and to separate all the hardened tissue from the natural tissue; and then to stitch the two lips together.
And if you wish, stitch the excess of the softened tissue at the beginning with three or four firm stitches.
And then, cut between the stitches; and then treat according to the treatment for other sores until it is healed and the pus drains.
Chapter 69.
Of castration.
Know that castration, in our law, is forbidden, but because of the need to remember it in this book; and it is only necessary to remember it in two ways, of which one is so that when a doctor is asked about it, they know how to treat it; and the other way is that we often need to castrate other animals for our benefit from them, like oxen, and goats, and pigs, and similar animals.
Therefore I say that castration is done in two ways: either by crushing, or by slitting and cutting.
But in that which is done by crushing, the method of the operation is that we should immerse the beast in hot water until its genitals are softened and relaxed and hang down. And then take them with your hand until they are separated and no longer appear underneath the touching.
But in castration done by slitting and cutting, it is necessary for you to hold the beast and press the scrotum with your left hand.
And then tie the suspensory ligament, and make an incision on each testicle with a cut until both testicles are separated.
And then cut those, after you have peeled each of them. And do not leave on those of the scrotum any cause, except the subtle scrotum that is over the vessels.
And this method of castration is better, which is done by attrition, for strong attrition leaves no cause in the testicles for the beast to desire copulation.
And then treat the wound until it is healed.
Chapter 70.
Of the treatment of hermaphroditism.
Hermaphroditism in men occurs in two ways: one is when there appears a space in the scrotum, between the testicles, resembling a woman's vulva, containing pubic hair.
And sometimes urine flows from that opening in the scrotum.
But in women, there is one type: it is when the vulva of the woman is, like the two testicles of a man, somewhat reduced on the outside in the same manner as a man's foreskin and two testicles.
And the cure is of three types: for two types of men and one type of women. And it is necessary that you cut those adhering flesh until the pressure is relieved, and then treat them with the treatment for other wounds.
And in the second type of men, concerning the urine that is in the scrotum, there is no cure or operation for it.
Chapter 21.
Of lentigo and protruding flesh, due to causes affecting women.
A light lentigo (freckle-like spot) is connected to natural causes until it is pressed and made less conspicuous; and sometimes it becomes so enlarged in some women that it spreads like in men and interferes with intercourse.
Then you should remove the excess lentigo with your hand or tweezers.
And do not overdo the incision, especially at the root of the hair, so that you do not cause a flow of blood.
And then treat it with a treatment for sores until it is healed.
But flesh that arises from within the womb of the mother until it fills that place, and then easily comes out to the exterior parts resembling a tail (and thus some earlier ones called it "tailed illness"); therefore, we should make incisions as we would for lentigo and cure it until it is healed.
Chapter 72.
Of the treatment of a certain illness. (or, more literally, "of the cure of a disease/illness called alratica")
Alratica is a condition where the woman's vagina is not perforated, or the opening is small. And it is either natural or accidental.
Accidental cases are caused by a prior illness, which is brought on either by poorly joined flesh or by a subtle or thick membrane.
And it occurs either in the mother's womb, or in her ribs, or in her upper abdomen, or in her lower abdomen.  It prohibits childbirth, conception, and labor, and strongly prohibits menstruation.
And the diagnosis of this is made by the observation of the midwife, if the blockage is apparent, quickly; but if it is not apparent, then you seek it with your questioning or with an examination.
But if the blockage is by a thin membrane, and it is close to the two lips, then you pierce and break it open.
And you should place powders on the two lips, and then place your index fingers of both hands on top of them.
And the woman should lie on her back, her thighs extended, and then forcefully spread the two lips until that thin membrane is broken and the blockage is opened.
And then take wool, soak it in oil, and place it on the area, and let the patient stay in bed that day so that the incised area does not heal.
But if the membrane is thick and dense, then it is necessary that you cut it with a sharp knife or with a myrtle leaf.
But if the blockage is due to a clot, then suspend that with forceps, and cut it.
And have with you the medicines that stop blood flow without causing biting, such as acacia, dragon's blood, and frankincense, mixed with egg white.
And then administer a wide lead cannula so that the wound does not heal too quickly.
And keep it in place for a few days and apply warm compresses.
And then treat it with further healing remedies until it is healed.
And sometimes it happens in the main nativity of other flesh, and then it is necessary to cut according to this method. However, if this is due to a brain abscess, no metal should be used to treat the brain abscess in any way.
Chapter 73.
Of the treatment of hemorrhoids, and of the tail and red swelling that occurs in the vulva of women.
Hemorrhoids are a condition of the openings of many veins from which a continuous flow of blood runs; and when these hemorrhoids are old and swellings are present...
And I have already discussed the types and symptoms of those (hemorrhoids), and will now describe those that receive treatment and those that do not.
Therefore, I say that hemorrhoids and swellings, when they are deep within and not perceptible to the touch, then no treatment with iron should be attempted for them.
But those which are in the opening (orifice) of the anus, where the touch can sense them, are those that can be cured.
And you should place the woman in a cold place and then carefully cut the swelling with scissors, or a rough cloth, and sever them from their roots.
And then sprinkle upon them the flows of blood from one of the cutting powders without chewing,  like acacia and similar substances.
And then wrap their feet for an hour, and afterwards immerse them in cold water.
And if the flow of blood persists, then put that (the affected area) in a decoction of sumacs, and bark of pomegranates and walnuts, and similar things.
And then take barley flour and mix it with honey and sour wine and make a poultice with this and place it on their back.
And if the blood is stopped, good; and if not, apply two leeches, and to the nipples without incision.
And then take wool and immerse it in the juice of coriander or the juice of arum or the juice of rue with diluted wine, and apply it to the area; and then treat the area with ointments until it is healed.
And treat it until it is healed.
Chapter 74.
Of the piercing of a bone injury in the mother.
Many types of abscesses may occur in the mother, such as cancer, hard abscess, ulcers, tumors, and eruptive sores, fistulas, hemorrhoids, boils, and other abscesses. And I have already described these illnesses and their types, and the signs of them, and their cures in the division.
And it is necessary for me to discuss in this treatise the inflamed abscess that appears in the mother when it collects pus, and if you wish to know how the operation with iron is performed.
Then you must consider if the pain of the abscess in its beginning is sharp with throbbing, phlegm and fever, and if it is accompanied by redness and, when you touch it, you feel sensitivity, then do not use incision, and cure it with what aids maturation until the intensity of the symptoms subsides.
Then, you must have the woman lie on a bed with two stretchers; she should lean on her side and place her feet at the lower part of her abdomen, with her thighs spread apart.  Place her arms under her elbows and tie them securely with suitable bindings.
Then the midwife, standing to the right, administers the instrument with which the opening in the mother's body is made, the form of which will be clear in the steps to follow.
And when you are about to administer this instrument, insert the shaft into the mother's body, ensuring that only the blade of the instrument enters the mother and does not harm the patient. But if the instrument is larger than the mother's opening, then you must place powders over the texture of the mother's opening to prevent any instrument from entering it.
And you must place the lubricant that is on the instrument's shaft on the upper side, and have the attendant hold the instrument and rotate the lubricant until the opening of the mother's body is clear.
And when the discharge appears, and it is touched by the hand and is slippery and moist, then you must dry it, wiping the area around it with a linen cloth.
And once the discharge is removed, you must place a piece of cloth soaked in either rosemary oil or green oil (in which some astringent is mixed) on the wound; and place a poultice over that, covering the area in the mother's opening.
And place outside the mother's opening, and on the perineum, clean wool soaked in water in which mallows have been boiled.
And it should be treated for approximately two days with the ointment appropriate for this until it is healed.
And sometimes the mother's opening and the wound are washed like this: with water and honey, and then with water in which the root of lily or long-stalked iris has been boiled, and then returns to using the ointment.
And if the wound is deep inside the mother's opening, then you must avoid treating it with iron, and instead treat it with what we have discussed in the division.
Chapter 75.
To teach the midwives how to treat living fetuses when their development deviates from the natural form.
It is necessary for the midwife to understand the natural form of childbirth from its signs.  When you see the woman straining downwards, desiring to breathe the air, and she is relieved by the process of birth, and speeds up the delivery of the fetus, then know that this birth is natural.  The expulsion of the fetus will be on its head, and the afterbirth either suspended or hanging from the navel.
Therefore, when you see those signs, the woman's abdomen should be compressed so that the fetus descends easily.  For when it descends on its head, it delivers the afterbirth, which is cleansed of those impurities by proper expulsion.
However, if the birth is unnatural and undesirable, the fetus emerges feet first, with its body emerging before its head and feet.  Or one hand, or foot, or head, or the belly, emerges first.  Its position is severely twisted upon its neck, and the body's form is among the undesirable positions.
Therefore, it is necessary for the midwife to be knowledgeable and skillful in all these matters, and to avoid error and deception.
And I am showing all the forms of these things, and the reason for those forms, so that they can be understood and studied.
When the child is born headfirst through a natural process, and the woman is greatly strained during the difficult birth, and sometimes her strength has already weakened, then let the women have that position.  Soak the child's head with collected fennel and moist oils.
Then the midwife should insert her fingers into the small space and fissure, and with that, separate the placenta, or cut it with her fingernail until she removes the moisture contained within it. And press the woman's abdomen until the fetus descends.
But if it doesn't descend, then the woman should be treated with a poultice of ptilli (likely a type of plant) and a poultice of fennel with cumin.
Then command the patient, the one being treated, to cough and make her sneeze with a spoon; and cover her mouth and nose for an hour, for the fetus will be expelled shortly.
And if the two hands of the fetus are expelled at the beginning, then you must gently reduce them, little by little. But if it does not obey (i.e., the fetus does not return to its proper position), then place the woman on a table (or stool), raise her feet up, and gently move the table towards the ground; and ensure the woman does not fall during the repositioning.
And if the hands are not returned and the fetus dies, then you must cut them and remove any remaining part of the fetus or bind its body to the woman's hand with cloth and remove it evenly, for this will be expelled.
When the fetus is on its feet, you must push it upward, then carefully turn the fetus, gently cradle it, and then take one of its feet and extend it slowly.
But when it has emerged into the thighs, then command it to expel itself, and make it cough with care, for if God wills it, it will be expelled.
And if it is not expelled by what we have recounted, then you must carefully return the fetus to its proper natural position, for then it will be expelled easily.
And if, despite all that we have recommended, it is still not expelled, then take marshmallow and dissolved gum, grind them well in a mortar, and then apply this mixture to the woman's vagina, the lowest part of her abdomen. And then apply this poultice in warm water, until it reaches the hypochondria (the area below the ribs).
And when the parts below her are soothed, then apply a fumigation of myrtle and place it over her. And when the fumigation has lasted an hour, then you have her sit on a stool, and then make her sneeze and press her mouth shut, and remove it, and gently compress the lowest part of her abdomen, for the fetus will soon be expelled.
The fetus emerges lengthwise, hanging from one of its hands. If a reduction of the hand is possible, do it, but if it cannot be reduced, then lift the woman and make her walk.
And if walking is not possible, then have her lie down on the bed, and forcefully compress her thighs, and then administer bandages which I have described, made of mucilages.
And if labor has begun, then have her sit on a stool, and then attempt to reduce the hand, and hold the fetus in its natural position, and make the woman sneeze and instruct her to push until it is expelled.
The fetus lies on its back, with its hands outstretched and its face towards its mother's side. The midwife should hold the baby's hand and gently and carefully turn it.
And when it is positioned correctly, then apply to its forehead what we have described as oil and mucilages.
Then instruct her to push gently, and when you have done that, have her sit on a stool and instruct her to lean to her right side, and then instruct her to push; and make her sneeze with the appropriate instructions. The prepared fetus is positioned on its side.
When the mother's afterbirth is delivered in this manner, observe, and then you cut the afterbirth with your fingernail until the moisture is expelled.
And if the fetus is suspended by the face and neck, then cut the umbilical cord so that it is not retained and dies.
Then push the fetus towards the openings until you place it where it should be, and tell the woman to press herself a few times, and it will be expelled easily, if God wills it.
Delivery of twins or multiple fetuses. Know that twins are born often, and sometimes three or four are born, but this is rare and unusual; however, such things are outside the natural order, and not viable.
And count those, whether they are multiplied, as a second, and separate them by cutting, distinguishing those within the ligament at the umbilical cord of each of them.  And sometimes they are expelled as easily as one fetus by a natural process; and sometimes it occurs by an unnatural process as we have described.
And if some of them are difficult during delivery and reach the point we have discussed regarding unnatural conditions, then treat them as we have described.
And if the midwife is skillful and does this with ease and subtlety, and with patience, and is ingenious according to all the procedures prepared by the ingenious to bring about recovery.
A recollection of that which is formed in the womb from embryos and miscarriages.
Sometimes one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, or even ten are formed in the mother's womb.  It has been verified by me that one woman miscarried six, and another ten, all fully formed, the cause of which was determined by the measurements of the esteemed scholars.
And all this should be within the knowledge of the midwife, for it is easy to recognize that small resemblance to this, and therefore one must act accordingly.
Chapter 76.
Of the extraction of the fetus when it is dead.
When you treat the dead fetus using what we have discussed in the division of medicine, and it has not emerged, and you are forced to use manual operations, then you must consider if the woman is of sound constitution and free from any of the conditions that cause fear of her death.
Then the woman must be positioned on her back on the bed, with her head lowered and her thighs elevated.
And the attendant should hold her on both sides, or she should be bound to the bed, so that her body does not move away from the fetus extraction.
And then you should moisten the mother's mouth with soothing oils and mucilage from marshmallow, fenugreek, and linseed.
And then the midwife should anoint her hand with those oils and mucilages, and then gently insert her hand into the mother, and then search with her hand for the location where she can hook her fingers onto the fetus.
And in suitable locations: then consider if the fetus is positioned so it's ready to descend headfirst, and if so, you should hook your fingers into its neck, or its nape, or its mouth, or the palate, or beneath its chin, or into its crotch, or in the areas near the ribs, or below the hypochondriac regions.
However, if the descent is with the feet first, then in the groin, or in the middle of the back.
And it's necessary that the midwife holds the fingers of her right hand, and positions the curve of her fingertip within the space between the fingers of her left hand, and gently insert her hand and place the fingers in one of those locations we mentioned, until she reaches the empty space.
And then place another finger, or a third if necessary, in opposition to the first, so that the traction is even, and there isn't just pulling in one direction.
And it should be moved gently in all directions, so that the extraction is facilitated, just as is done in the removal of a tooth.
And it is necessary in between these fingers that the stretching be gentle; and if any part of it is retained, then the midwife should anoint some of her fingers with oil and insert them gently and turn to release the retained part.
Therefore, if the part of the fetus is expelled, then the fingers should be repositioned in a higher location; and do this until the entire fetus is expelled.
However, if one hand has emerged before the other, and it is not possible to return it by pressing, then a cloth should be wrapped around it; and then pull it out until it is completely expelled, and cut it either at the wrist joint or at the elbow.
And so it should be done with the other hand and both feet.
However, if the fetus's head is large, or if pressure is applied to it during delivery, or if water has accumulated around the head, then it is necessary to insert fingers between the fetal bones and to break the head and drain the water, or to pierce it with an instrument called an "alundat," the shape of which will be shown with the forms of the other instruments in the chapter immediately following this one.
Similarly, do this if the fetus has a naturally large head; and then it should be incised with a scalpel, or pierced with an alundat as we have said; and then extract the bones with forceps.
And if the head has emerged and is stuck near the pubic bone, then it should be cut until the moisture in the feet is released.
But if it is not complicated, nor resisting delivery, then you should incise the head as soon as possible.
And if the lower part of the abdomen is inflamed or hydrops, then it is necessary to pierce it until the moisture within is released.
But if the fetus is positioned on its feet, then the pulling should be gentle and the direction toward the mother's mouth should be gentle.
But if it is stuck towards the abdomen and the feet, then you must extract it with a cloth wrapped around your hand, and cut the abdomen and the feet until that which is inside flows out.
But if the other limbs have been delivered and the head remains, then the midwife should insert her left hand; but if the mother's mouth is open, then she should insert her hand into the perineum, and search for the head with it, and pull it with those fingers towards the mother's mouth, and then insert a finger, or two fingers, and pull it with those.
And if the mother's mouth is constricted by a hot abscess that has formed there, then it should not be irritated; beforehand, it is necessary to administer an effusion of fatty, moist substances. And apply poultices; and keep the patient in waters that soften and moisturize.
And if the fetus is on its side, then if possible, it should be turned: and what we have said about the living fetus should be administered.
And if that is not possible, then it should be cut into pieces, and extracted.
And it is necessary that you leave no cause within the afterbirth.
And when you have completed all your operation, then administer what we have said about the treatment for abscesses that occur in the mother.
And if a flow of blood occurs, then you should immerse it in astringent waters and administer the other treatment.
And I have already seen a woman in whose belly a stillborn child was made, and shortly after that woman conceived again, and a stillborn child was the result. A long time ago, an abscess occurred near his navel; and it swelled until it was opened, and began to discharge pus.
And I was called to treat him, and I medicated him for a long time, and the wound did not heal.
Then I placed some strong-drawing plasters on him, and a bone came out, and after a few days, another bone came out; and I was greatly amazed, as there are no bones inside the belly.
And then I thought that they were bones from the stillborn child.
Then I cleaned the wound, and removed many bones from him, the woman being in her usual condition, and she lived in this way for a long time, with only a little discharge of pus.
And I did not consider this to be strange, but rather that it is knowledge and assistance in what the skilled physician administers with their hands for healing.
Of the forms of instruments that are necessary to extract the fetus.
Form of twisting with which the mother's body is opened:
This is the form of tightening in which the books are bound, to which binding there are two twists at the two ends of two straps. However, this twist should be more subtle than tightening, and should be made either of linen or of wooden sticks.
And the width of each stick is about two fingers, and the edge of each about one finger; and the length of each is one and a half palms; and in the middle of the two sticks are two joinings of the same sticks, which are already fastened, whose length is half a palm and a little more, and the width of each is about two fingers, or a little more.
And these two additions are inserted into the mother's mouth so that it is opened with them when you revolve the two prescribed twists.
Another form similar to that, more subtle and lighter:
It should be made of linen or wooden sticks, resembling forceps. However, at its extremity, there are two additions, just like before; the length of these additions is about one palm, and the width of each is two fingers.
And when you want to open the mother with these, then you have the woman lie on the bed with her feet hanging down, opening the space between her thighs. And then open your hand with the instrument, just as you would with scissors,  to the desired extent, according to the size of the opening of the mother's womb, until the midwife performs what is desired.
The method of twisting, which the ancients said:
Method of pushing with which the fetus is pushed:
Method of assistance/helping with which the large head is contained.
And it is similar to forceps, which has teeth at the extremity, as is sometimes the case, and sometimes it is made long like forceps, following this form, as is sometimes the case, which has teeth like the teeth of a saw, with which it is incised and contained. Method of slight assistance/helping:
Method of a hook having a spine/point:
Method of a hook having two spines/points.
Method of a spatula having two ends with which the head is severed/cut off.
Method of two wide spatulas.
All those instruments, and the more the species of those are multiplied and prepared by the craftsmen, the more light their operation is and the more valuable they are to men because of their quantity.
And do not neglect those instruments, wherever they may be, for you, for the need for them is unexcusable.
Of the extraction of the afterbirth.
When the afterbirth is retained after childbirth, then you must instruct the woman to hold her breath, and then make her sneeze with some means, and firmly press your hand on her mouth and nostrils, and if by this it is expelled, it is good.
And if not, then you take a bowl and pierce a hole in its cover, and place in it herbs—opening the mouth of the mother—such as calamint, rue, anise, chamomile, arabic cicada, cassia lignea, and St. John's wort. All of these herbs, or some of them, are submerged in water in the bowl, and place that over the fire.
And then place a reed tube into the mother's mouth, and hold it there until the vapor reaches the mother's cavity.
And then make her sneeze, as we have said, and the afterbirth will be expelled quickly.
But if this treatment remains ineffective and the afterbirth is not expelled, then you order the midwife to immerse her left hand in sesame oil or in a mixture of marshmallow root, and then introduce it into the vagina and search for the afterbirth with it.  And once she has found it, take it and pull it out slowly.  But if it is attached to the mother's cervix, then introduce her hand as we have described, and when she has found the afterbirth, pull it out slowly, following the correct procedure, so the mother does not suffer from excessive traction. Beforehand, it should be moved easily to the right and left sides.
And if the mother's cervix is constricted, we have already described the treatment using sneezing and applying herbal poultices.
But if it is not expelled using all the methods we have described, be careful not to exert excessive force. However, what has emerged from her into the mother's cervix must be placed in the woman's thigh, and then treat it with ointment and a four-ingredient remedy. This will cause it to decompose over a few days, and it will dissolve and be expelled.
However, when it decomposes, a foul odor rises to the head and stomach, and this weakens the patient; therefore, it is necessary to administer inhalations and appropriate remedies for this.
However, some of the ancients have already tested inhalations of dried nasturtiums and figs.
Method of the instrument with which the woman is inhaled for retained menses and afterbirth:
It should be made of glass or earthenware.
And place the narrow end in the patient's nose and the wide end over the fire, and the inhalation should be held over the flames.
And hold it until the inhalation is consumed and then repeat another.
Of the treatment of the child's unperforated anus.
Many children are born with their anuses unperforated, which are then extremely narrow and closed. Therefore, the midwife should pierce that narrowness with her finger; and if not, pierce it with a sharp instrument, and be careful not to touch the sphincter.
Then place some wool soaked in wine and oil over it; and then treat it with ointment until it is healed.
But if you fear it is obstructed, then insert a small tube into the opening for several days, and remove it when the child wants to suckle.
And blockage of the anus may occur due to consolidation of a plague or an abscess; then it is necessary that this consolidation be incised, and then treated with what we have said about the treatment and lead.
Of the treatment of fistulas that develop afterward.
Fistulas that develop in the lower part,  swollen and thick,  which develop near the anus externally or in the space of the one part [of the body].
And it is a fistula or boils.
And when that swelling is old and arises from watery, white moisture or a subtle pus, and sometimes these fistulas are also penetrating.
And those penetrating ones are known for what comes out of them through discharge and windiness; and sometimes the patient experiences discharge, and worms come out of them.
And sometimes these fistulas penetrate into the bladder and into the opening of the penis; and some of these penetrating ones reach the joint of the thigh and the marrow of the hip.
And what distinguishes a penetrating fistula from a non-penetrating one in the anus is that you should insert your index finger into the anus, and gently insert a thin probe of ramrod or iron into the fistula if there is no twist or obstruction.
But if there is a twist or obstruction, then insert a thin probe of lead or horsehair until you feel the probe or hair on your finger.
And if you do not feel any of this at all, nor does any discharge, worms, or windiness come from the opening, as we have said, then know that it is non-penetrating, and then proceed with the treatment.
And when the fistula penetrates into the bladder or into the opening of the penis, then the symptom is continuous urination and this is forbidden until the area is healed with medicine.
But if it penetrates into the joint of the thigh or into the bone, and pain arises around the area, then the sign is that the probe goes in there if there is no twist or obstruction into the bone, and pain arises around the affected part; and that this will probably remain for a long time; and that no medicine will help in this case, nor will it be healed with ointment.
And in all those penetrating fistulas, there is no complete cure, and the cure for these is the work and vanity of the foolish doctors upon whom you rely.
But in the one that is not penetrating and not old, healing with iron is hoped for, as I will tell you, and this is something that I have already tested.
And the patient should lie between your hands on their back, and raise their legs upwards, their thighs being bent towards their stomach, and then gently insert a lead probe, or a probe of similar material if there is a twist in the fistula, until you know the place where the probe goes in.
And if the patient feels the pain around the groin, then you should insert your finger into the groin.
And if, with your finger, you feel the probe already penetrating on its own, or if you feel something between your finger and that flesh or tissue, then know for certain that it is penetrating; and therefore do not work on that, for there is no cure for it, as we have said.
But nevertheless, some might say that it is cured in some men after a while.
And the treatment through which recovery is expected is that you use a fine cautery, according to the width of the fistula, as previously described, and insert that heated cautery into the fistula until it reaches around the groin; and then repeat this two or three times until you know that all those flesh tissues that are connected within the fistula-like a bird's feather quill- have been cauterized.
Then treat it with some bandages until all the tissues that were cauterized have healed, and then treat it with healing and consolidating medicines. If it is healed, that is good; and if not, it will never be healed by any other treatment.
And if the probe enters, but does not penetrate to your finger in the groin, and between that and the probe is a thick layer of flesh or tissue, and the fistula is found where it touches the surface of the membrane, then cut the membrane from the beginning of the fistula.  You must cut along with the probe, and keep the probe inside the fistula until the incision reaches the point where the probe's end is, and the probe is removed and discarded.
And then cleanse those fistula-affected tissues, which are gathered together like the quill of a bird's feather, and leave no cause of concern from those.
However, if blood flow occurs between you and your procedure when you cauterize those tissues, then the best and most immediate instrument is to cauterize with fire or with a sharp medicine, for cauterization with fire performs two important functions: it cauterizes the affected tissues, and it also removes the blood and excess moisture.
And then treat it with bandages or strips of cloth until the wound is closed, and then treat the sore with ointments that promote the healing and consolidation of firm flesh.
And those remedies, which include astringency and removal; when it is thus restored, it is healed and you need not fear a recurrence.
However, if the fistula extends to the anus and is distant from the body's surface, then insert your finger into the anus and investigate with it.
And therefore, if you feel resistance and between you and it there is a membrane or flesh, and it is suitable for penetration, then there is no operation there, but rather a treatment based on trust and hope.
Which problem can be addressed in one of three ways: either cauterize it as we have said; or cut it until you reach its cavity, so that you can insert remedies and promote healing; and do not perform too much cutting, so that you do not injure the surrounding tissue and cause further harm to the patient without their consent; then treat it with what we have previously said, because a strong wound will be healed; or extend the membrane and clean the pus that comes from the incision near the anus, as we have said, either with a probe or another instrument with a sharp tip, and then clean the fistulous flesh that is in the incision, until you can achieve a crust; and then you should strive to restore the entire wound with removal, and if the opening above is not healed and the fistula remains open in the anal region, it will be easier for the patient. And sometimes the fistula ends in this way: when you insert the probe into the fistula and it is located in the fold of the anus close to the body's surface, with the edges of the anus, then take a probe with a pointed end, which is like a needle prepared to treat these cases in this form:
and insert into it a probe wrapped with five threads or around them; and then insert the probe with a thread into the fistula until it reaches the cavity.
However, if it penetrates the edge of the anus near the interior, then you remove the thread from that hole, as if you were inserting your finger into the anus; and remove the end of the thread, and join the two ends together, and tighten each, and leave it for a day or two; and whenever you cut the thread into the flesh, tightly squeeze it until the flesh between the two ends of the thread is cut and falls away.
And then treat the wound until it is healed and cured.
But if the opening of the fistula is not penetrating, then make it penetrate, in whatever way is prepared for you, but not too deeply, because it is not for you to do this so that you do not injure the flesh; and then treat it until it is healed.
The shape of the probe with which the fistula is probed: the curve of which is very sharp, and the other part is not sharp, so as not to injure what is unnecessary, as sometimes happens.
Of the suturing of hemorrhoids in which blood flows in the incision of them.
Hemorrhoids are of two types, for either they are between the buttocks resembling bunches of grapes, or they are like bunches of grapes. And of those there are small and large, and the blood flows from them continuously and is single, and multiple, and are outside the anus, and at its extremities.
However, those that are outside the anus are according to the seasons of little moisture, from which flows pale yellow water or a little blood with continuous oozing, and it is according to the color of the substance.
And the treatment for those inside the anus is to tell the patient to sit down and strain until the anus opens and the hemorrhoids appear to you. Then you grasp and lift them with tweezers or nails, and afterwards cut them off at their roots.
However, if the tweezers are not able to grasp them due to their moisture and softening, then take them with a rough cloth or cotton or a piece of wool, and pull them out with your fingers. Then cut them off and sprinkle some warm powders over the cuts, so that they act as a cautery; or cauterize them according to what is prescribed in the chapter on cauterization. And then treat them with the other treatment until they are healed.
And if the anus does not yield to the effort, then stimulate the patient with a cristerium (a small, sharp implement) which has a biting edge, and wash it with whatever is in the anus, so that the anus yields to the patient's straining somewhat easily.
However, if the hemorrhoids are outside the anus, then the cause is minor, and you should grasp them with your finger or with tweezers, and cut them, then treat them with what we have said until they are healed.
And for any incisions, you should apply sutures to them in this manner: take a folded thread, thread it through a needle, and then pull the hemorrhoids apart, and use the needle to pierce the root of the other part. Wrap the two ends of the thread together at the part below the needle, and do so transversely. Tightly constrict the hemorrhoid with the suture, and then tie the thread and remove the needle.
Do this for all of them, and leave one (hemorrhoid) and don't suture it, so that excess blood can drain from that one.
And then place a cloth soaked in warmed oil or ointment on the anus; place it over the anus and instruct the patient to rest. And then leave it until it subsides; and when it has settled, treat them with ointments or other remedies until healed.
And if they are old and not helped by that medicine, then you must scrape them with the point of a spatula or with your fingernail until they are moist and the scab of pus on top, which prevents them from healing, is removed; and then treat them until they are healed.
Then you scrape them with a more forceful scraping than the first until much blood comes and they are scraped clean; and then treat them until they are healed.
Know that alamermar is key, and it is a round spot, according to the color of the body, similar to a clove's head. It is found throughout the body, but especially in the parts below the feet and on the fingers, and because of it, the pain should be treated accordingly.
And then it is necessary to cut what is around the spot, and hold it with forceps or tweezers, and remove it from its root; and then treat that area.
And if you wish, cauterize it according to what is described earlier in its chapter.
But a wart is a small, rough, fistulous, round prominence on the body's surface, and it frequently appears on the hands of children.
And its treatment is to scrape and cut that area, or to squeeze it with a file or a needle until it bursts. And if you wish, cauterize this, as we have said, with fire or with a sharp medicine.
But a pimple is a small, inflamed or ulcerated, large prominence on the surface of the body, often occurring on the face.  When cold touches it, a sensation similar to an ant bite is felt, and it is spread around the body.
And the treatment for it is to take a hollow tube, like the quill of a bird of prey, strong, and place it over the pimple until it encompasses the circle of the pimple. Then rotate your hand with the tube until you cut what is around the pimple, and press it into the flesh so that you eradicate the pimple from its roots.
And if you wish, do this with a tube of horn or iron in this manner:
The part of the tube above the opening should be thin, closed (that is, unperforated), wrapped so that the grip on it is smoothed and its rotation is facilitated.
And if you wish to cauterize the pimple, do so as described previously in the cauterization of boils in the chapter on cauterization.
Of the forms of instruments that are used for giving cauterization.
Sometimes cauterization is done with silver or bronze or molten or hammered horn; and sometimes it is done with small and large instruments, depending on those to which they are applied, for the one used in treating small children should be small, and for those whose buttocks are sore or painful, the cauteries should be small.
The form of a large and small cautery:
The head of its cannula, on which the pouch is tied, should be wide in this manner; and there should be a distinct marking where the pouch is tied, just as usual.
And the lower end of it, which is inserted into the anus, should be closed (that is, not open) very tightly, approaching thinness; and on one side of it there should be two holes, and on the other side one hole, and the size of the holes should correspond to the thickness of the rays, and one slightly larger than the rest.
And the pouch, in which the bladder medicines are placed, be it of an animal's bladder or sheepskin, and its opening should be one palm.
And it should be pierced with many holes, as if it were being twisted; and if the space between the holes is the thickness of a finger.
And then insert into those holes strong, pure, or roughly ten-fold strong fiel (likely a medicinal substance), or roughly that amount; and attach the pouch to that. And when the pouch is placed, tightly secure the head of the apparatus between two distinguishing points with strong constriction, and then seal each hole with it. However, the way of sealing with it is such that you fill the pouch with the medicine, which should be heated according to the patient's tolerance; and be careful that it is neither too hot nor too cold.
And then the patient should lie on their back, and raise their legs, and place a sheet beneath them, on which are already blankets or a cloth; and then anoint the end of the cautery with oil or egg white or fenugreek mucilage or something similar; and then insert that into the anus with ease, and then the attendant should take the pouch and squeeze it with both hands forcefully until everything in the apparatus has been emptied into the intestine; and then remove the apparatus, and the patient should lower their legs to the wall.
And if the medicine forces it to do so, hold it as long as possible; and if he sleeps with it all night, it is better for recovery.
But if you cauterize it for illnesses of looseness of the belly and its expulsion, then you repeat the cautery until it is cured.
And if there are hemorrhoids or festering sores in the anus, then the apparatus should be very fine and narrow, like the instruments with which children are cauterized.
Of the treatment of plagues.
I have already said in the division of the treatment of plagues what was appropriate for the book, and I say thus: the treatment of those with hand and with medicines according to their progression.
Therefore, I say that plagues are diversified according to how the plagues are caused and according to the location upon which the plagues appear.
And the causes by which plagues are often caused are like the throwing of a stone, or the incision of a space or with a knife, or a blow with a spear, or with a stick, or with an arrow, or similar to those from many causes.
But the plagues that are in the locations of the body are like a plague that falls upon the head, or the neck, or the feet, or the belly, or the liver, and similar to those of the members.
And I am recounting the treatment of certain plagues, so that you may place that reasoning and rule upon the other plagues.
And I will begin with the simple plagues of the head, for the remembrance of the compound ones will come at the beginning of the third chapter.
Therefore I say that when a simple plague occurs on the head, and it is not a fracture, then consider: if it is from a thrown stone or similar, and the skull has only been fractured slightly, and it is a serious wound and you fear the onset of a hot abscess in the patient, then you should immediately apply leeches and bleed the cephalic vein, and do not delay this; and extract from him the blood according to his strength, if no other cause prevents bloodletting, especially if the blood that has issued from the wound is scant.
And let the bloodletting be on the opposite side of the wounded part; and keep the patient from repletion and from wine and heavy foods.
But if some cause forbids the use of bloodletting, then the diet should be reduced, and he should not approach meat or wine.
And if a hot abscess arises on the wound, apply a poultice of roasted olive oil or wine with something astringent in it.
But if you are sure it's a hot abscess, then apply to the wound, if recent, its own blood, and if the air hasn't changed it, the powder I will recommend shortly.
And if the air has already changed it, then apply some ointments until it is healed.
But if the wound is large or caused by a cut/laceration and its edges are not brought together by sutures, then bring those together with stitches, as I will recommend in my section on stitches.
However, if the wound has already exposed the bone and tendon, and there is no retention but a slight displacement, then you should cut through that and then heal the wound with medicines and restore the flesh, approximately in the manner of a splint.  Then tell the patient to eat foods containing fat:  heads of various kinds of fish and similar foods, until it is completely healed.
And if you find putrefaction in the splint and it doesn't adhere to the bone, then you should cut away all the putrid material and discard it, and then treat it.
But if in these wounds there is an artery or vein from which blood may flow, and it has not been severed by medicine, then you should look for the artery, and if you find it not severed, then you should cut or tie it.  And if necessity requires that what we have said does not work, then you should cauterize it until the bleeding stops.
And if these wounds are simple and small, then their cause is slight; therefore, you should sprinkle this powder on them, for it will solidify them before the air changes them.
And the method for the powder is this: take one part of olive oil, two parts of dragon's blood, and three parts of unquenched lime; have all of this finely ground and sifted.  Then fill the wound with it, and tightly bind it until it adheres well, and is clotted with the blood.
Then bandage it firmly with dressings and leave it, and do not loosen it until it is suppurated, for the medicine will not be effective until it has healed.
And sometimes this works alone, when you do not have frankincense and dragon's blood present.
And you perform this same operation on large wounds when it is appropriate to apply it and bind them, and for fresh wounds with their own blood, which the air has not altered.
And if the air has altered them, especially in summer, then the application of this powder is not suitable.  Instead, treat them with what we have said previously.  You may apply digestive ointments, or a powder of barley flour mixed with water and honey, until a scab forms; then treat them with the other remedies until they are healed.
But if the wound involves a fractured bone, and it is small, then you extract it with care.
And I will describe the treatment of head fractures in what follows.
Of the wounds of the neck.
But if the wound occurs on the neck, there is no difference in treatment from a simple wound of the head.
However, if the neck wound involves the nerve or artery, if it's a nerve, it's not to be treated with anything that causes strong astringency, like alum and vitriol and similar substances, as they harm the nerves and aggravate the condition. And do not apply anything cold to the wound, because the substance of the nerves is cold and their connection is to the brain, which is the highest of all the limbs.
And if it is treated with mild remedies, such as washing with soft water, sometimes infused with rosined or un-rosined oil, and with poultices when washed with soft water and other similar softening stones following this method, and humid ointments.
But if the wound is large, then apply sutures, or close its edges, and then treat it with powders until it is healed.
But if the wound is deep or has reached the lowest part of the underlying tissue, then pierce it in the lowest point.
But if an artery has been cut in the wound and blood is flowing, then separate or tie off that artery, or cauterize it if necessary.
But if the vertebrae of the neck or all of them have been cut, and the veins of the neck are preserved, then you should rejoin the edges of the wound with sutures along the spine of the neck, and do not touch that; first align it and return it to its natural shape, then hold it with a proper bandage, and leave it for a few days; and then treat it with ointments which have astringent and stimulating properties until it is healed.
But if the wound has affected the bone significantly, then you must treat it, and if there are bone fragments, remove all that you can; and what you are not able to remove, leave it until the wound purulent and the separation of the tissue is eased.
And if the wound is recent, then powder it with the powder that is recommended to you. But if a fistula has formed in the wound, then treat it with what is mentioned in the relevant chapter.
If it is a stab wound from a spear or knife, and the depth is considerable, then consider further if there is air coming from the wound when the patient exhales; then know that the wound is mortal.
And if the wound is not deep and recent with its own blood, then you place on it, from the first hour, powder, and do not press it so that the blood is not trapped in the depth of the wound and returns to the heart, killing the patient, but rather place on it an attractive ointment, and apply it twice a day.
And if the ointment is not available, then you place in the wound opening old cotton so that it absorbs the humidity; and make the patient sleep on the wound so that anything that is in the wound will drain out.
But if three days or more have passed since the wound, and the patient does not experience spasms, tremors, or bad heart conditions, or constriction of the airways, and the other signs are good, then know that the wound is salvageable; and then cure it with herbs and other treatments until it is healed.
But if healing is impossible, and the wound has remained open for a long time, then know that a fistula has formed; therefore, cure it according to its specific treatment.
And if the wound is from a cut with a knife or sword, and is simple on the surface of the foot or back, then treat it with stitches if it is large, or with powder if it is small.
But if the wound has already affected the bone, and visible pieces of bone have already been cut, then you should clean the wound and try to remove those pieces if they are loose. But if they are not loose, then leave them until the wound can heal, because removing them would be too painful.
And for other wounds on other limbs, the treatment is the same as what we have described.
Of wounds of the abdomen.
The ailment which afflicts the abdomen is either severe, or mild, or moderate.
And a small rupture is difficult to repair in a different way, and it is known that their reduction is more difficult if you don't carefully return them to their place immediately, because if it opens and swells, the reintroduction is made difficult.
Therefore, the best rupture is a moderate one, for in that one the reduction of the bowel is not difficult, as it is in the two previously mentioned types.
And know that the suturing of the abdomen is done according to four methods, but two sutures are common and appropriate for sutures of other wounds in the body.
And two other sutures are appropriate for other wounds, but nonetheless more specific to the suturing of the abdomen.
And I will explain each one to you with explanation and declaration.
Therefore, I say that when the wound is small and some part of the bowel has come out through it, and it is difficult to reduce it, then this is in one of two ways: either due to the smallness of the rupture, as we have said, or when the bowel has become inflamed due to the coldness of the air.
And therefore, when this is the case, you should warm it in such a way that you immerse a sponge or damp cloth in lukewarm water alone, or that you soak it in water with cumin, and cyperus, and spic, and apply it to the bowel until the inflammation is resolved.
And sometimes, doing this with a styptic, it is better than water alone in resolving the inflammation.
And therefore, when you see the inflammation resolved, then you moisten the bowel with water in which althea and mallows have been boiled, for by this the inside of it is relieved with little effort.
But if the inside of it is not relieved by this treatment, then carefully cut the rupture a little with an instrument with which hemorrhoids are cut.
And the first treatment is better, when it is proper and does not involve cutting, and there should be no need to resort to cutting for the sake of necessity and weakness.
Of the instrument, describe its shape:
One part of it is sharp, and the other part is blunt, and the tip is slender, but not as slender as a needle; rather, it is a little blunt.
And therefore, if the wound is enlarged and the intestine is outside, then its reduction should be according to its natural shape, in its proper place, if possible, for that is better.
But when the rupture is large, and it is in the lower part of the abdomen, then you must have the patient lie on their back, and raise their legs higher than their head; and if it is in the upper part of the abdomen, then you should raise the head and feet higher than the lower parts of the body.
And similarly, if the rupture is in one of the two parts of the abdomen, then constantly direct your attention and consideration to this, so that the part where the wound is is higher than the other.
And thus you should administer this in large and medium wounds.
And in small wounds, place what you have prepared, and then have the assistant hold the rupture with their hand, close the edges, and then uncover it for whoever is doing the sutures for some other reason.
And this is the common method of suturing: one takes the needle, or several needles according to the size of the wound; then bring it out from the edge of the rupture, and hold the needle taut, ensuring you do not insert the thread in the two ends of the suture, with the two ends of the thread that are beneath the suture on the inside portions, until you've pushed it through that part; and you have already brought together the two ends of the suture and the two ends of the thread, making four knots.
And then tighten with double thread around the needle, sometimes from two sides at once, and then bring the two edges together and close the wound in a fitting way; and then leave the thickness of the finger and insert another needle, and then tie it with thread just as you did with the first needle; and do not cease doing this with needles if it is necessary until you have closed the whole wound.
And the needles should be medium in size, between thick and thin, for thin needles easily pierce the flesh, and thick ones are difficult to thread, therefore they should be medium in thickness and thinness.
And it is not appropriate to insert the needle into the two ends of the thread too close, so that the flesh is not pierced easily and the wound opens up before it heals.
And do not prolong the sutures, so that the wound is not hindered from healing.
And then cut the ends of the needles so that they do not prick the patient during their sleep; and place on the suture powders spread out on all sides, which hold the ends of the needles; and leave them until you know that the wound has already healed.
And this method of suturing with needles is most suitable for small wounds, for one or two needles, or so, suffice for their stitching.
However, the second suture is more common:  and it is that you stitch the four ends of the thread and the two ends of the [piece of cloth/material], at once, with a needle which is tightly wrapped in a subtlety and thickness that [are] appropriate.
And then, when you have pierced these four ends with the needle, withdraw the needle from the same part from which you began, so that the thread pulls back from the most superior part to the wound, so that the stitching is like the sewing of a cloth with which the cloths are fastened together.
And place between each stitch the thickness of the little finger.
And this stitching is known by men.
And with this type of stitching, I closed the wound which had happened to a man in his belly, who had been wounded with a knife, and the tear in the wound was more than a palm, and the intestines had come out about two palms from the middle part and the rupture was in the middle of the member; and then I returned that portion which the intestine had been outside the wound for 24 hours.
And the wound was consolidated in the space of fifteen days or so, and I cured him and he was healed; and afterward he lived for many years, and is known for his good condition/health.
And the other doctors had judged that he would not be healed; and by miracle it was, for I did not treat him with ointments, for it was in a place where no ointment or any medicine was found, but I placed old linen on the wound twice a day and washed it diligently with honey water until he was healed.
But I will describe two kinds of stitches appropriate, according to the narration of Scripture/the Word (of God).
And it is that you begin with a stitch from the outside edge, and insert the needle from the outer part to the inner part.
And thus, as the needle pierces the edge and the same laceration in a straight line, and along the entire length of the wound, and leaves the end of the thread where you have inserted the needle; and push the needle from the inside to the outside on the other end of the wound.
And when you have made that penetration, then you make that penetration again on that same wound edge from outside to inside; and leave the end of the thread that is on this side, and insert the needle into the other end of the wound from inside to outside.
And make that penetration with your penetration, with which you make the penetration in the thread at the wound end that is on his side until all of that penetrates.
And then begin on this same side and stitch it with the end of the thread on the other side, and remove the needle from the wound it pierced, and then return it to that wound and stitch the end of the thread that is on the other side with this end of the wound; and remove it from the wound that is on his side.
And do this once and again, and do this once and again until you have sewn everything on the outside according to that example.
And the sum of this manner of suturing is that you stitch with a skin stitch, with which you sew skin, in such a way that you stitch the thread one time from the wound's edge, and leave the other time until you have completed it.
However, the second type of stitch, which you correctly call Gaulish, and which is spoken of by him and recounted by him, is that you stitch it according to a similar method with which some healers stitch it, so that they gather every part to its comparable part on him appropriately by nature; and they apply the other end of him and the end of the wound to the other end of him, and this is done according to what I have recounted to you.
You should insert the needle into the edge of the wound close to the outer part, and make it penetrate to the inner part of that same wound, and leave two ends of the thread; and then turn the needle and make it penetrate from the outside to the inside at two ends of the thread.
And then turn each of those, and make each penetrate from the inside to the outside at two other edges of the wound, opposite to those already in the knot.
And this method of suturing is better than the ordinary, superficial stitch, and it is the stitch of which I have previously spoken.
This is the Gaulish method.
And yet some might say, the suturing of the belly is corrected with two needles, which means that you place a thread in each, and begin with the insertion of the needle from your side, and make it penetrate to the other side, following the stitching of those who sew the skins equally.
And know that when the rupture is in the middle of the belly, then the suturing of it is more difficult than in other parts of the belly.
But the judgment of the treatment of plague is the judgment of the other plagues.
Which means that when you catch the plague early, before the air alters it, and return the intestine to its place and sew it up and properly treat it, then place a flesh-healing powder on it.
And if the air has already altered the plague, then apply to it some ointments that are at your disposal until they form hard stone and the threads are consolidated and checked, and then treat it just as is the cure for other plagues until it is healed.
But if you do not have the necessary medicines available, then immediately apply to it, once it begins to discharge pus, old cloth, and change it twice a day, as you have been taught, until it is healed, for you will not need other medications in many cases when the plague is uncomplicated.
But if you fear that the plague might spread to the major limbs, then you should soak lion's wool in oil of good quality, or in rubbed oil, and place it around the areas between the armpits and under the arms.
And if pain or putrefaction is felt in their intestines, as often happens, then treat it with strong, black wine, especially if the swelling has spread to the intestine and caused a penetrating rupture into the cavity.
And know that the one that is in the large intestine is easier to heal than the one in the small intestines.
And it is difficult to heal, for the intestine called the "jejunum" does not receive healing from any plague that enters it; and this is due to the large number of veins in it, the size of the area they occupy, the thinness of its structure, and its close proximity to the nature of the nerves.
But if the result of the plague is a lump, and you get hold of that lump, reduce it according to the method you use to reduce hernias.
But if it has spread to the surrounding area and is already green or black, then you should apply a poultice of hot iron on the area darkened by it, so that blood flows out, because in the tissue there are veins and arteries.
And then cut whatever is connected to that ligament, and suspend the two ends of the poultice from below the affected area, so that the pull of the mass from the affected tissue and the expulsion of the plague's limb are lessened.
Remembering the plagues when they occur in the intestine.
When a rupture occurs in the intestine, and it is small, it is possible that it can be repaired in some people.  For this reason, I have seen a person who had been wounded in their belly by a lance blow, and the wound was on the right side of the stomach.  The wound was old and had formed a fistula, and gas and wind were escaping from it.
Then I considered the cure of the patient, although I wasn't confident in the outcome of their recovery, but I proceeded to treat the wound until it healed and the area was consolidated.
And since I saw the area healed, I monitored the patient for any further problems in their abdomen.  No further problems occurred, and they remained in good condition, eating and drinking, and soon returned to bathing and physical activities.
And some experienced people have said that when a wound occurs in the intestine, and it is small, then it should be bound in this way: You should take large-headed leeches; then bring the two edges of the wound together and place one of these leeches with its mouth open onto the two edges of the wound.  Then, when it has adhered and closed its mouth, cut off its head, for it has adhered and is not released.
Then place another leech near the first, and continue doing this with leeches, one next to another, according to the extent of the entire wound.
And then you remove them and close the wound.  Those leech heads remain attached to the intestine until the intestine heals, and no harm comes to the patient.
And it is also possible to bind the intestine with a fine thread made from an animal's intestine, if it's available, by threading it on a needle; you take the thin end of this intestinal thread, and tightly wrap the thread around the end, then thread it onto a needle and sew the intestine with it, and then return the intestine into place.
And this method of suturing with leeches is only a way of trust and hope.
However, if the wound is large and extensive, especially if it is in one of the delicate intestines, because then there is no cure, only a lessening of the harm, and no complete healing.
Of the treatment of sores and fistulas.
Know that every wound and abscess, as it ages and becomes an ulcer, and is not healed and constantly discharges pus and is not incised, then, wherever on the body it may be, it is universally called a fistula and we call it a sore.
And a fistula, in truth, is a hardened, tough, white swelling, with no pain, and has a cavity like the cavity of a bird's nest; and therefore that ulcer is called a "rized ulcer", i.e., a nest.
And in some people it is moist, discharging pus; and readily the moisture is incised in a few hours. And sometimes this moisture is thick, and is little, and is large, and is thin.
I have already shown all those causes, and the signs of them, and their treatment with medicines in the division.
And it is fitting that I make known to you the treatment of fistula, which is done by surgery with the hand.
And know that fistula occurs in all parts of the body; for there are fistulas that reach large veins and arteries, or nerves, or the spinal cord, or the intestines, or the bladder, or some of the ribs, or some of the spinal vertebrae, or some of the compound joints such as those of the hand and foot; and those that damage areas close to the main limb and similar parts.
Therefore, those fistulas that are of this type are among the illnesses of difficult healing, and do not readily receive treatment; and to attempt treatment with them is laborious and a waste of time.
And if any fistula's depth does not reach these places I have mentioned, and you hope and trust in its treatment, and desire to gain knowledge of it, then take a probe or iron, and if the fistula runs in a straight path, follow it with the probe.
But if the fistula is winding, then investigate it with a probe of fine lead, for lead, with the lightness of its nature, is easily bent and guided towards the winding path.
And if the fistula has many horrific obstructions, it is not possible for you to trace it with a probe.
Then irrigate the openings with their orifices, for the moisture you irrigate with goes towards the other openings and flows through them.
And then carefully investigate, in whatever way you can, to determine if there are bones or nerves, and whether the fistula's cavity is distant or near, or if it is a fistula with many openings and is located there among all these things, using your full strength, questioning, your inquiries into the patient, and seeking the source of the pain through the pressure of your hand on the affected area, and by considering the meanings and accidental causes of the abscess.
And when you have considered all those factors with true observation, then proceed to the treatment according to your understanding: and you must consider whether the fistula is a superficial, close-by one, or if it is located in a salt-like area, far from a joint, or a nerve, an artery, a vein, or one of the locations that I have mentioned to you.
Then you should dry the fistula as previously described in the account, and remove anything that is in that filtration and corrupt flesh, and whatever has formed in the opening of the flesh, or of the boil and similar things, and treat it until it is healed.
However, if the fistula is deep and located in a hidden area, then it should be incised as deeply as possible, and afterwards cleaned of all its corrupted flesh.  Then apply some medicated dressings, sharp medicines, and insert them into the fistula's cavity, which you have exposed by cutting.
And do this repeatedly until the sharp medicine removes all that remains of the corruption within the fistula's cavity.
And then restore it with ointments that generate healthy flesh until it is healed.
But if it is not healed by this, then you should cauterize it as we have described.
But if the cause of the fistula is bone, and you are certain of this, then you should investigate and cauterize it as described, if you do not find any vein, nerve, or other important body part in the way, as we have said.
But if the bone is exposed and there is any corruption or blackness on it, then you scrape it until all the corruption is removed; and then heal it with something that promotes flesh growth until it is healed.
And if it is not healed and breaks out again as before, then know that you have not achieved complete eradication of the corruption; and then you should expose it again thoroughly, carefully scraping and cleaning it with all your strength, and then restore it.
And if it is healed, that is good; but if not, then know that that corruption is in a deep, distant part of the body, which has not been reached, and therefore you have no other choice but to leave it.
And if the corrupted bone is small, or it is possible for you to pull it out, then you pull it out with fine forceps appropriate for this.
And if there are many bones, then carefully remove all of them, and leave nothing behind with your strength.
But if you encounter any difficulty due to the humors, and in their incision there is no fear or error, then cut those ligaments or flesh if there is any, and free the bones.
But if you are not prepared to remove the bones immediately, then place on the wound something that might heal that wound, and leave it until there is a substantial amount of flesh and ligament around those bones, and make sure the wound is not healed, and the incision you made in your operation is contained.
Furthermore, if you are afraid, place on it cotton soaked in oil, or cotton soaked in Egyptian unguent, or in any green unguent, for when those ligaments soften, and the bones are separated from them, their removal and extraction is made easier.
However, if it is a large bone, such as a leg bone or thigh bone, or similar, and only the surface is corrupted, then scrape that with a rasp only from behind until that blackness and corruption are removed, and then restore the wound.
However, if the corrupted part is extensive, and the corruption has already reached the bone marrow, then it is necessary to close that and cut entirely to the point where the corruption has reached, and then heal that until it is healed.
And I relate to you what happened to a man in his thigh, so that you may use this as an example and help for your operation.
There was a young man, about 30 years old, in whom pain arose in his thigh.  And from the parts within, pus accumulated inside the body until it reached the thigh.  And it was a matter of an abscess, a large abscess, and it was not caused by an external factor.
And then the time was extended by the doctors' error, until the abscess opened, and many matters were released.  And the cure was nearly given up, until the leg became fistulous, and many openings were created that all discharged pus and bodily moisture.
And then a multitude of physicians treated him for about two years, and none of them were skilled in the art, until I was called in.
And I saw his leg and the matters that flowed from it through those openings, a great deal; and already the body of that man was entirely wasted and its colour was yellowish.
Then I inserted a probe into one of those openings, and the probe reached the bone.
And I then probed all the openings, and found them leading from all parts of the leg.
Then I probed and incised one of those openings until I uncovered a part of the bone, and found it corrupted, already earthy and decayed; and a part of the leg had already been corrupted, having penetrated down to the marrow.
Then I closed what I had uncovered of the exposed bone.
And I judged that it was not the bone itself but that corruption which I had excised and closed, and I had already healed it.
And then I applied consolidative medicine to the wound for a long time, but it did not heal.
And then I probed and uncovered the bone a second time over the initial uncovering, and found continuing corruption alongside the bone.
And I closed what appeared to me to be that corruption, and then I was forced to perform its healing and restoration, but it was not restored.
And then I uncovered it again, and I did not stop cutting into the bone little by little, specifically, forcing its restoration, but it was not restored until I cut around a palm's breadth of it, and extracted the marrow with it.  Then I restored that with medicines, and it is slightly consolidated and healed.
And there is no need for further intervention in its operation and cutting, except because of its weakness and its low tolerance and fear of death, for it was at risk at all hours due to a bad syncope resulting from excessive evacuation.
Therefore, it is completely healed, and nothing is in the place of the bone – hard flesh; and its condition in the body is good, and its virtue has returned; and it is restored to its original condition, causing neither difficulty in walking nor harm in any way.
However, if the bone is protruding from its place in the body, then you must cut it in this way: take a bandage and tie it tightly to the end of the protruding bone, and have someone pull it outwards; and put another thicker wool bandage over the first; and then tie this over the flesh beneath the bone, pulling the end of it so that you draw the flesh back in the direction below; and uncover the flesh over the place you want to cut so that the cut does not injure the flesh.
And place a piece of wood or a plank under the bone properly, for when you do this, the cut is not prohibited from cutting into the corrupted flesh.
And the cutting must be done over the corrupted spot little by little, for if the corruption is in the cavity of the bone and does not appear on its surface to the senses, it will need to be cut again.
And if the bone is corrupted but not protruding, with one part continuing into the other, and the corruption is in the middle or a part of it, then you should uncover all of the flesh around it; then place wood underneath, and cut from the first part where the corruption is until the cut continues into the other part.
And let the cutting be along the area of corruption, a little at a time, as we have said.
And if the corruption is in the joint, cut through that corrupted joint, and saw the bone where it continues from the other part.
And if the corruption is in the continuation of two joints, then it is not a rational cause but a crafty one.
And if the corruption is in the flesh of the hand or foot, it is very difficult; however, you must investigate the corruption in whatever way appears to you, and you must dissect it and cleanse it according to every possible disposition, and with every possible method, as long as it does not cause you to cut or injure a vein or nerve.
And know that the incisions and saws for cutting these bones are very much dependent on the location of the bones, their preparation, their thickness, their subtlety and size, and their hardness and rarity; therefore, you must prepare suitable instruments for every type of operation.
And understand that this operation indicates to you the kind of instrument you will need; when great study and long experience and knowledge of the methods of this art, and experience with diseases, are yours, you will already know what instruments are appropriate for each illness.
And I am giving you, at the end of this chapter, a list of the instruments you will use, along with simple instructions for your procedure, which you will test on others. Shape of saw:
Shape of another saw:
Shape of another large saw:
Shape of ray: Let the head of this ray be in the shape of a star-shaped key head, and its points be in the shape of the points of an arrowhead.
And it is only fitting that with that [the ray], the heads of the joints be cauterized when they are corrupted, or the mouth/opening is large and wide.
Shape of a smaller razor:
Shape of a lateral razor:
Shape of a differently made saw:  Let its arc be the most superior part, and sharpen its iron edge, and its wooden part be a properly made stabbing tool. Shape of it:
Shape of a razor which has a concavity:
A different, more subtle shape of razor:
A different razor with a curved end:
A small razor resembling a probe:
A different, smaller cutting tool:
Another form of cutting tool; this one resembling a saw, and its end is like a saw blade, and it is used in many places in the treatment of bones:
A saw suitable for the treatment of a bone that has been perforated:
And its tip is triangular and sharply pointed.
And it is made of Indian iron, and likewise, all the tools we have described – razors, cutting instruments, and saws – should be made of this.
Of the cutting edges and the saw-like treatment of bones.
The extremities may be affected either by an internal or external cause, or if your treatment with those remedies does not resolve the corruption, or if the corruption has spread to a limb without any apparent cause, then you should cut into that limb where the corruption has reached, so that the patient is saved from death or a major injury to that limb.
The sign of the affected area is that the limb becomes black, as though fire has already burned it, or it gradually turns black until the hardness spreads throughout that limb and permeates the whole body; and therefore, cut into that area.
And similarly, if the corruption is caused by the sting of venomous creatures, such as a scorpion, viper, or a similar creature.
And if the corruption or injury is in the extremity of the finger, then you cut the finger, and do not allow the corruption to spread to the hand.
And similarly, if the affliction reaches the hand, then cut it from the base of the wrist, and do not allow the corruption to spread up into the arm's socket.
And if, instead of that, the affliction reaches the arm, then cut the arm up to the elbow joint.
And if the corruption passes beyond and surrounds the elbow, then in that case is the death of the patient; and to administer any other remedy for this is a futile effort.
And similarly, do the same for the foot. When corruption reaches the toe of the foot, then you cut it to one of the joints.
And if it takes hold in the sole of the foot, then you cut off the entire foot. But if it ascends to the knee, then you cut the leg up to the knee joint.
And if the corruption has already reached the knee, then there is no remedy but to let the patient go, and leave the sick person to death.
And the way to cut or sever the limb is to tighten the ligament in the part just below the place you wish to cut, and tighten another ligament above the spot; and let the attending physician pull a ligament downwards and another upward; and you separate the flesh which lies between the two ligaments with a sharp instrument until all the flesh is exposed; and then it is cut or severed.
And it is necessary that linen cloths be placed on all sides so that the area is not touched, and that the sick person receive a fitting wound and a hot abscess.
But if you encounter a flow of blood while working, then you cauterize the area carefully, or apply some powders to stop the blood; and then return to your procedure until it is completed.
And then bind the wounded limb with suitable bandages, and treat it until it is healed.
And I relate to you what happened to a man on his foot, this same accident which I and you have discussed, which happened to him, namely, a blackness on his foot, with a burning that resembled the burning of fire.
And that corruption first occurred in his toe until it spread to the entire foot.
And then that man prepared himself, since he saw the treatment going to the limb with the intensity of the pain and burning he felt, and he incised that foot down to the joint, and the wound healed.
For a long time, that same corruption occurred on the tip of his index finger.
And then he came to me, and I was forced to dispel that excess with what I placed upon his hand in the treatment of his body; but the excess was not dispelled, and it began to move to the other fingers, until it spread throughout his hand.
And he urged me to cut open his hand, but I did not want to do this, hoping for the expulsion of that excess, and more afraid of the fatal consequences of cutting his hand, because the patient's strength was waning.
And after he left me, having returned to his land, he came back to me, reporting that the man prepared himself and cut open his entire hand, and it healed.
And I have related this story only to be helpful in understanding this illness, and to provide a model by which it may be understood and treated.
Of the treatment of sinuses and the quality of clysterization with medicines.
When an abscess occurs on fleshy limbs and the space of the abscess is prolonged until it collects pus, and it is then broken and perforated, and the pus is discharged, and the location remains empty like a vessel, and the skin over it is like a thin cloth, and it hasn't progressed to further corruption, and it does not affect the bone, nerves, or ligaments, it is called a sinus, and not a fistula.
However, if the space is prolonged until the corruption affects a limb, then it is called a fistula and not a sinus.
And the treatment is to cut away that skin entirely, just as it is rolled back, especially if it is thin and like cloth, and ensure that it does not adhere to the area due to its corruption.
But if you suspect that the skin will adhere and that the corruption hasn't spread further, and the skin has broken open, then treat it with a clyster.
And if you consider it a sinus, and if it is large, and the discharge has a foul odor, then treat it with an Egyptian medicine, which is olive oil, sour wine, and honey, taken in equal parts, mixed in a vessel, and simmered over the fire until the medicine becomes reddish and reaches the consistency of honey.
Then take what is necessary of that, dissolve it with water and honey, and administer this as a clyster to the sinus, constricting the opening, and leave the medicine there for two hours.
Then remove it with a spatula; and do this for as many days as necessary until the sinus is cleansed and the bad smell is gone.
And sometimes, if this medicine is not available to you, it is treated with ash water.  Take the ashes of the vine, put them in water, let it settle, and administer a clyster with it until you are sure the sinus is closed.
And if the patient cannot tolerate the Egyptian medicine or ash water, then administer a clyster with water and honey mixed with crushed mint.  Also administer a clyster with wine and honey mixed, because honey has the property of cleansing and washing, and wine causes the sinus to adhere, especially when the wine has a high level of astringency and dryness.
And when you have done this several times and you are sure the sinus is healed, then administer a clyster with something that promotes the growth of flesh in that area.
You should take diafinicon ointment and dissolve it with rosemary oil and astringent wine; or you can administer a clyster with other medicines and ointments that have the properties which I have already described in the treatise on ointments.
And if the opening of the sinus is narrow, preventing the clyster tube from entering, then gradually enlarge it with a small iron tool, and apply a compress wrapped in Egyptian or basil ointment until it is widened.
And similarly, if the opening is wide, then you should bring the edges together with sutures, leaving the opening just wide enough for the clyster tube to enter without obstruction.
And if the opening through which the fistula drains is elevated on the upper parts, then you should drain it in the lowest part where the fistula lies, so that the drainage runs downwards; because when the fistula is constricted in the depth of the sinus, flesh is likely to regenerate there.
And if it is not possible for you to drain the sinus to the lowermost bone as desired, then you must prepare the affected limb with a preparation that will allow the fistula to drain more easily, and that no cause obstructs the drainage.
But the one over the sinus opening, which remains in place continuously, so that whatever is accumulating inside the fistula will drain out. And so that you may know if what drains from the fistula is much or little, or if it is digested, or undigested.
And by this, consider the location of the sinus, whether the patient feels pain in the area, and if there is an abscess there.
And as your treatment continues in this way, and you see the matter that has collected over the sinus opening has begun to adhere or become attached, then on the third day you loosen it, and when you loosen the scab, then change the cloth to another and renew the medicament.
However, if from the sinus there emerges a subtle, thin pus, then do not despair of its adherence, because healing will come to it, for there are some people in whom the generation of flesh in their wounds is slow, and others in whom the opposite is true.
And if from the sinus for many days undigested pus has emerged, then know that the sinus has not adhered; and if the adherence of the sinus is delayed and the cause is prolonged, then you should adjust the drying nature of the remedies, and if the remedies are moist in their substance and their virtue, make them dry as a diafineon ointment, when excess moisture is adjusted in them.
And the final remedy with which it is cured is to take diafineon ointment, dissolve it in warmed oil, and add to it aged wine, equal in substance, and then mix them together and use that.
And similarly in that action, when there is no pus, use diafineon ointment, honey when it is boiled until it is thickened, and use it; or take myrrh, aloes, and incense, grind them all together and powder them over honey which is over a fire until it is thickened, then apply this to a cloth and press it over the sinus; and apply that honey which you have boiled until it is thickened, and powder it onto a cloth and press it.
And sometimes it is administered with long aristolochia roots and the roots of lily of the valley (and it is the lily of the valley) and the flour of eryngo and centaury, and use these simple ingredients, either separately or combined, grinding and sifting them, then powdering them over the honey, as previously described, and use that.
And if the sinus is prolonged and not healed by this treatment, then know that the corruption is in the bone or in other hard members or ligaments; then treat it with a fistula cure, as described above.
Concerning the treatment of whitlows (panaritium), and of bruised nails, and the incision of the affected finger, and its sectioning.
A whitlow (panaritium) is an abscess that arises beneath the nail of a finger of the hand or foot, though it often appears on other fingers, and if prolonged and its treatment is delayed, or if it is an inflamed abscess, or if it is corrupt, and pus is discharged until the root of the nail is eroded, and it often completely corrupts the nail, and the corruption often extends to the bone until it emits a foul odor, and the end of the finger becomes dark, and its color turns dark.
And therefore, when you have done as we have said in the division, and your treatment does not work, then you must cut away with an iron all the remaining excess of the nail, and then cauterize the wound.  For cautery is very helpful in this.
However, if the bone is sound and the nail is healthy, and the nail bed has already compressed the flesh inwards, and begins to pierce and weaken it, then you must place a fine blade under the edge of the nail that is piercing the flesh, and lift that flesh and cut that flesh easily. Then apply to the remaining flesh corrosive and burning remedies until it is all gone; and then heal that with ointments until it is healed.
But if the corruption has already reached the bone, then you must cut the bone and remove it, for a corrupt bone is never healed.
And if the decay and corruption spread to the finger, then you must cut it (the finger) at one of the joints, according to the prognosis for its recovery, and then treat it until it is healed.
But if the nail has suffered impact or friction, and there is intense pain, then you must first bleed the patient, and then dry the nail with a sharp spatula by cutting it transversally from top to bottom.  Beware that the cut doesn't reach the flesh beneath the nail, for you will cause the patient extreme pain, and it will cause the growth of unnecessary, additional flesh in the area.  Then treat that area with remedies that relieve pain.
But a swollen finger, which is frequently found in the hands of some men, is often fleshy and soft, and often light in the bones, or soft in the nail.
And some of these swellings are born at the joint, or their growth is in some of the finger's joints. But the one that grows in some of the finger's joints is not serious, and the one that grows at the joints is easily inflamed.
And for those that are fleshy, the incision is gentle, and you should cut it along its base with a broad spatula.
But for the one that grows at the base of the joint, the cure is difficult; therefore, beware of cutting it.
But for the one that grows on the finger near the joints, you should initially cut the flesh around it in a circular incision down to the bone, then use a suitable saw to cut through it, and then treat it until it heals.
But if the fingers become thickened together, whether naturally, or due to scarring from a wound, a burn, or similar causes, then the thickened area must be cut away until the fingers return to their natural shape.
And then place strips of cloth soaked in warmed oil between them so that they do not heal prematurely, or place a thin sheet of lead between them until they heal properly.
And similarly, if the fingers have grown together with the palm, you should cut away that growth in a way that restores the proper shape of the limb.
Concerning the incisions of varicose veins.
Varicose veins are thick, convoluted veins full of melancholic superfluities that appear in various parts of the body, most often in the legs, especially in those who travel, work, or carry heavy loads.
Therefore, you should administer a purging of the body of black bile several times, with strong expulsion, and then bleed the patient from the basilic vein.
However, the treatment of them with iron is according to two methods: one is that they be incised and the black blood be drawn out, and the other method is that the vein be elevated and the entire thing be extracted.
The incision is done in this manner: First, immerse the leg in very hot water until the thick, phlegmatic blood from the leg is resolved; then, tightly bind the patient's leg from a point just above the thigh down to the knee with a bandage; then, cut the vein in one, two, or three places with a wide incision; and then lift the black blood from the lower part of the leg up and down, until the amount of blood you desire and can safely remove has been extracted, and which will lessen the illness.
And then bandage it, and order the patient to abstain from foods that engender black bile.
And repeat the treatment by phlebotomy when the veins are filled, and this is noticed by the patient.
But the elevation of them is done in this way: you elevate the patient's leg, if it is very swollen, and then put it in a bath and immerse the leg in hot water until it turns red and the veins become prominent; or, if a bath is not available, you have it exercised with vigorous activity until the limb is warmed.
Then dry the cord (presumably the vein) on the right side of the vein, by incision along or behind the knee, or below the ankle.
And then open the cord (presumably the vein) with hooks and scrape the vein from all sides until it appears sensitive, and the appearance of that red colour is often followed by a darkening.
And thus, when you open and see that white cord from the vein.
And then you place a ligature (or something like a splint/bandage) under that white cord until it is elevated and detached from the vein, and suspend it with a hook or a similar implement.
And then make another incision near that first incision over three days, and then scrape the cord (vein) from the upper part until it appears.
And then lift that (cord/vein) and cut it in a second incision towards the heel, and then extract it and lift it until it is out through the second incision, and then extract it from the incision that is above it.
And do this until you extract it from the incision that is highest or most prominent of all the incisions, until the whole thing is out; and then cut that (remaining portion of the vein).
And if you are not able to extract and elevate it, then insert a needle with a strong double hook and tie it and extract it, or insert a ligature (or splint/bandage) beneath it and turn your hand in all directions until it is expelled. And be careful that it is not cut; for if it is broken, it will be difficult for you to elevate that much and it will cause harm to the patient because of that.
And when that is entirely expelled, then place over the affected area wool soaked in wine and rubbed and unrubbed oil, and treat it until it is healed.
And if the vein is constricted, having a tortuosity to which it is wrapped in parts, and is not straight as we have said, then it is necessary that you cut around that in every part of its tortuosity and in the places where it is wrapped, and then suspend it with hooks until you have lifted the whole thing.
And be careful in your incision to not cut the vein and not harm it, for it will be difficult for you to elevate it; and keep your prudence in this.
Form of the incision with which the vein is cut:
It is not so sharp as the hooks, nor is it a sharp tip so that it does not harm the vein; and it is of great flexibility, like a lion's, for if it were subtle, it would cut the vein by its subtlety; however, there is superfluous thickness in it, as we said.
Of the extraction of the vein of the leg.
This vein is produced in the legs in hot lands, like the Nile River in the lands of the Arabs, and in the hot, arid lands of India, where there is little moisture and in which no grass or tree grows.
And it is easily produced in other parts of the body besides the legs.
And its formation comes from putrefaction that arises from beneath the skin, like snakes, worms, and insects that breed between the skin and the flesh.
And a sign of the coming of this vein is that inflammation of the leg occurs violently; and soon the area becomes blistered; and soon the vein begins to emerge from the place of that blister, appearing like a sprout from a plant.
And then, when its extremity appears, you should wrap a lead weight around it, which weighs one or two drachms, and fasten it, and leave the lead hanging from the leg.
And as many times as there is any cause of it (the affliction) on the exterior parts, wrap it in lead and bind it. And if the affliction is prolonged, then you should cut off a part of it and bandage the remaining portion; and do not cut it from its base until it has come out, for if you cut it from its base, it will be constricted and enter into the flesh, causing an abscess and a hard swelling in the area and a nasty ulcer.
Therefore, it must be treated gently and drawn out little by little, until it is expelled from behind it and no cause of it remains in the body.
And from this vein it has emerged in some men to a length of five palms and fingers, and it has even come to my attention that one emerged to twenty palms in length.
And if it is incised at the time of its treatment, then insert a rod into its opening and pierce it with a long rod through its body, until everything within the matter is evacuated, and apply putrefaction to the area for several days with medicinal substances; and then treat it with the treatment for abscesses.
And this vein sometimes has many branches, and especially when it appears at the joint of the foot or on the foot, and it has many openings, and a branch emerges from each opening.
And therefore treat it thus as we have said in the division and with what has been previously stated.
Of the incision concerning worms generated under the skin, and is called the bovine disease.
This illness is called bovine disease in some lands near us, because it often affects oxen.  A small worm is born between the skin and flesh, and travels throughout the body, ascending and descending, and is noticeable by its movement from limb to limb until it bursts through the skin and emerges.
And its generation is due to the putrefaction of certain humors, just as worms, snakes, maggots, and ascarids are produced in the belly.
And it is feared for its malice, for when it travels through the body and ascends to the head, and reaches the eye, it causes a severe inflammation there and enters, destroying the eye, and this happens often.
Therefore, when you wish to cure it and extract it, it is done only by following its movement and appearance as perceived, and then you should tightly bind and constrict that which is above it and that which is below it, and then cut around it and extract it.
And if it is concealed within the flesh and you do not find it, then you apply a cautery with fire to the area until it dies, and the greatest fear is the corruption it causes, corrupting the area as we have said.
And if you see that creature has reached the head near the eye, then tightly bind around the eyebrow with a strong constriction, then cut around it, and extract it.  And it is necessary for the sick person to use medicines that rid the body of bad, putrid humors, and to avoid foods that cause putrefaction.
Of the section concerning the sickness of the nose.
This illness is called "nafir" in our land, and it is a pain that comes in some limbs, and then it moves from limb to limb.
And I have already seen that, as I will tell you. I was called to a sick woman in a village, and I examined her arm and saw a small inflammation in the vein of the arm.  After an hour, I saw this inflammation moving like a worm ascending, but more quickly than you would expect a worm to move, like if it were liquid silver, moving from place to place.
And then the pain went to that place and settled in the muscle, and there it remained for an hour.
And then it moved to the other side of the body until it reached the other arm.
And then I noticed that it was moving throughout her entire body as I watched; and I was greatly amazed by its movement and the speed with which it moved from limb to limb. And I had previously seen this in my own observations in a similar manner, although I have observed many instances where pain is transferred from limb to limb. But I did not see this with my eyes quite like in the woman.
And I did not consider this to be anything other than due to the fact that the woman was old, with dry body tissues and exposed veins, and in this circumstance the moving air/wind appeared as a sensed sensation (of pain) being transferred.
And it is necessary that this (pain transfer) not appear in those who are delicate and with moist bodies, with hidden veins.
And when you seek the cure for him, and the patient feels that pain, then, it is not apparent to your sight as we have described.  Then, you gently and softly press on the area until that constricted wind/air is expelled, and cauterize the location.
But if you do not see it with your eyes, then you treat it with body purging and with things that expel wind/air, and cure it with smelly pills and with pills of Serapion and similar remedies.
Of the extraction of arrows.
Arrows are diverse according to their types, and according to the parts of the body they strike, for their diversity is that some have large points, and small ones, and concave, and blunt, meaning solid; and some have three angles, and some have tongues; and some have wings.
And the signs of the brain are when an arrow strikes it, piercing the bone and emerging from the skull which is above the brain, for it causes sudden violent pain, dizziness, vertigo, redness in the eyes, inflammation and redness of the tongue, spasms, confusion, vomiting of bile, speech is severely impaired or lost, and the voice is destroyed.  A white, dust-like humidity emerges from the wound, and the area around the wound looks like a watery part of the flesh.
Therefore, if you see these signs, then you abstain from treating and extracting the arrow, unless it is on the surface.
But the signs of an arrow striking the heart, if it is near the left breast, are that it feels as though it is lodged in a hard substance, and not hollow; and the arrow's movement is much like the pulse, and black blood flows from the wound, and cold spreads to the extremities, and cold sweats, and fainting; and thus know that death is imminent without a doubt.
And the signs when the arrow has struck the lung are the outflow of frothy blood from the wound, and the vessels near the neck become inflamed, and the patient's color changes, and the patient exhales large amounts of air and demands cold air.
And if the arrow strikes the lining [membrane] which is on the feet, the pain is then near the small ribs, and a great tremor occurs with intense pain and gasping, and all the muscles of the limbs are affected.
And if the arrow strikes the stomach, then it will quickly discharge undigested food from the wound.
And if the arrow strikes the abdomen and is lodged within, there will be some kind of rupture from the wound, either of the tissue, or the intestines which have been ruptured, and there is no hope for a cure without the removal of the arrow.
And if the arrow strikes the bladder, and urine flows out from the wound, and there is a further cause for outward discharge, and intense pain affects the patient, then know that it is fatal.
But the other limbs, such as the face, neck, throat, shoulders and arms, the vertebrae of the back, the collarbone, the hip, the leg, and similar limbs, will be saved, according to the greater likelihood, when the arrow does not strike a vein or artery, and if it is not a poisoned arrow.
And I will tell you this about the nature of these arrows, so that you may consider this in your treatment.
The reason for this is that in one man, an arrow struck the tear duct of his eye near the root of his nose, and I removed it from the other side, below the crease of his ear, and he recovered, and no harm came to his eye.
And I removed another arrow from a Jew, which struck him in the crease of his eye, beneath the lower eyelid, and the arrow was already embedded, and only a small tip remained visible, connected to its shaft.  It was a large, pointed arrow of the kind used by the Turks, with a lion's head-shaped iron head, without barbs.
And the Jew recovered, and no ill accident occurred to his eye.
And I removed another arrow from a Christian man, which had lodged in his throat. It was an Arab arrow, the kind with barbs.  It had already sunk into his throat.  I worked around it with a tool, and then extracted it.  The Christian recovered.
And I removed another arrow from a man which had lodged in his stomach; I thought he would die from it.  However, after 30 days passed with no change in his condition, I cut around the arrow and worked around it, and he recovered. No bad accident happened to him.
And I saw another man in whom an arrow had lodged in his back, and the wound healed.  However, after approximately seven years, the arrow emerged from the root of his thigh.
And I saw a woman in whom an arrow lodged in her stomach.  The wound healed inside her, and there was no change in her condition, and the woman suffered no harm in any of her natural bodily functions.
And I saw another man in whom an arrow lodged in his face. The wound healed, and the arrow broke, causing not much pain.  Many cases like this one happened.
And I extracted the arrow from the King's prince's man, which had lodged in the middle of his nose, and had already shifted slightly to the right side. The entire arrow was hidden.
And I was called to his treatment shortly after the arrow's lodging, within three days.
And then I found the arrow wound very tight; and then I probed it with a thin probe, and I felt nothing; but he felt a prickling pain below his right ear, and then I suspected that this prickling was from the arrow's tip.
And I applied a poultice to the area, one with attractive and digestive properties, confident that the area would become infected so that the arrow wound would appear, so that it would dry up around it.
And there was no significant result at the site where the arrow had lodged; and I continued with the poultice for many days and no further incident occurred; and meanwhile, the wound healed, and the patient remained free of discomfort for many days, until one day he felt the arrow within his nose and reported this to me.
And then I applied a sharp, corrosive medicine to the wound for many days until it opened up, and with the probe I examined it, and found the fine arrowhead, which adhered to the shaft.
And then I adjusted the application of that sharp medicine to the wound until the arrowhead became clearly visible to me, and I spent time with this for a period of up to four months.
And then, as the wound became larger, and it was possible for me to insert the forceps into it, and it remained, and did not yield, then I did not cease to refine and devise methods to remove it, until one day I began to remove it with skillfully crafted forceps, as will be shown in the form of those instruments at the end of the chapter, until I extracted it; and then I healed that wound.
Some doctors judged that the cartilage of the nose was not repairable, but I repaired it, and the wound healed completely, and the patient recovered his full health, and no harm came to him in any way.
I recount to you the method of extracting certain arrows, so that you may consider this a rule and a significance regarding what I have not said, for the parts of this art and the definitions of it are not encompassed by narrative, nor do these books contain them.
The skilled craftsman compares the little with the much; and the present with the absent; and finds a new operation and a new instrument for dealing with the removal of foreign objects in the art when it occurs.
Therefore, I say that arrows are not expelled from the members in which they are lodged except in two ways: either by traction from the place where they entered, or by pressure from the opposite part.
That which is expelled through the place of entry, or is an arrow lodged in fleshy tissue, is pulled and expelled.
And if you do not obey this timing when extracting it, then you should leave it for a few days until the flesh surrounding it can heal, and the extraction and its expulsion will be eased.
And similarly, if it is lodged in bone and you do not follow the schedule, then leave it for a few days and repeat the extraction with traction and movement each day, and it will be expelled.
And if you do not follow the schedule for a few days, then you must pierce the area around the arrow in that bone from all sides with a fine instrument until the space around the arrow is enlarged, and then extract it.
But if the arrow is already hidden in a part of the body, and it is hidden from sight, then you search for it with a probe, and if you feel it, then pull it out with instruments suitable for the extraction.
And if you cannot access it due to the constriction of the wound and the length of the shaft, and it is not over a bone, nerve, or vein, then you should work on the wound until it is widened and the arrow can be extracted.
And if it is lodged in the ears, you must carefully free the flesh in which it is stuck from all sides, using every possible method; and work on it, if you cannot free the flesh from the fracture of the ears and twisting them until it yields.
And when you perform the extraction of the arrow in any location where it is lodged, then use twisting with your hand and forceps from all sides until it gives way; and carefully handle it with subtle technique so that the arrow is not broken and that its extraction is not difficult for you.
And if you cannot remove it immediately, then leave it for a few days until the surrounding tissues are less tense, and then try again when it is less painful. But if there is excessive bleeding, then you should use the treatments described in the relevant chapter.
And be cautious about cutting a vein, nerve, or tendon, and employ every possible method for removing the arrow; do this with ease, calmness, slowly, and firmness, as I and you have agreed.
And therefore, position the arrow in such a way that the patient is in the position that the arrow's impact created, because this is more beneficial. But if this isn't possible, then you should use the best possible position and technique.
But if the arrows are protruding from the opposite side, or if any part of the arrow is extending outwards, or if the arrowhead is bent due to the impact on the nearby bone, often higher up; then you should cut there, and the incision should be according to the extent of the forceps; then pull it out, for it is easier to remove this way.
But if it's lodged in the bone, then you should twist the blade in the opposite direction until the arrow presses against the bone, and expands outwards, and then remove it.
Otherwise, leave it for a few days, and then try again until it comes out.
And if the arrow shaft is stuck in there, then you should push it out with it.
But if the shaft is broken and you want to administer an impulse, then you should introduce a hollow, curved instrument, so that its concavity fits into the arrow's shaft, and then push it out with it.
But if the arrow is concave, then you should push it out with a strong instrument inserted into it, because the arrow is made easier to extract by that.
And if the arrow is poisoned, then it is necessary that you cauterize all the flesh in which the venom is, if it is possible for you to do so, and then treat it with what is appropriate.
And if the arrow strikes the foot, or the abdomen, or the bladder, or the side, and is close enough that you can reach it with a probe, and it is possible for you to cut around it, then cut around it and be careful not to cut a vein or nerve, and remove it, and then cauterize the wound if necessary, and treat it until it is healed.
Form of forceps with which arrows are pulled out:
Let their ends be like the beak of a bird, made like a saw, so that when they grasp the arrow, they do not let go.
And of those [forceps] many types are made, large, small, and medium, according to the size of the arrow and its smallness, and the width of the wound, and the patient's constriction (or narrowness).
like a ray, so that the insertion of it into the concave arrow is eased and it is pushed with that [tool].
Of phlebotomy of the veins.
The veins for phlebotomy, of which there is a custom of phlebotomizing thirty, of which are in Chapter XVI, are: two pulsating veins near the ears, called *alhasisain*; two veins in the two apparent temples; and two veins in the two tear ducts, called *aspicientz*; and the vein located in the middle of the forehead, and the vein at the tip of the nose; and two veins at the neck; and two veins on the upper lip; and two veins on the lower lip; and – these are the veins called *algelic* – and two veins below the tongue. However, the veins that are phlebotomized in the arms are five: one is the cephalic, which is on the wild side; and the people call it "the vein of the head," and is blunt, and is a middle vein, and is composed of a branch of the basilic, and another branch of the cephalic; and the people call that "vein of the whole body"; and the basilic is the vein that is on the domestic side, and is called "citillar," and the common people call it "vein of the belly"; and the vein of the arm, which is located on the forearm; and it is the one that is phlebotomized, and it is the one that appears on the pit by manifest appearance; and *salvatella*, and is the vein that is between the said auricular finger and the smallest finger, and is in two branches.
And in the foot and leg there are three veins; one of them is below the bend of the knee on the wild side; and the second is *sophena*, and its location is below the leg on the domestic side; and the sciatic vein, and its location is below the leg on the wild side; and in the leg are other veins similar to those.
The benefit of the veins near the ears is for headaches, migraines, fevers, and bad old head ulcers.
And the method of bleeding those veins, as I recommend to you, is that the patient's head should be shaved, and the patient's head should be rubbed on the occiput in the location of both veins with a wide cloth with good friction; then firmly hold the patient's neck with a bandage until the two veins and their locations near the ears in two depressed places on the head appear; and you should feel them with your finger, and if you feel the pulse of those with your finger, then bleed there with a lancet.
Then take the lancet knife, which is sharp, and insert it under the vein at the incision until the phlebotomy reaches the bone. Then lift your hand with the vein and incision to the sides above, and cut the vein with a sharp incision. And let the length of the incision be the amount of two fingers joined together or thereabouts; and let the blood flow out as much as desired.
And then press with compresses and leave it until it is healed.
And already, at the beginning of the book, the incision of those and their cauterization have been discussed.
However, regarding the two arterial veins in the temples, the benefit of phlebotomy is for old migraines, persistent and harmful eye diseases, and frequent acute discharges of excess fluid from the eyes.
And the technique of phlebotomizing those veins is as I tell you:  hold the patient's head, tightly, until the two veins appear visibly, and the pulse of them is felt below your finger; and then, you should use a probe.
And then raise the skin above the vein with your index finger, and insert the phlebotomy instrument underneath, and lift the vein upward; and incise it as you did with the other two veins; and allow the blood to flow according to the amount needed.
And then release the patient's hold, and place your finger on the vein for an hour, then apply a poultice and powders and tightly compress that area, and leave it until it is healed.
And the recollection of those things, their incision, and the drawing [of blood] are already described at the beginning of the book.
Therefore, the benefit of phlebotomy of the frontal vein is appropriate for phlebotomy of the cephalic vein for ancient illnesses of the face, migraines, stiffness, and foul ulcers.
And the method of phlebotomy for him is as I recommend to you: the patient should press his neck with a bandage until the vein appears; and then take the instrument which is called a *fossori* [or "digging tool"], of which this is its form:
Place the pointed end of the *fossori* on that vein and strike it with a hammer or another similar tool, in the manner described, and allow the blood to flow according to the desired quantity.  Then release the patient's hold, and compress the area until it is healed.
And sometimes a lateral phlebotomy is performed, but the phlebotomy should not have a sharp end, like the other phlebotomies, but rather a blunt end, and phlebotomize across it, because the bone is very strong and thin, and the phlebotomy would break it if the instrument is too sharp.
However, the benefit of the two veins near the tear ducts is for scabies of the eyes, for redness and swelling in the eyes, and for illnesses of the face.
The method of phlebotomy is that the patient should press their neck with a bandage, and then the phlebotomist should perform the procedure, while you stand over their head.
And the phlebotomy should be made transversely, along the length, with a somewhat blunt instrument, because the area is not fleshy; and if the phlebotomy instrument is too sharp, it will easily break the bone there.
And then let the blood flow as much as you need, and place a cloth over it, and bind it for a night, and then remove it.
However, phlebotomy of the vein in the nose is beneficial for acute fevers and violent headaches, and for illnesses of the face, migraines, and redness that occurs on the face, especially when it is chronic.
And the procedure for phlebotomy there is that the patient should press their neck and you should hold their nose with your left hand, and take the sharp lancet and insert it into the middle of the bridge of the nose along the line, because the vein is not visible there, and as soon as the blood starts to flow.
You should slowly withdraw your hand with the lancet and let the blood flow as needed; and then bind it for a night, because it will heal quickly.
However, phlebotomy of both veins is useful for chest constriction, the beginning of leprosy, many illnesses, impetigo, and nasty, corrosive ulcers, as well as herpes.
And the procedure for phlebotomy of those is that the patient should press below each vein in their neck with a bandage; and the physician should be positioned above the patient's head, and the patient should lie on a bed.
Then lance the vein lengthwise with a wide lancet gradually; and then draw blood in a temperate amount or according to whatever the need is; and then do the same with the other vein.
Then loosen the bandage and compress the two veins with a moderate constriction so that the patient is not suffocated, and leave it until morning, for the wound will heal.
And the benefit of phlebotomy of the veins, for small abscesses and pustules of the mouth, and corruption of the gums and bad ulcers and fissures, and for bad ulcers that are on the nose and in the surrounding area.
And the procedure for phlebotomy of those is to make the patient lie down before you, and compress their neck with a bandage, and then you should pull back the patient's lips and look for two veins, one on the right side of the lip and the second on the left; and the identification of each is by the blackness of each of them, and this is because there are small black veins around them; and then you should cut into each of them with an incision.
But if there is doubt, and you do not know which one is which, then you should make the incision on the largest and most obvious of them.
And do the same for the two veins that are on the upper lips.
However, for the two veins beneath the tongue, bloodletting is useful for head ailments, neck problems, inflamed uvula, and mouth ailments.
And the method of bloodletting those veins is to have the patient lie between your hands in the sun's light, lift their tongue, and look beneath it; one vein on one side, and one on the other side, and the colour of each inclines towards blackness.
And then bleed each vein; and be careful not to press too hard when bleeding them, because beneath them are arteries.
And the veins that are bled in the elbow are those that commonly run in all men, and their bloodletting is done in two ways: either with a lancet, with a pointed tip that gradually tapers; or with a knife, and this is called incision, and this is its form:
Its cut should be like this: it is appropriate to open the full, concave veins, which are clearly large, and those that contain thick, clotted blood.
This bloodletting is of a smaller width and a more subtle tip, and is appropriate for bloodletting of thin veins containing thin, citrus-like blood.
However, bloodletting from the basilic vein, which is one of three veins, is useful for diseases located below the neck and collarbone, and for those affecting the feet and abdomen.
And it is necessary for the bloodletter, when bloodletting from that vein, to be very careful and cautious, for there is an artery below it. If he makes a mistake and misjudges the bloodletting puncture, he will cut that artery and cause a flood of blood. Therefore, it is necessary not to puncture it with a sharp lancet, but to cut it with a lancet like a scalpel.
And if the basilic vein is not readily apparent, then it is necessary to leave it and move to another vein, or to look for a branch of it.  Or bloodletting can be performed on the exposed part of the arm, as that is visible, and cut it with a scalpel-like lancet, as we have said.
But if you want to perform bloodletting from that same vein, then first, near the bend of the arm, you must feel the location of the pulse and then press on it with a bandage; then tie the arm up and cut the vein with a concave incision using a scalpel-like lancet, as we have said.  And be careful that the incision is at a slight distance from the artery's location.
And when you feel, by tightening the bandage, swelling at the location you marked with the bandage, then that swelling is swelling of the artery, and therefore avoid that spot.
And if you see the blood flowing from the bloodletting like a child's urine, and the blood is thin and reddish, then know that it is from the artery; and then you should stop and place your finger over the spot for a while; then remove your finger, and if the blood flow has stopped, as often happens, then you tighten the arm and leave it alone.
And watch the patient closely, and be cautious of complications, and do not neglect him for several days until he is healed.
But if the blood does not stop flowing, and you see that there is no suitable medicine for this, then you should cut into the artery if you believe it is necessary; for its extremity is constricted, and the blood flow will be stopped; or you can take a fig leaf, crush it, take half of it, and apply that over the vein with a bandage and powdered herbs, binding tightly until the next day.
And if the blood has stopped, that is good; but if not, then treat it with what was previously mentioned regarding stopping the flow of blood from the injured area.
And the stopping of the blood flow is difficult in many cases due to the small size of the wound and the possibility of the arm being tied up.
But in the case of a vein, phlebotomy is helpful by drawing blood from the highest part of the head and to the lower part of the body; because it is composed of branches of the basilica and cephalic vein, as we have said.
And the phlebotomist should be cautious during phlebotomy, for underneath that is a nerve; and if, during the incision, the phlebotomist hits the nerve, it will cause numbness, and the healing will be difficult, and often the area will not be fully healed.  This nerve is often apparent; but if it is hidden from some, and is subtle and not apparent, then you should perform the phlebotomy with a cutting instrument that avoids the nerve with strength.
And if the vein is between two nerves, then you should cut the vein lengthwise.
The benefit of phlebotomy of the cephalic vein is that it draws blood from the head and helps ailments of the eyes.
And in this case, if you want to perform phlebotomy, use a lancet made of olive wood or myrtle wood; for it is the safest of all veins, as there is no artery or nerve beneath it.
However, a boil is quite common in some men, when it is not lanced on the first touch, but do not harm any of the abscesses.
The first of these is that you must know that phlebotomy is administered only for the preservation of health and in anticipation of, and precaution against, illnesses, and that it should be performed on one of the veins of the arm, namely: the cephalic, the basilic, and the median cubital; and that phlebotomy should be performed in early spring, on an empty stomach in spring and autumn, and in winter close to a meal, when signs of congestion appear.
And phlebotomy should be performed on the third day or on the first day after three hours have passed.
But phlebotomy, when administered out of necessity or expediency, can be done at night or during the day, any hour, any time.
And it is necessary that a child not be bled until they are fourteen years old, and a pregnant woman should not be bled until the fourth month and until the seventh, and the elderly, who have already passed sixty years, should not be bled.
And if someone wishes to be bled, in any way, it is necessary that they cleanse their bowels beforehand with a leeks enema, if they have much retained waste, so that the veins do not draw the impurities from the bowels during the phlebotomy, which are impure, and do not harm the major members of the body.
And those patients suffering from nausea, vomiting, or drunkenness, or those suffering from illness or intoxication, should not be bled until this has passed from them.  Nor should those suffering from dropsy be bled.  Furthermore, phlebotomy should be avoided in cases of colic, vomiting, diarrhea,  excessive exertion or labor, prolonged fasting or vigils, and any cause that dissolves strength, whether bodily or of the spirit.
And beforehand, consider the subtle matter of the humors, whether the blood is thick due to foods and drinks, and with medicines, if possible, in order to address this.
And if no reason forbids it, then enter a bath, or be exercised, so that the blood may be thinned.
And perform the phlebotomy on the patient in the early part of the day, approximately the hour of terce, as we have said.
And be sure that the patient's feet are protected that day from all harmful animalistic affections, such as anxiety, anger, fear, and from all bodily afflictions, such as excessive labor, pain, exertion, and things similar to them.
And at his bedside, let there be present the means of which men customarily make use—aromatics and fragrances, balsams, and similar things—according to the amount possible.
And have the phlebotomist sit on a cushion higher than the cushion of the one who is to be bled.
Then, gently pull his arm, and the phlebotomist should rub it with his hand two or three times; and then tie the ligature with a strap, wrapping it around twice.
And let the constriction be moderate, for if the constriction is not tight enough, or if it is excessive, it prohibits the flow of blood; or if it is too loose, it likewise hinders the flow of blood.
And then, with the ligature in place, the person being bled should rub their hands together until the veins are swollen and clearly visible.
And then the phlebotomist should lubricate the lancet with a little old olive oil; and then place their left index finger on the vein, below the spot where they intend to make the incision, so the vein bulges slightly and the pressure is released.  For veins are like a fleeing string, drawing away from the incision; those veins are full of air, and when the lancet is placed on them, they contract toward the incision, and the phlebotomist will fail to pierce the vein; and if they do pierce the vein, that vein is constricted.
Therefore, for all these reasons, the phlebotomist must be careful and diligent.
And then, after the lancing, if the vein is opened in one try, it is good; but if not, repeat the procedure slightly below or above that spot quickly, if the area is not infected.
And if the area is infected, or the patient becomes frightened, then leave it for a day or two, and do not tighten the bandage, for that will draw the inflammation, nor should he bathe.
And then repeat the phlebotomy if necessary.
And if the incision is small and blood flows subtly, and you fear that not enough blood will be drawn, then you repeat the phlebotomy in the same vein, slightly adjusting the incision, and do this quickly before the area becomes infected, because many people get infections from a small incision.
But if the area is already infected, then do not repeat the procedure, for there is no benefit; and apply a small piece of oiled cloth, for it eases the flow of blood. And in this case, olive oil is better than other oils.
Similarly, apply oiled cloths to any phlebotomy where you are attempting to reduce the flow of blood;  therapists use theriac, aloes, and sagzea when applied over the area. This is because the blood is made thinner and is more manageable when thickened.
And if a large abscess forms at the phlebotomy site, as often happens, especially in those who have not been bled before, or where the vein was only slightly opened,  then you should compress the area and apply a sponge soaked in warm salt water for an hour, because it will resolve it.
And this should be done near the point where blood is leaving that vein, with support from that vein or another.
And if some blackness or greenish discoloration remains in the area for a few days, do not worry.  If desired, apply a mixture of aloes and myrrh dissolved, or some mint or balm extract, or something similar.
Often abscesses and swellings occur following phlebotomy of the basilica vein.
Therefore, place your hand over it, and if you find softness under your pressure, then the swelling is bad and dangerous; and then be careful not to apply anything that we've mentioned, because blood will quickly flow from the artery.
And make a poultice with something that has astringent properties, to make the area firm, and then cure it with other treatments until it heals.
One should draw blood from each person according to their constitution and the color of the blood that appears.
For if the blood is black, then you let it flow until it is red; and similarly, if you see it thick, then you let it flow until it is thinned; and similarly, if it is sharp, until its sharpness is gone.
And it is necessary for someone who is full, strong, and needs bloodletting in one session, that the phlebotomy of the vein be enlarged and the incision be wide.
And in someone who is frail, the opposite should be done, and it is necessary to draw it out in several sessions, and the opening should be narrow.
And the best method in phlebotomy is a transverse incision of the vein, not a puncture.
And this method of phlebotomy is safer from blood flow and nerve damage, and is more praiseworthy and safer than phlebotomy along the vein's length and width.
And in those who are prone to fainting during phlebotomy, you should treat them beforehand with a small piece of bread soaked in warm grape wine or simple oxymel; and draw off a quantity of blood in three or four sessions.
And if the patient is cold-natured, then before phlebotomy, they should take bread soaked in myrrh syrup or honey syrup flavored with spices such as pepper, cinnamon, ginger, and similar ones, or a strongly fragrant syrup.
And if fainting occurs during phlebotomy, and it's caused by excessive blood loss, then they should drink water from meat broth and a highly fragrant, subtle syrup; and use aromatics with camphor, and soak their feet in it.
And use the other remedies mentioned in the section on fainting due to evacuation (or, in a more modern interpretation, depletion).
And whoever wishes to heal their arm and dissolve their blood a second time, it is necessary for the phlebotomy to be a gradual evacuation, and its effect to be gentle, evacuating the blood little by little, according to the amount of the medicine's effect over the subsequent days.
But if someone wants to heal their arm, and let their blood out a second time, and their body is strong, then do this approximately seven or nine hours after the first phlebotomy.
But if one wishes to draw the blood of their body towards the opposite part of the body to which it inclines, it should be cured on the second or third day.
However, in a body where there is much heated and thickened blood, and fever is present, it is necessary to remove a large quantity of blood in one go, and to increase the incision until fainting occurs, provided you have observed all the conditions of phlebotomy; and that you place your hand on the patient's pulse, near the body of the blood, so that death instead of fainting does not ensue, for this often happens when the phlebotomist is ignorant and careless.
And it is not appropriate, when you wish to heal the arm and evacuate the blood a second time, since the opening of the vein is now closed and the blood flow is difficult, to press on it forcefully and to extend it slightly, for that is very bad.
Leave it until it is phlebotomized a second time; or this can be remedied with the sharp tool of the phlebotomist which has coagulated the blood in the vein's opening; or apply theriac, or sagzenea, to it and press gently until the blood has flowed out.
And if the vein is inflamed, then leave it and do not touch it until the inflammation subsides.
And if necessity compels you to evacuate the blood a second time, and there is no excuse, then you should bleed the patient at that location, or in the other arm, from a different vein.
And the vein called "the cord of the arm" is phlebotomized instead of the cephalic or basilic vein, when those are not found or are hidden, for it is composed of them.
And the method of phlebotomizing the patient is that the patient should immerse their hand in warm water until the vein reddens and becomes clearly visible.
And then, a ligature should be tightened around it with moderate tightness; then, phlebotomize along the small transverse vein, not laterally or longitudinally.
And if the opening is wide, make your phlebotomy with the instrument you use to phlebotomize a little above the wrist joint.
And if the flow of blood is obstructed, then you should re-immerse the hand in warm water and allow the blood to flow into the water until you achieve your desired result.
But if you are in the summer months, then you are excused from re-immersion of the hand in warm water, and in winter, the patient's body is placed in warm water.
And phlebotomy of this vein is safer than all other veins, for beneath it there is no pulsating vein or nerve.
And phlebotomy of the vein on the right wrist is appropriate for ailments of the liver.
And the procedure for phlebotomy there is that you hold the hand with a bandage or your hand, after placing it in warm water, until the vein is swollen and clearly visible; then, make a transverse incision; and if you cut it completely, that will not harm anything.
And be careful not to damage your hand with the phlebotomy, for beneath it lie the nerves of the exposed fingers.
And then return the hand to the warm water and allow the blood to flow from it, for if you do not return it to warm water, the blood will clot in the opening of the vein, and the flow is prohibited.
And when the blood has been drawn according to the necessary quantity, then you should place oil and salt on the vein so that it does not clot quickly; and similarly, you should do this on every open incision.
However, the benefit of phlebotomy on the left hand is that it is beneficial for illnesses of the spleen.
And do the same in the phlebotomy of that (other) hand, as you have done in the other.
And the benefit of phlebotomy of the vena saphena is for illnesses in the lower part of the body, such as uterine illnesses, and for retention of menses, and for illnesses of the kidneys and ulcers of the thighs and legs, and similar illnesses.
And the procedure for phlebotomy of that (part) is that the patient should immerse their foot in warm water and make friction on it until the veins are clearly visible; and tie the joint of the foot with a strap; and the location of the vein, which is clearly visible near the mentioned point, and from there branches out into many small veins on the surface of the foot.
And therefore, lance the vein from the largest branch below the leg towards the heel and close to the confluence, because this is better and more beneficial.
And if you perform phlebotomy on the surface of the foot, then be careful of the nerves beneath that on the surface of the foot, and make your phlebotomy with the instrument you use, across, as if you were slicing it.
And let the phlebotomy be done carefully.
But if the release of blood is prohibited, then you re-immerse the patient's foot in warm water and let the blood flow into it until it is evacuated.
And if the phlebotomist errs in the first attempt, then repeat the phlebotomy a little further, because the place is beneficial; and do not fear harming him, but be careful of the nerves as we have said.
And similarly, do the same for the sole of the other foot as well.
And for the sciatic vein, the location, as we have said, is below the heel, under the bone of the outside part.
And the remedy for the phlebotomy of the patient is for hip pain when it is caused by hot blood.
And the method of phlebotomy for him is that the patient should enter a bath, and tightly wrap the thigh from the side of the hip upwards to above the heel for four days with a long, thin bandage, because it only appears through this.
And therefore, when it appears, then you should perform phlebotomy on it according to any method possible and as needed, and the better way is that. Either make an incision, or cut across, because the area should be cleansed.
And it is very hidden in many men; and if you find it, and it does not appear by touching, then make a phlebotomy on a branch of it, and that is the one that appears on the back of the foot, next to the so-called auricular and annular veins.
And be careful of the nerves, and let the blood run the quantity you desire.
And then loosen the constriction, and place a cloth over the phlebotomy site and press the area, because it will quickly heal.
Concerning cupping and the qualities of their use.
Cupping is made of horns, or of earthenware, or of glass.
And cupping is done in two ways: one of them is with scarification and the extraction of blood, and the other is cupping without scarification.
And this cupping without scarification is done in two ways, because it is either with fire or without fire.
And for the cuppings that are administered with scarification and blood extraction, there are fourteen places on the body, of which one is placed on the occiput, and it is the rear part of the head; and another place is on both sides of the neck; and cupping on the chin, below the jaw, and below the mouth; and cupping on both shoulder blades; and cupping on the upper arm, and it is on the end of the arm; and cupping on the forearm, it is on the two arms; and cupping on the two calves; and cupping on the two thighs.
And cupping does not extract blood from the large veins, but rather from the small scattered veins in the flesh, and therefore it does not diminish the strength of those veins, as is the case with phlebotomy; and it is not necessary that cupping be done with fire or without fire in any disease caused by fullness, until the whole body is evacuated.
However, if necessity compels cupping for an illness or for a chronic condition, we administer it at any time, at the beginning of the month, at the end of the month, and in the middle of the month, and at any time.
And therefore, when any of these causes occur, and especially if it is in the third or middle part of the month, then we command cupping to be done after two or three hours have passed.
The benefit of cupping the nape of the neck is that when it alleviates heaviness in the head and that which is pressing on the eyes; however, this should be done after evacuation of the whole body.
And this cupping is in the location of the cephalic vein's bloodletting.
And it is not permitted for one who is cold or has a cold to use it, for it causes great harm to them.
And therefore, it is not appropriate for the elderly, and for those whose ailments are cold, to use it.
But for those who are continuously unwell, this treatment causes oblivion; and therefore, you should instruct the cupper to gently move the cup slightly downwards in sections, fearing the generation of oblivion.
But cupping with alcohol is in the place of bloodletting from the vena fusca and basilica veins: and therefore, it is effective for asthma, and chest constriction, and the splitting of the chest organ, and coughs, and congestion.
And the alcohol cupping should be slightly raised, for if it is placed too low, it engenders weakness in the body and stomach.
And cupping with *alhagdahan* is effective for accidental head pains, and ophthalmia, and migraine, and fever, and toothache; and it is a substitute for bloodletting from the basilica vein.
And you must instruct the cupper not to press their hand with excessive force during the scarification, so as not to cut the artery and cause a flow of blood.
And cupping under the chin is effective for ulcers in the mouth, and gum decay, and similar mouth ailments, and it is a substitute for bloodletting of the  (veins?) situated in both lips.
However, cupping performed over the two shoulder blades is effective for caput, which is caused by an excess of heat.
And cupping on the two parts within the armpits is as effective as bloodletting from three veins, namely the basilica, the cephalic, and the median cubital vein, because it draws blood from all the smaller veins in the flesh, and these smaller veins draw from the larger veins, until the draw is focused into the three veins.
And instruct the cupper not to proceed too deeply with the scarification, because the area is lacking in flesh, and below it are nerves and arteries.
And a cupping treatment applied to the buttocks is effective for hemorrhoids and ulcers lower down (in the anus).
And you should tell the cupper to use a large, strong cupping glass, as the area needs a strong suction; flimsy, small cupping glasses are ineffective and should be avoided; use scarification instead.
However, cupping of the legs is less effective in dealing with manifest problems, as it draws blood from the entire body, and it's helpful for longstanding pain in the kidneys, the uterus, and the bladder; it stimulates menstruation, and it's useful for fevers and chills.  It is comparable to bloodletting from two veins, and in that case, is effective also for the treatment of some coughs and other illnesses.
However, it greatly weakens the whole body and can cause fainting in many men.
And the benefit of cupping for coughs is similar to the benefit of cupping both legs.
And the proper application of cupping is to place the initially empty cupping glass and to use a moderate suction, and do not prolong the application of cupping glasses, but rather apply them gently, and remove them quickly, and allow the humors to return to the area gradually. And do not stop repeating this and continuing until you see the area already reddened and swollen and that the redness of the blood appears.
And then you scarify and repeat the suction gradually, and then consider the constitution of the body.
For that person who has delicate skin and is prone to bruising, you should scarify them only once, so the area does not become ulcerated.
And instruct the cupper to enlarge the scarification slightly, and to moderate the suction gently.
And if the blood is thick, then you should scarify twice, for in the first instance you open the path for the blood and its watery part to be thinned out. But in the second, you achieve the removal of the thick blood through scrutiny.
And if the blood is very impure, then a third scarification should be performed to achieve the final result.
And finally, when we want to extract little blood gradually, a single scarification is sufficient.
And if we want to extract a lot of blood, we scarify many times; and if we know the blood is thick, then we should scarify deeply.
And the depth of the scarification should be only the length of the lancet's blade.
And if the area where the lancet is to be used is thick, hard, dark, and its pores are tight, then the spots for the cupping glasses should be rubbed with gentle, opening, and resolving ointments; if it is summer, such as almond oil, violet oil, mild honey oil, or chamomile oil; and if it is winter, then narcissus oil, lily oil, chamomile oil, or blood root oil, and similar ones.
And if the superfluity is thick and cold, then the oil should be of marjoram, or balm, or almond, or dill, and similar ones.
However, if the cupping area has wide pores of soft flesh, then oil should be avoided, and the cupping locations should be washed with water or with cold spring water, or with cucumber water, or with rosemary water, and similar ones.
And if the area from which the blood is of moist nature, wash the cupping marks with sour wine, or with water of myrtle and sumac, and similar things.
And for those whose superfluities are thick, wash their cupping marks with old wine, or with water of plantain (possibly meaning a type of herb), or with an infusion of dill, or of chamomile, and similar things.
And the cupping should be guarded before a bath; after the bath it should be administered about an hour or two later, and the patient should rest/sleep after the cupping.
What is that which must be regulated in cupping or bloodletting before cupping?
One must consider at the start: if the person to be cupped or bled is choleric and has hot blood and inflammation, then it is necessary for them to take cooling things, such as milgrain (possibly a type of herb), pickled greens, endive in sour wine, lettuce, and secanabin (likely a type of herb or preparation), juleps, and their similar counterparts.
And withhold from them foods like lentils, and lean poultry meat, and dishes seasoned with sour ingredients, and similar foods.
And for one whose constitution is cold, it is necessary for them to drink althea syrup, or syrup made from the seeds of secanabin, and sumac, and wine slightly more aged, neither too young nor too old; and they should be told to consume little food and drink, and to avoid foods such as lentils, hempseed, pigeons and small birds.
And it is necessary that on the day of cupping and bloodletting, the drink should be more plentiful than the food.
And it is necessary to give some men, at certain times, theriac or musky remedies, or musk itself, or alcelita, before cupping or bloodletting, or afterward, so that the principal members are strengthened and the blood is refined; and they should not take these remedies heated.
But the cups that are used without incisions should be placed over the liver, the spleen, gout, and the navel, on the knee areas, and the groin area, for these members cannot tolerate incisions upon them.
And these are not sought for anything other than the drawing of blood from a member, just as we place a cup over the nipple in a disease of blood flow from the nose; and we use this to disperse cold, viscous air from the member, just as we place it on the abdomen and the navel, for that clarifies the member, warms it, and alleviates the pain by resolving the air.
And it is already placed upon the kidneys when there is blockage or congestion in them, for by the power of strong suction, it easily opens up the blockage and removes the congestion from its place.
And similarly, it works when placed upon the liver and spleen to dispel the air trapped within them.
And these cups are administered empty, with suction only; and sometimes they are administered with fire.
And sometimes they are administered full of warm water in diseases of the spleen.
And this is so that the cupping glass is filled and larger, that is, with warm water alone or water in which herbs suitable for this purpose have been boiled.
The form of a cupping glass administered with fire: let the width of the opening be two fingers, as we have formed it; and the quantity of the opening be half a palm; and let it be on his side, in the place that is in the circumference, half of it, the hole being small, according to the quantity that a needle can enter into it.
Let it be made of a reddish or citrus wood, with thick edges, leathery, and smooth, so that it does not injure the limb from its placement on it.
And there should be a transverse rod of wood or iron in the middle, where a candle with fire is placed.
And let this cupping glass be larger than the one we have described; and the small one smaller than that, according to the illnesses and the age of the one who uses it.
And the cupping glasses for children and the weakened are different from the cupping glasses for young people and those with strong bodies.
And the way to apply this cupping glass with fire to the limb is to heat the cup with wood fire properly, using a small beeswax candle, and placing that on the middle of the transverse rod in the middle of the cupping glass, so that the fire is ignited around the area below, so that the patient's body is not burned.
And it should then be placed on the patient's limb, and the finger should be over the opening we mentioned, until when we have the cupping glasses and we do not want the finger to obstruct and the vapor to escape through that opening, then the cupping glass will quickly be detached.
And heat the cup according to its method, and repeat it if necessary.
But a cupping glass used for a pleurisy ailment, with water, in which there is no transverse rod nor opening, and is administered only by filling it with water, and is placed directly onto the limb.
And this is its form:  The larger this cupping glass, the better, so that it can receive a large quantity of water.
Chapter 97.
Leeches are not administered to most limbs, but to those limbs where cupping is not possible, due to their small size, such as the penis, gums, and similar areas; or to limbs lacking flesh, such as the penis, nose, and similar areas.
And the quality of using those leeches is that they must be found in clean, clear spring water.
And they should be left in fresh water day and night until they are hungry, and that nothing remains in their stomach; and then, the body should be emptied first with bloodletting and cupping; and then, rub the patient's limb until it reddens; and then, place them on it.
And when they are full and settled.
And if suction of the area with a cupping vessel is possible, it is even better for healing.
And if not, then wash the area with vinegar and then with clean water; and it should be rubbed and squeezed.
And if the flow of blood from the leeches' bite prolongs, and it is oozing, then you should soak a cloth in cool water and place it over the area until the oozing subsides.
And if the blood is excessive, then sprinkle on it powdered vitriol, or other similar styptic agents, until the bleeding stops; or put roasted bean halves on the area, and leave them until the beans adhere to the site, and the bleeding stops.
And if necessary, repeat the application of leeches, when possible, changing them.
And if the use of leeches is prohibited, then the area should be rubbed with fresh blood, or a needle should be stuck in the area until blood comes out; and then apply them, for when they sense blood they immediately adhere.
And when you want them to detach, sprinkle a little powdered alum, or salt, or ashes, on them, and they will detach immediately.
Thus begins the treatment of the third part: of restoration. This chapter is very necessary in the art of medicine; and it is the restoration of fractures and dislocations that accidentally occur in the bones.
O, son, know that foolish and ignorant physicians and those who have never looked into the books of the ancients nor read a single letter of them disdain this chapter.
And for this reason, this method of learned men in our land is disregarded; and I have not forgotten this at all; and I have not applied this from what I learned, but through the length of reading the books of the ancients and studying their meaning, until I have extracted the science from them.
And now I turn to experiment and study throughout my life.
And I have now described in this chapter everything that contains my knowledge and upon which my experience is based; since I have shortened it for you all and freed it from tedious length; and I have shortened it at the end of the shortening; and I have shown it at the end of the explanation; and I have shaped in this many forms of the instruments that are administered in this case, as is done through the addition of the explanation, just as I have done in the two preceding chapters.
First Chapter.
A summary and collection of the elements of bone fractures, those which are necessary preliminaries before we begin to recall the fractured members and their various types. Therefore, let us begin this chapter with the summaries of the subject matter; and the chapters whose understanding is initially necessary for practitioners and to establish the truth of these matters—this is for you and for those who are ready to learn or to teach this noble art, other than yourselves.
And so I say that when someone suffers a fracture, dislocation, twist, or injury, then it is necessary that you first apply phlebotomy or some other treatment, or both, if no reason forbids it, such as weakness of the body, or if the person is a child, or an elderly person in decline, or if it is a time of intense heat, or intense cold.
And afterward, the patient should eat fresh herbs and the meat of birds and rabbits; and we prohibit fatty meats and foods that fill the veins with blood, until you are certain of a healthy resolution, and if you do not fear a discharge of matter from the limb.
And then return the patient to his/her former regimen, the one to which he/she is accustomed.
And so, when the broken bone begins to mend, then the patient must eat nourishing foods, of a substantial, thick, and heavy nature, in which there is viscosity, such as foods made of cooked wheat with water, and rice, and porridge, and the haunches, and bellies of cows, and eggs, and fresh fish, and thick wines and similar to these, and with this regimen the fracture coagulates more quickly and better.
And know that broken bones in people who are frail or in their old age, cannot be completely healed and consolidated according to nature because of the drying out of their limbs.
However, nature adjusts and brings together around the broken bone, from every side, something resembling glue in which there is thickness that adheres to and binds it tightly until it is completely joined and held together, until it reaches a state of strength and firmness, like fire at the beginning, until nothing prevents it from completing its work.
And for this reason, it is necessary that the patient's diet consists of foods that are heavy, viscous, and thick, as we have said.
And know that the types of fractures are diverse according to the diversity of the limbs, for a fracture of the leg bone is different from a fracture of the head bone; and a fracture of the foot bone is different from a fracture of the arm bone; and similarly, all the other limbs have different types of fractures.
And I will return with a reminder of every type of fracture, explained in its own separate chapter.
A great diversity of fractures in itself. And the types of bone fractures themselves are diverse; for a fracture is sometimes arched, or occurs in star-like patterns; and sometimes a fracture occurs along the length of the bone: and these are fractures of the bone, jagged, splintered, and with accompanying and non-accompanying damage, just as happens in a document when it is prepared to be written, and there are fractures with a flat surface and a disruption in the head of the bone, and small fissures.
And for every type, there is a specific remedy or treatment for restoring it, according to the separate reminder given in its proper place.
Clear sign of a bone fracture. And by this is a fracture of the bone known: it is a twisting of it, and from that prominence and appearance of it to the touch, and this from when you press it with your hand.
Therefore, when there is no apparent twisting in the location, nor is there anything felt upon touching the bone with force, and the patient does not experience great pain, then there is no fracture.
However, it is possible that there is a twisting or small fissure, in which case you should not press that with your hand and apply pressure all around; instead, place some medicines over it, which have the appropriate effect on that particular moment for the location; and then be tightened with a subtle constriction.
And know that if the location is bent but not split in two or otherwise damaged, and the affected part has been wholly removed from its position, then you should begin, immediately, to straighten it, before a painful abscess occurs there.
And if a painful abscess occurs there, then leave it alone for a few days until the abscess subsides; and then try to heal it using any method you can, with gentleness and ingenuity.
And know that the restoration and healing of the soft tissues are easier than that of a bone that has been broken.
And then strengthen it according to the healing that will follow.
But if the bone is broken, then the broken limb (whether hand or foot) needs to be extended in two parts.  If the limb is small, then use your hand to do this; or use two cords, or one cord and your hand.
And place the limb in its natural position while the broken limb parts are extended.  Then, use ingenuity and any method you can to return those additions to their proper places.
And be careful, so that your procedure doesn't cause the patient pain or injury.  Do your best to join the bone to its fellow bone in the best possible way.
And at that time, you should carefully touch it with your hand.  If you find any different or unusual cause, correct it and fix it with all your skill.
Avoid excessive stretching and compression, as some foolish doctors often cause suppuration or contraction in the limb through their procedures, as we have seen in many such cases.
The specifics of how to treat the calmed limb are what I recommend; so that you understand that broken limbs vary in size, shape, and form.
For those that are small, such as the arm, finger, or foot, and similar parts, the wrapping should be with a very thin, soft cloth.
However, for larger parts such as the thigh or leg, the wrapping needs to be firm and strong, for a firm bandage connects the large limb and tightly binds it all over, so that no injury occurs.
Then begin, and with your correct application, place a suitable bandage over the fracture site, using three or four wraps, depending on the limb's needs; and gently hold the bandage in place.
And then, move toward the highest point of the fracture site, and tighten the bandage less than you did when securing the fracture site itself. And then, gradually unwrap the bandage from the fracture site a little, and loosen the tightness bit by bit, until a significant portion of the site is free.
And then take another bandage and wrap it again over the broken site with a bandage, and now move the wraps to the lowest part of the fracture; and your operation should be in tightening the bandage and loosening it, as we said in the first wrapping above.
And then place strips of linen or cloth, where the fracture is twisted, if there is twisting; and if not, place no such thing there.
And then place another bandage over this, and quickly apply appropriate splints over these well-made wraps, if there is no inflammation or hot abscess in the area.  If there is, place on it whatever relieves the abscess and reduces the inflammation; leave that on for a few days; and then you tighten the splints over it.
And the splints should be made from half a rod of wood, or well-shaped wood, or from pinewood; or from palm branches, and each splint should have a width according to this shape and this form:
However, the splint placed over the fracture should be slightly thicker and wider than the other splints, and the length of the splint according to the limb's size and smallness;  then tighten the splints with another bandage, following your initial tightening; and then bind it securely with thread, as we have said regarding tightening, and your tightening should be precisely over the fracture site and the tighter the bandage, the less its length beyond the fracture.
And the threads should be moderate in thickness and fineness, and should be of linen; and if the threads are too thick, as I have seen in the operation of some fools using their ropes or twisted cords as threads, this is a great mistake, because it disrupts the evenness of the tightening.
Also, excessively thin threads are not suitable, for you will not be able to achieve the desired tightening with them.  And there should be at least a finger's width of space between each splint.
And if the patient complains of the ends of the splints pressing on their skin in the tight areas, then place some soft material like wool or coloured wool beneath them, so as not to cause him injury.
Sometimes a fracture is accompanied by a wound, and a disruption in the bone occurs, and I will discuss this in the second chapter regarding its peculiarities.
And know that not every broken limb should be splinted on the first day;  the reason for this is that when a limb is severely injured, you should not place splints on it until after about 5, or 7, or more days, depending on your assessment of the risk of a suppurative inflammation developing.
And this is the method of poultices with which the ancients repaired fractures, dislocations, and sprains.
A common method of poultice for fracture repair, suitable for many constitutions, especially women and children, because it does not produce heat or cold: you should take powdered flour, specifically the fine flour dust that collects in the mill walls when the grinding is happening.
And prepare it just as it is, but mix it with egg white, and make a poultice of it, not too thick nor too thin; then use it.
Another method of poultice for repairing fractures, dislocations, and sprains:  take asafoetida, opoponax, acacia, enula, and wild milfoil root, all 1/2 ounce; myrrh and aloes, 1/4 ounce;  aloeswood, 2 ounces. Grind and sift all ingredients, and mix them with ale or with egg white if the patient's constitution is hot; then use this poultice, as it is a good compound and restores slightly broken bones, and is beneficial to many people.
Another method of poultice beneficial for fractures and sprains: take wild milfoil and white marshmallow root, ½ ounce each; myrrh and aloes, ¼ ounce each; acacia, 6 drams; and Armenian bole, 2 ounces.
All are ground finely in a mortar, sifted, and mixed with water or egg white, and then applied.
A method of poultice for joints and bones dislocated from their places, and for pain, cracks, and fractures: take linen cloth, soak it in sour wine and cooked olive oil, and place it on the affected area.
However, this poultice does not have the virtue of restoring [broken bones], but rather is useful for resolving hot abscesses and expelling pain directly.
Another method of poultice that restores a broken bone: take leaves of wild fig and leaves of wild poppy; pound them together and make a poultice from them.
A shortened method of poultice for the restoration of a fractured bone, and when you want the resolution of the remaining abscess: take roots of marshmallow, chamomile, violet flowers, and flour of eryngo; all are to be ground separately and mixed with wine if the limb is not inflamed.
But if it is inflamed, then treat it with moistened coriander water, or with water and its use.
Another method of poultice, even stronger in resolving than the first, when a hard abscess occurs for the restoration of a limb: take roots of marshmallow, seeds of flax, and comfrey, melilot, marjoram, violet flowers, chamomile, all separately; all are to be ground together and mixed with willow water or plain water, or wine, depending on the quality of the limb and the color (or condition) of it.
However, Hippocrates in his book does not say that a poultice should be placed on the fractured limb for its restoration, but rather a cerot (plaster) made of wax and oil, and not anything else; and he recommends it to be of medium thickness, neither too thick nor too thin.
However, in Gaul, it is seen that poultices are placed on the broken limb for its restoration, and the ingredients that are drying with slight warmth, such as myrrh, frankincense, and similar things to those we have mentioned.
Method of a plaster to treat injury and pain: take equal parts of cheese, human skin (or perhaps bird skin), marshmallow root, and salt; grind them together, sift the mixture, and form a plaster.
However, the length of time the bandage should remain, and when it should be removed, depends on whether pain, swelling, or a fracture has occurred and if the bone is out of place.  If none of these are present, you should not remove it for several days. And if severe pain, swelling, or inflammation occurs at the site, then you should loosen or remove it immediately, and remove the plaster.
And take a linen cloth and a dampened piece of sea sponge, and immerse it in lukewarm water, and wash the area with it until the swelling subsides and the pain is relieved; then let the limb rest for an hour.  Then place a piece of wool soaked in sour wine and oil (or olive oil), and bind it over the area for one night until you are sure that an inflamed abscess has not developed, and the swelling of the limb and pain has subsided.
Then repeat this process of applying the thin bandage and small plaster, but do not compress it as forcefully as you did initially, and continue until it is healed.
And if the abscess, stiffness, pain, inflammation, and all the symptoms have completely disappeared, and you no longer need a plaster and bandage, then you should repeat the treatment in the same way you did initially.
And if no symptoms like those we have mentioned appear on the limb, then do not remove it until about three, four, five, or seven days; and sometimes it is left for twenty days, depending on how the limb responds to the treatment, as we have said, until the fracture adheres and the flesh around it consolidates.
And then adjust the bandage more tightly than in your initial application, and adjust the patient's diet according to their recovery process.
However, if you find the fracture site has dried out and weakened more than necessary, then know that nourishment is unable to reach it. Therefore, apply lukewarm water every time you remove the bandage, and do this for three days.  Loosen the bandage slightly, and through this action, nourishment flows back to the limb, and it heals quickly.
But what those foolish bone-setters do, in resetting a broken limb a second time when it wasn't correctly set the first time, according to need, and is instead set with contortions, is an error in their procedure, a great danger. If they had done it correctly, the Ancients would have written about it in their books, and would have worked in this way.
And I have not seen any of them do this, therefore it is more reasonable that you should not do it.
Second Chapter: Of fractures when occurring to the head.
The types of fractures are numerous, and their shapes are diverse, and the causes are distinct, for some fractures are caused by a blow of a club, and the blow crushes all the bone down to the skull, just as it does to a tree trunk.  This type is thus called a comminuted fracture; or the club strikes a part of the bone, and cuts into the flesh, but does not penetrate through to the back of the bone. This type of fracture is called a simple fracture.
And the severity of these two types of fractures is either great or small, and another type of fracture is a crushing or a tearing; and the cause of this is a blow with a stone or falling on rock, and similar things.
And this fracture is either penetrating, approaching the membrane beneath the bone, or on the surface of the bone, and the severity of these two types of fractures is either great or small.
And a fracture is also hidden within the bone, in the smallness of a hair's breadth, and thus this type of fracture is called a hairline fracture.
And a fracture is made either by falling or by striking with a stone or similar object, that causes a sliver of bone to move into the surrounding tissue.  It happens in a concave place, just as it happens to the ribs when they are struck and a portion of them is driven inward.
This happens most often in the soft bones of young children.
And in all these types of fractures, the fragments, are like separated shards. And I will come with a remedy for all of that, putting it back in its place.
And we recognize all these types of fractures by feeling them, and by investigating them with probes and examination of any decaying flesh around them.
A particular fracture is known because it is exposed on the bone, and it is wiped clean and examined with a probe, for the fracture appears dark/black.
But in the treatment of a fracture, first consider the patient's symptoms, and if you see, through the symptoms, that they indicate severe danger, like vomiting of bile,  extremities, loss of consciousness, loss of voice, syncope, high fever, and swelling and stiffness of the affected areas, and similar symptoms as those in major cases, without doubt, the patient is not going to recover.
And if you see symptoms that are not severe, you hope for recovery, and then you begin the treatment.
The reason for this is that if the patient came to you at the beginning of the illness, and this is in the winter days, then you must examine the bone within 14 days, according to all the circumstances.
And if it is in the summer days, then you must try to set the bone within 7 days, lest the soft tissue under the bone be corrupted by the pannicol, and the symptoms we have discussed occur.
And if the fracture has already reached the soft tissue covering the brain, and there are small broken and crushed pieces, then you must cut away the broken and crushed pieces, as I will instruct you.
And you must examine the head of the sick patient, and uncover the bone according to the customary and appropriate method, as best you can, considering the nature of the injury, and be gentle with the patient.
And if you encounter detection of bone, blood flow, or a hot abscess, then you must deal with it as needed, and you should fill the area with cloths soaked in wine and rubbed oil, and allow the injury to rest until the abscess subsides, and the blood flow is under control; and then begin with the treatment of the bone and its removal.
And this should be done according to one of two surgical methods.
And one method is that you cut the bone with a narrow scalpel, and this is its form:  And then apply another scalpel, a little wider than the first; and this is its form:
And then apply a scalpel wider than the second one.
And it is necessary that you have several different scalpels, some wider than others, and some of them shorter than others, and they should be sharpened at the ends, and made of tempered iron or steel.
And use them with ease in striking the scalpel so that you do not strike the head and dull it.
And if the bone is strong, hard, then it is necessary to perforate around it before you apply the scalpels with the drills, which are called non-deepening drills.
And they are not called thus (non-deepening drills)  except because they do not reach the surface of the bone next to it, because the drill has a round end or edge on which is below the pointed head, like a small edge or circle, which prevents it from sinking and going through the thickness of the bone.
And it is convenient that you take a large number of these drills, each suited to the thickness of each bone, so that you have available on every bone of the skull a drill head that is sharp, with a length and width appropriate to the thickness of that specific bone.
And this is the method for three types of drills:  To drill around a fractured bone, place the drill on the bone and turn it with your fingers until you know the bone is penetrated; then switch the drill to another location, and place it where there is space between the holes approximately the width of the ray or roughly that.
Then, with scalpels, cut between each hole in the bone, making it as thin as possible, as we have said, until you remove the bone, either with your hand or with another tool such as pliers or fine forceps.
And you must be very careful that the scalpel does not touch any part of the spinal column.
And when you have drilled around the bone, and if it is connected to the spinal column, separate it, and extract it, you should scrape and smooth the rough edges of the bone with another tool similar to a scalpel, but it should be thinner and finer than the other scalpels.
And if any small bone fragments remain, then remove them easily with your tools; and then treat the wound with liniments and ointments as we have described.
Another method of operation is gentle, free of fear, which is described by Gaul and praised highly; and this is his method:  It is necessary for you at the beginning to begin uncovering the area of the bone where the fracture is most severe and noticeable, until, once you have uncovered that area, and placing the end of this slow and gentle scalpel – which is of this shape – beneath it...
And the lentil-shaped part is smooth and does not cut anything, and the sharp part is on two sides along its length, as you see; so that the lentil-shaped part is fitted to the spinal column with its sharp cutting face against the bone.
Then strike the scalpel on one side with a small mallet until the entire bone is cut easily, as it is turned, and you are sure that no accident happens to it in any way, and if the physician were the most foolish of all men and most ignorant of their craft, certainly, and if he were asleep.
Then, if any cause remains attached to the bone in some areas, cut that away with the end of the lentil-shaped scalpel, and release it easily, for it is released without harm and without fear.
And if the fracture of the bone does not penetrate to the flesh, and what is cut away or removed from the bone is only its surface, and there remains roughness and subtle irregularities, then it is necessary to scrape away that roughness and eliminate those irregularities with fine razors, for which you have prepared a number of different sizes, so that you can apply the most suitable and most appropriate ones to every part according to how you progress with the operation on the broken bone and its shape.
And you should use the widest of those razors at the beginning of your scraping action on the bone, and then gradually use the finer ones, and do not stop doing this until you reach the finest and most subtle of all those razors.
But in each of the other smaller, capillary fractures and subtle breaks, you should administer care according to what you find to be best for their correction.
And it is a cause that is not hidden from all those who have studied this art. And what we have written here applies to large fractures.
And if the skin is retracted when you expose the bone, then you should take cloth according to the size of the wound, soak it in warm oil, and place it over the wound opening; then take another cloth, doubled or tripled, and soak it in wine and warm oil, and place that over the first cloth, doing this as gently as possible to not press on the flesh.  Then apply a wide bandage over that, but do not tighten it except to the degree necessary to hold the wound closed.
And leave it with this treatment for a day or two until you are certain of a healthy healing; then remove it and apply medicines for excess dryness, such as flaxseed, barley flour, and powders of incense and similar herbs.
And you should make a powder from these medicines, pulverized and dry, and generally apply any medicine that has the property of cleansing but does not cause pain to the wound.
And be mindful, through your skill, that the wound is clean throughout its healing process.  Avoid the use of ointments or other substances that might cause festering; do not allow virulence to accumulate there, for when it accumulates on the membrane covering the brain, it corrupts and rots it, and will cause the patient great and grievous harm.
And if, in the patient's head, the bone is exposed, especially if the treatment is neglected and there is blackness on the surface, and if you see the aforementioned harmful symptoms in the patient, know that it is dangerous without a doubt.
And if the blackness is not from the wound itself, but from the medicine applied, and the medicine is the cause of this blackness, then take one part honey and three parts of rubbed oil, use these to soak a cloth, and place it over the wound.  Then treat it with appropriate healing remedies until it is healed.
Chapter 3.
Of the restoration of the nose when it is broken.
Know that the nose is not broken in a single, absolute sense, but in two separate parts most often, or sometimes in just one. This is because there are two bones in the nose, since the lower part is cartilaginous and is not broken, and only shows abrasion, twisting, and deformity.
But if only one of the two parts of the nose is broken, then you must insert your little finger into the nose, and use your index finger to gently push the fracture back into its natural position.  Use your thumb on the outside to aid in this. And do this gently, taking care not to cause the patient unnecessary pain with your procedure.
And if the fracture is in the most prominent part of the nose, and the finger cannot reach it, then it should be set with a blunt end of a small instrument/tool.
And if the fracture is in two parts, then you do the same (as above).
And try to restore it on the first day after the fracture, if possible; if not, then approximately on the seventh or tenth day, you should apply a poultice/dressing to the sore.
And approximately insert a piece of linen cloth into the nose, if the fracture is in one part, or place two pads, if the fracture is in two parts, and let the padding/pad be of such thickness to fill the nasal cavity.
Some of the ancient healers say that the pads should be soaked in broth and changed daily, but I don't find that to be necessary;  instead, I suggest the pad should be soaked in a beaten egg mixture with powdered herbs, and leave it until the bone is healed and the cartilage is hardened.
And sometimes, instead of a pad, a linen bandage is placed in the nose, especially if the nasal fracture is severe and breathing is difficult for the patient.
And this method is not necessary for you; and if you want, do it this way, or if you want, do it with pads.
And if an abscess develops later, plaster the nose with a cerot (a type of plaster) or with cotton soaked in sour wine and roasted oil, or with diachylon.
However, if a superficial abscess does not develop, then you should plaster the exterior with wheat flour and powdered herbs mixed with beaten egg; then place a linen bandage over it and do not bind the nose with anything else.
But if the nasal bones are fractured or broken into small pieces, then you must cut open the area, and remove those fragments using suitable instruments; and then close the wound, healing it with things that promote flesh growth and consolidation, and with appropriate plasters.
And if a pimple appears inside the nose, then you must treat it with pads and administer lead cannulas until it is completely healed.
Chapter 4.
Of the restoration of the jaw when it is fractured.
When the lower jaw is broken and the fracture is not accompanied by an open wound, observe whether the fracture is simply displaced, and not broken into two pieces but bent inward, in that case, its reduction is simple.
And therefore, if the fracture is on the right side, you must insert your left index finger into the patient's mouth; and similarly, if the fracture is on the left jaw, then insert the said index finger of your right hand; and push the prominence of the fracture inward with ease towards the outside, with your other hand on the outside of the bone; in this way, gently align it.
And if the fracture of the jaw is already separated into two, then it is necessary to apply traction to both parts according to their alignment until the alignment of the jaw is possible.
And if you encounter displacement of teeth along with a fracture, then hold those you expect to remain in place with gold, silver, or silk thread; then place a compress on the fractured jaw, and then place a double cloth over it, and place a large, properly made plaster, or a single piece of linen the length of the jaw; and then bind it as your method of binding dictates and the application requires, until it is no longer disrupted.
And command the patient to use rest and tranquility, and provide him with easily digestible light food.
And if you estimate that the shape has been altered in any way, then you should remove and loosen it on the third day; and then rectify what has been altered and plaster it with powdered chalk, with egg white, or with powdered sesame, after you have removed the compress, and place soft wool over the plaster.
Then, when this plaster is firmly attached and the bone's position is not altered, leave it; do not remove it until the fracture is healed and strong; for frequently, this fracture is healed in three weeks.
And if another time a hot abscess occurs, then administer what we have often said for its reduction until it is healed, and the abscess is resolved.
And if the fracture is with a wound, then consider if it is a piece of bone separated or splinters, then you must carefully remove those splinters with what is suitable for their removal from the instruments.
And if the opening of the wound is narrow, then you should enlarge it with leeches according to the amount of your need.
And after you have removed those splinters, and nothing remains of them, then you should close the opening of the wound if it is wide; and if not, place one of the appropriate plasters over it and let it heal until it is sound.
Chapter 5.
Concerning the restoration of the furcula when it is broken.
Often the furcula is broken in the part in front of the muscle, and this fracture occurs in one of three ways.
When it is broken, or separated, or separated into two parts without any splinters; and it is easy to restore it; or it is such that splinters are present, and it is difficult to restore it; or it is such that the fracture is with a wound.
And the operation in that case, when the fracture is without a wound, is that you have two assistants present, so that one holds and steadies the broken furcula, and the other extends the wing (collar bone) towards that part.
And then gently close the fracture with your fingers until its shape is correct, and is neither too prominent nor concave.
And if you need more extension, then you should place under the patient's armpit a pad of cloth or wool, of a size according to your need; and extend and elevate the furcula and hold the pad with your hand until you have closed the fracture correctly.
And if you cannot pull the end of the furcula back into place because it has become lodged (or pushed) out of position, then the patient should be placed lying on their back, and a moderately sized cushion should be placed on the muscle of their neck.
And the assistant should press on the muscle below the area until the furcula bone that is lodged above is lifted, and then you should straighten the fracture and close it with your fingers.
But if you feel any splinters or fragments of the furcula, then you should break them off and remove them easily.
And if it is lodged in the bone, then you should make an incision there with one of the scalpels you have prepared for this, having first placed under the furcula the instrument that aids in the cleaving (or splitting); and this instrument is of wood or iron, of this shape:
And it is similar to a scoop, of which this is the concave part; and its width should be according to your needs, according to the size of the bone or the smallness of the wound.
But its length should be as much as possible during the operation; it should have two ends, like a pair of tongs, and one end should be wide and the other narrow.
And if the opening of the wound you made when you extracted the splinter from the bone is wide, and you are certain of a suppurating inflammation, then you should close the two edges of the wound with stitches.
And if the opening is small, or you fear a suppurating inflammation, then you should fill the wound with cloths and powders according to the extent of the wound's opening.
And if suppuration occurs, then soak a cloth in sour wine and rubbed oil and wine, and place it over that.
And be sure that the splint is not moved from the broken bone.  Therefore, you should visit the patient daily, and when the ligaments have softened or you notice the splint has already been dislodged, you should then correct this and tighten the bandage.
Then place the patient's head on a pillow, and under their armpit, place a small cushion beneath the pillow at night, so that the patient's arm is elevated away from the side of the injury, and the fracture of the collarbone is raised to reduce the strain on the muscles, or in the case of a broken arm, it's elevated away from the torso.
And do not loosen the bandage unless suppuration or a boil occurs in the area, within twelve days.
And then renew the plaster if you see the patient's skin reacting to it, and adjust the splint and restore it, and leave it until the fracture of the collarbone is restored and has clotted.
And it is tightened and comforted according to the method in twenty-eight days, and sometimes in some individuals it is done in less time than that.
Chapter 6.
Of the restoration of a shoulder fracture.
The shoulder blade is fractured at the side of it and not broken off from it, but only the edges.
And therefore, when the area is fractured—and it is fractured in the middle of it—and it is only known by touch, then, according to the nature of the fracture, prepare it and return it to its natural shape using any means possible.
And then, place pulverized chalk mixed with egg white and linen bandages over the area; then, place a double layer of cloth; and finally, place a thin, flat piece of wood, slightly larger than the entire shoulder blade, or a little more.
But if beneath the board there is a hollow in any part of the shoulder blade, then fill that hollow with linen bandages, and then raise the board to an even height.
And then, bind tightly with a long bandage, with appropriate constriction and firmness on the board, until it is fixed in place.
And consider the bandage every day; and whenever it softens, bandage again and tighten it, and re-adjust the board if it has shifted from its position.
And have the patient lie on their sound side.
And the shoulder blade is restored in 20 or 25 days.
And therefore, when this number of days is complete, then you dissolve the bandage, and know for certain that the condition is of those bones whose connection is not feared, nor their dissolution.
And if you proceed from the location of the pressed bone and place a splint beneath it, then you cut above it, remove it, and do as we have said in the fracture of the furcula, applying a cautery if there is an abscess there.
Chapter 7.
Of the restoration of the fracture of the foot.
The foot is sometimes broken in the middle, and this is quite painful; but its extremities are more prone to being crushed and broken into fragments.
And the symptoms when it is broken in the middle are that it inclines to the inside parts, causing great pain, difficulty in breathing, coughing, severe weakness, and vomiting blood; and the cavity in the broken bone is evident and not hidden from feeling.
And the restoration of it is to lay the patient on their back, placing a cushion between their shoulders; and then apply pressure to the muscles, and align the bones on either side with the hands of two assistants, and be subtle in the operation and in the adjustment in every possible and appropriate manner, until the bone returns to its proper shape.
Then place a plaster and bandage on it, and put beneath it a thin splint of willow or reed, or similar lightweight material, then wrap that in cloth; and then carefully apply the bandage to the broken bone to prevent movement; and proceed with a bandage that has a slightly rounded shape to the back in some cases, and tighten it appropriately; and frequently check the bandage, and when it is softened, tighten it.
And if the bandage causes irritation, swelling, pain, or abscess at the site, then you should remove and loosen it, and remove the plaster and correct any resulting problems with appropriate treatment; and then reapply the plaster, if necessary, to the area; and adjust the tightening until it is healed.
Chapter 8.
Of the restoration of bones when they are fractured.
Know that bone fractures occur only in thick parts, which are the middle sections; and in the extremities or parts forward, injuries only occur there due to the cartilage. And knowledge of that is not hidden from the sense, through investigation of it with the mentioned (parts/methods).
And the restoration should be such that the fracture is aligned with the fingers in the most possible way, until it is brought together as needed, and then apply a plaster and bandage the broken bone with a splint, if needed.
And if the bone fracture is extending towards the internal parts, then the patient experiences intense pain and stabbing, like the stabbing experienced by someone with pleurisy, and because the bone pierces the lining; and there is difficulty breathing, coughing, and vomiting blood; and this is difficult to cure.
And already the ancients were ingenious in dealing with that with great ingenuity.
And from them is this advice:  you must give the patient food that generates inflammation and gas, so that the belly is swollen and expanded, and the fracture is driven towards the outside.
But we would avoid this, for it is not a light cause to generate a hot abscess, if it does not occur; and if it does occur, then it helps with that.
And some of them would say that it should be placed over a cupping glass and then the suction should be strong; and it seems to be a reasonable approach, but nevertheless it is feared that the cupping glass will draw the superfluities to the location due to its weakness.
And some of them would say: the area must be covered with wool that has been soaked in hot oil, and powders should be placed between the ribs until it is filled, so that the bandage is tight when wrapping it around its roundness; and then the patient should be treated with the treatment for pleurisy, with diet and medicine.
And if a severe cause afflicts the patient, which they cannot endure, and the bone pierces the membrane with a damaging puncture, we fear for the patient, then it is necessary to cut open the area, expose the broken rib, and then place an instrument upon it to preserve the shape, the memory of which has been taken before, and cut the bone easily, and extract it.
And then we should bring together the two edges of the wound, if it is large, with stitches, and treat it with plasters until it is healed.
And if an abscess occurs inside, then you should mix powders with oiled, rubbed oil, and place it on the area.  And let the patient be treated with whatever is appropriate for an internal abscess.
And let him lie on his back on the bed on which he sleeps, until he is healed.
Chapter 9.
Concerning the restoration of fractures of the spinal column of the back and neck.
Sometimes fractures occur in the bones of the neck, and sometimes they result in their attrition, and similarly in the vertebrae of the back. And when this happens to someone, and you want to know if they will be healed or not, then consider this: if you find their muscles already softened, numb, dead, and cannot move them or extend or contract them, and when you press them with your fingers or prick them with a needle, they feel no pain, then know that they are not healed, and in this state of disrepair, it is fatal.
And if you move them and feel constriction with your fingers and pricking, then know that the core of the bone is sound and that the patient will recover with treatment.
And if you see the same thing happening to the vertebrae of the neck and want to know if they will be healed or not, then consider their feet.
Then if you see that they are already softened, the same thing has happened to them as happened to the muscles, and when they lie on their backs, they are winded and expel waste involuntarily, and sometimes they are lying on their backs, wanting to urinate but cannot, then know that it is fatal, and do not try to treat them.
But if no such condition is present, the cause is better and more manageable.
And the treatment for that is to apply a soothing poultice of warm oil or crushed eggshells to the affected vertebra; apply that several times a day until the inflammation subsides.
And then apply a comforting and stimulating plaster, and bind it securely; and instruct the patient to rest and remain calm, and not to sleep on the affected area until it is healed.
And if you observe a fracture of the bone, or any other detached cause, then it is necessary to carefully cut away the surrounding flesh and remove that bone; and then rejoin the edges of the wound, with sutures if it is large; and then treat it with a healing ointment until it is healed.
But if the bone of the buttocks (or coccyx) is broken, and it is the end of the matter, then you must use the finger of your left hand in the rectum and align the fractured bone with the other hand as much as possible for proper alignment; then apply a plaster and bandage, if necessary, and secure it tightly.
And if you find any broken bones there, then you should cut around them and remove them, and treat the wound with the previous treatment until healed.
Chapter 10.
Of the restoration of the spine.
The bones of the spine are often fractured, and if they break, the fracture is usually only a separation at the ends, and they are cut along the length and shift apart; the patient experiences pain, and a puncture wound, and the leg is numb when it's fractured.
And the restoration of it is that you extend your hand over it until it is over the fracture, which is the shape of it.
And if the fracture is only at the end of it, then you align that according to what you have at your disposal by matching it until it is aligned with its natural shape.
But if the fracture is along the length or has already shifted to the lower parts, then you make the patient lie on their stomach until you are prepared to restore that fracture. And then, once you have aligned it, place a plaster over it, and then place a splint of wood or bone over that, and tighten it firmly so that you do not fear puncturing the fracture or displacing the splint.
And align the cavity with whatever fills it until that part takes on the firmness/tightness in equal measure, and instruct the patient to sleep on their back or on their healthy side.
But if a hot abscess arises, then you cease the extension and restoration until the hot abscess is soothed, and place on it whatever soothes it as is previously mentioned; then return to restoring it, and tighten it as is appropriate.
And if the bones are splintered or broken into pieces, then you remove them.
Chapter 11.
Concerning the restoration of a fractured limb.
Adjutori" is that which is between the elbow and the head of the shoulder.
And if it is broken, then its restoration is in one of two ways, of which one is that you take a wooden splint of medium thickness according to this method:
And two ligaments are tied to its two ends, and it is then suspended from an elevated location.
And have the patient lie down on a bed; and then place the patient's broken arm over the splint until the tip of the arm is in the middle area where the curve of the splint is attached.
And then suspend some heavy object over it, or the attendant should stretch it down towards the ends; and then the doctor should hold the fracture with his hands together, until the fracture returns to its proper place.
The other method is for the patient to be lying on their back, and to bind the hand to the patient's neck with a bandage; and then command two attendants that one of them holds what is above the fracture with their hands; and the other holds what is below it; and each of them should stretch it to their own side.
And if you want the extension to be stronger, then you bind a bandage over the fracture and another bandage over that, and each of the two attendants should stretch it to their own sides.
And thus, if the fracture is close to the end of the muscle, then it is necessary that half of the bandage be placed over the tip and the other below the fracture near the elbow.
Similarly, if the fracture is near the elbow, then it is necessary that the bandage be placed over that place and over the elbow.
Apply that easily and without difficulty, and once it is bound correctly and applied with proper care, then secure it tightly so as to prevent a painful swelling (or abscess).
However, if a painful swelling develops, then leave the binding until the seventh day, and place on it wool soaked in sour wine and rubbed oil until the swelling subsides, and then you tighten it.
And the way to tighten that is to place a plaster over the fracture, then wrap a clean cloth bandage over the plaster; then support the arm using that support, and rest the open hand on the person's muscle.
And place the cloth and tighten the support on the arm so that the arm is in its proper position, unless some aspect of the broken bone prohibits this.
And then use splints.
And you place on the fracture the splint that is the widest and strongest of the other splints; and place the width of a finger between each splint, and the length of the splints should be according to the break, with an addition of three fingers on each side.
And then tighten the splints with the compression I mentioned at the beginning of the chapter.
And make sure your compression on the fracture site is tighter. And the longer the fracture, the less compression there should be.
And therefore, adjust the positioning of the splints and the compression as we have said, at the moment you restore the limb to its proper place, then do [the following].
And if you fear a suppurative abscess, then leave the compression and splints in place until the seventh day, as we have said.
And now, consider the ligament in all its parts for three days, so that no bruising or inflammation occurs at the site; or, the limb should be deprived of food to prevent an excess of pressure; and then correct all of this according to what we have said.
But if you are certain that no such cause will occur, then do not remove the bandage until approximately three days or longer.
And let the patient's sleep be on their back, and their hands on their stomach.
And place a full poultice of wool over the injury, and make sure at all times of night or day that the shape of the broken limb is not distorted or the ligaments softened, and correct all this with your skill.
And provide the patient with food according to the previous order, so that the food is subtle at first until the healing begins to tighten; then, you should increase the amount of food.
Because it is customary for the poultice and the limb to be bound for 40 days; and then they must be untied, and a bath should be administered, and medicated with ointments which correct it.
And if the fracture is badly injured, then do not loosen the ligaments and splints for up to a day or two months.
Chapter 12.
Concerning the restoration of a fractured arm.
The arm is composed of two bones, which are called two "foils"; of which one is small, and it is the one that sits on the said elbow, and the other is large and is the one that is placed below the small one, on the lower part.
And frequently the larger "foil" is broken alone, or the smaller one, and frequently they are broken together.
And when the small "foil" is fractured above, then the restoration of it is easy, and its healing is more easily accomplished.
And when the "foil" is fractured below, the fracture is severe, and its healing is difficult.
And even more serious than that is when both bones are fractured together.
Therefore, if the fractured bone is the small "foil" above, then it is appropriate for the physician, during its restoration, to apply a small extension with ease until it is healed.
But if the large "foil" is fractured, then a more forceful extension is necessary.
And if both "foils" are fractured together, then you must apply the pressure much more forcefully.
And it is necessary that you place the figure of the hand over the restoration of it and the extension of it stretched over a cushion, and the palm of the hand should be higher than all the other parts, and the said pinky finger should be lower than the other fingers, and the patient should be resting on a smoothed/polished board.
And there should be a cushion in front of him, at his height or level, so that the patient does not experience any discomfort.
And then the attendant should extend the lower arm with their hand or a bandage, and another attendant should similarly extend the upper arm.
And then the physician should manipulate the bone until it returns to the best possible position.
And if there are fragments of the bone, then you must endeavor to return each piece to its proper place with your skill.
And if there appears a detached fragment that pinches the nerve and there is no hope of restoring it, then you should operate on it and remove it according to the method we have described above.
But if the fracture is with a wound, I have already made a separate chapter on this, and thus take care of that.
And if an abscess arises at the beginning of your repair, then you should apply a cloth with a plaster made of clarified oil and white wax, and it should be moderate in its consistency and subtle, and tightly bind the cloth over it until the abscess subsides; and then remove the plaster and apply a prepared poultice of ground powder with egg white, and then apply bandages; and the bandage placed over the fracture should be larger and stronger.
And know that the dressings for the arm are varied in their application, whether the fracture is in one or two places at once.
Then apply your binding to the fracture site more strongly and vigorously, and if the binding is placed on the parts above the fracture or on the lower parts of it, apply the binding a little more loosely, according to what is prescribed in the beginning of the chapter.
And the cloths wrapped around the fracture should be soft and damp, and not hard or rough, and the bandage with which they are bound should be of a medium consistency between subtle and coarse, as we have previously described.
And consider the limb and its ligaments for a few days. And if any cause arises requiring correction, such as swelling in the limb, then you must soak the limb in warm water until the swelling subsides.
And leave the limb unconstrained until it rests, and then return the binding.
And if the binding is now softened and the bone is now set and similar to the others, then correct all of that with your skill.
And further consider if nourishment is prevented from reaching the limb due to excessive binding, for then you must soften that a little and leave it for a few days until nourishment flows to it, and then bind it again.
But if the patient has no condition among those we have mentioned, then it should not be unbound for nearly twenty days or thereabouts.
And then the patient's hand should be suspended by its own power of active movement, and let that person sleep on their back.
And know that this fracture is restored in 30 days or 32 days, or a very easy one is restored in 28 days, and all of this is according to the disposition of the constitutions and the efficacy.
Chapter 13.
Of the restoration of fractures of the wrist and fingers.
Know that the wrist and the joints of the fingers are often fractured, and not by chance, but by many times by rubbing/pressure.
And when the hand is fractured or rubbed, the patient should lie down with their hands and forearms lying straight, and then place their hand on that outstretched hand.
Then the attendant extends the broken bones and the physician holds them until they are properly joined.
And then a poultice and bandage should be applied, if not a boil forms; and then place a splint over the area, proportionate to its size, and you have already wrapped it in linen.
However, if the fracture is in the parts inside the palm of the hand, then make a type of sling out of cloth, and tell the patient to hold it with their fractured palm; afterwards, wrap it with a long cloth.
Let the splint be of leather, with cloth underneath, so that the leather is applied to the palm; and bind it as necessary.
But if the fracture is on the outside parts, then you must place a splint above and another splint below, in the palm, so that the hand is open and straight; then apply the bandage, so as to hold the hand in the normal position between the fingers with ligaments.
And if a fracture occurs in any of the joints of the fingers, then if it is the thumb, it should be bandaged as necessary, and then be held with the palm, and if you wish, place a small, straight splint on it, so that the fracture is elevated and not moved.
But if the fracture is in the other fingers, such as the middle finger, or the index finger, or the ring finger, or the pinky, then it should be bandaged and tied to the adjacent finger; or all of them should be tied together following a continuous method, which is better; or place a small splint on it, as we have said for the thumb.
And consider, in your restoration, and after that, the disposition of a hot abscess and its opposite – with your operation – with what is necessary when any of these conditions occur, as the narrative about them repeats.
Chapter 14.
Concerning the restoration of a fractured thigh bone.
The thigh bone is often fractured, and it is evident to the senses according to how it has been broken in the front part and in the most superior part.
And the restoration of it is done in this way: a ligament is tightened over the fracture and another ligament below the fracture, and the patient is laid prone on their stomach and on their face.
And then the minister extends the whole ligament to its proper position, when the fracture is in the middle part of the bone.
But if it is close to the root of the thigh, then the ligament should be close to the knee, to the part of the groin, so that the extension goes into it, and the other ligament below the fracture.
And similarly, if the break is close to the knee, then the ligament should be placed near the knee, and the extension should be towards the parts below.
And then the physician aligns the bone with both of their hands until it returns to its natural shape and the bone is properly joined; then it is necessary to apply a poultice and a bandage, otherwise the limb could become infected. But if it becomes infected, then you leave it for a few days until the infection subsides, and then return to your treatment.
The bandage should be applied like this:  it is necessary to wrap a hard bandage around the fracture, folding it two or three times, and removing any excess; then wrap the leg until it reaches the ankle and the root of the thigh.
And insert a long splint between the thigh and the leg near the knee, and let the ends of the splint extend from the most prominent part of the two sections; then wrap the excess bandage around the leg and thigh.
And then place splints over the thigh, at the location of the fracture, and place one splint over the bone of the leg.
And then fill the spaces between the leg and the thigh with soft cloths, so that the fracture is held together.
And then begin with a strong bandage in the middle of the fracture site, using three or four wraps; and the further you move away from the fracture site with the bandage, the weaker, lighter, and looser the bandage should be.
Then extend the two ends of the splint down towards the ankle of the foot, and hold both ends of the splints on the other side so that the bandage does not shift from its position.
And then leave the bandage on it, in such a way that no corrosion, no acute abscess, nor inflammation or similar conditions affect the limb; and if any of these occur, then remove it immediately and rectify what has happened, just as we have said many times.
But if there is a piece of bone protruding, then you should put it back in place as best you can; and if not, cover it and leave it, and treat it with what precedes the healing until it is healed.
And sometimes this fracture of the thigh or similar injuries are held together with splints, just as we have said in the case of injuries to the arm.
However, in the restoration made in such a way, the patient does not develop lameness; and if it is restored alone, or if the other leg is applied to it, then it is necessary that the one from which it is temporarily separated, limps.
And know that the thigh is held in place for 40 days, or a little more or less, and all of that depends on the variety of the constitutions and other conditions.
Chapter 15.
Of the restoration of a fractured kneecap.
Know that a fracture of the kneecap often results in, but frequently causes, attrition (wear and tear).
However, if it results in a fracture, then it is only a fissure or hole in its parts, and this is either with inflammation or without, and concerning this, everything is perceived with the senses.
And the restoration of it is done so that what is broken of its parts is rejoined with the ligaments until it is joined and connected as much as possible by means of alignment, ease, and forming.
Then apply a poultice and place it over the affected area, if needed; and bind it securely with a suitable bandage.
And now consider all the treatments we have described for other fractures, just as with an abscess or similar condition, so that any accident is opposed with what is suitable for it until it is healed.
Chapter 16.
Of the restoration of a fractured leg.
Know that the leg has two bones, one of which is thick, and is called the thigh bone; and the other is thin, and is called the shin bone.
And the treatment for any kind of fracture that occurs in the two bones of the arm is similar to the restoration of an arm fracture, and the operation is the same.
And if both bones are broken together, the leg is dislocated in all directions.
And if the thinner bone is broken, the leg is dislocated forward.
And if the thicker bone is broken, you'll find it below, and it is one of those things that is not hidden from you.
And then administer extension, equitation (likely meaning reduction or setting), and binding of the splints accordingly.
However, if the fracture of the leg is large, having many fragments, the extension should be less and gentler, and you should ease it with your skill.
And if there is any need for an operation on the arm in relation to the leg, and when you have set the splints and completed all your work, then you will take pieces of pinewood, placed under the supports which are placed on pillows, and made also of palm branches;  choose those with a small thickness, not large ones, and make their length according to the length of the leg, from the knee down to the lowest part.
And then wrap each [piece] in two layers of cloth according to its length, and place one over the leg part on one side and the other on the other side, extending from the knee down to the lowest part of the foot.
And then bind the two splints in three places: at both ends and in the middle.  With this binding, the leg is prevented from bending to the right or left, and it stays in a good position.
And now a brace of wood, according to the length of the leg, has been applied; and the leg is placed in it so that it is kept from movement.
And this is especially necessary to do in a fracture, and when the injury is properly a fracture.
And then examine the leg daily and carefully monitor it, watching for abscesses, inflammation, or other similar conditions; and if any such condition arises, apply appropriate remedies until it heals.
Chapter 17.
Of the fracture of the heel and the bones of the foot and toes.
A fracture of the heel doesn't happen often, but fractures of the foot bones do sometimes happen; and fractures of the toes happen rarely, and they are usually only bruised or scraped, rather than fractured, in most cases of injury.
And if the foot bones are fractured and some of the bones are raised out of place in relation to each other, then the patient should place their foot on the ground in a position similar to that of walking.
And then place one foot on whatever is propping up those bones, and then press and push down on them, and hold them until they return to their proper places.
And then apply a plaster and bandage on top, and place a small board with two flat ends underneath the sole of the foot.
And then secure that with a downwards pressure on the foot, since you have wrapped it with cloths and other materials as needed.
And when three or four days have passed, then you loosen the bandage, for you will find the bones either aligned, or broken, or dislocated, and the treatment for those is as you know.
But if any of the fingers are broken, then restore them, and align them in the same way as I have explained to you concerning the restoration of the fingers of the hand. And then place a splint along the length of the broken finger, and slightly overlapping it; and then underneath the foot, this board which I have described to you, and secure it with a downward pressure.
But if what is broken of the bones are two, three, or more, then you place splints on each finger, of their respective sizes, wrapped in linen, and secure the board to the lowest part of the foot, and position one end of the board over the abdomen of the foot so that it holds firmly.
And it is important for you not to forget that you should consider all the factors that I have mentioned in the other fractures and accidents we have discussed; and be prepared for any accident with the appropriate treatment.
Chapter 18.
Of the fracture of the thigh bone, the hip bone, and the penis of the male.
When the thigh bone is fractured, then make a splint of carved wood, and then incline it slightly towards the back, and hold it in place behind the leg.
And then the midwife fills the thigh with wool, and it should be done in such a way as to support the thigh; and then the woman should be supported, and slowly raise her back, because everything is kept apart until the thigh area is in the proper position and the broken bone is in place.
And then place pillows under her back, and when she wants to urinate, the wool comes out easily and she urinates, and you reposition and return it according to the method you used at the beginning, and then return it to its original position on the pillow.
And do this for seven days or so, because that is how it is restored.
And if you wish, take a sheep's bladder and insert a reed tube into the opening; and insert the entire bladder into the thigh, and then blow into the tube forcefully until the bladder is inflated within the thigh, because this will realign the fracture.
And then fill it with wool and leave it for several days as we have described, until it is healed.
And when the hip bone of a man or woman is broken, then administer in its restoration and joining what we have described regarding the hip bone.
And what is right is not hidden in these nearby, easily-treated fractures, especially for those who have some knowledge and use and understanding of this book of mine; for this fracture signifies to you the best method for its restoration and consolidation; therefore, understand it well.
But when a man's penis is broken, take a bird's wing, and place the penis inside; then apply a bandage of cloth, wrap it, and leave it for three days or so, and it will be healed.
Chapter 19.
Of the restoration of fractures of the bones when afflicted with plague.
It is convenient for those suffering a fractured bone with plague, especially if the bone is large, such as the thigh bone or the humerus, or similar, that you bleed them [perform phlebotomy] as soon as the conditions for phlebotomy permit, or if they indicate it as discussed above.
And if the plague causes the outflow of blood, then you must apply a compress to contain it, and in the same way, you can powder it with crushed egg, if no other reason is present.
And then begin restoring the fracture on that same day, and do not prolong this, unless an abscess develops.
However, if a large abscess develops, then you leave the restoration until the ninth day, until the abscess has subsided, and do not approach it on the third or fourth day at all, for you will cause harmful accidents.
But if the broken bone is prominent above the skin, then you must carefully reduce it and bring it together with your hands with ease and minimal force.
But if force is not available to you to align it with your hands, then you reduce it with your hands using this instrument; and this instrument is made of iron, its length is seven or eight inches, and its width is according to the size of the injury; and thus it is necessary for the doctor to take three or four of these, according to the quantity needed for this treatment in all types of fractures.
And it should be round, and of little thickness, so that it is not doubled by pressure on it during the operation.
And let it have a sharp edge on its extremities; and let its upper part be thicker, and its middle parts thinner.
And this is its shape:
And it is called in Greek "labre volentz atelarem", that is, a small spatula.
Therefore, it is necessary that the sharp end of it be placed raised on the prominent bone's end.
And you push that in one go until the bone returns, and it is aligned with some equalisation.
And therefore, strive to align the fractured ends, and if the fractured end is fragile and does not accept the instrument well, then you must cut the end of that bone until the instrument has sufficient power to do so.
However, if you cannot completely reduce the bone with what we have recounted, then cut it with whatever surgical instruments we have mentioned; or saw it with one of the saws, in any manner possible to you.
And then remove what remains of roughness and small scales from the bone.
And when the bone is reduced, and after the reduction the patient experiences intense pain, then know that the bone has not returned to its natural place; and then do what you deem best to greatly benefit the patient.
When your bone restoration is complete, then soak a cloth in black astringent wine, and especially if it is summer, do not place a plaster or any other oily substance on the wound, so that it does not cause festering and corruption.
And then, administer styptics at the time of your bone restoration's completion, and leave the wound uncovered so that you cut the hole with scissors and use dressings according to the wound's size.
And be very careful not to compress the wound with the fracture, for many foolish physicians have done this, and caused death or a corrosive or wasting illness in their patients, that is, gangrene. And if your tightening is light, soft, different from the tightening of other fractures.
And if the wound is large or a bad wound, and you fear the bad accidents we have recounted, and you find pain in the area, then it is not suitable to place styptics there, but make a bandage of hard cloths instead of styptics and tighten it with them.
And when after a day or two the wound begins to fester, that a boil has arisen in it, then you remove the cloth you had placed over it with wine, and then administer some ointments, with which it is our custom to treat wounds, such as tetrafarmacon ointment and similar ones.
And it befits you to loosen the ligament and consider the wound each day morning and evening until it is consolidated and closed, and the limb must be prepared in such a way that the pus runs from it to the lower parts with ease.
If many days pass over the wound, and it is not consolidated nor has the boil been separated from it, then you should know that there are hidden dangers here, so you must investigate the wound with a probe. And of those dangers, those that are separable, remove and extract; those that are not separable and cause pain to the limb, force you to cut them, as is possible for you.
And if pus or discharge, that is, suppuration, or another kind of corruption and putrefaction happens to the wound, then you must apply to it whatever is appropriate for its treatment, as was previously described in its chapter.
And concerning this, in which my discourse should end, and you should put forward your skill: when a large bone is broken, treat the limb accordingly as the bone of the thigh and the help and similar to those of large limbs, and do not presume to pull or extract it, for often death results from that; let it be until it can, for it will fall back in place in about 20 or 30 days; and then treat the wound, if you see fit, and if it does not return to place.
Chapter 20.
Of the treatment of swelling that occurs in the area of a fracture.
Often this swelling occurs in the area of fracture healing, especially if it's near the joints, and it distorts the shape of the limb; and it severely hinders the limb's natural function.
Then consider if the swelling is recent, and apply remedies that are astringent, such as alum, vinegar, myrrh, ceruss, and similar; use some or all of them, and mix them with astringent wine, or egg white, or sour wine, and apply this mixture to the swelling on a cloth, and bind it firmly.
And leave it bound tightly for several days; then unbind it and repeat another application, until the swelling is gone; or apply a lead plate gently over it, because lead has the property of reducing swelling in the limbs.
However, if the swelling has become hardened and tight and it's necessary to remove it forcefully, then cut it in the most superior part, and remove the excess or cut into it with some lancets until it is gone; and treat the area until it is healed.
Chapter 21.
Of the restoration of a fracture when it is restored and afterwards the limb remains weak and frail, not according to its natural strength.
When a fractured bone is restored, and afterward the limb remains weak and frail, this is caused by several factors: one of which is excessive loosening of the ligaments and their improper binding; or due to excessive tightening of the ligaments, preventing nourishment from reaching the limb; or due to excessive application of remedies; or due to improper movement at the wrong time; or due to insufficient blood in the patient's body and their weakness.
And the treatment for this is to give the patient food and make their body tender until the blood is replenished; and administer baths; and introduce joy and cheerfulness into their lives.
And then place a poultice on the limb, so that the poultice draws more nourishment to it, or continue applying warm water compresses, until the nourishment flows and returns to its natural form.
Chapter 22.
Concerning the treatment of broken bones when they are improperly set and the operation is not performed as it should be.
When, after the restoration of a limb following a fracture, you notice a deformity and a prominence or knot on the broken bone, and this has impaired the limb's shape, but the limb is not prevented from its natural function, then do not believe the claim that the limb has been broken again.
But there have been many foolish doctors and bone setters who have done this in our land; and this procedure is highly reprehensible, leading to great fear and a sign of deadly consequences.
However, if the lameness and swelling are recent, then they should be treated with lukewarm water in which softening herbs are steeped, such as marshmallow leaves and roots, and melilot, and similar ones; and a softening poultice should be applied, such as well-made diachylon; or a mucilage made from marshmallow root and mixed with hen's grease or beeswax oil should be used as a poultice; or fatty figs should be crushed with pigeon dung and similar medicinal concoctions known to promote healing.
And sometimes it is resolved with consistent gentle friction with wet hands, and the limb should be moved in all directions at all hours.
But if the deformity has progressed and become firm and stony, and requires surgical intervention, then the pus must be drained, and the surrounding bone tissue should be softened.  Then, the excess swelling must be cut away from the bone itself with sharp scalpels, and careful and diligent treatment should be administered to facilitate the process.
Chapter 23.
Concerning the treatment of dislocation.
Dislocation is the displacement of any joint from its proper position, hindering movement, and deforming the affected limb, causing great pain and injury to the patient.
Therefore, when a dislocation occurs, it is essential to work quickly to reduce it, and delay should be avoided. For if it is delayed, the joint becomes inflamed and stiff, making the reduction of the dislocation difficult.
And therefore, it should not be manipulated or stretched during the inflammation, for this often causes spasms and severe pain.
But when this happens, you must apply leeches to the patient's inflamed area, and allow it to remain until the inflammation subsides; then, apply warm water and oil to the affected limb, and proceed with reducing it with ease.
And every limb is cured in this way, so that the affected area returns to its proper place.
And I have already ordered the chapters on dislocations in the same way as those on fractures, beginning with the most superior part of the body and proceeding to the lowest part.
Chapter 24.
Of the treatment of a lower jaw dislocation.
The two jaws are dislocated if not quickly treated; and the dislocation of both is done in one of two ways: either they are slightly displaced from their proper position and a little softened; or they are completely dislocated and fully dislocated, until they are softened at the joint, so that saliva drips from the patient and they cannot hold their mouth shut, and the patient's tongue is wrapped in their mouth.
However, when the dislocation is slight, in most cases it returns on its own with little effort.
However, if the dislocation is complete and severe, then a gentle reduction of it is necessary, and should not be delayed at all.
And the attendant should hold the patient's head, and the physician should insert the finger(s) of one hand into the area of the jaw dislocation inside the patient's mouth, if the dislocation is on one side; or should insert both thumbs together, if the dislocation is on both sides, and the other fingers of the hands should be outside, grasping the jaw; and he should tell the patient to relax their jaw muscles and let the jaw relax on either side; and the physician should grasp and push the jaw until it returns to its proper position.
And if the reduction is difficult, especially if both jaws are dislocated, then apply a vaporization with hot water and oil, until the reduction of both is made easy and do not delay the reduction of both at all, as we have said.
And therefore, when they are returned and held in place, and the patient's mouth is closed and not softened, then place over it some cloths with a cerot (a medicated plaster), made of wax and rubbed oil; and then bind it easily with soft bandages.
And let the patient sleep on their back, with their head supported between two pillows, so that it doesn't turn to the right or left side; and do not force them to chew anything;  let their food be soft and easy to swallow, until the pains have subsided and the jaws have healed, then let them eat whatever they want.
And this should be administered easily, and do not force the opening of the mouth for eating, drinking, or speaking, until the jaw is healed and sound.
And if the reduction of the two jaws, when dislocated at any time and not returned to their places, then often fever and persistent sweating occur, and the patient's stomach is frequently upset, and there is a lot of vomiting of pure bile.
And when you see this, then know that it is dangerous; and often the one who experiences this dies within a few days.
Chapter 25.
Of the reduction of the dislocation of the furcula and the extremity of the muscle.
The furcula is not dislocated from its place within by its connection with the feet; and sometimes it is dislocated outwards, and this is evident to the senses.
And the restoration of it is that the patient lies on their back and extends their arms. And then press the area with your palm with a firm pressure, for it will return.
And then apply a plaster and powders to it and bind it tightly.
However, the extremity that joins the elbow and continues from there is not dislocated in any way; therefore, it must be reduced and bound as we have said, and as is appropriate for your treatment.
And then apply a plaster, powders, and a bandage, and instruct the patient to adhere to quietness and rest until they are healed.
And with this same treatment, the extremity of the muscle is reduced when it is separated from its place.
Chapter 26.
Of the reduction of muscle dislocation.
Know that the muscle is not dislocated except in three ways, of which one is that it is dislocated from the upper part to the lower part.
And the second is that it is dislocated from above the muscle, and this is done with difficulty; and it is not dislocated to the parts behind by the shoulder; and it is not dislocated to the parts in front by the nerves.
And it is most commonly dislocated and exits outward to the lower parts towards the upper limb, and especially in those whose flesh is sparse, it is easily dislocated; but in those in whom there is much flesh, it is forced out with difficulty.
And often it happens to some men by a blow or a fall, and the muscle in them becomes inflamed with a hot abscess, and it is swollen because it has already been dislocated.
Then you should find out about this until you are completely certain about it, and then you should proceed with its cure.
And the dislocation is recognized when it is in the lower parts toward the upper limb; so that you can distinguish between the dislocated muscle and the healthy muscle, for you will find a clear difference between them; and you will find in the head of the muscle a concavity and below the upper limb, near the head of the muscle, like an egg, and the patient cannot bring their hand to their ear, nor can they move it much.
If it is dislocated towards the feet or upwards, and you then find a clear touch, and it is not hidden.
And of this dislocation, a slight reduction is made when it is fresh and the patient is young.
And the reduction of it is that the minister raises the patient's hand to the upper parts; and then places their hands below the patient's upper limb, and elevates the joint with strength into its place, and the minister raises the patient's hand and extends it upwards; and then places it down, as it returns easily.
But if, despite what we have said, it does not return, and it has been a long time since the dislocation occurred, then the patient must be bathed in hot water and given a poultice that softens and loosens, such as a decoction of marshmallow root, fenugreek, and melilot in water, and it should be applied.
And then the patient should be placed on their back, and a wool cushion that is neither too loose nor too tight should be placed under the patient's upper limb.  Then the physician places their heel on the cushion, elevates the muscle/limb with strength, and pulls the patient's hand so it's not drawn down, and another assistant holds the patient's head so it's not pulled down, for it will soon return to its place.
And if you wish, reduce it by this method: you should have a man present who is taller than the patient, standing on the affected side.  He should place his arm under the patient's upper limb, and elevate the upper limb upward until the patient is suspended in the air, while another assistant pulls the patient's hand away from the lower part of their body. But if the patient is light, then something else must be suspended with them, to weigh them down, so that the dislocation returns quickly.
And it is easily reduced by another method: a long wooden post, rounded at the top like a mortar pestle, neither thick nor thin, is placed on the ground under the patient.  Then, after placing a thick blanket on top of the post, the patient stands along the length of the post, and the patient's hand is extended to the opposite side, and the patient's body is stretched to the other side with force, so that the joint quickly returns to its place.
And if the reduction is difficult by all the methods we have described, then use this treatment: take a piece of wood, the length of which is two arms' length, and its width is four fingers, and its thickness should be moderate at the level of the patient's upper limb in this manner...
And over the rounded top, thick cloths should be tied so that the post does not injure the patient.
And then place the wood under the patient's armpit, and stretch the arm or hand along the post towards the lower part, and tie the post to the support, the arm, and the extremity of the hand.
Then the arm is placed on a ladder-like support, the width of the arm, and the hand is extended downwards, and the other side of the body is suspended from the other side, so that the joint quickly moves back into place.
And when the repositioning is complete by any means possible, then place a layer of wool underneath the armpit;  then apply a prepared plaster of ground herbs and egg white over the entire muscle, wrapping it well. Then, tightly bandage under the armpit with a suitable bandage.  The bandage should be wrapped around the plaster, and the patient's hand should be tied to the neck.  Leave it undisturbed for seven days, and do not move the hand.
And the patient should be given little food until the limb is strengthened, for this is more beneficial to the recovery.
And then the food should be increased gradually to seven or five portions, and the limb should be exercised; and if it is now firm and not soft, then it is healed.
But if the joint is repeatedly dislocated due to humidity or other causes, then a cautery with three punctures should be administered, as described earlier in the chapter on cauteries.
And if all this is done and after seven days the bandage is removed and the joint is not firm, and the plaster and bandage are reapplied several times, and it remains loose and the person cannot raise that arm above the head, then understand that the nerves, which are at the head of the muscle, are severed, stretched, or softened, and know that the joint will never return to its proper position.
For dislocations of the foot, nipple, or back parts, reduction is performed by pushing and pulling with the hands until it returns to its proper place.
And another bandage should be applied to that area, and it should be treated until it is healed.
If after healing there is heaviness in the limb and slowness in movement, then the patient should use baths frequently until that heaviness is relieved and it returns to its original state.
Chapter 27.
Of the treatment of elbow dislocations.
Know that the elbow joint is difficult to dislocate and similarly difficult to return to its proper place; and it is dislocated in all directions, particularly in front and back.  The dislocation is not hidden from you, because it is evident under examination or touch, regardless of the specific type of dislocation.  And when you attempt to adjust the dislocated elbow with your hand, this is made very clear to you, for the joint is concave and cannot bend the arm nor can the muscle be engaged.
And it is necessary to treat the dislocation promptly before it becomes acutely inflamed, for if it becomes acutely inflamed, the reduction is difficult, and the limb may not be completely healed; and especially when it is in the posterior region, for it is the most difficult of all types of dislocation, and causes the most pain, and often leads to death.
And the restoration of it, when it is possible to reduce it, is that the patient's arm should be extended with both hands, and the arm should be extended, and the physician's hands should be on the elbow, and under it, and he should push the joint with the thumbs of his hands together, or with the base of his palm, until it returns to its proper place.
But if the dislocation is in the anterior region, then it is returned by bending the arm with one's hand, until the elbow is struck with the base of one's palm.
And if the dislocation does not yield to reduction, then administer forceful extension and very strong pressure.
And it is necessary that two assistants extend the arm, and hold that extension so that it is not moved away from the extension.
And then the arm should be wrapped around, since it is covered with a folded cloth or bandage long on the patient's arm.
And when the physician touches the joint with his hand, anoint it with some oil so that these things help lubricate the joint easily; and then press the joint with forceful pressure until it returns to its proper place.
And after the reduction, it is necessary to place a poultice on the area that has styptic and astringent properties, using egg white, and to bind it tightly, suspending the arm from the neck, and leaving it in that position for several days.
And then it should be unbound; and if the joint has returned to its proper position, then remove the bandage and leave it be.
And if you see that the joint is not sufficiently strengthened, then reapply the poultice and the bandage and leave it for several days until it is strengthened; and then remove the bandage.
But if during the reduction of the joint, and its position is unsteady, then apply moistening through baths and gentle friction, and compression, until it is relieved; or place on the joint something soft, i.e. a fatty substance; and then bandage it, and leave it bandaged over the affected area by day and by night. And then remove the bandage, and put it in a bath; and when it is soaked, then rub the joint with moderate friction, and then reapply a soft, fatty substance, once, and again a second, and a third time. with intervals of bathing, until it is healed.
And if you wish, place a warm, damp cow's hide over the affected area and press firmly on it; and do this several times, for this is moist and will reduce to its proper position.
Chapter 28.
Of the treatment of a dislocated shoulder, that is, of the joint between the arm and the hand.
A dislocated shoulder is sometimes dislocated, and the reduction of its dislocation is easy, and the opposite is true for other joints.  However, speed is necessary in its reduction at the time it is dislocated, before the area becomes inflamed or a painful abscess forms there.
And the reduction of its dislocation is this: you place the patient's hand joint on a table, and the attendant extends the patient's arm. The physician places his hand or palm on the area above the joint and pushes until it returns to its place.
However, it is necessary to consider if the palm is already facing the stomach of the hand.  In that case, the patient should place the back of their hand on a table for the extension and reduction.  And if the dislocation is in front of the back of the hand, then the hand of the patient should be placed, in a slightly tucked-in position, upon the table, so that the physician's hand can fit on that joint area.
And therefore, if it returns quickly, it is good.  But if not, then gently hold it while preventing the inflammation and leave it; and do not repeat this, for otherwise, it will not tolerate nor permit the reduction of it any further when days pass.
However, the joint remains twisted; and if the patient feels no pain, but the hand is weakened and cannot grip anything, then know that the nerves are severed or crushed, and in that case, there is no remedy, but that it be held with a cautery near the affected spot, and with strong pressure, you give it some strength.
Therefore, once the injury is treated, apply the bandage we have described, and allow it to remain and be held for five days; and then it should be released and left alone, and the patient's hand should be exercised.
But if its movement is hindered and some heaviness arises, then relieve it with hot water and some rubbing several times, until it is alleviated.
Chapter 29.
Of the treatment of dislocated fingers.
Sometimes the fingers are dislocated in all directions.
And when any of those fingers is dislocated towards the palm side or the belly side (of the hand), then straighten the finger and push the dislocation back with your fingers, until it returns to its place.
Then support the head of the finger and suspend it from the side to which it was dislocated, and leave it like that for two days.
And then suspend it and extend it until it is properly aligned in its proper place.
And when night comes, bind it according to that description, and do not cease to unbind it during the day and exercise it with movement, and bind it at night; and do this for several days until it is straightened.
And do the same if it is dislocated towards the palm of the hand, and bind it to that side and perform your first procedure, until it is healed.
And similarly do this when it is dislocated to the other parts of the body.
Chapter 30.
Of the treatment of dislocations of the vertebrae of the back.
When an accident causes a complete dislocation of one of the vertebrae in the back or neck, and the displaced vertebrae remain out of place, then in that case there is no cure, for death is likely for the patient.
And a sign of this is that the patient's bowel movements are involuntary and cannot be controlled; and many times certain limbs are paralyzed, or two legs or two arms, or one of them; or a vertebra remains displaced, for often it is displaced, and often the displacement occurs in four parts.
Therefore, this is already displaced in the posterior parts and is called "gelbozitat.
However, the treatment for this is to consider if the displacement occurred from childhood, for in that case there is no cure or complete healing.
But in cases caused by accident, or impact, or similar events, the Ancients described methods of treatment in lengthy treatises, from which the most benefit can be derived; but I have shortened that, avoiding the excess of it, due to my proximity to my audience, with which I have explained and organized this from various sources, by which I will demonstrate and explain this.
And of those, only the one that occurs in the back specifically, with what I recommend, is cured.
And it is necessary that the patient be laid on their face, close to a wall, and be supported underneath with a soft instrument so that the patient's foot is not injured.
And then a straight piece of wood should be placed, dug into the ground at the foot of the wall near the patient's head, and another piece of wood likewise at the patient's feet on the other side of the wall.
And one attendant should hold the first piece of wood, and it should not be buried in the ground; and another attendant should hold the other according to that form.
And then wrap something around the patient's head and under their armpits with a firm bandage; and extend the end of the bandage to the wood near their head, and tie it there; and then tighten another bandage around their hips, their thighs, and near their legs; and then adjust all the bandages and tie them to the other piece of wood near their feet.
And then each attendant should extend the bandage to the wood, and the two pieces of wood and the bandages should not be moved from their positions, but nonetheless, they should not be fixed as we have described.
And then the physician places their palms on the spine with strength until it returns to its proper place, or places a table over it, and then the patient should adjust their feet onto the table until it returns.
But if it does not return in this way, then take a board whose width or length is approximately three arms' lengths, and carve a space in the wall near the patient, where the end of the board can fit into. And then place half of the board on the spine, and the physician places their feet on the other end, and presses firmly until the spine is straightened and returns to its place.
And if you wish, use a turning tool; and you must place two pieces of wood, each a yard long, in the ground behind the patient's head, and similarly two more pieces of wood behind the patient's feet; and the space between each piece of wood should be a palm's width.  Each piece of wood should have a hole in it for the turning tool to fit, and each should be firmly secured to the ground to prevent movement.
And a round post should be placed on the turning tool, and it should be turned in the two holes of the two pieces of wood.
And at the end of it (the round post) is a hole into which the post (the round one) fits, its length being a palm's width from the turning tool; and in the two other pieces of wood, there is a similar hole.
And then tighten the ligatures that you have tied around the patient's feet in the hole that is towards the head, and the ligatures that you have tied around the patient's thighs at the turning tool that is towards the feet.
And near each turning tool, let there be a person who turns the tool with their hand, and the physician adjusts the spine according to what we have said.
And then, once the spine is repositioned and the area is aligned, you should apply a very thick plaster with egg white, then linen; and then place a table-shaped splint over the plaster, its width being about three fingers, and its length sufficient to cover the area of the bulging, and also over the area of the spine itself.
And then it should be bound with the ligament we have mentioned, and the patient should use subtle nourishment until healed.
And if any swelling remains in the area at the end of the healing process, then medications that soften and soothe with the table's administration (as we have described) must be administered for a long time; and a lead plate is also applied to that area.
And sometimes swelling occurs in the back of the spinal vertebrae, caused by that dislocation; and that bone is the one that swells, so you should not presume to treat it with this medicine, for it will likely cause death.
Chapter 31.
Of the treatment of a dislocated hip.
Know that the hip joint and the muscle joint should only be dislocated, and not experience the same issues as other joints that involve small movements and cavities.
And the hip joint is dislocated in four ways, for it is dislocated inwards, or outwards, or forwards, or backwards.
And it is more often dislocated inwards, and less so forwards or backwards.
And a sign of the dislocated hip inwards is that, when you align the patient's healthy leg with the affected leg, the affected leg is longer and the knee is more prominent than on the healthy side, and the patient cannot bend their foot towards their groin, and the area where the foot would normally bend is inflamed with a hot abscess, because the head of the thigh bone has now reached there.
And the sign of a dislocation outwards is that the symptoms are opposite to this inward dislocation.
The sign of a forward dislocation is that the patient extends their leg to its fullest, but cannot bend it without pain in the knee, and if forced to go forward, cannot do so without pain in the front; and their urine is retained, and their groin is abscessed, and they walk on their heels.
The sign of a backward dislocation is that the knee does not extend, nor can it be bent forward as the groin can be, and the patient's leg is shorter than the other, and the groin is swollen, and the head of the thigh bone is toward that area.
But the reduction of these types of dislocation is that you must consider, then, if the dislocation is old and chronic, having already endured that,  then you apply reduction and it remains in its position, then it's not a complete cure; and therefore, no presumption should be made in such a case.
But in the case of a recent dislocation, one of the four types, you should attempt to restore the joint and extend it in all directions, both inward and outward, and to the right and left, for it will readily return and require no other treatment.
However, if it does not return in this manner, then you must prepare strong assistants and extend the patient's leg from the lowest part, either with their hands or with a bandage tied to the leg above the knee; and another assistant should extend the patient's hand so that they place their hands under the patient's armpits; and then tightly bind a strong bandage around the root of the thigh, and another assistant should hold the end of the bandage.
And the extension should be either from the inside of the knee to the groin, or from the back of the knee to the back of the hip.
And all those extensions should be performed at once until the patient is lifted off the ground by his/her body weight and hangs suspended.
And this type of extension is a common method for all four types.
And therefore, if the dislocation returns with what we have described, it is good; and if not, then for all types, the specific treatment is necessary.
In the specific reduction of a dislocation, when it is dislocated and the dislocation is on the inside, the patient should be placed on their right side; then, place the ligaments over the root of the thigh in the area between the head of the thigh and the space below the groin; and then extend the ligament from the groin area to the highest part of the groin.
And another strong assistant should take the patient's arms, and firmly grasp the thick part of the diseased thigh and extend it outward forcefully, for this will return it to its place.
And this type is easier to treat, with which this limb is reduced compared to other types.
But if you are unsure and do not follow this type of treatment completely, then it is necessary that the patient's two feet be bound together with strong, light bandages, around both ankles and both toes.
And the length of each should be about four fingers, and the diseased leg should be extended more than the other by the amount of two fingers.
And then the patient should be suspended over the top of a post, and be in the house; and the height from the ground should be about two arms' length.
And then command a strong young man to grasp the thigh, and have another young man suspended with the patient, and the other young man, pulling the thigh with strength, will push, so the joint returns to its place quickly.
But in the proper reduction, when there is a dislocation to the outside, the patient must lie on a raised surface, as we have described in the case of the bent knee; and the bandage should be tightly wrapped around the diseased leg itself and the patient's feet.
And then two posts should be placed, one at their feet, and another at the head; and then posts should be placed fitted in the middle of the raised surface on which wet cloths are wrapped, so that the patient is not harmed because the post is between the patient's thighs, so that from below, the extension is not pulled.
And then each attendant should extend their part, and the physician, with his hand, guides the reduction according to the art.
And when the dislocation is in the front parts, then the leg must be slightly extended, and it is according to this same description on the raised surface; and the physician places the palm of his right hand on the sick person's shin, and then with the other hand, he grasps it, and with that grasp, he places the extended leg in the lower region towards the front part.
And if the dislocation is in the rear parts, then the patient should not be extended towards the lower regions, but raised from the ground; rather, it should be placed on a hard surface, as is appropriate for lifting if their hip is dislocated outward, according to what we have said about their lying on two cushions; and it is on their face, and the ligaments should be extended, as we have said, not much.
And pressure must be applied with a cloth over the area where the joint is.
Therefore, when the reduction is completed as required – and the sign of its reduction is not hidden from you, and it is that you extend the patient's two legs, and when you see those aligned and the patient grasps their leg and extends it without hesitation, then know that the limb has been returned as required – and then you align the two sides and place a bandage and compress it with a bandage so that the hip is not displaced in any part; and keep the patient at rest for three or four days.
And then loosen the bandage and the compress, and compare one leg with the other.
Then, if you see those aligned properly, then know that the dislocation has been fixed, and then allow the patient to go.
And if you see any cause of swelling, then you return and bandage that, and compress it according to your initial compression, and leave it for three days.
And then release it, and have the patient walk on it for several days, until it is strengthened.
Chapter 32.
Concerning the treatment of a dislocated knee.
The knee is dislocated in three ways, for it is dislocated outward, inward, and downward, but not forward.
And the sign of a dislocated knee is that you instruct the patient to straighten their leg at the hip; then you will know that the knee is dislocated.
And the restoration in all those ways is that you have the patient lie straight, so that they extend their leg, if they can; place your two hands on the side of the patient, and place their foot between your feet.  Then, place your palms on the patient's knee, and hold them between your fingers on the knee firmly. Another assistant stretches the leg until the knee returns to its place.
And the sign of its reduction is that their leg adheres to their hip with effortless ease.
And then bandage it and secure the leg to the hip with a bandage for three or four days, then unbind them.
And do not allow the patient to walk for several days until they are healed and strengthened.
But if the reduction by you is excused, then administer strong extension with bandages, which are described in the treatment of the hip earlier in the narration.
Chapter 33.
Of the treatment of the dislocation of the ankle.
The ankle is sometimes dislocated by a small displacement, and sometimes it is dislocated completely, and its dislocation is either inward or outward.
And the sign of its dislocation is that often the ankle swells on the side to which it is dislocated.
But the treatment for the displacement is a gentle return, and it is that it be extended easily with the hands and be held until it returns.
But in the treatment of it when it is completely dislocated, it is necessary that you have the patient lie straight, and have a strong and capable assistant on the back of the affected area in the middle of it.
And then you, with your right hand, take hold of the foot's highest part, and with your left hand, the lowest part of the foot near the ankle.
And then pull the foot towards you with your right hand, and then with the left hand twice, and then extend with the left; and push the foot's lower part towards the leg with the right hand without difficulty.
And do this twice as we have counted.
And then push the foot's lower part towards the leg a third time, and you are at the ankle.
Therefore, if it returns in one or two attempts in this manner, and if you see the foot is healed, it is good; and if not, then repeat the procedure, for it needs returning.
But if you are prohibited from reducing it by what we have recounted, then have the patient lie on their back on the ground, and firmly press a thick, flat cushion between their thighs, and you have already wrapped them in a cloth so that the patient does not get hurt.
And then the attendant holds the patient's thighs, and another attendant extends the foot with their hands or with a bandage tied around the foot's ankle; and then each attendant pulls against the other's pull, and the cushion remains between the patient's thighs, holding it, so that the patient's body is not pulled down from the extended area.
And then the physician grasps the dislocation with their hands, and another attendant holds the healthy thigh in the lower areas, for the dislocation returns with ease.
And thus, when the dislocation returns and the success of its reduction is evident, then apply a plaster and bind it tightly with bandages, and tie the foot to the leg with a bandage.
And you should be careful of the nerves that are located behind the heel, so that the bandage over them is not too tight and hurts them severely.
And then leave it for two or three days; and if the bandage is softened, tighten it.
And then loosen it on the third or fourth day, and forbid the patient from activity for 40 days. But if he is forced to move before that time, there is no guarantee that the dislocation will not be dissolved or corrupted, and therefore that it will not receive a cure.
And if a boil happens to him, then you must apply to it what we previously described, in another location for healing and fomentation, until it is gone.
Chapter 34.
Of the treatment of dislocation of the fingers and toes.
The dislocated part should be gently pulled back without force; and this is not difficult, rather it is easy.
But if the dislocation is in the joints of the toes of the foot, then you must have the patient place their foot on a soft surface, such as the ground or a table, and be positioned as if they were walking.
Then you stand, and place your foot over the area of the joint, and gently press down on it with your foot until it returns to its place, and you see that it is now in place and no longer appears protruding.
Then place a board under the sole of their foot, that supports the entire foot, with two ends.  Secure this firmly with appropriate bindings for three days.  Then loosen these and keep them from walking for many days, until the joint is strong and secure.
Chapter 35.
Of the types of dislocations that are caused by a blow or fracture, or both together.
When any of these causes occur, and you exert yourself in treating and restoring them, death often results.
Therefore, one should not presume to treat them, but only those skilled in the art, with long experience, merciful and compassionate, slow, not rash or presumptuous;  and who, in the beginning, should use only gentle, soothing remedies for boils, and leave the patient to divine judgment, unless one expects healing from death, with a lessening of the illness, and in which one sees some hope. Then strive to do the reduction (of the dislocation) as soon as possible, before it becomes a severe boil.
And if the limb returns as desired, then administer a treatment to reduce inflammation and heal the injury with appropriate desiccant ointments.
And if the dislocation is accompanied by a fracture, and the bones are separated, then you must repair the separation, and do in this regard what we have said concerning the simple maladies previously mentioned in these cases.
And guard and avoid, according to your ability, that which is dangerous in the paths of fear, as my teaching has preceded you. For this is better for you before your Creator, and more permanent for your glory, and more salutary to your body in your time. Thus ends the words of Albucasis, perfectly, for which may God be praised. Amen.
