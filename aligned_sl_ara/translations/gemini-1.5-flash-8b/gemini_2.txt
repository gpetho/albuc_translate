The author of this book, having completed for you, my children, this book, which is a complete part of the science of medicine, and having reached the peak of clarity and explanation in it, saw fit to complete it for you with this chapter, which is a part of the practical application of the hand.
Because practical application of the hand is entirely lacking in our country and our time, so much so that its knowledge is nearly forgotten and its influence has ceased. However, only a few traces of it remain in the books of the ancients, which have been corrupted by hands, affected by errors and confusion, until their meanings became obscure and their benefit distanced.
Therefore, I saw fit to revive it and compose this chapter in the manner of explanation, clarification, and summarization, and to provide illustrations of cauterizing irons and other tools of the craft, since it adds to the clarity and encompasses what is necessary.
The reason there is no skilled practitioner with a skilled hand in our time is because the craft of medicine is lengthy, and its practitioner must first diligently study the anatomy, as described by Galen. So that he grasps the benefits of the organs, their arrangement, temperaments, connections, and separations; the knowledge of bones, nerves, muscles, their number and exits; arteries, veins, and their points of exit.
Therefore, Hippocrates said that physicians are many in name, but few in action, especially in the practical craft. We have mentioned a portion of this in the introduction to this book.
For whoever is not knowledgeable about the anatomy we have described will inevitably make mistakes that kill people, as I have witnessed many who claimed knowledge in this field without understanding or study.
I saw an ignorant physician who opened a scrofulous tumor on a woman's neck, then severed some of the neck's arteries, so the woman bled to death before his eyes.
I saw another physician who attempted to remove a stone from the bladder of an elderly man.  The stone was large, and he acted rashly, removing it with a piece of the bladder wall. The man died about three days later. I was called to remove it, and I saw the size of the stone and the patient's condition, and I judged that I could not have done it.
And I saw another physician who earned a living by practicing medicine among the merchants of our town.
A dark-skinned boy had a broken leg near his heel, along with a wound. The physician, in his ignorance, quickly bound the fracture to the wound with strong splints and bandages, leaving no room for the wound to breathe.
Then he indulged his desires, then left him for days, ordering him not to loosen the bandages until his leg and foot swelled up and he was close to death.
So I was called to him, and quickly loosened the bandages.  He gained relief and was freed from his pain, but the damage had already taken hold of the limb, and I was unable to stop it.
The damage continued to spread in the limb until he died.
I saw another physician treat a cancerous tumor.  After days, it ulcerated, and the affliction of the patient worsened.  This is because if the cancer is purely of black humor, it should not be treated with iron at all.
Unless it is in a limb that can be completely removed.
Therefore, my son, you should know that manual work is divided into two categories: work that is accompanied by safety, and work that, in most cases, leads to injury.
I have warned in every place in this book about the work that involves risk and fear.  You should avoid and reject it.
So that the ignorant may not find a way to speak ill and criticize, be firm and cautious, and gentle and steadfast in your care of patients.
Use the best path leading to safety and a good outcome, and avoid dangerous diseases difficult to cure.
Keep yourselves away from anything that you fear might bring doubt upon your religion and your worldly affairs.  This is the lasting safeguard for your reputation and the highest elevation of your status in this world and the next.
Galen said in some of his precepts: Do not treat a disease poorly, lest you become a poor physician.
This article has been divided into three chapters.
The first chapter.
In cauterization by fire and cauterization by sharp medicine, a well-ordered treatise from the heel to the foot, detailing instruments and cauterizing irons, and everything necessary for manual practice.
And the second chapter.
On incision, extraction, phlebotomy, cupping, surgeries, removing arrows, and similar procedures, all categorized and ordered, with illustrations of the instruments.
And the third chapter.
On fractures, dislocations, treatment of sprains, and similar conditions, categorized and ordered from the heel to the foot, with illustrations of the instruments.
The first chapter.
On cauterization.
Before describing the procedure, it is necessary to mention its benefits and drawbacks, and in what temperament it is used.
I say that discussing the benefits and drawbacks of cauterization, its precise science, and hidden secret, is a long discussion and a subtle knowledge, about which many wise men have spoken.
And they differed in their opinions; I have summarized the essentials of their discourse, for fear of being too verbose.
I say that cauterization is generally beneficial for all bad temperaments, whether with matter or without, except for two temperaments: a hot temperament without matter and a dry temperament without matter.
As for the dry temperament with matter, they differed in opinion. Some said that cauterization is beneficial in it, while others argued the opposite, that cauterization is not suitable for an illness arising from heat and dryness, because the nature of fire is heat and dryness.
It is impossible to be cured of a hot and dry illness with a hot and dry remedy.  The one who says otherwise asserts that cauterization with fire may benefit from a hot and dry illness occurring in people's bodies. Because when you add a person's body and its moisture to the temperament of fire, you make the person's body cold.
And I say as he says, because experience has shown me this many times, however, this matter should only be considered by someone who has trained extensively in the art of cauterization. And he must understand the diverse temperaments of people, and the nature of illnesses themselves, their causes, symptoms, and duration.
As for other temperaments, there is no danger from them, especially cold and moist diseases. All physicians agree on this and do not differ on the benefit of cauterization in these cases.
Know, my children, that the secret of cauterization with fire and its superiority over cauterization with a burning medicine lies in this: fire is a simple element whose effect is limited to the organ cauterized, and it harms a connected organ only slightly.
Cauterization with a burning medicine, however, may extend its effect to other organs and perhaps induce a difficult-to-treat illness or even death in the affected organ. Fire, by its nobility and the purity of its essence, does not cause this unless it is used excessively.
This has been made clear to us through experience, due to the length of our service and care in the craft, and through our understanding of the truth of the matter.
Therefore, I have dispensed with lengthy discussion.  Had it not been inappropriate for this book, I would have presented to you a profound secret about fire, its effect on the body, and its ability to dispel disease, using a rigorous and logical philosophical argument that might be beyond your understanding.
Know, my children, that there is disagreement concerning the time most suitable for cauterization, and they consider spring to be the best time.
I say that cauterization is suitable at all times, since the harm caused by time is overcome by the benefit derived from cauterization. Especially if the cauterization is for a strong, necessary affliction, a delay for which is intolerable, for fear that it may lead to a greater calamity than the slight harm caused by time.
Do not, my children, consider the misconception of the common people and ignorant physicians, that cauterization, which cures a disease, will never return, and you regard it as a bane.
This is not as you suppose, for cauterization is like a medicine that changes the temperament and dries the moisture, which is the cause of the afflictions.
However, cauterization is superior to medication because of its swift success, powerful effect, and intense influence.
The disease may return at some time, depending on the patient's temperament, the strength and severity of the illness, the accumulation of humors in the body, and neglect of acquiring proper nourishment, and similar causes.
Unless the disease for which cauterization is used is a mild one, affecting a part of the body with few humors and moisture. For example, cauterizing a tooth for pain, and similar cases, the pain may not return, and this is the least that can be expected.
And as for the common saying that cauterization is the final treatment, it is a correct statement, not in the way they believe, since they think that no treatment can benefit after cauterization, either medicinal or otherwise, but the matter is different.
The meaning of "cauterization is the final treatment" is that, when we have employed various treatments for a disease and those remedies prove ineffective, then if cauterization is ultimately successful, that is why cauterization is called the final treatment. Not in the sense understood by the common people and many ignorant physicians.
The ancients stated that cauterization with gold is better than cauterization with iron.  They said this because of the moderation of gold and the nobility of its essence, and that the cauterized area does not fester.  However, this is not universally true.
For I have tested it and found that it only does this in some bodies and not others; and cauterization with gold is better and superior to iron, as they have said. However, if you heat the gold cautery in the fire, you will not discern when it has been heated to the desired degree for the redness of gold.
Because it is quickly chilled, and if you increase its heat in a fever, it melts in the fire and becomes deformed, so the artisan is occupied with this.  Therefore, cauterization with iron is faster and more practically sound for use, God willing.
I have organized this chapter on cauterization into sections, arranging them from head to foot, so that the student may readily find what he desires, God willing.
Chapter One.
In cauterizing the head, a single cauterization.
This cauterization is beneficial for the excess moisture and cold in the brain, which are causes of headaches, frequent colds descending from the head to the eyes and ears, excessive sleepiness, toothaches, and sore throats. And generally, for all illnesses resulting from cold, such as paralysis, epilepsy, and stupor, and similar ailments.
The procedure for this cauterization is that the patient should first be made to vomit with a purgative medicine that clears the head for three or four nights, according to the patient's strength, age, and habits.
Then, order him to shave his head with a razor, then seat him before you, squatting, with his hands on his chest.
Then, place the base of your palm on the base of his nose between his eyes.  Where your middle finger ends, mark that spot with ink.
Then heat the olive-wood cautery, which is of this shape.
If the bone is exposed to the size of a thread or a carob seed, lift your hand. Otherwise, reheat your iron, or use another if it has cooled. Until you see the bone as I described.  Then take some salt, dissolve it in water, and soak a piece of cotton in it.  Place it on the affected area and leave it for three days.
Then apply a piece of cotton soaked in clarified butter and leave it until the inflammation from the burn subsides.  Then treat it with the four-part ointment until it heals, God willing.
And they say that the longer a wound remains open, the more pus it produces, and that this is better and more beneficial.
Some have said that the skin should be cauterized to the bone, and the cautery should be held until some of the bone's thickness is burned. Then the burned portion of the bone should be scraped off, and then treated.
Others said that the cauterization should be vigorous, affecting the bone strongly, so that it falls away like a small, granular or scaly fragment.  They claimed that this expels fumes from the head, and that the wound should be left open for a long time.
Then it is treated until it heals.  I do not at all consider these two types of cauterization suitable for everyone, but rather a matter of chance. I prefer to avoid it, and safety is best.  For if the head's natural connections are disrupted, it weakens, as we have observed in other parts of the body.
Especially if the patient's head is naturally weak. The first type of cauterization is safer and better in my opinion.  Use it, and God willing you will be safe.
Chapter Two.
On cauterization of the head as well.
If a chronic headache occurs throughout the head, and this persists in the patient, and if poultices, plasters, flogging, ointments, and dressings have been used, especially if the single cauterization we described has not helped, then examine. If the patient's head is strong in constitution and not weak, and he experiences severe cold, cauterize again, a little above the first cauterization. Then cauterize each horn of his head, until the thickness of the skin is gone and the amount of bone we described is exposed. Cauterize a spot at the back of his head, in the area known as the "axe" (or "the place of the axe").  Be gentle here; do not expose the bone, as the patient will experience intense pain, unlike the pain of the other head cauterizations.  I will describe this cauterization in its place.
The cautery used for the horns and back of the head should be gentler than the cautery used for the middle of the head.  This is its image (or form).
Chapter Three.
For cauterization of the non-chronic sister (or sibling).
If, in a head fissure, pain occurs with headache, and the pain extends to the eye, then the patient should be purged with medications that clear the head.  Employ all other treatments that I have mentioned in the classifications of diseases.  If this is unsuccessful, then cauterization is possible in two ways. Either by cauterization with a sharp, burning medicine, or by iron.
As for cauterization with the burning medicine, one takes a single clove of garlic, peels it, and cuts off its ends. Then, with a broad scalpel, one cuts open the painful area of the temple until a space beneath the skin is created, large enough to accommodate the clove.
Then, insert it under the skin until it disappears, then apply a firm pressure to it, and leave it for fifteen hours. Then, remove it and take out the garlic. Allow the wound to heal for two or three days, and then dress it.
Apply a cotton swab dipped in ghee until the area becomes suppurated. Then, treat it with ointment until it heals, God willing. If you wish, you can do this with some of the burning medicines that I have provided in the eighteenth chapter on burning medicines.
As for cauterizing it with iron, it is done in this manner: Heat the cautery iron, which is depicted as follows:
It is called the nail-shaped cautery because its head resembles a nail, with some grooves and a small protrusion in the middle.
Then place it on the painful area, holding your hand while slowly rotating the iron. The amount burned through the skin's thickness should be about half of it. Raise your hand so as not to burn the artery underneath and cause bleeding, then soak a cotton swab in salt water and place it on the area, leaving it for three days. Then wrap the cotton in oil, and treat it with ointment until it heals, God willing.
If you wish, cauterize this abscess with the pointed knife-like part of the cautery, protecting yourself from cutting the artery in this particular abscess, especially if it is chronic.
Chapter Four.
Treating chronic abscesses.
If you have treated the abscess with the aforementioned treatment and the treatments mentioned in the sections on diseases, but the treatment has not been successful, and you observe a cause that does not respond to the initial cauterization with medicine or fire. Then you should heat the knife-like cautery until it whitens, after marking the area of pain with a line half a finger in length or similar, and you should withdraw your hand only once, while pulling it until the artery is cut and it reaches towards the bone.
However, you should be careful not to touch the jaw that moves during chewing, so as not to burn the muscle or nerve that moves it, and thus cause spasm.
And be cautious and careful of the bleeding from the artery you have cut, for there is danger in cutting it. Especially for one who does not know what to do and has not been a practiced practitioner, abandoning the work is better.
The treatment of accidental bleeding from the artery will be discussed in its place in the book, God willing, if you see an ailment that this cauterization cannot address.
If you see the patient's body able to tolerate it, cauterize a spot in the middle of the head, as we have described, and treat the wound until it heals, God willing.
If you wish, use the cauterization mentioned in the chapter on ligating the artery with the double-bladed cautery; it is a better and more effective cauterization than this.
Fifth Chapter.
On cauterizing earaches.
If an earache due to cold occurs and is treated with purgatives and other treatments mentioned in the classification, but the pain does not subside, cauterize the ear with the cautery, the so-called "point," depicted in this image.
Then, after heating it, apply it in a circling motion around the entire ear, or around both ears if the pain is in them. And move the cautery slightly away from the base of the ear after marking the area with ink. The cauterization should be about ten points to each ear or similar. Then, treat the affected areas until healed, God willing.
Chapter Six.
Concerning cauterization with a hot iron.
The affliction treated by cauterization is of the type that arises from phlegm, as I have mentioned in the classifications of diseases.
One should avoid cauterizing the type that arises from dryness and nerve tension.
If you have treated this type of affliction with poultices, massages, and gargles and your treatment has been unsuccessful, then the afflicted person should be cauterized three times. One at the base of the ear, the second slightly below the temple, and the third at the junction of the lips.
Make your cauterization on the opposite side of the affected area, because relaxation occurs on the side that appears healthy.
The cauterization should be performed with one cauterization in line with the upper part of the ear, slightly below the temple, and another in the temple, with a length equal to that of the thumb.
Apply the cauterization with your hand until you burn approximately half the thickness of the skin. This is the image of the cautery iron, which is a type of scalpel, whose image was previously presented, but it is slightly gentler than it, as you can see. The knife should have a slight excess thickness, then the affected area should be treated as previously mentioned, until it heals, God willing.
Chapter Seven.
On cauterization for chronic stroke.
If the stroke becomes chronic and treatment as described was ineffective, and the patient does not have a fever, cauterize four times. One cauterization on each temple, one cauterization in the middle of the head as previously mentioned, and one cauterization at the back of the head as described before.
Using the cautery method as previously stated, a cauterization may also be applied to the mouth of the stomach, which will be more effective. Then, treat according to the preceding method.
Chapter Eight.
On Cauterization for Forgetfulness.
The patient afflicted with phlegmatic forgetfulness should first be given large doses of emetics and purgatives that clear the brain.
Then, shave his entire head and apply a mustard poultice, as described in the chapter on dressings, repeatedly.  It is a form of cauterization.
And do this in the same manner as described there. If he is cured, then stop. Otherwise, apply three cauterizations to the back of his head, aligned from the top of the head to the bottom of the neck.
Place the thickness of a finger between each cauterization.  Then treat the cauterization as previously described. If you wish to increase the treatment and the patient can tolerate it, cauterize the middle cauterization.
If you wish to increase the treatment, cauterize the temples, then treat it until he is cured. The cauterization tool should be olive-shaped, as previously described.
Chapter Nine.
On cauterization for paralysis and general relaxation of the body.
First, purify the head with the applications mentioned.  Then shave the patient's head and cauterize one spot in the middle of the head, one on each temple, and one on the back of the head.
And three cauterizations on the cervical vertebrae.  If the illness of bodily relaxation requires more than that, and the patient is able to endure it and the illness is strong and entrenched, cauterize four spots on the vertebrae of the back. Cauterize deeply enough to burn most of the skin, then lift your hand. Then treat as previously described until he is healed, God willing.  Use an olive oil-based cautery.
Chapter Ten.
On cauterizing epilepsy.
Only the epileptic whose epilepsy is due to phlegm should be cauterized. First, his brain should be cleansed with large cupping glasses and with all the treatment we have mentioned in the section if the patient is large and able to take the medications.
However, if he is a child who cannot tolerate medication, then gargles and mouthwashes that cleanse the brain should be used many days before, along with improving his diet.
Then, shave his head and then cauterize with one cautery in the center of the head, as described previously, and another cautery at his back. And on each temple of his head, a cautery.  If the patient is strong and can tolerate it, cauterize with the cauteries mentioned in the section on paralysis and relaxation of the body, on the cervical and dorsal vertebrae.  The cautery should be olive-shaped, as described previously.
If the patient is a child, make the cautery gentle, in this manner.
Chapter Eleven.
Concerning the cauterization of melancholia.
If the cause of melancholia is corrupted humours and thick phlegm, cauterize with the cauteries we described in the section on paralysis.
If the cause of melancholia is an excess of black bile and the patient's body is moist, purge what will cleanse his brain, as was previously discussed in the division.
Then shave the patient's head, then make a tight cake of flax like a circle, then place it in the center of his head, and the patient sits upright holding on from each side. Then take one pound of aged sheep's fat.
Then heat it over the fire to a moderate heat, as much as the finger can tolerate if placed inside, then pour it into the circle on the center of his head and leave it until it cools. Do this with the patient once a week with the rest of his good treatment until he is cured, God willing.
And if you wish, cauterize it with many small, scattered punctures without holding the cautery in one place, but rather by stroking. This type of cauterization moistens the brain moderately.
Then apply a cloth soaked in clarified butter or chicken fat to it.
Chapter twelve.
On cauterizing the water that flows from the eye.
If you initially determine that the water flowing from the eye displays the signs mentioned in the classification, then promptly treat the afflicted person.  Cleanse their head, protecting it from all moisture, and have them sweat in a bath on an empty stomach for several days.
Then shave their head and cauterize the center of the head, and cauterize the temples twice if the water is flowing from both eyes, or once on the affected temple if only one eye is involved.
Then, with the cautery, cut all the veins and arteries under the skin, ensuring the cauterizations extend lengthwise across the temples, and take precautions to prevent bleeding.
If you see something of it, cut it off at the point with any available remedy.  We will come to the wisdom of binding arteries and cutting them, and how to prevent bleeding.
Two strong cauterizations may be applied to the back of the head, beneath the bones.
Chapter Thirteen.
On cauterizing chronic tears.
If the tears of the eye are chronic and persistent, and originate from veins and arteries on the surface of the head, originating from outside the head, and you are certain that it is due to excess thick cold phlegm, then apply the cautery that I described at the beginning of the descending water. A cauterization in the middle of the head, two cauterizations on the temples, and two cauterizations at the back of the head below the bones; and if further cauterization is needed, then apply a cauterization on each side of the eye's corner at the edge of the eyebrow with a small cautery iron.
Chapter Fourteen.
On cauterizing foul odors of the nose.
If treatment with what we have mentioned in the classification is unsuccessful, then quickly apply cupping to the patient three nights, then shave his head and cauterize the middle area with the olive-oil cautery. Then cauterize with the nail cautery two points above the eyebrows, slightly beneath the hair, taking care to avoid the artery, not to cut it.  This is the image of the nail cautery.
Chapter Fifteen.
On cauterizing relaxation of the eyelid.
If the eyelid is relaxed due to illness or moisture, cauterize the eyelid once with this crescent-shaped cautery.
And if you wish, cauterize slightly above the eyebrows, two points on each side, spaced apart from the temples, and the length of each cautery should be the length of the eyebrow.
Do not overdo the cauterization, but only to the point where one-third of the skin is burned.  The shape of the cautery should be like this.
Chapter Sixteen.
On cauterizing the eyelid.
If the eyelashes turn inward and injure the eye, then the cauterization is of two types. Either by fire or by a burning medicine.  If cauterization is by fire, then instruct the patient beforehand to remove the eyelashes if he is the sort who plucks them, until they grow long and straight.
If it injured the eye while the eyelashes are growing, then bind his eyes with a bandage so that they do not move until they grow.  Once they have grown and straightened, place the patient's head on your lap, then mark the eyelid with ink in the shape of a leaf-like as.
Begin the mark near the eyelashes. Then place under the eyelid a cotton swab soaked in egg white or the saliva of the *basarqatun*.  Then heat a cautery iron, this is its image.
Then cauterize in the shape you have marked, little by little, several times, until the surface of the skin that is in the shape of the entire leaf-like as is completely burned.  A sign of successful work is to see that the eyelid has shrunk and the hair has risen from the eye's flesh.
Then remove your hand and leave him for three days. Then apply a cotton swab with ghee until the scab falls off. Then treat it with ointment until it heals, God willing. If any hair grows back later and the eyelid relaxes.
Then repeat the cauterization on that spot as you did at first. If the hair is in the lower eyelid, cauterize it until it returns to its natural position and does not injure the eye.  As for cauterization with a burning medicine, tell the patient to let the eyelashes grow long and straight.
Then make a shape of an as-leaf from paper. Then take from the usual soap and quicklime, one dirham or thereabouts from each, grind them both well, and do this quickly so that they do not dry. Then spread some of this mixture on the paper you have shaped like an as-leaf, and place it on the one or both eyelids. Place a cotton swab soaked in egg white under the eye, and hold the patient's head in your lap.
Place your index finger over the medicine and gently press it while moving it whenever the patient feels the medicine's sting, because he will feel a stinging sensation like fire. As long as he feels the sting, leave the medicine and move it with your finger.  Once the stinging subsides, remove the medicine and wash the eye with water.
And see if you see the eyelid has risen, as it rises when cauterized with fire or cut. Otherwise, repeat the application of the medicine to the area where it did not take effect and did not darken until you complete your work and the eye is cauterized. Then apply cotton with oil to remove the irritation of the burning.
Then treat it with the palm ointment or another, until it heals.  You should be extremely careful during the procedure to avoid any medicine falling into the eye. If the eyelid loosens after a few days, and you are afraid of something like hair getting into the eye.
Then reapply the medicine to the loosened area of the eyelid specifically, as you did at first, and treat it until it heals. This is an image of the as-leaf.
Know that people's eyes vary in size and age, therefore, your cauterization should be adjusted accordingly.  The correct method is not hidden from someone experienced in this craft.
Chapter Seventeen.
On cauterizing the fistula that appears in the eye's corner.
If you have treated the fistula as described in the sections on diseases, and your treatment has not been successful, then you should cauterize it in this manner.
Tell the patient to place their head in your lap, and have an assistant hold the head firmly, preventing any movement or shaking.
Then place a cotton ball soaked in egg white or in the juice of a prickly pear on their eyes, and then heat the cauterizing iron, which is depicted like this.
It should be hollow, like the shaft of a bird of prey's feather, on the side used for cauterization, and if you wish, the other side can be pierced, or if you wish, it can be solid like a rod.  However, this hollow form is better for your work, God willing.
Then, squeeze the fistula if it is open, and remove the matter from it and dry it, or if it is not open, then open it and remove the pus.  Then apply the very hot cauterizing iron to it, holding it with your hand until you reach the bone.
Move your hand slightly when cauterizing, from the eye towards the nose, so that your hand does not miss the mark or the patient become upset and the cautery falls on the eyelid, damaging it. If you reach the bone on the first cauterization, then do otherwise; if not, repeat the cauterization again if necessary.
Leave it for three days, then apply a cotton ball with oil and treat it with a drying ointment until it heals. If forty days pass and it does not heal, apply a strong, corrosive medicine until the bone is exposed, and treat it as described in the relevant chapter, God willing.
Another method of cauterizing the fistula, mentioned by some earlier authors, is to go to the location of the fistula, slit it open, and then place a thin funnel in the slit.  This is its form.
Pour into it an amount of molten lead equal to the weight of a dirham.  Hold the funnel firmly in your hand, tightly held, and the patient must not move at all so that the molten lead does not drip into his eye.  You should place a cotton ball soaked in egg white or water on the patient's eye.
The lead will burn the fistula and heal it in an amazing way. If the fistula heals with the cauterization and treatment described, then it is well. Otherwise, it is necessary to use nasal perforation and return the fistula to its nasal passage as will be explained in the specific section.
Chapter Eighteen.
On cauterizing the cleft lip.
A cleft often occurs in the lip, called the hair, especially in the lips of young boys.  If, after treating this cleft with the methods we mentioned in the classification, the treatment is ineffective, then heat a small, knife-shaped cautery in this manner.
Make its cavity as thin as a knife, then place it hot and quickly into the same cleft until the cauterization reaches the depth of the cleft, and then treat it with the Qiyaruti until it heals, God willing.
Chapter Nineteen.
On cauterizing the fistula occurring in the mouth.
If a tumor appears at the base of the gums, or in the palate, or at the roots of the teeth, then ulcerates and bursts, and from the flow of pus a fistula results, and if treatment fails, then a cautery should be heated to the size suitable for the fistula.
Then, insert it hot into the fistula's opening, and hold until the heated iron reaches its depth and end. Do this once or twice, then treat it afterward with the treatment we mentioned until it heals, God willing.
If the matter is severed and healed, then well and good. Otherwise, the area must be examined, and the corrupt bone must be removed, as will be explained in its chapter, God willing.
Chapter Twenty.
Loose teeth and gums.
If the gums have become loose due to moisture and the teeth have moved, and treatment with medicines has been ineffective, place the patient's head in your lap, then heat the cautery iron, whose image will come after this, after placing the tube on the tooth.
Quickly insert the hot cautery iron into it, holding your hand for a little while until the patient feels the heat of the fire has reached the root of the tooth, then remove your hand, then repeat the cautery iron several times as desired. Afterwards, have the patient fill his mouth with salt water.
He should hold it for an hour and then spit it out.  The loose tooth will become fixed and the loose gums will tighten, and the putrid moisture will dry up.
Chapter Twenty-one.
On cauterizing toothache.
If the toothache is from cold or contains worms and medicine has not helped, cauterization can be done in two ways: either with oil or with fire.
As for cauterization with butter: take cow's butter, boil it in an iron spoon or shell. Then take a piece of cotton, wrap it around the end of a probe, dip it in the boiled butter, and place it on the aching tooth quickly, holding it until it cools.
Then repeat this several times until the heat reaches the root of the tooth. Alternatively, you can dip wool or cotton in cold butter and place it on the aching tooth, then place a heated iron on top to bring the heat to the base of the tooth.
As for cauterizing with fire: take a copper or iron tube, somewhat thick-walled, so that the heat of the fire does not reach the patient's mouth. Then heat a cautery instrument, place it on the same tooth, and hold it until it cools.  Repeat this several times.
The pain will then disappear either on that day or the next.  Following the cauterization, the patient should fill his mouth with good butter and hold it for an hour, then spit it out.  This is the image of the cautery instrument.
Cauterize with whichever end you prefer, as necessary.  This is the image of the tube.
Chapter Twenty-Two.
On cauterizing swine.
If the swine are affected by phlegm and cold humors, and do not respond to ripening with medications, and you desire rapid ripening, heat the hollow cautery, the image of which is shown with both ends perforated.
To allow smoke to emerge from the opposite end during cauterization, apply it to the same tumor repeatedly, if necessary, until you reach the depth of the tumor. If the tumor is small, make the cautery the same size as the tumor.
Then leave it for three days and apply a cotton ball soaked in ghee to the area until what was burned by the fire is gone. Then treat it with ointment and sutures until it heals, God willing.
Chapter Twenty-three.
In cauterization for hoarseness of voice and shortness of breath.
If humidity predominates in the trachea, especially if accompanied by a cold temperament, the patient should first be made to vomit with laxative medications.  Then, a cautery should be applied to a point on the neck, near the base of the throat, at the low point.
Be careful not to reach the throat with the cautery, and only burn the skin to a half-degree.  Then cauterize another spot at the neck joint, just past the last bead of the neck.  The cautery iron should be nail-shaped, as described previously.
Then treat him with what has been mentioned previously until he is healed, God willing.
Chapter Twenty-four.
On cauterizing lung disease and coughing.
If the cough and lung disease are due to cold dampness, and the patient does not have a fever or consumption, and the illness is chronic, cauterize twice above the collarbones, in the soft, empty, low-lying areas, and once more in the middle of the chest between the breasts.
The cauterizing iron should be pointed, as previously described.  If you prefer, use a dripping cauterizing iron, the one called "the point," a design previously shown in the treatment of ear pain.  The number of drips should be between thirty and about that number.
Then treat him/her with what was previously mentioned until he/she is cured.  One may also use a three-pronged cauterizing iron, as depicted, for a quicker treatment as it allows three cauterizations in one application. This is the image of the iron.
Chapter Twenty-five.
Cauterization of the armpit.
If the head of the humerus has dislocated due to slippery moisture, or if, after returning it from dislocation, it does not remain fixed, so that it dislocates again at the slightest movement, as we have observed, then the joint must first be reduced. Then the patient lies on their back or on their right side, and the skin inside the armpit is pulled upward with the fingers of your left hand, if the joint has dislocated inward.
Then the double-pointed cautery, whose image is this, is heated.
Then, with it, the skin is cauterized until it penetrates to the other side. The shape of the cauterization is four cauterizations.  It may also be cauterized with a three-pointed cautery, in which case the shape of the cauterization is six cauterizations, and the points are according to the thickness of the tissue.
And this is the image of the three-pointed cautery.
And one more may be added to this number, making eight cauterizations. Then the beaten balls with salt are applied to the cauterization.  The patient should be given rest and not move the affected limb for a time until it strengthens.  If the dislocation is upward, it is rare.
Cauterize above the shoulder blade with one good, nail-like cauterization or many small cauterizations.  Then the joint will strengthen, the moisture will disappear, and the patient will recover.
Chapter Twenty-six.
In cauterizing the stomach.
If the stomach suffers from cold and excessive moisture, disrupting its temperament, and frequent discharges occur despite various treatments being ineffective, the patient should lie on their back, extend their legs and arms, and then receive three cauterizations. Cauterize beneath the breastbone, a distance equivalent to a finger's breadth, using a nail-like cautery iron.  Then cauterize with two additional cauteries, one each below the flanks of the first, so the cauteries form a triangle. Keep a space between them so that they do not unite when suppurating. The depth of the cauterization should be roughly two-thirds the thickness of the skin.  The shape of the cauteries should be [a particular form, implied].
In this way, and to this extent, no more.
And if you wish, cauterize it with a single large cautery in the center of the stomach, in this manner.
The cautery iron used for this single cauterization should be circular in shape, in this manner.
The stomach can also be cauterized by pricking, for those who are averse to this cauterization.  Mark the stomach with dots, the size you desire, using ink.  Then cauterize them using a pointed cautery iron.  Then treat it with the previously described treatment until it heals.
Chapter Twenty-Seven.
On cauterizing the cold liver.
If a painful condition arises in the liver due to coldness and dampness, or a hot wind that has caused it to deviate excessively from its natural temperament, and the treatment described in the classification proved ineffective. Then the patient should lie on their back, and three cauteries, of this exact shape and size, should be marked with ink on the liver, below the collarbones, where the human forearm ends.
Each cautery should be the thickness of a finger, and the cautery should be applied straight along the body, without pressing the iron with your hand.
Let the amount burned of the skin's thickness be about half, no more.  The patient should stand on their feet, or if unable, lie with legs extended and arms raised.  This is the shape of the cautery iron.
You may perform these cauteries with a knife-shaped cautery iron, if you possess skill and dexterity in the craft, and take care not to overdo it, lest you burn all the skin, thus burning the abdomen and reaching the intestines.  The skin there is thin; be aware of this.
Chapter Twenty-Eight.
Treating a liver tumor with cautery.
If an abscess appears in the liver, and you wish to know whether the tumor is in the liver's flesh or its membrane, if it is in the liver's flesh, the patient will experience heaviness and pain, but not severe pain.
And if it is in the liver's membrane, there will be severe pain with intensity, and if you find that the physicians have exhausted all treatment options, then the patient should lie on their back, and you should mark the swollen area with ink.
Then, heat the cautery in the fire; it is a cautery resembling a file, and this is its form. And cauterize with a single cauterization, until the entire skin is burned and the cauterization reaches the membrane, so that all the matter is expelled, then treat it with abscess treatment until it heals.
This type of cauterization should only be performed by someone who has extensive experience in medicine and has treated such diseases repeatedly through experience. Only then should one undertake such a procedure; to leave it to someone else is preferable.
The twenty-ninth chapter.
On cauterizing the fistula.
The ancients recommended cauterizing cold fistulas with the roots of the zarawand plant in this way: take a single, longest, dried zarawand root, as thick as a finger, then dip it in oil and hold it in the fire. Then cauterize once between the collarbone and neck, and two small cauterizations slightly off the veins, slanted towards the area under the chin, and two large cauterizations above the breasts, between the third and fourth ribs.
And two more cauterizations between the fifth and sixth ribs, slightly slanted backward, another cauterization in the middle of the chest, and another above the stomach, and three cauterizations from behind, one between the shoulders and two on the sides of the lower back, below the cauterization between the shoulder blades.
One should not probe deeply with the cautery, but it should be superficial, on the surface of the skin.  Some of the ancients reported that some people used a heated iron rod, similar to a spatula, heating it and inserting it between the ribs until it reached the tumor itself.
The pus will discharge, as we mentioned in the case of a liver tumor, and in this condition, cauterization may lead to the patient's death immediately, or a fistula will develop that cannot be healed.
Chapter Thirty.
On cauterizing the spleen.
If you have treated spleen disease with the therapies described in the classification and your treatment is unsuccessful, cauterization is possible in three ways, each correct: one is to cauterize the spleen three or four times, in a row along its length.
In the shape of the liver cauterizations previously described, and there should be a space between each cauterization the thickness of a finger or a little more. The cauterization implement should have the same properties as that described for liver cauterization. Do not dig deep with the cauterization tool. The patient should be lying on their back.
The other way is at the elbow; lift the skin opposite the spleen where the patient's left elbow ends. Lift the skin across the width of the body so that the cauterizations are along the body.
Then, very carefully insert the cautery probes until they penetrate the skin from the opposite side. Then, remove the cauterizing tool, and the cauterizations will be four.  If desired, use the cautery tool with three probes.
Then treat the cauterization site after it has been allowed to discharge pus for several days; this is more effective than any of the previous treatments.
Chapter Thirty-one.
On cauterizing hydrops.
Cauterization is only beneficial in ascites, specifically. If, after treating the patient with the types of treatments we mentioned in the classification, your treatment proves ineffective, you should cauterize four times around the navel and once on the stomach.
Another cauterization on the liver and one on the spleen, and two behind his back, one opposite his chest and the other opposite his stomach. The depth of the cauterization should be close to the thickness of the skin. Then leave the cauterization open to discharge pus for a long time.
Do not neglect the patient with aftercare following the cauterization, as necessary for the affected areas to heal quickly, ensuring the proper recovery of the patient. The shape of the cautery iron used for the back is pointed, as previously described, and that used for the back is olive-shaped.
Chapter Thirty-two.
On cauterizing the feet and legs.
If the feet swell and fill with yellow water in dropsy, then it is necessary to cauterize the back of the foot at the point between the little finger and the ring finger.
Hold your hand with the cautery iron upright and do not bend it. Then raise your hand and do not lower it again, for the yellow water will drain, and the cautery iron should be of this shape.
Then cauterize the legs twice on each leg; the cauterization should be done with the sharp tip of the cautery iron, along the length of the leg, one below the knee, and another below that, towards the middle of the leg, and on each thigh cauterize twice.
Leave the cauterization open without treatment for a long time to allow the water to drain, then treat it with the rest of the methods we mentioned.
Chapter Thirty-Three.
On the cauterization of diarrhea.
If the diarrhea is due to cold and dampness, weakening the binding and digestive forces in the stomach and intestines, and if various treatments have been unsuccessful, and you see the patient capable of enduring a cauterization and possessing sufficient strength, then cauterize a large area on his stomach. As previously mentioned, cauterize the stomach with a circular cautery iron, and perform four cauterizations around the navel using a fine pointed cautery iron.  Apply one or two large cauterizations to the cotton above the coccyx.
If you observe excessive dampness and the patient is able to tolerate it, cauterize a spot on the pubic area, and a spot on each hip.  Perhaps, add two small cauterizations near the large one on the stomach.  This is a successful and unfailing treatment, God willing.
Chapter Thirty-Four.
On cauterizing hemorrhoids of the anus.
If there are many chronic hemorrhoids in the anus, or one hemorrhoid, and they are composed of thick, cold humors or corrupt moisture, and treatment as previously mentioned in the division was ineffective, cauterize the patient three times on the lower part of the lumbar spine, slightly below the table, in a triangular shape.
And cauterize under the navel with a width of two fingers.  If you judge that the patient's stomach is cold, food is not digesting, and you see the face swollen, then cauterize a large spot on the stomach, as previously described, and cauterize the liver. And another on the spleen with a nail-shaped cautery. Leave the cauterization open for a time, then treat him until he is healed, God willing.
Chapter Thirty-five.
On cauterizing warts.
After cutting it, if the wart is cut, heat the cautery, which resembles a stylus, then insert it hot into the same cut wart and press your hand firmly until the cautery reaches the mouth of the vein from which blood flows. Do this once or twice.
If the warts are numerous, cauterize each one as described, then treat them with suitable ointments until they heal.  If you cauterize a large area on the skin, with cotton, that would be more beneficial.
Chapter Thirty-six.
On cauterizing the fistula that occurs in the perineum and its surrounding areas.
If the patient does not respond to the incision and the procedure we described in its place, and avoids it, he may heal with cauterization. If a fistula develops in someone and has existed for a long time, pus and corrupted moisture flow from it, the first thing you should do is measure it with a thin probe.
Then, determine its depth with the probe. Then, heat the cautery iron, which resembles a needle, and insert it hot into the same fistula, aligning it with the depth of the fistula and the amount the probe went in. Repeat the cauterization until all the corrupted material is burned, once, twice, or three times as needed.
And be careful not to burn a nerve, if there is one, or a large vein, if the fistula opens into the bladder or the intestine.
And be careful of all these locations.  You should only do this if the fistula is in a fleshy area and you judge that it is not penetrating. Then treat the area until it heals. If the area is sealed and the materials have stopped flowing from it and remains so for a while, know that it has healed completely.
If the discharge does not stop, know that it is penetrating or that there is corrupted bone within its depth, or something similar, which will be discussed in its place.
Chapter Thirty-seven.
On cauterizing the kidneys.
If pain occurs in the kidneys due to cold or thick wind, and the patient's sexual activity is reduced as a result, it is appropriate to cauterize them on the loins, cauterizing each kidney with the nail-shaped cautery previously mentioned.  Perhaps the cauterization can be done three times on the same surface, producing three aligned cauterizations, which will be more beneficial.
Chapter Thirty-eight.
On cauterizing the bladder.
If weakness and relaxation occur in the bladder due to cold and dampness, to the point that the patient cannot retain urine, cauterize it with a cauterization below the navel on the bladder, where the pubic hair begins, and another cauterization to the right of the navel and another to the left.
The cauterization, from each side, should be the size of a thumb's breadth.  Cauterize one or two cauterizations on the lower back, if needed.  The cautery should be nail-shaped, as previously described.
Chapter Thirty-nine.
On cauterizing the uterus.
If the uterus has a buildup of cold and dampness, preventing pregnancy, corrupting the menstrual flow, or causing pain during menstruation, three cauterizations should be applied around the navel, as described in the cauterization of the bladder. One cauterization on the lower back, at the base of the spine, or two, and the cautery should be nail-shaped.
Chapter Forty.
On cauterizing a dislocated hip.
False humors may gather in the socket of the hip, causing dislocation.  A sign is that one leg will be longer than the other when compared, and you will find an empty space at the site of the dislocation.  It is necessary to cauterize the afflicted area, around the socket of the hip itself, with a roughly circular cauterization.
After applying the cautery around the socket, the socket should lie in the center of the circle.  The cautery shown in the example of cauterizing the stomach should be used. If this cautery is unavailable, then use three cauterizations with a large olive-shaped cautery.
Make the cauterization deep to the full thickness of the skin.  Then treat it until it heals, God willing.
Chapter Forty-One.
In cauterizing sciatica.
If pain occurs in the hip joint due to cold and dampness, and the treatment mentioned in the classification proves ineffective after a period of time, then the patient should be relieved of thick humors through the use of rotten seeds or prickly pear seeds, or similar remedies.
Then cauterize.  Cauterization has two forms: either with burning medicines, or with fire.  Cauterization with fire has various methods, one of which is to cauterize the hip joint itself with three triangular cauterizations in this manner.
This will produce a beneficial depth, with the interval between each cauterization equal to the thickness of a finger.  The cauterizing agent should be olive-colored.  One may cauterize in the center, on the head of the hip itself, for a total of four cauterizations.  Or, if desired, cauterize with a circular motion, as previously described in treating hip dislocation, with a single cauterization.
The circle should encompass the entire hip, burning the full thickness of the skin. This is the method of cauterization for sciatica if the pain is localized to the hip itself, and does not extend to the thigh and leg.
If the pain extends to the thigh and leg, cauterize twice on the thigh, at the location the patient indicates as painful.  Cauterize once above the heel, about four fingers to the outer side.  Use a scalpel-like cauterizing agent, and make the depth of the cauterization only the thickness of the skin.
If the patient indicates that the pain extends towards the toes, cauterize at the indicated location with the pinpoint cautery three, four, or more times, if necessary.  If the pain is below the knee, towards the leg, cauterize once with a scalpel-like cautery.
In all your cauterizations, be careful not to burn a major nerve or artery, lest you cause the patient a serious or lasting injury.
I have observed cases of cauterization above the heel, where excessive cauterization caused gangrene of the leg, extending to the foot and causing its complete necrosis, ruining the entire leg, and followed by diarrhea and death. If the pain is in both areas, cauterize them in exactly the same manner.
Some knowledgeable scholars have described a specific cauterization method for the hip.  A cup-like object is made of iron, with a diameter of half a span.  Its opening is the thickness of a date pit, or slightly smaller.  Inside this cup are another cup, and a third cup.
There is a space of about the width of a thumb's breadth between each cup, and the cups are open on both sides. Their height is approximately one or two spans.  A handle of iron is firmly attached to the cups.  This is its description.
Then, it is heated in the fire until it glows red and sparks, and then placed on the affected hip, with the patient resting on the healthy side.  Three circular cauterizations are made in one instance.  Then, it is left for three days, and bandaged with ghee, leaving the wound open for several days.
Then it is treated with ointment until healed. The author of this book states that this type of cauterization is rarely used due to its unpleasantness and horrific appearance, and few can tolerate it. However, it is a good cauterization for those who can endure it and who suffer from the affected area.
As for cauterization with burning medicines, it is done by creating two cups resembling the rings where the gate-bolt of a door goes, made of copper or iron.
Their height will be about two spans, or thereabouts. The distance between them will be about the thickness of a finger.  The bottoms and tops will be open.  They are fastened together in this manner.
Then, place them on the affected hip of the patient lying on his/her healthy side. Hold your hand gently. Then pour a little hot, sharp water between the circles (cups).  Hold it for a while, like an hourglass. The patient endures the burning and stinging, which is like fire.
Until the stinging subsides. Then remove the instrument, and wash the entire hip with fresh water.  Leave it for three days.  Apply ghee until the blackness of the burning disappears.  Leave it for a few days, allowing pus to drain, as it is most beneficial.
Then treat it with ointments until it heals. If the pain extends to the thigh or leg, make a mold for him/her, holding the water in the same way as done for the hip.  This is the description of sharp water, and it has been proven in the treatise on the improvement of medicines.
Take one part each of lye and quicklime. Grind them and place them in a new pot with a single small hole at the bottom, just large enough for the pestle to enter. Place another glazed pot under the bottom of the first pot.
Pour enough fresh water over the lye and lime to cover them with a finger's breadth after you have thoroughly crushed them with your hand.  Let the pot sit until the sharp water descends to the bottom glazed pot.  Collect all the water and pour it onto fresh lime and lye, also ground.
It will then be extremely sharp, effective in many medical procedures and cauterizing other parts of the body, for it acts like fire itself.  Some medicines, such as thafsīya, balaذر honey, and lime mixed with soap, can also cauterize the hip when ground.
Galen recounted a story of an ancient physician's treatment for hip pain and sciatica, greatly praising it.  He claimed that no other treatment is needed and that it heals in one application.
Even, it is said, that a patient could be carried into the bath and emerge healed.  This is achieved by taking fresh green shiṭraj, or if no green is available, fresh dried shiṭraj, grinding it with some fat, and applying it to the hip where the pain is, or to the leg or thigh.
Apply the compress and leave it on for three hours, or as long as the patient feels the burning subside.  Then, have him enter the bath.  When his body is moist, place him in a basin.  The pain will disappear and he will be healed, God willing. If not, reapply the compress after ten days.
He will be healed, God willing.  And know that no one should use these cauterizing remedies until the body is emptied.  Dioscorides mentioned that goat's dung, if used for cauterizing sciatica, is beneficial.
The cauterization should be performed as follows: Take wool, soak it in old oil, and place it on the deep area between the thumb and the elbow, closer to the elbow.  Then take dry goat's dung.
Heat it in the fire until it becomes glowing embers, then place it on the wool and let it cool. Continue doing this until the sensation extends from the middle of the forearm to the hip, and the pain subsides, God willing. This type of cauterization is called cauterization with goat dung.
The Forty-second Chapter.
On cauterizing back pain.
Pain in the back may arise from various causes, such as falls, blows, excessive vomiting, and the like.  It results from the effusion of cold, moist matter.  Cauterization is applied only in this type of case.
After the patient has vomited, and after applying remedies like rotten herbs, the back where the pain is should be cauterized in three rows, each the width of a table, after marking the area with ink.  In each row, five cauterizations or more should be applied, as determined by the patient's tolerance and strength.
The cauterization should be done with a point cautery, or if desired, with a medium-sized nail cautery in three or four applications, in this manner.
Chapter Forty-Three.
On cauterizing the beginning of a swelling.
This ailment often affects young children.  A sign of its early stage in a child is shortness of breath when standing or moving, and at the end of the spinal column, a prominent bead appears, protruding above the other beads.
If you see this and wish to stop it, cauterize it with a circular cautery, in this manner. Apply the cautery to each side of the vertebra evenly.  If desired, cauterize around the vertebra with a pinpoint cautery, in two or three rows.  Let the points be close together.  Then treat the area until healed, as described.
Take care to use cautery on swellings caused by nerve spasms.
Chapter Forty-Four.
On cauterizing gout and joint pains.
If joint pains are caused by cold dampness flowing to any part of the body, and if the pains occur in the legs, physicians customarily call it gout, specifically.
If the cold gout, the cause, is treated with the methods we mentioned in the classification, and the pain does not subside, then cauterization will relieve it. This involves applying numerous cauterizations around the joint of the legs after inducing vomiting. The cauterizing instrument should be olive-oil based and of medium heat, in this manner.
And if necessary, apply dots on the leg with the pointed cauterizing instrument. If the pain ascends to the knees or to other joints, which frequently occurs, cauterize each knee with three or four cauterizations on each side using the same olive-oil based cauterizing instrument.
If more cauterization is needed, apply it, but do not dig your instrument deep into the skin; cauterize only to the thickness of the skin. If the pain ascends to the hips or back, use the cauterization method described in its appropriate section.
If the pain is only in the hands, apply dots around the wrists, in a row on both sides.  If the pain remains in the fingers, apply a dot to each knuckle and on the palm of the hand. If, after a few days, the pain ascends to the elbows or shoulders,
Cauterize them [the elbows or shoulders] on both sides.  The patient should not neglect good treatment and taking medication.  If he improves his diet and expels phlegm, he will recover with this cauterization, God willing.
Chapter Forty-five.
On cauterizing hernias.
If a hernia appears in the groin, and some intestines and fat have descended to the testicle, and this is a recent occurrence, the patient should be instructed to abstain from eating that day and to use laxatives to expel stool from his body.
Then, he should lie on his back before you, and you should instruct him to restrain himself until the fat or intestines emerge.  Then, you should push them back with your finger, and mark the area under the hernia on the pubic bone with ink, a mark resembling a semicircle with its ends pointing upwards towards the body.
Then, heat a cautery, which is pictured like this.
Until it glows white, emitting sparks.  Then, return the intestines or fat to the abdomen.  Then, have an attendant place their hand on the area so that the intestines do not protrude again. The patient's legs should be spread apart, and a cushion placed underneath them, with another attendant holding his legs.
And another attendant should hold his hands on his chest.  Then, bring the cautery down on the same mark.  Your hand should hold the cautery upright until it reaches the bone, or repeat the process if it did not reach the bone on the first attempt.
And carefully restrain the intestines from protruding while cauterizing, lest you burn the patient, causing either death or a serious illness.  Know that if the cauterization does not reach the bone, your work will not succeed.  The cautery should be appropriate in size for children and adults.
Then, treat the cauterized area with ghee after three days to remove the harshness of the burn, then treat it with other ointments until it heals.  Keep the patient lying on their back for forty days until the wound closes.
His food during the treatment should be such as to soften his bowels so that the intestines do not protrude during bowel movements.  Then, if he wishes to stand after forty days, a tight bandage should be used and kept on for another forty days.  Reduce exertion, overeating, drinking, and loud shouting.
If he follows this treatment, he will be completely healed, God willing.  I will describe the treatment of hernias by incision in its appropriate section, God willing.  Regarding a hernia that occurs in the rest of the abdomen, if you wish to prevent its growth, cauterize a circular area corresponding to the size of the hernia. Let the skin burned be about a third of its thickness, then treat it as described.  It will not grow, God willing.  Some early physicians mentioned cauterizing the hernia with a triangular cautery in this manner.
After marking the hernia with ink, and making a line across the upper part of the hernia and another line to the bottom, and placing your hand in the middle with a single, nail-like cauterization, the initial cauterization is easier and better, God willing.
Chapter Forty-six.
On cauterizing the fistula.
If, in some limb, a fall or blow causes pain that persists for a long time, and medication is ineffective, then it is necessary to cauterize with a pinpoint cautery.  The cauterization of each limb should be adjusted according to its size, smallness, weakness, and strength.
The pain and fistula will be subdued by the cauterization; if the initial cauterization heals him, then it is well and good.  If not, repeat the cauterization, for it is the nature of these ailments to spread from the affected limb to its surroundings.  Thus, cauterization must be followed up until the patient is healed.
Chapter Forty-seven.
On the cauterization of leprosy.
Lepers may benefit greatly from cauterization, especially those whose leprosy originates from the putrefaction of phlegm and black bile.
If you wish to cauterize him, observe. If the leprosy is in its initial stages and you have treated it as described in the section on classification, without deterioration or cessation, and you fear the corruption might spread to the patient's entire constitution, cauterize his head five times. One in the customary middle of the head, the second below it toward the forehead, at the end of the hair; two on the temples, and one at the back of the neck, at the nape; exert your cautery slightly, so that it affects the bone to a slight degree.
Scales will peel off, facilitating the expulsion of thick vapors from it; and cauterize the spleen also, as previously stated.  However, if the leprosy has persisted and become clearly evident on the patient, it is necessary to cauterize with the described methods on the head. One cauterization on the tip of the nose, two on each cheek, two on the cervical vertebrae, six on the thoracic vertebrae, one large one on the coccyx at the base of the tail, another above it on the same plane, and two on each thigh, one on each. Two on the knees, one on each knee, two on the shoulders, two on the elbows, two on the ribs of the chest, and cauterize each joint of his fingers and toes; and each heel of his feet and each wrist of his hands.
Avoid burning the nerves behind the heels.  A cauterization may be applied to the pubic bone, another to the stomach opening, and another to the liver.  Know that the more cauterizations you apply, the more beneficial and effective they will be.
Know that the patient experiences less pain from the cauterizations than a healthy person, because their body is numb.  The cauterization size—large or small—should be determined by the organs and joints, as described previously in the characteristics of the instruments.
Then treat the cauterization with fine powdered carrageen, honey, and other treatments until he is healed, God willing.
Chapter Forty-eight.
Concerning cauterization for numbness: If a part of the body has been numb and treated with medications, ointments, and dressings, but still has not healed, cauterize the numb part with cauterizations corresponding to the size of the affected bone.  Make your cauterization slightly deeper in the skin's thickness.
Then treat it with ointment until it heals.  Cauterization may also be used for some numbness that occurs in the hand or foot, arising from the spinal vertebrae at the point where the nerve that moves the affected limb emerges; this will alleviate the numbness.
Only those who are knowledgeable in the anatomy of the limbs and the origins of the nerves that move the body should undertake this.
Chapter Forty-nine.
On cauterizing leprosy.
If leprosy persists despite all medical remedies, cauterize it with a moderate depth, corresponding to the thickness of the skin, so that the whiteness disappears and the color changes.
Then treat it with lentil flour, rose ointment,  horsetail leaves, and dove's blood or hawk's blood, one part of each. Mix them all and apply to a cloth, and bind it to the affected area until it heals.
Chapter Fifty.
On cauterizing cancer.
If the cancer is in its early stages and you wish to stop it, cauterize it with a circular cautery around it, as it circles. Some physicians have suggested a severe cauterization in the center, but I do not advise this, as I anticipate ulceration, having witnessed it on several occasions.
So the correct approach is to cauterize around it in a circle, as we have said, or with numerous small cauterizations.
Chapter Fifty-one.
On cauterizing the fistula.
If a fistula has developed and is slow to mature, either due to the agent causing it, the patient's age (if the patient is an elderly person with low blood), or time, and you wish to hasten its maturation, cauterize around it with many small, dotted cauterizations.
Then leave it; this will hasten maturation. If you wish to cover it with a cauterization, heat the cautery that has this form.
Place it in the center of the fistula until it penetrates the skin.  Let the cauterization be positioned downwards so that the pus drains easily. Then treat it as appropriate until it heals.
Chapter Fifty-Two.
On cauterizing ulcers.
Ulcers are a corruption that spreads within the tissue, consuming it like fire consumes dry wood. If you see an ulcer in a location suitable for cauterization with fire, heat numerous small and large cautery irons, according to what is suitable for the location of the ulcer.
Then cauterize it from all sides until all the corruption is eradicated and nothing remains. Then leave it for three days and apply powdered sulfur mixed with oil to the cauterized areas, to remove all the scab and corruption.
Then treat it with healing ointments. If after three days you see that the flesh grows soundly without any corruption, then leave it alone. Otherwise, repeat the cauterization on any remaining corrupted areas. Ulcers can also be treated with strong medicine.
For it serves the purpose of fire, offering quicker benefit.  The treatment of ulcers with strong medicine was mentioned in the division; take it from there when needed.
Chapter Fifty-three.
On cauterizing inverted and non-inverted nails.
This affliction, a rough, painful condition, often occurs on the soles of the feet.  Cauterization is performed in two ways: either by fire or by strong water.
As for cauterization by fire, heat a hollowed-out iron implement, resembling an eagle's beak, the size of the nail's circumference, with thin edges. Then, apply it, hot, to the nail.  Rotate the implement around the nail until it penetrates to the nail's depth.
Leave it for three days to form pus.  Then, apply a poultice of crushed wild barley mixed with salt, and leave it on overnight.  This will remove the nail from its roots.  Then, treat the wound with a wound-healing ointment until it heals; this is for non-inverted nails.
It often occurs on the surface of the body, especially the hands and feet.  Therefore, take a tube of copper, iron, or eagle's beak and apply it to the nail or wart. Then pour a small amount of strong water into the tube.
Hold the tube and gently rotate it with your hand so that the edges of the tube affect the nail's base, and the strong water penetrates to the nail's base.  The patient should endure the stinging of the strong water for a while.
Then leave it, as the nail will detach from its roots. Do this to each one until you have dealt with all of them on the body.  Then treat the areas, after removal, with ointments that promote healing of the flesh.
Chapter Forty-five.
On the treatment of scabies.
If someone has scabies caused by cold in the nerve, or fever, or other conditions, you should cauterize four or five times on the back, between each cauterization on the back, and one on the chest. And cauterize the abdomen with an olive oil cautery, as this will relieve the scabies and hasten the resolution of the cold disease.
Chapter Fifty-five.
On cauterizing a wound occurring on the body.
Ugly boils may arise on the body due to thick, corrupt cold materials.  Upon their first appearance, a gentle cauterization should be applied to the head of each boil with a burning stick, the tip of which has been ignited with fire or with the long root of the zarawand, or with a lentil-shaped cautery.
And boils, in their initial eruption, should be cauterized in this manner.  The active principle will not increase, and the patient will recover, but this must follow bloodletting.
Chapter Fifty-six.
On cauterizing bleeding occurring from a severed artery.
Bleeding frequently occurs from a severed artery in a wound from the outside, or when incising a tumor or cauterizing a limb, or similar situations, and it is difficult to stop.
If this happens to someone, quickly place your index finger over the artery's opening and press firmly until the blood is contained beneath your finger and nothing escapes.  Then, take several small and large olive-oil cauteries and heat them in the fire until extremely hot.
Then, take one, either small or large, depending on the wound and the location where the artery has ruptured, and apply the cauterium to the same vein after quickly removing your finger and holding the cauterium until the bleeding stops.
If the bleeding surges again when you remove your finger from the artery's opening and the cauterium has cooled, quickly take another cauterium from the heated ones and continue doing this one after another until the bleeding stops.
And be cautious not to burn a nerve, lest you cause further injury to the patient.  Know that if an artery is bleeding, it cannot be cut, especially if it is large, except in one of four ways: either by cauterization, as we have said, or by amputation if it has not already been severed. If it is severed, its ends will contract and the bleeding will stop, or it can be tied tightly with threads, or medications that will stop the bleeding and tightly constrict it can be applied.
As for those who attempt to stop the bleeding by tying it with a bandage, or by constricting it with cloth, or applying burning objects and similar methods, the bleeding will not stop thereby except rarely.  If someone in such a situation is not attended to by a physician or does not have medicine, then let them quickly place the index finger over the opening of the wound as we described.
He should press it firmly until the blood is contained and flows out above the wound and on the artery and finger.  The finger should not be removed from the wound with repeatedly applied very cold water until the blood coagulates and thickens and stops flowing.  During this time, consider what cauterization or medication is needed.
The Second Chapter.
Concerning incisions, lancinations, phlebotomy, and other surgical procedures.
In the previous chapter, we discussed every disease in which cauterization with fire and burning medicaments is appropriate, along with its causes, reasons, and tools, and the various types of cauterization procedures, presenting this information as chapters from the head to the foot.
I will follow the same method in this chapter, to make the material easier for the student to grasp.
Before beginning, you must know, my children, that this chapter contains greater uncertainty than the first chapter on cauterization.
Therefore, caution must be greater here, as actions in this chapter often result in excessive blood loss, the lifeblood, when opening a vein or making an incision on a tumor, lancing an abscess, treating a surgical wound, removing an arrow, making an incision on a stone, or similar matters.  All these are accompanied by uncertainty and fear, and death often results.
I advise you to avoid doubtful actions.  Those in this profession will encounter various types of sick people, some of whom are weary of their illness and have little fear of death.
Because of the severity of their illness and the prolonged suffering, some show signs of impending death; others offer you their wealth in the hope of recovery, yet their illness is fatal. You should not treat those whose condition is such.
Let your caution be greater than your desire and eagerness.  Do not undertake any of these actions without certain knowledge of a favorable outcome.  Use knowledge and warnings about the consequences of health or sickness in all treatment of your patients.
This will aid you in acquiring praise, glory, remembrance, and thanks. May God guide you, my children, with wisdom, and deprive you not of truth and success.  Indeed, this is in His power, there is no god but Him.
I have arranged this chapter into sections, as was done in the chapter on cautery, from the crown to the foot, so that you may find what you seek more easily, God willing.
Chapter One.
On the treatment of water that collects in the heads of children.
This ailment often affects infants at birth if the midwife applies pressure to the infant's head without gentleness. It may also arise from a hidden cause that is unknown.
I have not seen this ailment in anyone other than infants. All those I have seen who had it died quickly. Therefore, I have decided to abandon treatment for it. I have observed an infant whose head filled with water, and the head grew larger each day. Until the infant could no longer sit up due to the enlargement of the head, and the moisture increased until death occurred.
This moisture either collects between the skin and bone, or under the bone on the peritoneum. If the moisture is between the skin and bone and the swelling is small, one should make a single horizontal incision in the middle of the head, about two spans long, to allow the moisture to drain.  This is a depiction of the lancet.
If the moisture is greater and the swelling larger, make two intersecting incisions in this manner.
If the moisture is under the bone, and the sign is that you see the sutures of the head open on all sides, and the water recedes when pressed by your hand inwards (this should be clear to you), then three incisions should be made in the middle of the head in this manner.
After the incision, all the moisture will come out. Then, the incisions are closed with bandages and splints.  Afterwards, the wound is treated with poultices, and oil, until the fifth day. Then, the bandage is removed, and the wound is treated with lint and ointments.  The head should not be bound tightly, and the patient should be fed with all dry foods that are low in moisture.
Until the limb strengthens and heals. Another method of incision is to look where the bone of the swelling and the accumulation of water appears, as it may be more prevalent at the back of the head, or the front, or to the right, or to the left.
Thus, with the incision, aim for the location where the swelling and accumulation of water appear.  Make the incision as best you can, and be careful not to cut an artery, causing bleeding, which could lead to the patient's death from such bleeding while also evacuating the moisture.
The Second Chapter.
Severing the two arteries behind the ears, known as the "hissings.
When someone suffers from a severe affliction of the eyes or chest, and the remedies of medicine prove ineffective, then the most effective treatment is the severing of these two arteries.
If you wish to sever them, you should first shave the patient's head with a razor, then rub the area with a rough cloth to reveal the artery.  Then, tighten the patient's neck with the aid of the patient's own clothing.  Then, look for where the pulse beats and the two locations, the two recessed areas behind the ears.  These are rarely hidden, except in some people.
Then, mark them with ink. Then, sever them with a dissecting scalpel, cutting them through to the bone.  This will be across the width of the head.  Or, if you wish, insert the scalpel beneath the artery and cut it upwards.  The length of the cut should be about two clenched fingers.
Then, when the artery is severed, the blood will flow out in a pulsating, forward, continuous stream.  If the artery is not visible to the touch, then you should estimate from the ear by about three fingers' width, mark it with ink, and cut through to the bone.  And what is necessary...
About six ounces of blood will be released immediately, more or less, depending on the strength of the patient and the fullness of their arteries. Then, look at the wound. If any part of the peritoneum remains on the bone, cut it off.
So that a hot swelling does not arise. Then, bind the wound with a linen thread, and treat it with ointments until it heals.
Chapter Three.
Of the arteries in the temples.
If a person suffers from chronic headache or acute attacks caused by sharp humors and heat in the muscles of the temples, or from chronic severe headaches, and similar conditions, and if treatment with various medical remedies has been unsuccessful, we have experimented with severing the arteries of the temples, or cauterizing them, as we have described.
The procedure for severing them is to shave the patient's hair on the temples, and to locate the superficial artery in the temple.  It can be identified by its pulse, and it rarely goes unseen, except perhaps in exceptional cases.
Or, if the artery is hidden by intense cold, the patient should tighten his neck with his garment, then you should rub the area with a cloth, or apply warm water until the artery becomes clearly visible. Then take the lancet, which has this image. Then, gently dissect the skin with the lancet until you reach the artery.  Then insert a hook into it and pull it upward to bring it out from the skin and free it from the membranes beneath, on all sides. If the artery is thin, twist it with the hook's end. Then cut off a portion so that its ends are separated and constricted, and no bleeding occurs.  If it is not severed and cut, the blood will not be separated at all.  Then drain between six and three ounces of blood.
If the artery is large, it should be tied in two places with a strong doubled thread, whether of silk or of bowstrings, so that putrefaction does not quickly reach it before the wound heals, causing bleeding.
Then cut the excess between the ligatures, do this either at that moment or after some time.  If you wish, cauterize the area down to the bone with a small, knife-like cauterizing iron until the ends are severed, and this will do the same work, or even better, as we said.
However, if the patient has a fever or is of a hot temperament, cauterization will aid in eliminating the humidity, making it more beneficial.  After dissecting the arteries, the area should be packed with old cotton and covered with firm bandages.  After the dressing is removed, treat with dry wound healing medicines and compresses until healed, God willing.
If, during your work, bleeding from the artery occurs, immediately cut it off, either by cauterization or by filling the area with alum and pressing firmly until the blood stops. If nothing of that is available, use your finger to stop the blood.
Apply very cold water to the area to reduce the inflammation and tighten it as appropriate.  A simpler and easier method than dissecting the artery is to cauterize the blood vessel with this double-bladed cauterizing iron after marking the two locations with ink.
Apply the cauterization very intensely until it reaches the bone and severs the blood vessel in two places, so that the distance between the ends is increased.  It will not heal with this type of cauterization.  This is an illustration of the cautery instrument.
The instrument has two sharp blades, similar to small knives, but much less sharp than a knife. If they were as sharp as a knife, the cold would reach them quickly, and the flesh would not sever quickly.  Therefore, if they have some thickness, the heat of the fire will be retained.
It quickly cuts through the flesh.  This method is the best, easiest, and simplest, with the distance between the blades being about the thickness of a finger.
Chapter Four.
For the treatment of persistent, hot, watery discharge from the eyes.
If the discharge is persistent, coming from the veins on the skull's exterior, and no medicinal treatment is effective, and you see the patient's face has become red. And if he feels a crawling sensation in his forehead like ants crawling, and his eyes are sunken and moist, their edges eroded, and their eyelids glued together from the intensity of the tears, the earliest treatments resorted to this method, calling it "treatment with the sword."  It involves ordering the patient to shave the hair from his forehead.
Then three parallel incisions are made on the forehead, each about two fingers long, aligned with the length of the nose in the center of the forehead, the second slightly distant from the movement of the muscles in the temple, and the third on the opposite side.
And be careful not to cut the arteries on the sides, and keep your hand away from touching the jaws.  After each incision, allow a space of three fingers closed together.  Have ready sponges or many dry cloths to absorb the blood.
Then insert the sharp-ended scalpel, which is of this form. From the incision next to the temple to the middle incision, use it to peel away all the skin between the incisions, along with the periosteum on the bone.  Then do the same from the middle incision to the third incision.  Then remove this scalpel. And insert into the first incision another instrument, called a scalpel, sharp on one side and smooth and blunt on the other. This is its image.
Turn its sharp side towards the flesh attached to the skin, and its smooth side towards the bone.  Push it until it reaches the middle incision, and cut all the vessels that descend from the head to the eyes, without reaching the surface of the skin.
Then do this from the middle incision to the other incision.  After a moderate amount of blood has flowed, compress the areas of solidified blood. Then, in each incision, place a cotton wick, and put on it a compress soaked in a mixture of medicated liquid and oil, or vinegar and oil.
So that a hot swelling does not occur. On the third day, dissolve the ligaments.  Use abundant tepid water compresses, then treat with basil ointment mixed with rose oil and other remedies for wounds until healed, God willing.
Chapter Five.
On treating tears and discharge from the eyes from within the head.
When someone has a severe, persistent, and copious discharge, and the eyes are sunken and small, and their sight is weakened, and the eyelids are ulcerated, and the eyelashes are falling out. And there is intense, painful pain deep within the head, and repeated sneezing.  Know, from these symptoms, that these materials and discharges come from numerous deep veins. The best treatment is this: order the afflicted to shave their forehead, then make a single incision in the middle of the forehead.
And there is intense, painful pain deep within the head, and repeated sneezing.  Know, from these symptoms, that these materials and discharges come from numerous deep veins. The best treatment is this: order the afflicted to shave their forehead, then make a single incision in the middle of the forehead. Or raise it slightly transversely, beginning the incision from the left temple to the right temple.  The incision should be to the bone, and keep your hand away from the mobile masseter muscles when chewing.  Until the bone is exposed and all blood is wiped away with a sponge.
Separate the edges of the incision with used cotton or flax thread. Then, tie it together from above with bandages, and soak the bandages with medication and oil to prevent a hot swelling.  Once you have resolved it, and see that the hot swelling has subsided, you should rub the bone until flesh begins to grow there.
Then treat it with a desiccated preparation that promotes flesh growth, such as taking two parts wheat flour and four parts of calphonium, preparing a salve from them, and using it for flesh growth in wounds of this type.
Chapter Six.
For treating what falls into the ear.
Everything that falls into the ear is one of four types: either a metallic or semi-metallic stone, like iron or glass; or a vegetable seed, such as chickpeas, nuts, and similar things; or a liquid, like water and vinegar, and similar substances.
Or, if an animal, such as a pebble or a similar small stone, falls into the ear and does not grow in the ear, face the ear towards the sun.  If you see the stone, drop a little violet or cerucean oil into it, then try to remove it by moving the head or inducing a sneeze with a censer. And close the nostrils when the sneeze comes, after placing a bandage of cloth or wool around the ear and stretching the ear upwards.  Often, this treatment will remove it.  If it does not, try removing it with gentle cotton wool, of which this is a picture.
If it comes out with the cotton wool, otherwise try to remove it with a gentle, slightly curved, blunt hook. If it doesn't come out with that, then make a copper tube and insert the end of the tube into the ear canal.
Seal the area around the tube with softened pitch mixed with oil, so that the air has no route other than through the tube, then pull it out with a strong pull.  It often comes out this way.  If it doesn't come out by the methods described, then take a small amount of Nabataean gum or prepared gum with which birds are caught and place it on the end of the rod.
After wrapping it tightly with cotton, gently insert it into the ear canal after the ear is dry. If it doesn't come out with all the methods described, then proceed to incision before the hot swelling or hardening occurs.
The method of incision is to first bleed the patient from the temples or forehead, to the extent of their strength.  Then, place the patient before you, turn their ear upward, and make a small incision at the base of the ear, near the cartilage, at its lowest point.
The incision should be crescent-shaped until you reach the stone, then remove it with whatever instruments you can. Then quickly stitch the incision and treat it until it heals.
If the object lodged in the ear is one of the grains that grow and swell, attempt to remove it with the methods described. If that doesn't work, then take a thin, delicate lancet of this form.
Try to cut that type of fallen grain in the ear with it, but only do so if you are certain that the grain has moistened with earwax to make it into many small pieces, then remove them with a blunt hook, a soft cloth, or by suction.
As mentioned, it is easier to remove it.  As for water that has entered the ear, the patient should first use a bellows-like device for sneezing, and have filled their ear with some worn cotton while lying on their affected ear.  If it comes out that way.
Otherwise, take several small, smooth stones, warm them slightly by fire, and have the patient insert one into the ear hole.  The patient should then stand on one leg, on the same side as the affected ear, and strike another stone against the stone in the ear.
He should continue doing this with stone after stone until all the water is removed.  Water might also be removed by taking a piece of papyrus or feather, inserting one end into the ear, and heating the other end in a fire until most of it burns; then, a different piece of feather is used.
Repeat this process until all the water is removed, or use the tube as described for the stone removal.  Regarding removing an animal that has entered the ear, if it is small, such as a flea or similar, treat it as described in the classification.  As for...
If its body is large enough to be felt, try removing it with lint and forceps.  This is easier than anything that can occur in the ear.  As for removing worms that have developed in the ear, if you have treated it according to what we have mentioned in the chapter on the various types of infection but your treatment was not effective.
Then you should look into the ear in the sunlight. If you see any worms, remove them with lint or fine forceps. If you don't see anything, take a tube—this is its shape.
The tube is narrow at the bottom and wide at the top. Insert the thin end into the ear as far as the patient can tolerate, then suck strongly with it. Repeat this several times until all the worms are expelled. If that doesn't work, seal around the tube with wax, as I have described for removing stones.
If it is not removed with the methods mentioned, use the catheters I have described.  The ancients tested these for killing worms, and you will find this in the chapter on catheters.  You would apply ointments and medications to the ear with this instrument.  Here is its image.
As you see, you make it from silver or copper. Narrow at the bottom, with a small hole, and wide at the top.  If you prefer, the projectile within the tube can be made of strong copper.  Or, you may take a cord and tightly wrap cotton around its end.
Then place the ointment, or juice, or whatever medicine you want, into the tube while it is in the ear.  Then, insert the cord with cotton on top and gently squeeze with your hand until the ointment flows into the ear and produces a sensation.
Have the patient remain inside while applying it, and make sure the substance instilled into the ear has been slightly warmed in fire.  Be careful not to use something that is extremely cold or extremely hot, as the ear cannot tolerate that.
Chapter Seven.
Concerning the treatment of ear obstructions.
Some children may be born with their ear canals unperforated.
Some people may also experience an obstruction in the ear canal due to a wound or overgrown tissue. This obstruction may occur deep within the ear canal, and be invisible.
Sometimes it may present slightly outside the canal, and be visible.  Obstructions deep within the ear, not visible, are often difficult to cure.  Those visible should be placed in the sun. If the obstruction is visible, then open it with a gentle scalpel; this is its image/form.
Its tip should have a slightly limited protrusion, and the rest of the scalpel should be smooth on both sides so as not to injure the ear. If the obstruction is due to tissue growth within the ear canal, grasp it with a gentle forceps and cut it away with great care until all tissue is removed.
If the obstruction is deep within the ear, take a smooth, slender probe, warm it slightly in the fire, then insert it into the ear canal.  If you feel the obstruction, along with the patient's difficulty hearing, then remove it gently.
Care should be taken not to injure the ear drum.  Then, place a wick into the ear, sized to fit the canal, smeared with Egyptian ointment.  Do this for several days until the wound is healed.  Or, take a wick, soak it in water, and sprinkle powdered zaga on it.
Use this.  If you see that the ear has swollen with a hot tumor, then remove the wick and replace it with another one smeared with ointment made from rose oil, in order to reduce the hot swelling. Then treat it until it heals.
If bleeding occurs, dip a sponge or cloth in cold water and apply it to the ear. Use the other treatments for stopping bleeding mentioned in the chapter on cauterization.
Chapter Eight.
On treating warts that appear on the eyelids.
These warts that appear on the eyelids may be moist or dry.  They should be grasped with a forceps or needle and cut away from their roots with a scalpel. Then, powdered alum should be applied to the area.
If bleeding occurs, cauterize it with a gentle, lentil-shaped cautery iron.  Cauterization is preferable after cutting.  It often returns if any part of the root remains.  If cauterized with fire, those roots are burned and do not return.
Chapter Nine.
On treating cold affecting the eyelids.
A condition resembling severe cold often appears on the eyelids.
Therefore, it is called cold, being the accumulation of thick moisture in the upper and lower eyelids.  If the cold is prominent on the surface of the eyelid, moving in every direction, then it is easy to treat.  Cut it across.
Then carefully scrape it from every side until it comes off.  Then hang it by a hook and cut it.  If cutting it does not become possible until the eyelid is pierced by the cut, this will not harm the patient. If the cut is large, sew it up and treat it until it heals.
And if it is small, there is no problem.  The ointment will heal and join it. If the cold is sloping towards the inner surface of the eyelid, turn the eyelid inside out, hang the cold by a hook without needing a cut, and trim it from every side.
If the eyelid is pierced by the cut, this will not harm anything. Then wash the eye with salt water after cutting the cold and treat the area with something that heals it until the patient is well.
Chapter Ten.
On treating the chalazion that appears in the eyelid.
A chalazion is a swelling that forms in the layers of the upper eyelid.  It occurs most often in children.  It weighs down their eyes and causes them to have colds in the early morning hours, and they cannot look at sunlight. Because tears rush to them.
Therefore, you see them always leaning on their faces, and they sleep on them. Their eyelids beneath the eyebrows are moist, possibly swollen.  The chalazion is clearly visible.  If you press the area with your fingers, you feel the chalazion between them.  The method of treatment is for the patient to place their head in your lap.
Then take a linen cloth, prepare a wick from it, and make a circle from that wick to encompass the chalazion on all sides.  Then place it on top and press with your fingers on all sides to gather the chalazion into the center of the circle.
Then, with the lancet, cut through the center of that moisture with a transverse cut.  The cut should not be larger than that made in a venesection.  As for depth, you should cut through the entire skin until you reach the chalazion.
In most cases, the chalazion will protrude from the cut as a white piece of fat.  Pull it out with a cloth wrapped around your fingers, moving your hand back and forth until it heals.  Be careful not to enlarge the cut, lest the lancet injure the eye.
If the chalazion does not appear in the initial cut, you should gently enlarge the cut a little more until the chalazion emerges.  Then pull it out as we said.  Then, dip a cloth in vinegar and water, place it on the area, and bind it firmly.  Some people crush salt.
And place it in the opening of the cut to dissolve any remaining moisture.  Then treat it until it heals. If a hot swelling occurs at the site, treat it with cooling compresses until it heals.
Chapter Eleven.
On the types of eye dressings.
If extra eyelashes grow on the eyelid, outside the natural course, under the normal lashes and thicken, they harm the eye and cause various illnesses, such as constant tearing, eyelid relaxation, white spots, and thickening, until this becomes a cause of eye impairment.
And eye dressing has four aspects: either by cauterization with fire, or by a sharp medicine as previously mentioned in the chapter on cauterization, or the dressing may be by cutting and stitching, or by using a reed, as I will describe.
You should place the patient's head in your lap, then turn the eyelid with your left hand. If it turns, then insert a needle with thread from underneath the eyelid, and pass the needle and thread from above, close to the eyelash itself, and pull the thread upward through the eyelid.
Then turn it with a spatula, and cut the excess hair from the inner eyelid with a lancet from the larger to the smaller incision, then pull the thread, and place a small pad of cotton or cloth under the eyelid, and then secure the eyelid with medication.
Like the shape of a rue leaf, but the shape should be according to the amount of elevation needed for the eyelid, as this may differ among people. Some may require a specific amount of eyelid excision in proportion to the eyelid's relaxation.
Some require a smaller incision.  All this is according to the relaxation of the eyelid.  Then, with the lancet, make incisions along the lines you marked, starting from the larger incision to the smaller, and make each incision near the natural lashes, about the thickness of a spatula.
Then, insert the hook into one corner of the skin, then peel the entire skin off.  Then sew the two edges together with a fine wool needle and thread, wiping away the blood.  Stick any remaining threads to the eyebrows with something adhesive.
You may do this, or you may not bother.  The stitches and threads remain for about three or four days, then treat it.  If you prefer, leave the wound unstitched and treat it with something that dries and contracts, for the eyelid will elevate when the wound closes and comes together. Stitching is better.
This method of incision, the ancients described it, but it requires effort for the patient. It is a good procedure, without danger. Another method of incision exists, also, in which you shape the eyelid like a rue leaf, as we described. Then raise the eyelid with three hooks, separated or grouped in this manner:
Then cut off any excess eyelid with a small scissors in this manner, cutting evenly.
If you are unable to hold the hooks in place, or if the procedure is not successful, take a needle with thread and insert it into the center of the shape. Insert another thread near the larger incision and a third near the smaller incision.  Hold the threads evenly with your fingers, then raise your hand steadily.
Raise the marked skin entirely as we described, then close the wound edges with stitches and treat it until it heals.  If a hot swelling appears after the incision or cut, reduce the swelling with a poultice or similar soothing ointment.
The lower eyelid may also have its edges turn inwards, so it is necessary to use the cutting, stitching, and cauterization methods we mentioned.  Cauterization with fire or sharp medicine is better and gentler on the patient than cutting and stitching. Cutting and stitching are more complex in these cases.
Cauterization with a reed is done in this manner: turn the eyelid over, make an incision on the inside as described, then make two thin reeds or pieces of wood the length of the eyelid, and less than the width of a scalpel.
Nibble the ends of each reed on both sides where the threads adhere, then gently bring them together over the remaining part of the eyelid.  Tightly fasten the reeds from both sides, and leave it for several days.  The tightened skin will die, turn black, and decay.
Until it falls off on its own.  If it takes too long, trim it with scissors, then treat it until healed.  Once it is joined, the eyelid will rise and the lashes will no longer irritate the eye.  This is the shape and size of the two reeds, the length and width should be precisely as shown.
Chapter Twelve.
For removing irritating hairs from the eye with a needle.
If it is one or two hairs, the procedure is to take a thin needle, thread it with a smooth, fine silk thread, tie the ends with a very gentle knot, and make the thread about a span long.
Then, thread another thin, shorter thread onto the tweezers.  Tie its ends if you wish.  The patient should place their head on your lap, close to a light source to clearly see the work, as it is a delicate procedure.  Then, using the needle on the tweezers, insert it into the root of the extra hair.
And gently pierce the eyelid, until it emerges from above the natural hair. Then pull the thread upward through the tweezers, and extract the hair(s) - one, two, or three at most - into the tweezers.
Then, pull with your hand until the hair comes out of the eyelid with the tweezers, along with the natural hair.  If pulling the tweezers doesn't remove the hair, pull the tweezers downward using the thread you'd previously attached, until the tweezers exit the upper opening.
Then, return the hair to the tweezers and pull them out. Repeat this until the hair is elevated in the upper opening and clearly visible.  At that point, remove the tweezers and thread, close the eye, and keep it closed for two or three days, until the hair is firmly in place and the flesh has grown over it.
If the hair is short, either add a longer strand of natural hair to elevate it with it, or allow it to grow longer and then lift it.
Chapter Thirteen.
On treating the stye that occurs in the upper eyelid of the eye.
This stye, which is called "arnybiyyah," can be either natural or accidental.  An accidental stye results from an inflammation of a wound, a cut, a burn, or similar conditions.
The procedure involves cutting the inflammation, separating its edges, inserting a linen thread between them, and tying it until it heals.  Things that dry and constrict should not be used in its treatment.
If you do that, the stye will return even worse. Instead, use softening substances like fenugreek, licorice root steeped in rose water, flaxseed, and a diacodion ointment mixed with some unguents. Apply this mixture to the thread and treat it with this.
The key to treating it is to avoid any re-adhesion in its original form.  This method, as described, is merely a part of correcting the stye, not a complete restoration to its original state.
Chapter Fourteen.
On treating styes in the lower eyelid.
This stye, which forms from below, is the true stye, and is either natural or accidental.  The accidental stye results from a wound, cut, burn, or similar causes.
The method involves taking a needle with a doubled thread, inserting it into the flesh, and passing it from the inner to the outer eyelid until the thread is on both sides of the flesh. Then, pulling the flesh upwards with the needle, cut it with a broad scalpel.
If the eyelid returns to its proper shape, well and good.  Otherwise, take a spatula and place it over the cut.  Turn the eyelid over and make two incisions in the inner side of the eyelid, the edges of these incisions meeting at the angle of the previous cut, forming an angle. So that when joined, the shape will resemble this shape.
Then, remove the flesh to the extent that the sharp side of it is below the eyelid.  Then, rejoin the separated parts with two stitches, sewing with a wool thread.  Then, treat it with the relaxing and tightening remedies that we mentioned, until it heals.
If the ulceration occurred from a cut, suture, or cauterization, a simple incision should be made, also without touching the eyelashes, as previously mentioned. Then, the lips should be separated with a tightening method, as described.
In short, for treating an ulceration, whether it is on top or bottom, conduct the treatment based on the appearance of the ulceration.  For it can vary greatly in its presentation, and the surgeon must devise a method by any means possible.
Until the shape returns to, or approximates, its natural state. The condition itself will indicate the appropriate action and tools in most cases.
Chapter Fifteen.
Concerning the adhesion of the eyelid to the conjunctiva or cornea.
This adhesion may affect many people, causing the upper eyelid to adhere to the white of the eye, hindering its free movement and its natural functions.  A blunt instrument should be inserted underneath the eyelid.
Then lift it upwards or stretch it with a hook, and sever the adhesion with a gentle scalpel, one not as sharp as surgical blades, but rather somewhat dull, so as not to cause distress to the patient during the procedure, lest the scalpel slip and injure the eye with its sharpness. Your incision should be like peeling away the adhesion.
And wait until the eyelid returns to its normal position and the entire adhesion heals. Then, instill saline solution into the eye, or apply a solution of zinjari (a type of mineral substance) diluted in water, using a dropper, and separate the eyelid from the eye with a linen thread.
Place wet cotton wool soaked in egg white over the eye. After three days, use poultices until healed.
Chapter Sixteen.
In cutting the nail and deep fleshy growths.
The nail is of two types: either nervous, resembling a tough, thin membrane, or non-nervous, resembling a solid, white moisture. If touched by iron or attempted to be grasped with a hook, it breaks.
A hook does not stick to either type.  Both types begin in the largest part of the eye, gradually spreading until they cover the pupil and obstruct the light and movement of the eye.  The procedure for cutting them is for the patient to place their head on a stone.
Then, the patient opens their eyes and you raise the eyelid with your hand.  Then, you grasp the nail with a slightly bent hook and pull it upwards.  Then, take a needle, thread it with a horsehair or cowhair and a strong thread, bend the needle tip slightly, and insert it into the center of the nail.
Pierce it with the needle, tie the nail with the thread, pull it upwards, and peel away with the hair the side of the nail adjacent to the pupil, as if spreading it with the hair to its end. Then, cut the remaining portion at the root of the eye with a gentle scalpel or small scissors, and leave the natural tissue of the eye.
So that a continuous flow of tears does not result from cutting it.  The nail can be pulled with the hook alone or with the thread, as we said, then the smooth scalpel is used to peel the end, which is pictured as follows:
Be careful that the scalpel does not touch the cornea, causing a rupture in the pupil.  After the cutting, place some powdered salt or powdered green vitriol into the eye, and leave it until the next day, then treat it as necessary until healed.
If the nail is not sensitive and you cannot insert a needle or secure a hook, this type of nail is often treated with medications, healing as described in the classification. If you wish to cut it, open the patient's eye.
Take a gentle, smooth, blunt scalpel, like this picture. Peel the nail gently from above with the scalpel. If you see that it is crumbling and only the peel is affected, put a drop of powdered green vitriol or red vitriol or powdered salt into the eye, and compress the eye until the next day.
Then, repeat the procedure until all of it is gone, unless a hot abscess appears in the eye.  Leave it alone and treat the hot abscess until it is healed, then resume peeling until healed.  And as for a fleshy outgrowth...
If the outgrowth is causing a severe injury to the eye, attach the outgrowth to the hook and cut a portion of it off, but do not cut excessively lest it cause tear leakage.  Then, apply red or green vitriol to the depths until healed.
Chapter Seventeen.
On the excision of the hordeolum and any excess flesh that grows in the eye.
In some people's eyes, red, accumulated flesh may grow until it covers the pupil or nearly covers or spills over the eyelids, and sometimes the eyelids turn outward, resembling a rose.
The treatment involves placing the patient's head in your lap, then opening their eyes, and using appropriate hooks to remove all of the red flesh.
Or hold it with a scalpel or forceps, and then cut the flesh, piece by piece, until it is all removed.  Protect the eye from injury during the procedure.  Use either the scalpel described earlier for excising the toenail, or a small pair of scissors, for the excision. Like the method used to pick out splinters, as will be shown in the following chapter.
If the excision is complete and all the fleshy growth is gone, then fill the eye with powdered salt or drop in red or similar corrosive remedies. Apply a bandage of egg white to the outside of the eye to prevent inflammation.
If any fleshy growth remains, and bleeding is excessive, and you fear inflammation, leave the eye and treat it with something to reduce inflammation. Then return to the procedure until healed.  Do the same for any excess flesh that appears in the eye of this type.
However, you should avoid treating any weak eye through natural means or by surgical intervention with iron, and do not insert your hand into any of these procedures until you see that the organ is capable of withstanding the procedure.
Chapter Eighteen.
On the extraction of foreign objects from the eye.
Foreign bodies are red veins that weave over the eye, preventing sight and weakening the eye over time.  First, you should examine it. If the eye with the foreign bodies is strong, and has no other ailment besides the foreign bodies...
Then, the extraction is to instruct the patient to place their head on your lap, and to grasp those veins with a single hook, or two, depending on your skill.  The hooks should be subtly curved in this manner:.
or they can be two hooks joined together in a single instrument, like this:.
Then, gently extract the veins with a fine pair of scissors, wiping away the blood occasionally until you see the eye is free from the veins and the blood has drained.  Protect the eye; do not injure it with the scissors' edges.  Work in the middle of the day, in the sunlight.
Be very precise in your work to avoid cutting anything other than the veins.  Upon finishing, instill green or red antimony into the eye, to consume the remaining foreign bodies.  If you cannot remove all the foreign bodies at that time, then bandage the eye to relieve its pain.
Leave it for several days until the pain subsides and the inflammation abates.  Then, repeat the procedure in exactly the same way, until it is healed.  This is a depiction of the scissors used for this procedure.
Leave it [and let the patient's head rest on the student's lap, while another dries the tears and examines the front and back of the eye]. The proper procedure is to open the eye with fixed or triangular openings, held by a student.
Concentrate; the patient's head should rest on the student's lap, and another should wipe away tears and examine the front and back of the eye.  You have the choice of beginning the extraction from the upper or lower part of the eye.  It is preferable to dry two thread-like structures (sonar) in the upper part, one at the end of the crown and the other at its beginning.
Hold it [the eye] between the index and middle fingers.  Then hang the threads from underneath them.  Then hold it between the ring and pinky fingers, and gently remove your hand so that you see all the foreign bodies have risen.  Cut them from the smaller side, either with scissors or a delicate scalpel, if you wish.
Insert a needle, and carefully remove all the foreign matter until it rises to the surface.  Do not cut the drying threads, as tears and blood will flow profusely onto you.
Then cut with scissors what remains of the threads, both above and below the crown, so that nothing remains protruding except within the cornea. If possible, lift it from the cornea with a needle; that is better, and may prove suitable for some people.
If you cut it, the area will be painful for a few days.  The pain will subside and the inflamed swelling will be avoided, and then the procedure can be repeated.
Chapter Nineteen.
Regarding returning the rib to the nose.
Doctors call the rib a "nasus," if, after treating it with cauterization or a harsh, burning medication as previously described, it does not heal, then the only recourse is to incise the tumor when it is ripe and remove all the moisture or pus within it.
Until the bone is exposed. If the bone is exposed and you see damage or blackness in it, scrape it with an instrument, this is its form:.
And the instrument is called the "khashna al-ras," made of Indian iron, and its head is round like a seed. It is engraved, like a file or a scraper, with a fine engraving. You place it on the damaged area of the bone, then rotate it between your fingers while slightly squeezing your hand until you know that the damage has been removed.
And you do this repeatedly, then bandage the area with drying, astringent medications. If the area is sealed, flesh grows in it, the discharge ceases, and forty days pass without recurrence, or pus formation, or any incident.
Know then that it is healed, otherwise there is no remedy except to return the nasus to the nasal opening in this manner: expose the bone again with iron or a caustic medication.  Once the bone is exposed, take a probe of this shape:
The end of the iron instrument should be triangular, and its shaft tapered towards the tip, as you see. Then place it on the bone itself, close to the nostril, and move your hand slightly away from the eye.  Then, rotate your hand with the probe until it penetrates the bone and the patient feels it.
By finding that air comes out from it when he holds his hand over his nose.  At that point, bandage the area with astringent, drying medications, as I have taught you.  If the flesh grows and the area hardens, the matter that was protruding outward will return to the nose, making it easier on the patient, God willing.
Chapter Twenty.
In returning the protruded eye.
If the entire eye has protruded, and there is no damage or loss of vision, then ease the patient, then place it (the eye) in a sling. Then place a cupping glass on the back of the neck without restrictions, and apply gentle suction.
Then apply a poultice made of acacia, aloe, frankincense, and spikenard to the eye.  Then gently tie the eye over the bandage with numerous bandages. The recipe for the bandages is to take many soft strips of cloth, fold each strip into four layers, and use many of these.
Then place them one on top of the other as much as the eye needs, then tie them tightly with a firm cloth. Replace the cupping glass with suction, without restrictions, then remove the cupping glass and leave the eye tied for a day and night.
If the ligament relaxes during this time, it should be tightened again.  Then remove the bandage after one day and one night, as we said.  If you see the eye has returned, then stop. Otherwise, repeat the bandage, poultices, tightening, and cupping until it returns.
Chapter Twenty-one.
On the excision of the conjunctiva.
If a rupture occurs in the conjunctiva, then protrudes and emerges outside the eyelids, resembling the conjunctiva and spoiling the person's appearance, and you wish to excise it, then the procedure is as I describe.
To do this, insert a needle into the base of the conjunctiva from below upwards, then insert another needle with a doubled thread from the opposite side and pierce through it, leaving the first needle as it is.
Then, cut the doubled thread at the point of its bend, tie a portion of the conjunctiva around the needle with it, tightening it firmly.  Then, remove the needle and apply soaked wool dipped in egg white to the eye, leaving it until the threads and conjunctiva fall out.  Then, treat the eye with something that strengthens it.
Until the wound heals, the conjunctiva may be tightened from all sides with a circular piece of cloth, so that the eye protrudes more forcefully. Then, with a thin scalpel, reach the depth of the eye so that the whitish moisture flows out and the eye descends and withers in place, then tighten it until it heals.
Chapter Twenty-Two.
On the treatment of abscesses.
This affliction, called an abscess, is a swelling that collects in the eye, resembling descending water but without its properties.  The method of treatment involves having the patient sit upright on a chair, then taking their head in both hands.
and move it until you see the swelling descend with your eyes, and then hold it still so it does not move, and the light will be released and the patient will see things as they used to.  If it does not descend, we know it is water. If the swelling does not descend with the method we described,
Otherwise, have the patient sit before you, then take a slender scalpel and make an incision just above the cornea where the inflamed area meets the cornea at the limbus, until the material is discharged.
Then, after the discharge, instill warm water into the eye, mixed with honey, or water in which you have boiled licorice root and honey. Then treat with the rest of the treatment until healed.
Chapter Twenty-Three.
We have already discussed the types of water in the classification, and which are suitable for instillation, with detailed explanations.  Take these from there for accuracy.  Then, the patient should sit before you, crouched, facing the light near the sun.
Tie and firmly hold the healthy eye, then raise the eyelid with your left hand if it is the left eye that has the water, or with your right hand if it is the right eye.
Then, place the tip of the cupping instrument near the limbus, with the thickness of a date pit, in the same white part of the eye, near the smaller eyelid corner.  Then, push the cupping instrument firmly, while rotating it with your hand, until it penetrates the white of the eye and you feel the cupping instrument has reached an empty space.
The cupping instrument should penetrate to a depth equal to the distance from the child to the edge of the iris (the limbus). The copper can be seen by the person looking, in the same way the eye sees, because of the clarity of the cornea. Then, move the cupping instrument upward to the location where the water is.
Then press it downward repeatedly. If the water comes out at once, the patient will see what has been opened to his sight immediately; the cupping instrument will be in his eye. Then he rests for a while. If the water rises, lower it again without removing the cupping instrument.
If it settles and does not rise, remove the cupping instrument gently, twisting your hand slightly. Then dissolve some clear, fine salt in the water, and wash the inside of the eye with it. Then place a moistened cloth or wool over the entire outer eye.
With rose ointment and egg white, bind the healthy eye.  As for us and the people of our time, we place crushed cumin with egg white on it.  If the cupping instrument will not enter the eye due to its hardness, because some people have very hard eyes. One should take the scalpel called the *bayrid*, which is of this form:
Pierce only the adhered tissue with it, do not make the hole deep.  Rather, make a gentle opening for the cupping instrument, then insert the cupping instrument as described above. When your work is complete, prepare a secure bed for the patient, in a dark room, with the patient lying on their back.
He must avoid all movement and coughing.  His food should be easy to digest. He must not move his head right or left at all. The bandage should remain in place for three days.  Then, in that dark room, remove the bandage and test his eyesight.
Show him objects, then replace the bandage for seven days.  You should not do this during the treatment period or after cupping.  Rather, you should avoid it before the water rises quickly with excessive staring.
If a hot swelling appears, then you should remove the bandage before the seventh day and treat the swelling with what will calm it. Once it has calmed, then release his sight. Place a veil over his face to train his eyesight from beneath it for several days while he is in that dark room.  Then...
He is gradually released from the room and allowed to move about. Know that a learner cannot dispense with observing cupping multiple times before undertaking the procedure.  I have heard from some Iraqis that they make a suction cupping instrument in Iraq that draws out water.
I have not seen anyone in our country do this, nor have I read of it in any of the earlier books. It may be a recent invention.  Here is a depiction of the various types of cupping instruments, to illustrate the different possibilities.
They are made of copper, specifically, and their tip is precisely this shape; triangular and sharp-pointed.
Chapter Twenty-four.
In the treatment of flesh growing in the nose.
Various superfluous growths may sprout in the nose, some resembling scorpions with many legs, others cancerous, hard, and dark-colored, and others soft and not dark-colored.
For those growths that are soft, not malignant or cancerous, the patient should sit facing the sun, their nostril opened, and the snare applied to the flesh.  Then it should be drawn out, and what is caught should be cut away with a gentle, sharp scalpel, on one side only.
To ensure that all the flesh is gone, if any remains uncut, remove the remainder gently with a suitable instrument, so that nothing remains; otherwise, bleeding or a hot swelling may ensue.
If it is a malignant tumor, then cauterize it until the bleeding stops and all the flesh disappears.  Then, after cutting, apply vinegar and water or other drink to the nose, so that the nose opens and moisture drains into the throat.
Know then that it has healed, but if the moisture does not drain properly, know that there is growing flesh inside the porous bones, which the cutting instrument did not reach.  In this case, a thick linen thread should be taken.
Tie many knots in it, making the space between each knot the width of a finger or less.  The patient should use a smooth instrument or something similar to a button to insert one end of the thread into their nose and then pull it along until it reaches the turbinate bone.
It will emerge at the throat.  Children often do this in schools.  It is easy for anyone who desires it.  Then, pull together the two ends of the thread, the one that has come out of the mouth and the other that remains in the nose.
Then use the knots in the thread to separate the flesh, continuing until you know the flesh has been separated by the thread's knots.  Then remove the thread.  After cleaning the blood from the nose, insert a thread soaked in Egyptian ointment into the nose. Do this for three days or more.
Until the ointment has consumed all remaining flesh.  Finally, a lead tube is placed in the nose for a period of days until healed.  If further drying treatment is needed, use that method.
This is a picture of the instrument used to instill ointments and medicines into the nose.
A small, open-topped, ointment-containing vessel, made of silver or brass, similar to a small lamp, is used.  Its passageway is also of this nature.
If desired, the tube can be made closed, like a cane, and the ointment applicator's surface flat.
It has a handle at its end, as you see, to hold when heating the ointment or any other liquid substance within it.
Chapter Twenty-five.
On warts growing on the tip of the nose.
Warts often grow on the tip of the nose, increasing in size and number over time until they disfigure the appearance.
Therefore, it is necessary to cut it off at its first appearance and remove it completely, then apply either cauterization or a burning medicine that serves as a cauterization. If cutting it off was delayed until it grew large, then examine it; if it is hard, dense, dark-colored, and insensitive,
do not use iron on it, for it is a cancerous tumor; I have often seen that cutting this tumor resulted in great suffering for the patient. If the tumor feels soft, is not dark-colored, and you see that it can be entirely cut out, drain the affected area and cut it out without hesitation or delay, and treat the area with what dries and contracts until healed.
Chapter Twenty-six.
On the suturing of the nose, lip, and ear. If its connection is separated by a wound or the like, know that when a separation of connection occurs in one of these cartilages, rarely does treatment succeed except in some people.
Therefore, when one of these things occurs, examine if the wound is fresh with blood. If so, bring together the edges of the wound with sutures and treat it until it heals. If the separation of connection has separated its edges and each gap is sound, then one must remove each gap's visible skin thickness until it bleeds.
Then, bring together the edges with sutures, tighten them, and dust them with powdered gypsum and frankincense. Place a plaster of palm ointment, or another suitable ointment, on top of the dusting, and leave it tightened for two or three days, then remove it.
Then change the medication and leave it until the threads break by themselves, then treat it with ointment until it heals.  The method of suturing is to bring together the separated connection, either with needles as described in abdominal suturing, or with thread, as previously explained.
Chapter Twenty-Seven.
On removing the knots that appear on the edges.
Many people develop small, hard tumors inside their lips, some resembling carbuncles, others smaller or larger.  One should turn back the lip and cut open each knot, and remove it with tweezers.
Cut it from all sides, then fill the wound with powdered alum until the bleeding stops.  Then rinse with vinegar and salt, and treat the affected areas with something astringent until the wounds heal.
Chapter Twenty-Eight.
In cutting excess flesh on the gums.
Excess flesh often grows on the gums, which the ancients called *apulus*.  It should be grasped with tweezers or a pick, cut at its root, and allowed to bleed.  Then, powdered alum should be placed on the area.
Or one of the astringent, dried substances. If the flesh returns after treatment, it often does. Cut it again, and cauterize it, for it will not return after cauterization.
Chapter Twenty-Nine.
In cleaning the teeth with iron.
Rough, unsightly scales may collect on the surfaces of the teeth, both inside and outside, and between the gums.  They may turn black, yellow, or green, leading to decay of the gums and an unsightly appearance of the teeth.
The patient should be seated before you, head resting on your lap.  Carefully clean the tooth or teeth exhibiting scales and sand-like substances until nothing remains.  Do the same for any black, green, or yellow discoloration, until clean.
If the cleaning is complete on the first attempt, proceed. Otherwise, repeat the cleaning process another day, and again on a third day, until the desired result is achieved.  Know that different shaped cleaning instruments, many in form, are required depending on the task.
Because the instrument used to clean the inside of a tooth is different from the one used for the outside, and another still for cleaning between the teeth.  You should have a variety of these instruments prepared.
Chapter Thirty.
On the extraction of teeth.
One should attempt to treat a toothache by all means before resorting to extraction, for there is no remedy after extraction, as it is a noble substance.  Only when extraction is absolutely necessary should it be performed.
Therefore, if the patient insists on extraction, one must be certain the toothache is healed. Often, the patient is deceived by the pain, thinking it is in a healthy tooth, and has it extracted, only for the pain to persist until the diseased tooth is also extracted.  We have observed this repeatedly in the actions of barbers.
If the painful tooth is clearly identified, then one must carefully use a strong forceps to detach the gum on all sides and then gently rock the tooth back and forth, bit by bit, with fingers or fine forceps, until it loosens.
Then, firmly grasp the tooth with large forceps, with the patient's head between your knees, ensuring no movement.  Pull the tooth straight to avoid breaking it.  If it doesn't come out, take one of the instruments and carefully insert it underneath the tooth from all sides, gently rocking it as before.
If the tooth is hollow or decayed, it is necessary to fill the cavity with a cloth and firmly seal it with a thin, smooth strip, so it does not break apart when you grip it with forceps.  Carefully detach the gum from all sides, thoroughly.
Use caution to avoid breaking the tooth, as a piece left behind will cause the patient greater suffering than the original pain.  Do not act like the unskilled barbers who extract teeth without the methods we have described.
They often inflict great harm on people, the least of which is breaking the tooth and leaving the roots, either all or in part. Or, as we have witnessed repeatedly, it may pull out part of the jawbone.  After extraction, the patient should rinse with a drink, vinegar and salt. If bleeding occurs, which frequently happens, crush some alum and apply it to the area.
Otherwise, if the alum is ineffective, use the delicate forceps, the ones that first move the tooth.  Their handles should be short, and the tips long and thick, so they do not bend when you grip the tooth.  This is a picture of the larger forceps.
The handles should be thick, so when you grasp them, they do not yield or bend.  The tips should be short.  They should be made of Indian steel or tempered, strong steel.  On the tip, there should be teeth which interlock securely.
The tips can also be made like a file, making them very strong and precise.
The Thirty-First Chapter.
On the extraction of tooth roots and the removal of fractured jawbones.
If, after removing a tooth, a root remains broken, you should apply a piece of cloth soaked in ghee for a day or two to relax the area.  Then, use forceps or pliers. Which resemble the beak of a bird called a 'balrajah' and this is a picture of the forceps.
If it is not possible to extract it with these forceps, then you must drill into the root and expose all the flesh with a scalpel, then insert the tool resembling a small lever, of which this is an image.
Short, slightly thick at the end, and not sharp, lest it break.  If the root comes out with this, otherwise, use the other tools, of which this is an image; the first one is triangular at the end with some thickness.
Another delicate triangular image.
We can also use this instrument with two branches, of which this is also an image.
And with other tools and instruments, which were previously mentioned in the inventory of the teeth, and we may also use this instrument resembling a large hook, of which this is an image.
Triangular, curved at the end, with a little thickness to prevent breakage, and not sharp. And know that dental instruments are numerous, and similarly, other instruments are almost countless.  A skillful craftsman, through his practice, may invent tools as indicated by the work and the diseases themselves.
For some diseases, the ancients did not describe instruments, because of the differences in their types. If a bone of the jaw or one of the bones of the mouth breaks or decays, investigate it in its place with a suitable tool from among these instruments and forceps, mentioned in removing the roots.
And we use the forceps, this is its image.
It should have some slight thickness to grip the bone firmly so it does not slip until the bone is extracted, and we treat the area with appropriate medications. If the bone has a slight decay, remove the decay and blackness until it is clean, then treat it until it heals.
Thirty-second chapter.
In the eruption of teeth that sprout over others.
Teeth that erupt out of their natural course disfigure the appearance, especially in women and slaves.  One must look closely. If a tooth has erupted behind another tooth,
If it cannot be moved or retracted, remove it. If it is attached to another tooth, cut it with this instrument, whose image is this:.
It resembles a small beak, made of sharp Indian steel.  Cut it over many days due to the tooth's hardness and to avoid disturbing other teeth. If it is protruding and firmly placed, cool it with an Indian file, of this form.
It should be entirely of Indian steel, with very fine engravings, resembling the file used to make needles.  Cool the tooth gradually over many days, gently, to avoid dislodging it and causing it to fall out.  Then, smooth it afterwards and scrape it with certain scrapers.
If a tooth has broken and causes pain to the tongue while speaking, it should also be cooled until the roughness of the fracture disappears and it becomes smooth, not hurting the tongue nor impairing speech.
Chapter Thirty-three.
In fastening loose teeth with silver or gold thread.
If older teeth become loose and displaced due to a blow or fall, and the patient cannot eat anything for fear of their falling out, and treatment with astringent remedies has been unsuccessful.
The solution is to fasten them with gold or silver thread; gold is better because silver tarnishes and becomes foul after days, whereas gold remains unchanged. The thread should be of medium thickness and thinness, appropriate to fit between the teeth.
The method of fastening is to take the thread and insert its fold between the healthy teeth, then weave the ends of the thread through the loose teeth, one or more, until you reach the healthy tooth on the other side.
Then weave back to the starting side, gently and wisely tightening your grip so the teeth do not move.  Tighten the thread at the roots of the teeth to prevent it from slipping.  Then cut the excess ends of the thread with scissors, gather them, twist them together with a tool, and hide them between the healthy tooth and the loose tooth.
To avoid injuring the tongue.  Then leave it tightened as long as it remains; if it loosens or breaks, tighten it again with another thread, and the patient may enjoy it thus for a lifetime.  This is the method for fastening teeth, with two healthy and two loose teeth, as shown.
A single or two teeth may be re-inserted into their place and fastened as described, and remain. This is the work of a skilled craftsman.  He may also carve bone from a cow's bone, shaping it like a tooth and placing it in the space where the tooth was lost. And tightens it, as we said, so it remains and is enjoyed.
Chapter Thirty-Four.
On severing the ligament that lies under the tongue and prevents speech.
This ligament that lies under the tongue may be either natural, present at birth, or accidental, resulting from a healed wound.
The procedure is to open the patient's mouth, place their head in your lap, and lift their tongue.  Then, cut the ligament transversely until the tongue is released from its restraint. If it is somewhat hard and entangled, if it is from a healed wound, use a probe to split it transversely until the ligament is severed and the knots are loosened.
Be careful not to cut too deep into the flesh, severing an artery and causing bleeding.  Then, rinse the cut area with rose water or diluted vinegar afterward.  Place a linen compress under the tongue for the patient to hold in place each night.
To prevent re-adhesion.  If bleeding occurs, apply powdered alum to the area.  If the bleeding is severe, cauterize the site with a lentil-shaped cautery iron. Then treat it with the rest of the treatment until it heals.
Chapter Thirty-five.
For removing a toad that has developed under the tongue.
A swelling resembling a small toad may form under the tongue, hindering its normal function.  It may even enlarge to fill the mouth.  Treatment involves opening the patient's mouth facing the sun and examining the tumor.
If it appears dark-colored or black, hard, and the patient feels no sensation in it, do not attempt to treat it, as it is cancer. If it leans towards whiteness and contains moisture, insert a probe, and carefully cut it open with a scalpel, removing it from all sides.
If blood flows excessively while working, apply pulverized alum until the bleeding stops; then return to your procedure until complete removal, and finally have the patient gargle with vinegar and salt.
Then treat it with all other appropriate remedies until healed.
Chapter Thirty-Six.
In the treatment of tonsil tumors.
And any tumors growing in the throat, which may present glands resembling those appearing externally, are called tonsils. If these have been treated as described in the preceding sections but have not healed, ...
If the tumor is hard, dark-colored, and insensitive, do not use a knife. If it is red and thick, also do not use a knife for fear of bleeding, but leave it until it matures; either it will soften or burst of its own accord.
If it is white, round, and thin, this is what should be cut. Before doing so, check if the inflammation has completely subsided or if some of the inflammation has decreased.
Then, have the patient sit facing the sun, head resting on your lap, mouth open, and a helper by your side who will press the patient's tongue downwards with an instrument, which looks like this:
Make one of silver or brass, as thin as a knife.  When you have pressed the tongue down and the tumor is visible, take a hook and insert it into the tonsil, pulling it outwards as far as possible, without pulling any of the membranes along.
Then cut it with an instrument, which looks like a pair of scissors, but with the tips bent and very sharp, made of Indian iron or Damascus steel.
If this instrument is not available, cut it with a scalpel, which looks like this:
Sharp on one side and blunt on the other.  After cutting one tonsil, cut the other in the same manner.  Then, after cutting, the patient should gargle with cold water or vinegar and water.
If bleeding occurs, gargle with water in which pomegranate peels or rue leaves, or similar astringents, have been boiled, until the bleeding stops. Then treat it until it heals. Other tumors may grow in the throat besides the tonsils, and these are to be cut in the same way as the tonsils.
I treated a woman with a tumor that had grown inside her throat, resembling a small, poorly sensitive lump, which almost blocked her throat.  The woman was breathing through a narrow passage and had been unable to eat or drink.
She was close to death if she had lived another day or two. The tumor had grown two branches that extended to her nostrils. I acted quickly, inserting a hook into one of them, and pulled out a piece.
Then I cut it where it emerged from the nostril, and did the same with the other nostril. Then I opened her mouth, pressed down her tongue, inserted the hook into the tumor itself, and cut off a portion of it, with only a small amount of blood flowing.
The woman's throat opened up, and she immediately drank water and ate.  We repeatedly cut away at that tumor over a long period of time, and it kept growing back in place of what was cut away, and this went on for a long time, involving both me and her.
I devised a method and cauterized the tumor within her throat, causing it to stop growing.  Then I left the area, and I do not know what happened to her after I departed.
Chapter Thirty-seven.
On the removal of a goiter.
If a tumor, called an *unba*, descends to the throat and swells, being white and oblong, it is called a *amood*. If it is thick at the bottom and round, it is called an *unba*. If treatment as described in our classification is ineffective.
If the hot tumor has subsided and is thin, it should be cut.  If it is a compacted, round mass with no length, and is the color of blood, or dark or lacks sensitivity, it should be avoided.
If it presents the described characteristics of whiteness and length, the patient should sit facing the sun, and the tongue should be pressed with the instrument described before, then the snare should be inserted into the *unba*.
Pull it downward and cut it with one of the two instruments mentioned in the section on tonsil removal.  Only the excess beyond the natural amount should be cut, for cutting more will harm the voice and speech.
Then, after cutting, use the methods described for tonsil removal and treat it until healed. If the patient is hesitant to have it cut, use cauterization without fear or caution. The method of cauterization is with a sharp medicine, and the patient's head should be placed on your lap.
Then, press the tongue with the instrument mentioned before, take the sharp water mentioned in the chapter on cauterization, mix it with quicklime, neither thick nor thin, fill the indentation of this instrument, and this is its form.
The tip where you place the medicine has a depression like the depression of a mard spoon.  Place the instrument with the medicine on the uvula itself, with the patient lying on their side, so that saliva will drain from the mouth from inside the throat, so nothing will go down into the throat and harm him.
Then, hold the medicine in your hand and press it against the uvula for about half an hour until you see it blackened and the burning sensation of the medicine subsides.  If you wish, take a piece of cotton, wrap it around the end of a mard spoon, and moisten the cotton with the medicine.
Insert the spoon with the cotton into the tube from above until the cotton adheres to the uvula.  Repeat this several times until you have achieved the desired cauterization of the uvula. Then leave it; it will wither and fall off after three or four days. If you need to reapply the medicine, do so.
After the cauterization, wipe around the uvula with cotton soaked in ghee, and wipe away any medicine around it.  Then, the patient gargles with cold water and is treated externally with poultices and internally with gargles until healed. This type of treatment is safer than cutting and further from fear.
The uvula can also be treated with something milder than cauterization or cutting, by using incense in this way:  Take frankincense, saffron, sage, squill, wormwood, chamomile, and rue, or similar herbs. Combine them all, or some of them, in a pot and soak them in vinegar.
And it is boiled, while the pot is covered with earthenware, and there is a hole in the middle of the lid on which a hollow instrument is placed. This instrument is made of silver or copper.
The end of the device with the pomegranate is inserted into the patient's mouth, so that the steam rises up to the uvula through the tube until the uvula shrinks.  Then, repeat the process several times until it withers.  Be careful not to perform this treatment at the very onset of the swelling.
For it often increases the swelling.  Rather, it should be done when the hot swelling has subsided.  If you do not have this device, take a reed and fit a hard-boiled egg shell to its end, so that the patient's mouth does not burn.
Because the egg shell prevents the heat of the steam from burning the mouth. This is a good and safe treatment.
Chapter Thirty-eight.
On the removal of thorns and other foreign objects lodged in the throat.
Thorns, fish bones, or other objects often lodge in the throat.  It is necessary to remove any visible ones that can be seen, after pressing the tongue with the instrument under the light.
To ascertain what is in the throat; if something is hidden and not visible, the patient should vomit before the food has digested in the stomach.  Perhaps the foreign object will come out with the vomit, or the patient will swallow a piece of a twig or the root of a plant.
Or he swallows a piece of dry bread, or takes a piece of soft sea sponge, ties it to a thread, then swallows it.  When it reaches the location of the thorn, pull the thread quickly, repeating this several times.
Often the thorn or bone adheres to it and comes out. If it does not come out by the methods mentioned, then use a lead instrument in this manner:
It should be slightly thicker than a lead rod.  At its tip there is a hook. The patient inserts it into their throat gently, while raising their head upward and taking care not to touch their throat to avoid coughing, and thereby dislodging the bone or thorn.  Or the physician inserts it with their hand.
Having the patient insert it is better, as they know the location of the foreign object, and pushing it downward, or pulling their hand with the instrument upward, should be done to the extent possible until it comes out.
Chapter Thirty-nine.
Removing a leech lodged in the throat.
If, having treated the leech with the remedies mentioned in the section on medicinal treatment, it proves ineffective, then examine the patient's throat in the light of the sun, after pressing down the tongue with the instrument that I have described to you.
If you see the leech, pull it out with a small hook or a gentle, firm forceps.  If that is not possible, take a hollow tube, insert it into the patient's throat near the leech, and then insert a heated iron into the tube's interior.
Do this several times. The patient should abstain from water all day.  Then, he should take a jar filled with cool water, open his mouth over it, gargle, without swallowing any of it.  He should move the water with his hand from time to time.
If the leech feels the water, it will fall off. If it does not come out using the methods described, fumigate the throat with urine and with hellebore using the instrument described for fumigation of the throat. Do this several times and it will fall off.
The method for fumigation is to take a vessel containing embers heated by fire. The vessel is covered with a lid having a hole in the middle.  Place the end of the instrument in this hole, then put the fumigation material into the vessel.  The patient should place their mouth on the end of the tube and close their mouth tightly so that the smoke does not escape until it is certain that the smoke has reached the throat.
If the leech falls off at that point, good.  If it does not fall off, the fumigation is repeated several times.  The patient should endure thirst and eat salty foods and garlic, but not drink any water.  The leech must come out with this treatment.  This is an image of an instrument used to pull the leech from the throat when it is spotted.
It resembles pincers, as you see, except that it has this bend which enters the throat, and its tips are like a bird's beak.  There is the roughness of a file on them; if they grasp something, they do not let go.
Another instrument is used to press the tongue.  It is a wide ring of iron, as wide as the mouth, placed above the tongue. It is inserted into the mouth upright on its side, so that the mouth remains open involuntarily.  The patient cannot remove it at all until it is removed.
Description of the instrument used to open the mouth in this exact manner.
Chapter Forty.
In it, there is discussion of the incision and lancing of tumors.
Tumors are numerous and varied, as will be described one by one in this book.  Their incision and lancing differ in two ways: one, from the nature of the tumor itself and the humours it contains.
The second way is due to the locations in the body where they occur, for a tumor arising in the head differs from one arising in the buttocks, and a tumor arising in fleshy tissue differs from one arising in a joint.  Each has its own treatment.
Some tumors should not be incised until the pus has matured and is fully formed; others should be incised while still raw and not fully matured, such as tumors close to the joints.
Because if a tumor arises near a joint and continues to fester until it rots the surrounding tissue, it may damage the ligaments or nerves of that joint, causing paralysis of that limb, or the tumor may be near a vital organ.
Because if you delay incision until it matures, you will harm the vital organ, or if it is near the buttocks, you should incise it raw.  It is necessary to incise a raw, incompletely matured tumor near the buttocks, lest the decay spread inwards and reach the anus and become a fistula.
It will become incurable.  You should know when to incise fully matured tumors, which is when the tumor pain subsides, the fever abates, the redness and throbbing decrease, the head of the tumor softens, and other symptoms disappear.
The incision should be made at the lowest point of the tumor, if possible, to allow the discharge to flow downwards; or at the thinnest, most prominent part of the tumor.  If the tumors are on the arms or legs, the incision should be made lengthwise along the limb.
The incision should be made over muscle, tendons, nerves, and arteries, generally in all straight, non-bending areas.  For those that bend, the incision should follow the natural contour of the area.  If the tumor is in a fleshy area, it is best to leave it alone.
Until its maturity is complete, as we have stated.  If you incise it before then, the pus will flow excessively, causing much harm and dirtiness, and possibly hardening the edges and the wound. Some tumors may require an incision across the body, if necessary, or in accordance with the needs of the affected limb.
Small tumors require a single incision, while large tumors require a broad incision or many incisions, depending on the size of the tumor. Some tumors may require the skin to be incised and cut away if it has become like a tattered cloth.
It has become, in some cases, like dead tissue, as often seen in many tumors and abscesses.  Some are incised with a three-angled cut, and some are cut like a rue leaf, like a tumor of the groin.
Some require a circular or crescent-shaped incision, and similar types of incisions.  Tumors that do not have a head, such as flat, smooth tumors, should only be incised with a simple incision. If the tumor is large, has existed for a long time, and has been incised, do not rush to drain all the pus at once.
Instead, drain some of it, then compress the tumor until the next day, and drain some more pus. Repeat this gradually until all the pus is removed.
Especially if the patient is weak, a pregnant woman, a young child, or an elderly person, the vital spirit often weakens with the sudden expulsion of pus.  The patient might die without you realizing it.  Beware of this matter greatly.
After incising these tumors, you should clean the wound and examine it.  If the tumor wound is small or the incision is simple, use a bandage of linen or worn cotton.  If the tumor is large and the incisions are numerous,
Then you should insert a thread into each incision until they meet.  If part of the skin has been severed or eroded by the tumor, you should fill it with worn cotton or linen fibers without moisture and compress it until the third day.
Then remove it and treat it with the appropriate ointments until it heals. If bleeding occurs during your work, use cold water and vinegar, after soaking a linen cloth in them, and apply it to the bleeding area repeatedly.
If the bleeding persists, you should use the methods and treatments, and the cauterization techniques, that we have described in many places in this book and in the classifications. If it is winter and the tumor area is highly sensitive, you should soak the compresses in warm drinks and oil.
And place them on the area. If it is summer and the areas are fleshy, you should apply compresses soaked in water and oil, or in cool drinks and oil, until, as we said, the third day, when you should remove the tumor and clean it.
And use similar treatments until it heals. This is what you need to know about treating tumors in general.  As for the detailed approach, each tumor's treatment is described in a summarized and categorized manner.
Chapter Forty-One.
On the treatment of tumors appearing on the scalp.
Small tumors appear on the scalp, a type of pustule contained within membranes, resembling the characteristics of a hen's egg.  Their types are numerous, including fatty ones and those containing a moisture like mud.
Some contain moisture like porridge and soup, and similar substances. Some are stony and hard.  None are dangerous to cut open and remove, unless you encounter a blood vessel while cutting.
The procedure for cutting them is to first probe them with the instrument, whose image will come after this, called a probe, so you know what they contain. If they contain moisture, cut them lengthwise with a simple incision in this manner:
Begin the incision from line ~b~ to line ~c~. If the moisture is discharged, peel away the sac that contained it and cut it entirely.  Leave absolutely nothing behind, as it often returns if any part remains.
Then dip cotton in the resinous ointment, if available, or in salt water, and fill the wound with it. Leave it for another day, for it will consume any remaining sac.  Then apply the cotton with the resinous ointment again, and a third time if necessary.
Until you are certain that nothing of the sac remains. Then treat the wound with ointments until healed. If the swelling contains fatty matter, cut it in this manner:
Make a firm incision, and place forceps on the edges of the wound. Peel it away from every side, and exert all your effort in removing the membrane that contains it. If an artery obstructs you, do what was previously described to you.  Similarly, do this with the swelling, if it is hardened from the incision.
The treatment is the same as previously described. The incision on a hardened swelling is easier, because it has little blood and moisture. Some of these swellings in the head in some people may have no moisture at all.  This is because I incised a swelling in...
the head of an old woman, and found the swelling as hard as stone, rough, white; one could not break it even if one threw it, and it would only chip.  Other swellings occurring on the head, such as those which appear on children's heads, were not like this.
At the roots of the ears, make a simple incision along their entire length, and create a slope from the lower portion so that the material can drain downwards.  Then treat it with the appropriate therapy.
Chapter Forty-two.
On the incision of swine-like swellings which often appear in the neck.  These swellings often appear in the neck and under the armpits and in the groin.  They may appear elsewhere on the body.  The one which appears in the neck may be single or multiple, and some arise from others.
Each such swelling lies within its own special membrane, as do tumors and swellings of the head, as we have described.  There are many types of these swellings, some hard, some containing moisture, and some malignant, which do not respond to treatment.
Of those I have seen, some felt good and their appearance was close to the color of the skin.  They moved in all directions and were not attached to the neck's nerve, vein, or artery, nor were they sunken. Then it is necessary to incise it simply from top to bottom of the body in this manner, from line ~J~ to line ~B~.
One should dissect it from all sides, and stretch the skin flaps with a hook or two, or many hooks if needed, as we said regarding swellings of the head.  Remove it little by little, taking care not to sever a vein or nerve.  The scalpel should not be excessively sharp.
So that your hand does not cause more cutting or cause distress to the patient, leading to the severing of what is not necessary to cut.  If you cut a vein or artery, preventing you from continuing, then apply powdered za'aj or some of the substances which stop bleeding to the wound.
Then tighten the wound and leave it until the swelling subsides, the wound relaxes, and putrefaction begins.  At that point the bleeding will cease, so return to your work until you are finished. Then, use your index finger to check if there are any remaining, then smaller, splinters and cut them and remove them.
If a large vein is at the base of the splinter, you should not cut the splinter at its base.  Instead, you should tie it with a doubled, strong thread and let it fall out on its own without causing harm.  Then fill the wound with used cotton soaked in Egyptian ointment, and then treat it.
If you have cut the splinter entirely, you should bring together the edges of the wound and stitch it immediately, after making sure there is absolutely no remaining splinter.  If you see that a splinter of the bone remains, however.
You should aim to cut at the root and base of the splinter, and use stitching as we described.  For splinters containing moisture, apply a simple compress where their point of ripening appears, placing the compress as we said, below.
Then, after the compress, apply a bandage with Egyptian ointment, or similar, to consume any remaining corruption.  Once you see the wound is clean, treat it with healing ointments until it heals.
Chapter Forty-Three.
On opening the throat for a tumor occurring within the throat.
The ancients mentioned this opening of the throat, but I have seen no one in our country perform it.  This agrees with their account.  As for those with difficulty breathing, it is necessary to avoid opening the throat, as it will not benefit them.
If all the tumors and lungs are diseased, and those with a hot tumor in the mouth, throat, or tonsils, if there is no disease in the trachea, then opening the throat is necessary to escape the harm of suffocation.
If we wish to do this, then the throat should be opened under three rings of the trachea, or four small transverse incisions between two rings, as far as the incision should be in the pleura and not in the cartilage.  This place is suitable for the incision.
Because it lacks flesh and the blood vessels are distant from it, if the surgeon is timid, then the throat's skin should be stretched with a hook, and then the skin should be cut until, when it reaches the trachea, he should avoid the blood vessels if he sees any.
Then, he should cut the pleura, which we have described, and the incision of the trachea is shown by the phlegm that comes out of it with the things that are being discharged, and from the cessation of the voice, and the wound is left open for a time, and when the time that was feared for suffocation has passed, he should bring together the lips of the wound from the skin.
Then, its line is alone, without cartilage, and then the medications that produce flesh are used until it heals.  The author of this book said: The explanation of this speech that we have recounted is only if they see the patient's throat blocked by one of these tumors that they mentioned.
When the patient was close to death and was about to die, they went to cut the throat so that the patient would breathe through the wound, and be saved from death.  However, they were ordered to leave the wound open until the disease's course was completed, and the course of the disease is about three days or so.
Then they ordered the wound to be sutured and treated until it healed.  What I saw with my own eyes was a servant who took a knife and slashed her throat, cutting part of her lung's trachea.  I was called to treat her, and I found her weakening as a slaughtered animal weakens, so I examined the wound.
I found the blood that came out of the wound to be little, so I was certain that she had not cut an artery or a vein.  Air was coming out of the wound. I quickly sutured the wound and treated it until it healed.  The servant was not harmed, except for some hoarseness in her voice, nothing more.
And after a few days, she returned to her best condition.  From this, we say that cutting the throat has no danger.
Chapter Forty-Four.
On the incision of the tumor that appears on the larynx from the outside, called the pharyngeal tumor.
This tumor, called a pharyngeal tumor, is a large tumor the color of the body. It is common in women and has two types.
Either it is natural or accidental. The natural one is incurable.  The accidental one comes in two types: one similar to fatty tumors, and the other similar to tumors that arise from the complexity of the artery; there is danger in cutting it. Therefore, one should not use the knife at all, except for those that are small.  If, upon probing and examining it with a probe, it is found to resemble a fatty tumor and not connected to any vessels, cut it like you would cut a tumor. And remove it with whatever sac it is contained in, if it is in a sac. Otherwise, remove the whole thing and then treat the area with the appropriate treatment.
Chapter forty-five.
On cutting various tumors.
Tumors have many types, and all their types have been mentioned in the classification.  It is necessary here to explain the difference between a tumor and an abscess, as this is problematic.  I say that an abscess is accompanied by heat, fever, and frightening pains until the boiling of the inflammation subsides. The putrid material then develops, and the fever and intensity subside.  A tumor is not accompanied by heat, fever, or pain. It is contained within a serous sac, which is a special covering for it. It is the same color as the body, and it begins as a small lump, growing into something larger or smaller.
They are of two types, either fatty or containing moisture.  The colors of moisture are numerous, as mentioned in the classification.  Therefore, when treating a tumor, you must first probe and examine it with an instrument called a "meds," as its image will appear in the following chapter.
Assess the size of the tumor, then withdraw the meds and observe what comes out afterward. If a flowing moisture of any color emerges, then make a small incision, as described in other tumors. If no moisture emerges after using the meds, know that it is fatty.
Incise it with a firm incision, in this manner, as I have taught you.  Hang it with hooks and carefully detach the skin from every side, and if possible, remove the sac containing the tumor intact.
If the sac breaks during the procedure, and you are unable to remove it intact, as often happens, remove it piece by piece, so that nothing remains.  If any part remains, large or small, the tumor will likely recur.
If you are overcome and only a small part remains, cauterize the wound with some sharp cauterizing substances when finished, and suture the wound. Apply a remedy to calm the hot tumor and treat it with other remedies until it heals. If the tumor is large, suture its edges and treat it with remedies to close the wound.
If a bleeding vein, or other vein, interferes and causes bleeding, immediately cauterize the affected area with powdered alum. Leave it compressed for two or three days until the wound becomes infected and the blood ceases to boil, then proceed to remove any remaining parts of the tumor.
Chapter Forty-Six.
In the figures of the instruments.
In the images of the instruments used for the incision and extraction, there are various types of probes, including large, medium, and small ones.
Image of a large probe.
Image of a medium probe.
Image of a small probe.
Made of hardened steel, square-ended, and tightly fitted to facilitate entry into tumors. These are the images of probes, called "bard," also available in three sizes: large, medium, and small. Image of a large probe.
Image of a medium probe.
Image of a small probe.
It is suitable for probing tumors, wounds, fistulas, and cavities to detect the presence of bones and other matter within.  It is made round, polished, and smooth like a whetstone, from Chinese brass, or "aspadruyia," or copper, or iron, or silver; the best is made of "aspadruyia.
Probes can also be made of lead, suitable for probing fistulas with bends, as its flexibility will follow those bends.  These also come in three varieties: long, medium, and short.
According to the needs of each fistula's depth, the thickness should be adjusted to the width or narrowness of the fistula.  Image of a large lead probe.
Image of a medium lead probe.
Image of a small lead probe.
Images of forceps, which are numerous types.  Some are simple, meaning they have one hook, and come in large, medium, and small sizes.  Other forceps are blind, in three types, and others have double hooks, in three types, and some are curved, with double hooks. And there are three types.  From these are forceps with three hooks, also in three types.  All these types require their own specific location.  Image of a large, simple forceps. Image of a medium simple forceps. Image of a small simple forceps.
Image of a large blind forceps. Image of a medium blind forceps.
Image of a small blind forceps.
Image of a large forceps with two hooks. Image of a medium forceps with two hooks. Image of a small forceps with two hooks.
Image of a large forceps with three hooks.
Image of a medium forceps with three hooks. Image of a small forceps with three hooks.
These are images of the scalpels used to cut and scrape tumors and sores.  There are three types, some large, some medium, and some small.  Image of a large scalpel.
Image of a medium scalpel.
Image of a small scalpel.
Its blades, with which it cuts, are limited, and the other ends are not limited.  This is done so that it can be used for scraping away the sore, when there is fear of cutting a nerve or tendon, so that the patient may be supported and find a little relief from the burning sensation that occurs when scraping away the tumor.
These are images of the retractors.  There are three types, some large, some medium, and some small.  Image of a large retractor.
It is made of polished brass, similar to that used for kohl. On one end is a wide spoon-like shape, made of two layers, with the scalpel blade hidden within its head.  It resembles a bird's tongue, moving in and out as desired, as you see.
Images of the blunt-ended scalpels, which are used between the fingers for excising tumors and are not felt by the patient. There are three types, some large, some medium, and some small.  Image of a large scalpel.
Images of leeches, used for cutting off blood flow.  There are three types, some large, some medium, and some small.  Image of a large leech.
They are made of brass or Chinese metal, slightly elongated and rounded, as you see.  These types of leeches, both large and small, should be available to quickly cut off blood when needed, and when medication is not available.
However, they are not used to cut blood from every part of the body, but rather in fleshy areas, such as the leg and thigh muscles, arm muscles, breasts, abdomen, and groin, and similar moist fleshy organs.
Other small instruments like pistachio shells can be made from them, in this image.
Blood is cut with them if it bleeds from a venesection site, or when a vein or artery is cut.  A round one can also be made, in this image.
Chapter forty-seven.
On the treatment of the male breast.
Some people's breasts may swell to resemble women's breasts during puberty, remaining swollen and unsightly.  If one dislikes this, one should make a crescent-shaped incision on the breast in this shape.
From line ~b~ to line ~c~. Then remove all the fat, then fill the wound with the medicated ointment, then stitch together the wound's edges and treat it until it heals.  If the breast sags and relaxes due to the weakening of its structure, as happens in women.
One should make two crescent-shaped incisions on its upper sides, connecting at their ends, so that the larger incision encircles the smaller one in this manner. From line ~b~ to line ~c~, then the skin between the incisions is removed, the fat is extracted, and the previously mentioned stitching, sutures, and necessary treatments are applied until healed.
If you are unable to remove everything that should be removed, either because of the patient's distress or excessive bleeding, then the wound should be packed with cotton soaked in corrosive ointment, left until the remaining fat is consumed, then treated until healed.
Chapter Forty-eight.
On the treatment of tumors that appear under the armpit.
These tumors that appear under the armpit are of the swine-like variety, hard and contained within a sac. Some contain moisture.  Those containing moisture should be incised with a crescent-shaped cut, like this.
From line ~b~ to line ~c~.  If all the matter in the tumor has been discharged, pack it with used cotton and leave it until the next day, then remove the cotton.
And treat it with the appropriate ointment until it heals. If the tumor is of the "swine's knot" type, cut it as we described for swine tumors.  If the wound becomes purulent, use cauterization as previously described.
Chapter forty-nine.
In the incision of a tumor appearing near an artery or vein, called an aneurysm.
If an artery is wounded and the skin above it adheres, a tumor often results.  Similarly, a vein can also develop swelling and a tumor.
The signs distinguishing whether a swelling is arterial or venous:  If from an artery, the swelling is oblong, clustered deep within the body, and when you press it with your finger, you feel a crackling sensation.
A venous swelling is round and on the surface of the body.  Incisions on these tumors are dangerous, especially in the armpit, groin, neck, and many other areas of the body.  Large tumors should be avoided when treated with iron.
Also, those in the limbs or head should be avoided.  For those that have an arterial swelling, make a lengthwise incision in the skin, then widen the cut with hooks, and then separate and free the artery from the membranes.
Until it is exposed.  Then insert a needle beneath it, and pierce it to the other side.  Tie the artery with a double thread in two places, as I have shown you for the arteries in the neck.  Then pierce the area between the ligaments with a lancet until all the blood is released.
The swelling will subside.  Then use the treatment that produces pus until the ligaments fall off.  Then treat with the appropriate ointments until it heals.
If the swelling is from a vein rupture, you should grasp the swelling with the skin as much as possible.  Then insert a needle below the area you grasped, and pierce it with a double thread until it comes out on the other side. Then tie the swelling firmly, in the manner I described for tying the aneurysm on both sides of the thread. If you fear the threads will slip, insert another needle with another thread under the entire swelling, where the first needle crosses it.
Tie your threads in four places. Then cut the swelling open in the middle, until what is inside comes out. Cut off any excess skin, and leave what was tied. Then place a bandage on it, dipped in a mixture of liquid and oil. Then use the treatment of twisting and ointments until it heals.
Chapter Fifty.
In the swelling that arises from nerve twisting.
Just as swelling occurs in the artery and vein, so too does swelling occur in the nerve if it is struck or caused by excessive exertion, or similar things.  This is more common in the wrists and ankles.
And in every place where the joints move, it is a hard swelling that resembles the color of the rest of the body.  Most often, it is painless.  If pressed firmly, the patient feels a numbness-like sensation.  The swelling is not deeply embedded in the body.
Instead, it is under the skin, moving in every direction, but not forward or backward.  Any swelling in the joints should not be treated with a knife, for it may cause a festering sore.  And any swelling in the head or forehead...
Cut the skin with a scalpel.  If the swelling is small, hold it with forceps and cut it from the root. If it is large, tie it with a noose, then scrape it off, remove it, and stitch the wound, treating it until it heals.
Chapter Fifty-one.
On the removal of warts appearing on the abdomen.
Warts, called "fungal" because of their resemblance to fungi, often appear on the abdomen and throughout the body.  Their base is thin, and their head thick, sometimes with thickened edges.  They vary in size, from small to very large.
I have observed a man with two warts on his abdomen, resembling fungi in appearance.  Their base was thin and white, their edges thickened, and moisture constantly oozed from them.  I removed them, and the weight of one was approximately eighteen ounces and the other approximately six ounces.
If the wart is moist, white, and thin-based, cut it with a broad scalpel while having a cautery iron heated nearby, as considerable bleeding often occurs during removal.
If bleeding is excessive, cauterize the area.  If the patient is afraid of cutting with iron, take a tightly wound lead thread, tie it around the wart with these characteristics, and leave it for two days, gradually tightening the lead thread.
As the lead thread tightens the wart, it will eventually detach and fall off without further effort. If the wart has a thick base, cutting it carries a risk, especially on the abdomen, though half or part of it might be removed.
Then cauterize it to prevent recurrence, and treat the wound until it heals.  Beware of cutting a wart that is dark-colored, insensitive, and dull-looking, as it may be a cancerous tumor.  We will discuss cancer later.
The Fifty-second Chapter.
In the treatment of umbilical tumors.
Umbilical tumors arise from various causes, either from a rupture of the peritoneum in the abdomen, allowing the bowels to protrude as in other hernias, or from blood emanating from a vein or artery, as previously described, or from trapped air.
If it is from a rupture of the peritoneum and protrusion of the bowels, the tumor will be similar in color to the body, soft without pain, and of varied shape. If it is from the protrusion of the bowels, its shape will be even more markedly different as described.  If you press it with your fingers, it will disappear then reappear, and perhaps there will be rumbling. It will often become larger with bathing or intense exertion.  If it is from moisture, it will be soft.
If it does not disappear when pressed with your hand, and does not increase or decrease in size, then if it is from blood, the tumor will exhibit these signs, but also turn dark. If it is from a newly grown flesh, the tumor will be hard and firm, and maintain a consistent size.
If it is from air, it will be soft to the touch.  In this case, if the umbilical protrusion is due to blood from an artery or vein, or air, you should abstain from treating it, as there is danger and deception involved, as I informed you in the chapter on tumors arising from arteries and veins.
If the umbilical protrusion is due to bowels or intestines, you should instruct the patient to hold himself still and stand upright, then draw a line with ink around the entire umbilicus. Then, instruct him to lie on his back before you.  Then, make a wide incision around the umbilicus, at the marked spot.  Then, lift the center of the tumor upwards with a large hook.  Then, bind the incision with a strong thread or strong silk thread, firmly.
The knot of the bandage should be a slip-knot.  Then, open the center of the constricted tumor above the bandage, and insert your index finger and search for the intestines.  If you find that the bandage has caught the intestines, loosen the slip-knot and push the intestines back into the abdomen. If it is a fistula, extend it with a hook.
And cut off the excess.  If an artery or vein obstructs you, tie it off firmly, then return to your work.  Take two needles, thread them with strong threads, and insert the two needles into the incision you made around the tumor, penetrating them firmly.  Then, tighten the tumor at four locations using the needles.
And if you wish, remove the needles and leave the area until the tightened flesh rots and falls off of its own accord, or cut it if it has thinned and rotted.  Then, treat it with the appropriate ointments until it heals. If the umbilical protrusion is from flesh that has grown there.
Or if it is from moisture, you should cauterize the tumor as we said, and remove the blood or moisture that you find there, then treat it with what will heal the area.
Chapter Fifty-three.
On the treatment of cancer.
We have previously mentioned the types of cancer in the classification, and how to treat it with medications, and warned against treating it with iron, lest it ulcerate.  We have also described cancer originating in the uterus and warned against treating it.
The ancients stated that if the cancer is in a location where it can be completely excised, like cancer in the breast or thigh, and similar members that allow its complete removal, especially if it is small and in its early stages, then it should be removed completely. However, if it is advanced and large, it should not be approached.
I have not been able to cure anyone of it, nor have I seen anyone before me achieve this.  The procedure, if the cancer is accessible as we have described, is to proceed with cauterization with the black cautery, several times, and then to excise it if there is apparent fullness in the veins.
Then apply cauterization in a way that allows for effective treatment, then insert the appropriate forceps into the cancer, and remove it from every side along with the skin, completely, until no part of its roots remain.  Allow the blood to flow without quickly stopping it.
Instead, squeeze the affected areas and remove all the thick blood with your hand or whatever tools are available.  If during the process, a major hemorrhage occurs from a severed artery or vein, constrict the vein until the bleeding stops, then treat it with the usual methods until it heals.
Chapter Forty-five.
On the treatment of carbuncles.
We have previously discussed the various types of dropsy, how water collects, the symptoms of each type, and its treatment with medications.  Only the scrofulous type of dropsy is treated with iron.  The phlegmatic and fleshy types should never be treated with iron.
If, having treated this scrofulous carbuncle with medication, your treatment proves ineffective, consider whether the patient has succumbed to excessive weakness or has another ailment besides the carbuncle.
If the patient suffers from coughing, diarrhea, or similar ailments, avoid treating it with iron, as this is risky. If you see a patient of robust constitution, free from illnesses besides the carbuncle alone, neither a child nor an old person, proceed by having the patient stand before you. A servant behind him should press his abdomen with their hands, pushing the water downwards towards the pubic area.  Then, take a pointed lancet in this manner:
Having two limited ends, long, and pointed like a lancet, but with a slight curve, so as not to penetrate the intestines during use, and cause injury.  Then, consider if the carbuncle originates from the intestines.
If the carbuncle originates from a problem with the liver, the incision should be three finger-widths to the left of the navel, below it and above the pubic area. If it arises from a problem with the spleen, the incision should be three finger-widths to the right of the navel.
Also, the incision should not be on the side the patient wants to lie on, lest the fluids flow to that weakened spot.  Then, pierce the entire skin with the instrument and insert the instrument into the incision, raising your hand.
With the lancet, separate the skin from the peritoneum, as if you were peeling it back.  The amount peeled back should be about the size of a fingernail, or similar.  Then pierce the peritoneum until the lancet reaches an empty space, the location of the fluid.  Then extract the fluid and insert the instrument of this form into the hole.
It is like a thin tube made of silver, copper, or smooth polished leather.  It has a small hole at the bottom and three holes on the sides, two on one side and one on the other, as you see.
Its tip may have a pointed end, like the nib of a pen, of this form.
At its upper end there is a ring; when the instrument reaches the water, it will drain from it onto the instrument immediately.  Empty the water from it in a moderate amount, because if you empty more than necessary at once, the patient may die from the dissolution of their vital spirit.
Or the patient may experience a near-death fainting spell.  However, empty the water according to the patient's strength and what the patient's pulse and complexion indicate, and then remove the instrument and contain the water, as it will hold immediately.
Because of the skin that grips the opening in the diaphragm, which you were told to soothe in that manner, then use the instrument again another day if you see the patient is able to tolerate it.
Also remove a small amount of water.  Do this for several days while being careful to avoid mistakes, so that only a small amount of water remains.  If you fear for the patient's health and leave a lot of water behind, then treat the patient with burial in hot sand.
A lot of sweating in the bath and sun, and enduring thirst, and treating with dried medications until he is healed, and cauterize the stomach, liver, and spleen after removing the water as described before.
Chapter Fifty-five.
On treating children born with unperforated or narrow, or misplaced, urinary openings.
Some boys may be born with an unperforated urethra; therefore, it is necessary to perforate it as soon as they are born.
With a very thin scalpel, in this manner:.
Then, a thin leaden nail is placed in the opening, tied and held for three or four days.  When urination is desired, it is removed and then replaced.  If the lead is not used, the urine flowing in that area might not allow it to close.
And as for those with a narrow opening, it is treated with lead, as we said, for many days until it widens.  Those whose opening is in the wrong place, some being born with the opening at the end of the urethra, are unable to urinate forward.
Until the urethra is raised by hand, and he is not born with the semen unable to reach the uterus in a straight line, which is a very serious condition. The treatment involves the patient lying on his back.
Then, with your left hand, strongly stretch his urethra, and trim the head of the urethra with a blade or a sharp scalpel, like a pen-knife, or as if carving something so that its center is prominent, like a urethra, and the opening is in the center, as it should be.
Be careful of bleeding during your procedure, as it often occurs.  Stop the bleeding and treat the wound until it heals.
Chapter Fifty-Six.
Concerning the ulcer that occurs in the prepuce, the glans, the blackness, the decay, and the adhesion of the prepuce to the glans.
This ulcer often occurs in the urethra, as a fleshy, dark bump, and can be malignant or benign.  The benign one should be lifted with a delicate hook.
Cut it completely clean, then apply a cotton swab dipped in Egyptian ointment, then treat it with palm ointment until it heals.  If the ulcer is malignant, dark in color, cauterization should be used after cutting and removing it.
If the ulcer is in the prepuce of an uncircumcised person, and some of the ulcer is inside the prepuce and some outside, the ulcer inside should be removed first.  Then, once it has healed, treat the ulcer from outside.
Because if you treat both simultaneously, you risk the prepuce becoming perforated.  This can also occur in females, with blackness and decay in the prepuce; all blackened and decaying or already decayed material should be removed.
Then apply honey with ground and sifted pomegranate rind and crimson to it. Then treat it with further remedies until it heals.  If bleeding occurs, use a crescent-shaped cautery iron in this manner:
Cauterization is beneficial in both cases, meaning bleeding and the ulcer if it becomes infected.  If the foreskin is entirely destroyed at some point, a lead tube should be inserted into the urethra for the patient to urinate through.  As for adhesion of the foreskin to the glans...
This adhesion occurs in those whose foreskin was healthy and who did not undergo circumcision, or it may result from a wound or a tumor.  The foreskin should be separated with a sharp scalpel until the ligaments are loosened and the glans is freed on all sides.
If it is difficult to distinguish it through examination, a portion of the glans and foreskin should be separated. The foreskin is thin, and so it might perforate quickly due to its thinness.  Then separate the foreskin and glans with a thin linen cloth soaked in cold water, to prevent further adhesion.
Then treat with a styptic drink until it heals.
Chapter Fifty-seven.
In the purification of boys and the treatment of their errors.
Circumcision is nothing other than the separation of connection, like other surgical procedures. However, since it is of our own doing and specifically used in boys, we must establish the best method of procedure.
And the easiest way to safety, I say that the ancients did not mention circumcision in any of their books, because it was not used in their laws; rather, it is something we have adopted.
By experience, for I found the majority of artisans and barbers using purification with a knife and scissors, and using a scalpel, tying with thread, and cutting with a nail. I have tested all these methods.
Therefore, I found no better than purification with scissors and tying with thread, because purification with a knife often causes the skin to adhere, as the foreskin has two layers, and perhaps the outer layer is cut while the inner layer remains.
One would be forced to make another cut and suffer further pain.  Purification with a scalpel does not guarantee avoiding cutting the urethral opening, as it might be entered.  As for purification with a nail, the skin might tear, spoiling your work, or the boy's skin might be naturally short.
Often, they are born needing no purification. I have seen this.  As for purification with scissors and tying with thread, experience revealed its superiority to me, because the scissors have even cuts, as the blade above is like the blade below.
When you squeeze your hand with the blades in harmony, they cut at the same level and in the same time.  This makes the thread's grip like a wall to the urethral skin on all sides; there is no error at all.  The method first involves reassuring the boy.
Especially if he is somewhat intelligent, explain that you are only tying the thread to his urethra and leaving it for another day. Then, please him and delight him in any way you can, and do what he accepts mentally. Then, have him stand before you, upright.
Do not have him sit down.  Hide the scissors in your sleeve or under your foot.  Do not let the boy's eyes see them or any other instruments. Then, insert your hand into his urethra and inflate the skin and pull it upward until the head of the urethra emerges.
Then, clean it of any accumulated dirt. Then tie the marked area with a double thread. Then, a second tie slightly below it.  Hold the lower tie firmly with your thumb and index finger and cut between the two ties. Then, quickly lift the skin upward and remove the head of the urethra. Let the blood flow for a little while, as this is better and lessens urethral swelling. Then, dry it with a damp cloth.  Afterwards, sprinkle dried, burned gourd ashes on it, as this is the best I have tried, or fine sawdust, which is also excellent.
Then, quickly lift the skin upward and remove the head of the urethra. Let the blood flow for a little while, as this is better and lessens urethral swelling. Then, dry it with a damp cloth.  Afterwards, sprinkle dried, burned gourd ashes on it, as this is the best I have tried, or fine sawdust, which is also excellent. Then, apply a poultice of a hard-boiled egg in rose water, pounded with soft, good rose oil, to the wound.  Leave it on for another day, and then continue the rest of the treatment until he is healed.
This is a suitable scissor design for the procedure.
The scissors should be straight, sharp, and have a nail-like tip.  The blades should be the same length as the handles.  A common mistake in the procedure is that the skin inside may be turned over completely or partially when cutting.  Therefore, you should pull the skin out with your fingernail before the area swells.
Cut it [the skin] evenly. If you can't hold it with your fingernail, pull it with a hook and cut it.  If three days pass and the area under the head of the urethra remains swollen and inflamed, leave it until the acute swelling subsides and gently scrape it off.
Cut it as you see fit, being careful around the head of the urethra.  If some of the head of the urethra is cut, it will not harm; treat it with the poultices that we described in the article on poultices.
If more skin is cut than necessary and it pulls back, this is not very harmful. Treat it as described until it heals.
Chapter Fifty-eight.
On treating urine retention in the bladder.
Urine retention in the bladder occurs due to blockage by a stone, clotted blood, pus, or overgrown flesh, and similar obstructions.  If you treat this with the various treatments described in the classifications,
If the urine does not flow and you suspect the retention is due to a stone damaging the neck of the bladder, the patient should be placed on their knees, then have someone sit on their back, pressing the abdomen towards the back. The patient should hold themselves as best they can.
The neck of the bladder will then be forced to push the stone backward, and the urine will flow. If the urine still does not flow and the patient's condition worsens, then the extraction instrument called catheters, whose image is this, should be used.
It is made of silver, thin and smooth, hollowed out like a bird's feather tube, about a foot and a half long.  It has a gentle funnel at its head.  To draw out the urine, a doubled thread with attached wool or cotton is securely tied to one end.
The thread's end is inserted into the lower end of the catheter.  Any excess wool is trimmed with pliers so it can enter the tube and seal it like a stopper. Then the catheter is lubricated with oil, butter, or egg white, and the patient sits on a chair.
The bladder and urethra are moistened with warm oil or water, then the catheter is gently inserted into the urethra until it reaches the base of the urethra. The urethra is then pulled upward towards the navel, and the catheter is pushed into it.
Once the urethra is pulled back, the catheter is pushed inward until it is close to the anus. The penis is then tilted downward, with the catheter inside, and pushed until it reaches the bladder. The patient will feel that it has reached an empty space.
This is done in this manner because the urinary passage has curves.  By pulling the thread with the wool a little forcefully, the urine follows the wool.  Then it is removed, and the urine is drained.  The catheter is then reinserted.
Continue doing this until the bladder is emptied and the patient feels relief.
Chapter Fifty-nine.
How to inject the bladder with a syringe.
Images of suitable instruments for this purpose are made of silver or hollowed ivory.  They have a long, thin tube, and are intended to instill water and medications.  This is done with an instrument called a syringe.  This is its image:.
Made of silver or hollowed ivory, it has a long, thin tube, hollow throughout except for the end, which is solid.  There are three holes in it: two on one side and one on the other side, as you see.
The hollow part, where the projectile is, is sized to fit it snugly, without any excess.  Thus, when you pull something out of the liquid, it is pulled out.  And when you push something in, it is pushed out; just as a pump used for throwing oil in naval warfare does.
If you want to remove the moisture in the bladder, insert the end of the syringe into the moisture and pull upward on the projectile. The moisture will be drawn into the syringe. Then, insert the tip into the urethra, as described in the catheters.  Then, push the moisture with the projectile.
This moisture will reach the bladder in such a way that the patient feels it.  This is also a picture of a gentle syringe for injecting the bladder.
It is made of silver or lead. Its upper head resembles a small funnel, and below it is a groove to hold the cord. Then, you take a camel's bladder and put into it the moisture you want to inject into the bladder. Then, tie it tightly between the two grooves with a doubled thread.
And you warm that moisture a little over the fire. Then you insert the tip of the syringe into the urethra. Then firmly press down on the bladder with the moisture until the patient feels that the moisture has reached the bladder.
If you do not have a bladder, take a piece of thin material, make a circle out of it, and pierce it all around.  Then, insert a strong thread through those holes as they circle, then gather the circle together, like gathering a table after putting in it the moisture, oils, and water you want.
Then tie it to the apparatus and work with it as you worked with the bladder, pressing with your hand until the moisture reaches the bladder.
Chapter Sixty.
On removing stones.
We have previously discussed the types of stones and their treatment with medicine.  We have described the difference between stones originating in the kidneys and those in the bladder, and the signs of each. We have also discussed stones requiring manual removal and incision.
This is specifically the stone originating in the bladder, and that which develops in the urethra, and I will describe this with clear and concise explanation.
I say that stones originating in the bladder most often affect boys.  Among its signs is that the urine exits the bladder resembling thin water in its consistency.
Sand appears in it, he scratches and fiddles with his penis.  Often it hangs down, then spreads, and the anus protrudes in many of them.  It is easier to cure in boys up to fourteen years old.  It is harder in the elderly.  As for young men, it is intermediate between the two cases.
The larger the stone, the easier the treatment; the smaller the stone, the opposite is true.  If we turn to treatment, first the patient should be injected with an enema to remove all the waste in his intestines, for it may prevent the stone from being detected during examination.
Then the patient is taken by his feet and shaken downwards to cause the stone to descend into the neck of the bladder, or he jumps from a high place several times.  Then, you seat him upright before you with his hands beneath his thighs so that the entire bladder tilts downwards, and then you examine him.
And feel him from the outside. If you feel the stone in the space, immediately make an incision to reach it. If it doesn't come under your touch at all, you should smear your index finger with grease from your left hand if the patient is a boy, or your middle finger.
If he is a fully developed boy, insert it into his anus and search for the stone.  Once you locate it under your finger, slowly move it towards the neck of the bladder. Then press on it with your finger and push it out towards the area you want to incise.
You instruct a servant to squeeze the bladder with his hand, and another servant to stretch the labia upward with his right hand, and with his other hand to stretch the skin below the labia towards the site of the incision. Then take the lancet, the image of which is as follows:
Make the incision between the anus and the labia, not in the center but along the left side of the scrotum. The incision should be precisely over the stone, with your finger inside the anus, pushing the stone outward in an oblique manner, so that the incision is wide on the outside and narrow on the inside, as much as possible to facilitate the stone's removal.
Do not exert excessive force, for perhaps the finger in the anus will push the stone during the incision and it will come out without difficulty.  Be aware that some stones have corners and edges, making removal more difficult.
Some are smooth, resembling acorns and round, making removal easy; those with corners and edges require a slightly wider incision.  If removal is still not possible, one must devise a method to extract it, perhaps using a tightly gripped instrument with a rasp-like tip.
So that it grips the stone and does not slip from it, or introduce a gentle, curved instrument beneath it. If you cannot manage this, then enlarge the incision slightly. If you encounter significant bleeding, stop it with a cauterization tool.
If there are more than one stone, first push the largest one into the bladder opening, then make an incision over it, and afterward remove the smaller ones.  Do the same if there are more than two. If the stone is very large, it is unwise to make a large incision, for this could cause one of two things to happen to the patient.
Either death or permanent dribbling of urine, because the area will not heal.  However, try pushing it out, or devise a method to break it with forceps so that you may remove it in pieces.
Once you have finished your work, dress the wound with kender, sopor, shiyan, and strips, and place a wet cloth soaked in oil and a potion, or rose ointment and cold water over it to calm the hot swelling. Then, the patient should lie on their back, and do not loosen the bandage for three days.
Once it has softened, wash the area with plenty of water and oil, then treat it with the نخلي ointment and the basilikon ointment until it heals.  If excessive heat, swelling, or inflammation appears in the wound, or if blood clots in the bladder and urination is blocked, this is recognized by blood coming out with the urine.
Insert your finger into the wound and remove the blood, for if it remains, it will lead to the corruption and infection of the bladder. Then wash the wound with vinegar, water, and salt, and treat each type of condition with a corresponding treatment until it heals.
Throughout the treatment, it is necessary to bind the thighs together to keep the medications applied to the area in place.  If the stone is small and is in the urethra, causing swelling and blocking urination, treat it as described previously before it causes a tear.
Often, this treatment obviated the need for incision.  I have tried this method, which involves taking a curved iron instrument, with a form like this:
A triangular-pointed, sharp iron instrument is inserted into a stick.  Then, a thread is used to tie the penis below the stone so that it does not return to the bladder.  Then, the curved iron instrument is gently inserted into the urethra until it reaches the stone itself.
Rotate the instrument on the stone, slowly, until it pierces the stone from the other side.  Urine will then flow immediately.  Then, grasp the remaining part of the stone outside the penis.  It will break apart and be expelled with the urine, and the patient will be cured.
If this treatment is not possible due to an impediment, tie a thread below the stone and another above the stone.  Then, make an incision on the stone within the penis between the two threads and remove it.
Then, loosen the threads and clean the coagulated blood that has formed in the wound.  Tying the thread below the stone was necessary to prevent it from returning to the bladder, and the other thread above to ensure that, after the stone's removal, the skin returns to its place and covers the wound when the thread is loosened.
Therefore, when tying the upper thread, you should lift the skin upwards so that it returns to its place and covers the wound, as we said.
Chapter Sixty-one.
On removing stones in women.
Stones rarely develop in women. If one of them has a stone, its treatment is difficult and impossible for many reasons. One of them is that the woman might be a virgin, and the second that you will not find a woman who allows herself to be examined by a physician.
If she is chaste or from among women with close relatives, and thirdly, that you will not find a woman who excels in this craft, especially manual work. Fourth, the location of the incision on a stone in women is far from the location of the stone itself, requiring a deep incision.
In that case, there is danger. If necessity requires it, a skilled female physician should be sought, but these are rare. If none is available, seek a virtuous and compassionate male physician or bring in a skilled midwife or a woman knowledgeable in this practice to provide some guidance.
Bring her in and instruct her to perform all the examinations you order, first, to determine if the woman is a virgin.  If so, the finger should be inserted into her vagina to search for the stone.  If found, the stone should be pressed with the finger.
In that case, instruct her to perform the incision on it.  If she is not a virgin, but a married woman, instruct the midwife to insert her finger into the woman's vagina, search for the stone, and then place her left hand on the bladder, pressing it firmly.
If she finds it, the stone should be guided from the mouth of the bladder downward to the extent of her ability, until it reaches the root of the thigh.  Then she should make an incision over the halfway point of the vagina at the root of the thigh, whichever side feels the stone in that area.
Her finger must remain on the stone, pressing it.  Make the incision small at first. Then insert a probe into that small incision.  If she feels the stone, enlarge the incision as much as needed to remove the stone.  Know that there are many types of stones.
Among them are small and large, smooth and rough, long and round, and those with branches.  Know their types so that you may recognize what you want.  If blood overwhelms you, sprinkle powdered alum on the area and hold it for an hour until the bleeding stops. Then return to your work.
Until the stone is removed. Prepare the instruments mentioned for removing stones from men, to assist you in your work. If bleeding overwhelms you, and you know from the pulse that it is from a severed artery, place a styptic on the area.
Hold it tightly with the bandages, firmly. Leave it and do not return to it. Leave the stone; do not remove it.  For perhaps the patient will perish. Then treat the wound. When the severity of the blood subsides after a few days and the area becomes infected, return to your work until the stone is removed.
Chapter Sixty-Two.
In the fissure of the hydrocele.
A hydrocele is an accumulation of moisture in the white peritoneum, which lies under the scrotum surrounding the testicle.  It may also be in a special membrane naturally formed in one area of the testicle.
Until one might think it is another testicle. It is between the scrotum and the white peritoneum which we have mentioned. This rarely occurs. This hydrocele originates from weakness affecting the female.  This substance is deposited on the female.  It might also result from a blow to the female.
This moisture comes in various colours; it may be yellow, or bloody red, or dark-greyish black, or white like water. The white water type is the most common.  The signs by which it is recognized are...
Where the water accumulates, if it is in the white peritoneum mentioned, the swelling is somewhat elongated and round, like an egg. The testicle is not visible because the moisture surrounds it from all sides.
If the moisture is in a specific membrane, the swelling will be round on one side of the testicle.
This is why a person might imagine it is another testicle. If the moisture is between the scrotum and the white peritoneum, it is palpable.  To determine the colour of the moisture, probe the swelling with the square probe whose image was previously described.  Judge its contents by the substance that comes out on contact.
If we turn to treatment with leeches, the patient should be bled if possible and if their body appears full.  Then, they should lie on their back on a slightly raised surface with many cloths beneath them.  You should sit on their left side.
You should instruct a servant to sit on their right, extending the patient's penis to one side of the scrotum and towards the flank.  Then, take a broad scalpel and cut the scrotum lengthwise from the middle, towards the pubic area.
The incision should be straight, parallel to the line dividing the scrotum in half, until it reaches the white peritoneum.  Carefully dissect it, avoiding further cutting.  Focus your dissection on the side closest to the testicle and continue as far as possible.
Then, widely dissect the water-filled peritoneum and remove all the water.  Then, separate the edges of the incision with forceps, lift the peritoneum upward, avoiding contact with the scrotum, and cut the peritoneum as much as possible, either in one piece or in sections.
Especially its thin side; if you don't thoroughly cut it, you won't be sure that the water won't return.  If the testicle protrudes from its covering during your work, then, after emptying the peritoneum, put it back in place and stitch the edges of the scrotum together.
Then treat it like any other surgical wound until healed.  If the testicle has been damaged by another ailment, you should tie off the vessels in the suspensory ligament to prevent bleeding, then detach the testicle from the ligament and remove it.  Then treat it as we have described.
If the collected fluid is in both sides, know that it is a hydrocele in both.  Incise the other side in the same manner as the first.  If you prefer to do both at once, do so.  Then, clean away the blood.
Insert wool soaked in oil or rose oil into the incisions.  Put another layer of wool soaked in a mixture of liquid and oil over the testicles and the abdominal wall.  Place folded cloths, or bandages, on top. Tie it together from above using the six-sided bandage in this manner:
Then, take two cloths, stitch them together, and fill them with fluffy wool, like this example.  Make the ends to be tied from cotton or damp wool, and secure them tightly with a belt around the waist. One end will be placed over the buttocks and toward the back.
The other end goes towards the pubic area and the other two ends go down the thighs.  The remaining two ends are placed on the hips.  Tie all of the ends together with a belt around the waist.  This hydrocele may also be treated by cauterization instead of incision with a knife.
This involves taking a gentle, heated, knife-like cautery iron to cut through the scrotal skin, exposing the white membrane containing the water. Take another cautery iron in this shape:
It resembles a Greek eye, then cauterize that membrane while it is hot until all the moisture is released.  Then, pull the membrane with forceps and scrape off the containing layer using the cautery iron, cutting it as much as possible until all of it is removed, and do not burn the testicle.
Know that this method is safer and less likely to cause bleeding, and better than incision.  If, during the incision or cauterization, you encounter a hot tumor, bleeding, or anything else, you should treat each difficulty with the appropriate remedy as described above.
If the patient is cowardly and cannot endure this procedure because of its unpleasantness, use cauterization as described; if it proves effective in accordance with the signs presented previously.
If the discharge is watery, the patient should sit on a high chair, and then cauterize the tumor below with a wide probe.  Make the cauterization lengthwise along the body, and make the opening wide enough for all the water to drain out.  Then apply cotton to the area and bandage it.
Allow the remaining water to drain, then treat it until the wound heals. If the water does not drain during cauterization, it is because the white membrane obstructs the opening of the wound, preventing the water from exiting.
In that case, you should insert a goose feather, or the instrument used to extract the water of the affected area, whose image was previously shown, or slightly enlarge the wound opening.
Know that water may return and accumulate after six months or so. If it does, cauterize it in the same way, and the patient should rest for those days.
Chapter Sixty-three.
On the tearing of fleshy tissue and its treatment.
Know that tearing of these fleshy tissues is often a perilous condition leading to death. Therefore, we recommend leaving them alone and avoiding them. I will now discuss the treatments and types of tumors in these cases.
I say that many tumors may occur in the bodies formed by the union of two parts. This occurs for many reasons, either due to excessive heat flowing to the two parts, or due to blows. The tumor's color is like the color of the body, and it does not contain water.
The tumor is firm, and it might be stony, the color of mud, and without sensation. It might be from the entanglement and swelling of the arteries, as previously mentioned, or from the swelling of the veins. If it is from the swelling of the arteries, this is recognized by the dispersion of the tumor.
If you press it with your fingers, it should not be treated at all. However, if it is from the swelling of the veins, nothing will disperse when pressed with the fingers. This type can tear, and tear through the rest of the flesh.
One should cut the scrotum's skin, then pull the testicle upward, remove it from the white peritoneum, and free the appendices from the vessels.  Tie the vessels and cut the appendix after removing it from all sides of the testicle. If the testicle has adhered to the growing tissues.
Then, the testicle should be removed and cut. If the adhesion is between parts of the peritoneum or between vessels, then all of this adhesion should be freed and cut in a circular fashion.
If the flesh growth is in the area of adhesion, which is behind, then all of it should be cut and the testicle removed, as we said. Once your work is done, dress the wound with moist wool, rose-oil and drink, then treat it with other remedies until it heals.
The Sixty-fourth Chapter.
On the treatment of dropsy with dropsy.
Dropsy is a swelling twisted and knotted, resembling a bunch of grapes, with relaxation of the limbs.  It hinders the afflicted person's movement, exercise, and walking. In treating this condition, the remedy is similar to what was previously mentioned.
However, one must follow the methods of the ancients.  I say that the afflicted person should sit on a high stool, then pull the limbs downwards, then grasp the scrotum with your fingers, near the vessels close to the penis.
A servant of yours should hold it and stretch it forcefully.  Then, with a broad, sharp scalpel, make an oblique incision next to the vessels until the vessels are exposed.  Then, dissect from all sides as I described to you in dissecting the arteries in the temples.  Then, insert a needle with a double thread into them.
Tie it at the first points where the dropsy appeared, and also at the last.  Then, slit it in the middle with a vertical incision along the body, and remove the accumulated foul and corrupt moisture.
Then treat the wound like other wounds that require time to heal so the vessels that nourish the limb fall away.  This is acceptable. If the dropsy has affected all the vessels, then the limb, including the vessels, must be removed so that the testicle does not lose its nourishment. Otherwise, the vessels will be cut, it will wilt, and no use can be derived from it.
Chapter Sixty-five.
On the treatment of intestinal dropsy.
This dropsy occurs when a rupture appears in the peritoneum extending over the abdomen, near the groin, causing the intestines to protrude into one of the testicles.
This hernia is either from a rupture in the peritoneum or from its extension. These two types occur due to many causes, such as a blow, a leap, a scream, or lifting a heavy object, and the like.  If it is from an extension of the peritoneum, it will develop gradually over a long period.
It does not occur suddenly.  The swelling is flat, extending inward because the peritoneum compresses the intestines.  If it is from a rupture in the peritoneum, it is initially accompanied by intense pain, and the swelling is clearly different beneath the skin nearby.
This is due to the intestines protruding out of the peritoneum.  Pus may also exit with the intestines, making this dropsy intestinal and purulent, and it may also be accompanied by wind.  Mucus may also run into the intestines and become trapped there, causing the patient's demise.
Because it causes intense pain and gurgling, especially when pressed.  Treating these types of ailments with iron is dangerous; therefore, one must avoid it.  The procedure is to tell the patient to push the intestines back into their abdomen with their hand, if possible to return.
Then, he lies on his back with you at his side, and his legs are raised.  Then, the skin around the groin is pulled upward and the entire skin of the scrotum is slit lengthwise.  Then, hooks are inserted into the edges of the slit, as much as needed to open the slit.
The slit should be large enough to allow the testicle to come out.  Then, the peritoneum beneath the scrotal skin is stripped away until the white, tough peritoneum is exposed on all sides.  Then, insert your index finger into the area next to the testicle.
Between the white peritoneum beneath the testicular skin and the second peritoneum, release the adhesions behind the testicle.  Then, with the right hand, pull inward on the scrotal skin, while with the left hand, pull the white peritoneum upward and lift the testicle with the peritoneum toward the slit.
You instruct the attendant to pull the testicle upward, and you completely release the adhesions behind it.  Examine with your finger to make sure there is no twisted bowel within the tough white peritoneum.  If you find any, push it back into the abdomen below.
Then, take a needle with a thick thread, twisted from ten strands, and insert it at the edge of the peritoneum beneath the scrotal skin near the slit.  Then, cut the ends of the thread until there are four strands. Then, interweave some strands together in a firm manner and tie the peritoneum, which we said was beneath the scrotal skin, tightly on both sides.  Then, also wrap the ends of the threads and tie them tightly, so that nothing of the vessels nourishing it can reach it. So that a hot tumor does not arise from this, and also make a second ligature outside the first ligature, a distance of less than two fingers. After these two ligatures, leave a portion of the peritoneum beneath the scrotal skin the size of a finger.
So that a hot tumor does not arise from this, and also make a second ligature outside the first ligature, a distance of less than two fingers. After these two ligatures, leave a portion of the peritoneum beneath the scrotal skin the size of a finger. Cut the rest of it entirely around, and remove the testicle with it.  Then, make an incision below the scrotal skin, one that bleeds and discharges as described previously. Then, use wool soaked in oil and place it in the wound, and use the ligature that we described.
The white peritoneum, which we mentioned after cutting it, may be cauterized cautiously to prevent bleeding, as this often occurs. Leave the ligature until it falls off on its own; if it is slow to fall off, soak it in hot water and apply something to cause perspiration, so that it falls off.
Then treat the wound with all other surgical treatments until it heals.
Chapter Sixty-six.
In this type of gaseous colic, I have seen no one dare treat it with iron.  The ancients described making it as we described for colic with a pouch, by tying the vessels gently below the incision.
Then it is incised in the center, and the swelling is treated to open it, so that the vessels fall out.  The wound is treated as we mentioned until it heals.
Chapter Seventy-six.
In the hernia that occurs in the groin.
The hernia in the groin may appear as we said, bulging the area but not dragging any intestines down into the scrotum.  If it does descend, it is slight and always returns.
However, if time passes, the tear in the peritoneum increases, so that the intestines and omentum descend into the scrotum. This is a result of the peritoneum's extension in the groin, as we said. This is because the peritoneum extends, then relaxes and bulges the area, and its treatment is by cauterization, as previously described.
And it may be treated with a cautery as follows: the patient lies on their back before you, then you cut the swollen bulging hernia with a transverse cut about the width of three fingers, then you cauterize the peritoneum under the skin.
Until the white peritoneum beneath is exposed. Then you take a thread, place it on the protruding area of the peritoneum, and press it deep into the abdomen.  Then you stitch the two protruding points on the thread of peritoneum, and sew one to the other.
Then pull out the thread, and do not cut the peritoneum at all, nor touch the testicle or anything else, as I instructed you in treating intestinal hernia. Then treat it with the treatment for surgery.
If the threads are severed, cleanse and close the wound until it heals, for the peritoneum contracts and the hernia bulge does not increase.
And this method is the best in this situation, because it is closer to safety.
Chapter Sixty-Eight.
On the relaxation of the scrotum.
The scrotum often relaxes in some people without the underlying tissues relaxing, making its appearance unsightly.  Therefore, those wishing to treat it should lay the patient on their back.
Cut all the relaxed skin away from the tough skin, then bring the edges together.  If you prefer, first stitch the excess relaxed skin with three or four stitches, secure the stitches, then cut between the stitches.
Then treat it with the usual treatment for other surgical wounds until it heals and the stitches fall out.
Chapter sixty-nine.
On castration.
Castration is forbidden in our religion.
For this reason, I should not mention it in this book, but I have mentioned it for two reasons: one, so that it will be part of the physician's knowledge if questioned about it, and to understand the treatment of those who have suffered from it; and the other, because we often need to castrate certain animals for our own benefit.
Like sheep, oxen, and cats, and similar animals, I say that castration can be done in two ways: either by crushing or by cutting and dividing. The method by crushing involves placing the animal in hot water until its testicles relax, soften and hang down.
Then you crush them with your hand until they dissolve and are no longer distinct to the touch.  As for castration by cutting and dividing, one must hold the animal and use the left hand to squeeze the skin of its testicles, then tie the suspensory ligaments and cut each testicle once.
Until the testicles are exposed, then cut them, after removing the coverings, leaving no peritoneum except the thin membrane covering the vessels.  This method of castration is better than that by crushing.
For crushing might leave some of the testicles, causing the animal to desire mating.  Then treat the wound until it heals.
Seventy-first Chapter.
On the treatment of hermaphrodites.
Hermaphrodites in men come in two types. One appears as a space or a patch of skin between the testicles resembling a woman's vulva, with hair, and urine may flow from that patch of skin.
In women, there is only one type, located above the vulva on the pubis, like small, protruding man's testicles. One of them is like a man's penis, and both together resemble the female parts. Treatment for all three types.
In the two types of males and the one type of females, the excess flesh must be cut away until the mark disappears, then treated with other surgical procedures until healed.  However, in the second type of male from whom urine flows from the skin of the testicles, there is no work to be done and no cure at all.
Chapter Seventy-one.
On cutting the penis and protruding flesh from the vulva of women.
The clitoris may increase in size beyond the natural state, becoming discoloured and unattractive.  In some women, it may enlarge to the point of resembling a penis, and making intercourse possible.
One should hold the excess clitoris with one's hand or forceps and cut it, without excessive cutting, especially not deep into the root, lest it cause bleeding.
Then treat it with surgical remedies until it heals.  As for the growing flesh, it is flesh that grows in the vaginal opening until it fills it.
And it may protrude outwards, resembling a tail. Therefore, some of the ancients called it the "tail disease".  It should be cut, like the clitoris, and treated until it heals.
Chapter Seventy-two.
Concerning the treatment of prolapse.
Prolapse is when a woman's vulva is not perforated or the perforation is small, either naturally occurring at birth or accidentally.  The accidental type arises from a prior condition and may be from excess overgrown flesh.
Or from thin or thick peritoneum, located either deep within the uterus, or along its sides, or at the top or bottom. It prevents intercourse, childbirth, and possibly menstruation.  A midwife can diagnose this by observation.
If the obstruction is visible and close, but if not visible, she should investigate with her fingers or a probe. If the obstruction is from thin peritoneum and close to the labia, then proceed to pierce it by forming folds on the labia, and then place your thumbs of both hands on them.
And the woman should be on her back, with her legs spread. Then, forcefully spread the labia until the thin peritoneum is pierced and the obstruction opens.  Then, take wool, soak it in oil, and apply it to the area. Have intercourse with the woman daily to prevent the area from closing up again.
If the peritoneum is thick and dense, then it should be cut with a wide scalpel resembling a thin, flat blade. If the obstruction is from overgrown flesh, then use forceps to lift it and cut it.  Have with you medications to stop bleeding without cauterization, such as qaqia, shiyan, and frankincense mixed with egg white.
Then use a wide lead tube so that the wound does not heal quickly. Hold it for days, and use a thread of dry linen. Then treat it with the general treatment for abscesses until it heals.  Another growth of flesh may appear in the uterus, and it should be cut in the same way.
Unless it is a cancerous tumor, the cancerous tumor that is in the uterus should not be treated with iron at all.
Chapter Seventy-three.
On the treatment of hemorrhoids, warts, and red pustules that appear in the vulva of women.
Hemorrhoids are the swelling of the veins' openings, causing a constant flow of copious blood.  When hemorrhoids progress, they become warts.  Their types and signs have been discussed in the classification, and we will describe them here.
Regarding which hemorrhoids and warts respond to treatment and which do not, I say that if hemorrhoids and warts are deep within the uterus and do not present themselves to touch, then there is no iron-based treatment for them.  Those that are on the mouth of the uterus and are perceptible to touch are the ones that are treated.
The woman should enter a cool room, then the warts should be scraped with a lancet or a rough cloth and cut from their roots.  After bleeding from one of the blood-stopping devices,  apply [something] without causing a prick.
Like acacia, dates, frankincense, and similar things. Then raise her legs to the wall for an hour, then lower them into cold water. If the bleeding continues, seat her in a decoction of sumac, pomegranate peels, and gallnuts, etc. Then take barley flour, knead it with honey and vinegar.
Apply it as a poultice to her back. If the bleeding stops, then cease. Otherwise, apply leeches to the back, breasts, and chest, without restriction. Then take wool, dip it in the juice of turpentine, or the juice of comfrey, or the juice of the branches of elder, with gallnut drink, and apply it to the area.
If the swelling subsides, treat the area with ointment until it heals.  As for the red sore, it resembles the heads of warts, rough in appearance; it should be cut as much as possible as described for warts and treated until it heals.
Chapter seventy-four.
Concerning the treatment of abscesses occurring in the uterus.
Many types of tumors, such as cancer, hard tumors, ulcers, wasting diseases, consuming diseases, polyps, hemorrhoids, fissures, warts, and hot tumors, may occur in the uterus.  All of these diseases and their types and symptoms have been discussed in the classification.
Therefore, in this treatise, we must describe the hot tumor in the uterus, if it is a tumor that has accumulated for a period.  How should it be treated with iron?  One should observe; if the tumor's pain is severe at the beginning, accompanied by throbbing, inflammation, and fever...
And if you see it red, and if touching it causes pain, do not hasten to treat it with iron.  Treat it with methods that promote maturation.  Once these symptoms subside, then the woman should sit on a stool with two seats, leaning back.
And she should draw her legs towards the lower abdomen, with her thighs spread apart, and her arms placed below her knees, tied together with an appropriate bandage.
Then, the midwife should sit on the right side and use the instrument for opening the cervix, the image of which will be shown later.  When using this instrument, one must estimate the depth of the woman's uterus, so that what enters the instrument does not exceed the depth of the uterus.
Otherwise, the patient will be harmed. If the instrument is deeper than the uterus, a piece should be placed on the edge of the cervix to prevent the entire instrument from entering the uterine cavity. The spiral that runs within the instrument should be positioned from above.
While you hold the instrument, the attendant rotates the spiral until the cervix opens.  If the abscess is visible and soft when touched, it should be incised at its head with a wide scalpel.  Once all the matter has been discharged.
A soft wick soaked in rose oil or green oil with some astringent should be placed in the wound. The wick should be placed externally from the incision in the cervix, and pure wool soaked in boiled baker's water should be placed externally on the uterus and pubis.
Then, it should be treated with the appropriate ointment for two days until healed.
The uterus and wound may be washed by injecting water and honey, then water boiled with the root of wormwood or long-leaved wormwood.  Then return to the ointment.  This is if the abscess is hidden inside the uterus.
Iron should not be used for treatment; instead, the treatment should be as described in the division.
Chapter seventy-five.
On instructing midwives on how to treat living fetuses that emerge in an unnatural form.
The midwife must first know the normal form of childbirth.  Signs include the woman moving downwards, desiring to smell the air, and finding the afterbirth less burdensome.
And if the fetus emerges quickly, know that this is normal childbirth, with the head leading and the placenta either present or hanging from the umbilical cord. If you see these signs, then you should press her abdomen so that the fetus is expelled quickly.
If the head descends, the placenta will descend with it, and it is cleaned well of such impurities. Any birth other than this is abnormal and reprehensible, as the fetus may emerge on its feet, with its hands or feet emerging before the head.
And one hand or one foot, or its head and hand, or it emerges folded, or perhaps turned upside down, and similar abnormal forms.  The midwife should be skilled and gentle with all these things and avoid mistakes.
And I am describing each of these forms and how to handle each.  If the fetus emerges head-first, the normal way, and the delivery is difficult and painful for the woman, and you see her strength weakening, then have her sit on a chair and order women to hold her.
And bind her uterus with boiled rue and moist ointments.  Then the midwife should insert a small scalpel between her fingers to cut the placenta, or cut it with her fingernail, until the moisture within flows out. Press the woman's abdomen until the fetus descends.
If it does not descend, the woman should be injected with rue juice and sherj ointment.  Then, after the injection, she should be made to cough and be sneezed at with a kunds.  Hold her mouth and nose, and the fetus will emerge shortly. If the fetus's hands emerge first, gently return them slowly.
If the hands do not enter, place the woman on a raised platform and raise her legs. Shake the platform on the ground, and the woman holds on so as not to fall during the shaking. If the hands do not enter and the fetus dies, cut them off and pull out the rest of the fetus.
Or tie his hands with a cloth and pull them gently, and it will emerge.  If the fetus emerges on its feet, push its feet upwards, then turn the fetus slowly until it is aligned, then take one of its feet and extend it slowly.
If they emerge to the thighs, instruct her to cough and sneeze her with a kunds, and it will emerge. If it does not emerge as described, gently return the fetus bit by bit until it is in its natural form. It will then emerge smoothly. If it resists all the methods described.
Take juice of hyssop, rue juice, sherj ointment, and dissolved myrrh.  Grind all well in a mortar.  Then apply this to the woman's vagina and lower abdomen.  Then seat her in lukewarm water until it reaches the sharafs.
If you see that it has softened below, make her a pessary of myrrh and have her tolerate it. If she holds the pessary for an hour, seat her on a chair, then sneeze her, and close her mouth and nose, and gently squeeze her lower abdomen.  The fetus will emerge at once.  If the fetus emerges on its knees and hands...
If it emerges in this way, gently insert your hands bit by bit.  Then, have the woman lie on her back, her pelvis hanging downwards as she lies on a bed, and have her hold her hands together.  Then, gently press on her upper abdomen. Then remove the pillows from beneath her legs so that her lower body is supported. If the fetus does not emerge, grasp both her legs and move them vigorously.  Then press on the sharafs gradually until the fetus ascends. Then, the midwife inserts her hand and shapes the fetus gradually.
And instruct the woman to strain until the fetus emerges.  The fetus emerges transversely, with one arm hanging down.  Try to straighten the arm. If unable to straighten it, make the woman stand and have her walk. If she cannot walk, have her lie down.
Shake her legs vigorously. Then use the poultice made of saliva that I described. If a discharge occurs, seat her on a chair. Then work to straighten the arm and shape the fetus into its natural form. Make the woman sneeze and instruct her to strain until it emerges.
If the fetus emerges on its back, arms outstretched, and face towards its mother's back, the midwife should grasp the fetus's arm and gently turn and straighten it. Once straightened, apply the grease and saliva as described previously to its forehead.
Then instruct her to move slowly.  When she does, seat her on a chair and instruct her to lean to the right side. Then, instruct her to strain, and make her sneeze with the kands.  The fetus will emerge, positioned upright on its side.
If the fetus descends into the cervix with the placenta in this manner, slit the placenta with your fingernail to release the moisture. If it is attached to the fetus's face or neck, cut it from the umbilical cord so that it doesn't suffocate and die.  Then push the fetus inside until it is in the proper position.
Tell the woman to strain repeatedly; this will cause easy delivery.  Concerning the birth of twins or multiple fetuses, know that twins often are born, and three or four may be born and survive, but this is rare.  Five is unnatural and will not survive at all.
And if they are numerous, they are enclosed by one placenta.  A partition separates them, attached to the umbilical cord of each.  They may emerge like a single fetus, easily and naturally, or they may emerge in a manner described as abnormal.
If some of them present difficulties during delivery, and become in any of the abnormal forms mentioned, treat them as described.  Let the midwife be gentle, act with care and patience, and use any means at her disposal to achieve safety.
Fetuses that form within the womb and then miscarry may number one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, or more than ten.  I have heard reports of a woman who miscarried seven and another who miscarried fifteen, all of whom had formed within the womb.
By the estimation of the all-knowing and all-powerful, all this should be within the knowledge of the midwife, for such a case might occur to her one day, and she should be prepared to address it properly.
Chapter Sixty-Seven.
In the removal of the dead fetus.
If you have treated the dead fetus with the methods of treatment described in the division and it does not come out, and your actions necessitate manual intervention, then you must consider the following. If the woman is strong and has no symptoms that raise concern for her well-being or risk of harm, the woman should lie on her back on a bed.
Her head should be tilted downward, and her legs raised. A servant should hold her from both sides or tie her to the bed to prevent her body from moving when the fetus is being pulled out.
Then, moisten the mouth of her uterus with moist ointments, along with the saliva of a *khatmi* plant, and fenugreek and flax seeds.  The midwife should then anoint her hand with these ointments and saliva.  Then gently insert it into the uterus.  She should then locate a place to insert the hooks in the fetus and the appropriate locations for this.
If the fetus is positioned to descend head-first, insert the hooks into its eyes, nape of the neck, mouth, palate, under the chin, collarbone, near the ribs, or under the collarbones.
If it is descending feet-first, then in the pubic area and the middle ribs.  The hook should be held in the right hand, its curve placed between the fingers of the left hand.  The hand should be inserted gently and the hook inserted into one of those locations mentioned.
Until it reaches an empty space.  Then, insert another or a third hook if needed to ensure the pull is even and not biased towards one side.  Then, the pull should be steady and even, and not merely in a straight line, but moved in all directions.
So that it is easy to remove, as is done with a tooth when extracting it.  Between these actions, the pull should be relaxed. If it is stuck in one direction, the midwife should anoint some fingers with ointment and insert them to turn what is stuck.  If some part of the fetus comes out, the hooks should be moved to other locations.
She should do this a little higher, until the entire fetus is removed. If a hand comes out before the rest and cannot be pushed back due to compression, then a cloth should be wrapped around it, and it should be pulled until the whole hand is out, then it should be cut.
Either at the wrist joint or the elbow.  The same should be done for the other hand and the feet. If the fetal head is large and faces pressure during delivery or has accumulated water in its head, then a pointed lancet should be inserted between the fingers.
Using it, the head is opened to release the water, or it is squeezed with the instrument called a *mashdakh*, which is shown with other instruments in the chapter following this one.
Likewise, if the fetus has a large head naturally, the skull should be opened or squeezed with the *mashdakh*, as we said, then the bones should be extracted with forceps. If the head comes out and is compressed at the collarbone, the chest should be opened to release the moisture within.
Then the chest will contract. If the chest does not contract and the delivery is not possible, cut as much as you can. If the lower abdomen is swollen or contains tumors, it should be incised to allow the moisture to drain.
If the fetus is on its feet, pulling it and positioning it towards the opening of the uterus is easy. If it is compressed against the abdomen or chest, it should be pulled with a cloth wrapped around your hand, and the abdomen or chest should be opened to drain what is inside.
If all other organs are removed and the head is retracted and stuck, the midwife should insert her left hand. If the opening of the uterus is open, insert the hand into the cervix, locate the head, and pull it with the fingers towards the opening of the uterus. Then insert a hook or two hooks and pull it out with them.
If the opening of the uterus has contracted due to a hot swelling, it should not be forced. Instead, moist, oily substances should be applied, compresses used, and the patient should sit in relaxing, moist water.
If the fetus is on its side, if possible, it should be positioned as described for a living fetus. If this is not possible, it should be cut and removed.  Nothing of the placenta should be left inside at all.  Once you are finished with your treatment, use the remedies mentioned for hot tumors that occur in the uterus.
If bleeding occurs, she should descend into constricting water and use other treatments. I have observed a woman who conceived, and the fetus died within her, and then she conceived again after that.
Then the other fetus also died.  After a long time, a tumor appeared on her vulva and swelled until it opened, discharging pus. I was called to treat her and treated her for a long time.  The wound did not close, so I applied some potent, drawing ointments to it.
Then a bone came out of the area, and after several days another bone came out.  I was astonished by this, as the abdomen is not a place where bones are found.  I reasoned that these were bones from the dead fetus.  I probed the wound and removed many bones from the skull of the fetus.
I continued this process until I removed many bones, and the woman was in the best of health.  She lived like that for a long time, with a small amount of pus discharging from the area.  I have presented this rare case here.
Because it contains knowledge and assistance for what the skilled physician attempts to achieve through his hands in treatment.
Chapter Seventy-Seven.
It contains images of the instruments needed for removing the fetus.
Image of a spiral for opening the cervix.
This binding, by which books are sewn together, has two spirals at the ends of the wooden boards.  However, this spiral should be finer than the binding, and made either from ebony or boxwood. The width of each board should be two fingerbreadths.
Their width is approximately one finger, and their length one and a half spans. In the middle of the boards, there are two pegs made of the same wood, secured to them.  Their length is half a span, or slightly more, and their width approximately two fingers, or slightly more.  These two pegs.
They are the ones that enter the cervix to open it when you rotate the spirals.  Image of another similar instrument, finer and lighter.
Made of ebony or boxwood, shaped like tongs, but with two pegs at each end, as you see. The length of each peg is about a span, and the width two fingers.  If you wish to open the cervix with it...
Place the woman on a bed, with her legs spread apart. Then insert these two pegs, pointed, into the cervix.  Hold the end of the instrument between her legs, below, then open your hand with the instrument, as you would with tongs, to whatever extent you want to open the cervix. So that the midwife may achieve her goal. Image of another spiral mentioned by the ancients.
Image of the instrument used to expel the fetus.
Image of the instrument used to crush the fetal head.
It resembles scissors, with teeth at the end, as you see.  It can also be made rectangular, like tongs, in this image, as you see. It has teeth like saw teeth, with which to cut and sever.
Image of a device as well.
Image of a hook.
This hook should have a little thickness so that it does not break when pulling the fetus with it.  Image of a two-pronged hook.
Image of two wide scalpels for cutting the fetus.
All these tools, the more types there are and the more prepared they are by the craftsman, the quicker his work and the higher his reputation among people.  Do not scorn any tool for being in your possession, as you may need it.
Chapter seventy-eight.
In the removal of the placenta.
If the placenta is retained after childbirth, you should instruct the woman to hold herself, then make her sneeze with a cupping instrument, and press your hand on her mouth and nostrils.  If it comes out this way, do so; otherwise, use a certain amount [of another method].
Pierce a hole in the cover, place herbs that open the cervix in it, such as fumitory, dill, fennel, chamomile, rue, and agrimony, all or some of these.  Soak them in water, place on the fire, and then put a silver tube on the hole in the cover's lid, and the other end in the cervix.
Hold it until the steam reaches the bottom of the uterus, then make her sneeze as we said; the placenta will then come out quickly.  If it remains after this treatment and does not come out, instruct the midwife to immerse her left hand in the fat of a shrew or the saliva of a viper.
Then, she should insert it into the vagina and search for the placenta. If she finds it, she should grasp it and pull it out slowly, little by little. If it is stuck deep inside the uterus, insert the hand as described until, when she finds the placenta, she gently pulls it out little by little.
So that the uterus does not fall with excessive pulling, but rather it should be gently moved to the sides, right and left, and then the pulling should be increased in amount.  Then it will yield and free itself from adhesion.  If the cervix is closed, we have described the treatment with sneezing, the pot treatment, and herbs.
If it does not come out with all the methods we described, then be careful not to use force when pulling it again.  Instead, tie what has come out of it to the woman's thigh, then inject her with the four-part ointment, as it will cause it to decay after a few days.
It will dissolve and come out, but if it rots, a foul odor will rise from it to the stomach and head, and this will harm the patient.  Therefore, the appropriate incense should be used.
Therefore, some of the ancients tried the incense of the wood and dried figs, an image of the device used to fumigate the woman when menses and placenta are retained, and similar cases.
It is made of lead, resembling a funnel, or made of copper.  The narrow end is placed in the vagina and the wide end over the fire.  The incense is placed on the embers; it is held until the incense is gone and then another is replaced.
Chapter Seventy-nine.
In the treatment of the unperforated anus.
Many boys are born with unperforated anuses, often blocked by a thin membrane.  The midwife should pierce this membrane with her finger, or, failing that, incise it with a sharp scalpel, being careful not to touch the muscle.
Then, place wool soaked in wine and oil on it, and treat it with ointments until it heals.  If you fear it will close again, place a lead tube in the opening for many days, and remove it when the child wishes to defecate.
A blockage of the anus may also arise from a wound abscess or tumor.  One must incise this abscess and then treat it with the remedies mentioned, and with cauterization.
Eighty-third chapter.
On the treatment of warts that appear on the lower part of the body.
Warts that appear on the lower part are a thickening and hardening that occurs near the anus, either externally or in a space on one side.  There may be one or more warts.
If this thickening persists, it may open and discharge a whitish watery fluid or thin pus.  Some of these warts may penetrate into the rectum and intestines; others may not.  Penetrated warts may be identified by what is expelled with stool and flatulence when using the enema.
And possibly worms may be expelled from them.  Some warts, if in a space, may penetrate into the bladder and urethra.  Some may also penetrate into the hip joint and the tailbone.  The penetrated wart that is in the rectum is also distinguishable from one that isn't.
Insert your index finger into the rectum and introduce a thin probe of copper or iron into the wart. If there is no deviation in the wart, do so. If there is a deviation, insert a thin lead probe or a horsehair.
Until you feel the probe or hair in your finger. If you feel nothing at all, and no stool, flatulence, or worms emerge from the opening, as we have said, know that it is not penetrated.  Proceed with treatment.
If the wart penetrates the bladder or urethra, its sign is the discharge of urine from it and the inability of the affected area to heal with medication.  If it penetrates the hip joint or tailbone, the sign is the probe's reaching it.
If there is no deviation toward the bone, and pain is present in the area, and pus constantly drains from it, and no treatment is effective and it does not heal with ointment, then these penetrated warts have no cure.
Treatment is futile for those ignorant physicians who attempt it.  As for those that are not penetrated and are not chronic, healing is anticipated by cauterization, as I describe and have tested.  The patient should lie on their back before you.
Raise the patient's legs, and tilt their thighs towards their abdomen. Then, if the wart has a deviation, insert the copper or lead probe until you know where the probe ends.  If the patient feels it near the buttock, you should then insert your index finger into the buttock.
If you feel the probe has penetrated your finger itself, clearly exposed without feeling any membrane or flesh between your finger and the probe, then know for certain that it is penetrated.  Do not exhaust yourself on it, as there is no cure for it, as we said.
They say that it heals in some individuals rarely.  A useful treatment is to heat a thin cautery iron according to the size of the wart, as mentioned before, and insert it into the wart until it reaches the vicinity of the buttock. Then repeat this two or three times.
So that you know that all the excess, hardened flesh, resembling a bird's feather tube, has been burned. Then treat it with a thread soaked in clarified butter until the burned flesh comes out, then treat it with healing ointments.  If he heals.
Otherwise, it will never heal with any other treatment.  If you insert the probe and it does not reach your finger in the buttock, and there is a thick layer of flesh or membrane between it and the probe, and you see the wart just below the skin's surface, then cut the skin from the beginning of the wart. As you are passing through the incision with the probe inside the wart, continue the incision until you reach where the tip of the probe ends. The probe will be released and fall out. Then clean away the hardened flesh, resembling a bird's feather tube, leaving nothing of it behind.
Then treat it with healing ointments until it heals. If bleeding hinders your work in cutting away that flesh, the best and quickest remedy is to cauterize it with fire or a sharp remedy, because cauterization with fire combines two beneficial effects: burning away the excess flesh.
And cut away the blood and dry the moisture. Then treat it with a thread soaked in clarified butter or pulverized sulfur mixed with oil until the area becomes suppurative and the burned flesh comes out in the pus. Then treat the wound with healing ointments that promote the growth of firm flesh.
These are the remedies that have a binding and drying effect. If it is healed, it is cured, and there is no need to return.  If the wart extends deep into the buttock and is far from the surface of the body, then insert your finger into the buttock and search with it.
If you feel the probe, and between you and it there is a barrier of peritoneum or flesh, and it is close to penetration, then the only action is through hope and anticipation.  This means you should use one of three approaches: either cauterize it, as we said.
Or else, you should slit it until you reach its bottom to be able to insert the thread and treatment from close proximity.  Do not proceed with the slitting excessively, so as not to cut the muscle surrounding the buttock, causing involuntary bowel movements in the afflicted person. Then treat it as previously described. Perhaps it will heal as we said.
Or else, you penetrate that barrier and pierce it after you have slit it close to the buttock, as we said, either with a probe or another sharp instrument. Then thoroughly clean all the congested flesh in the slit to the best of your ability.
Then close the entire wound, including the slit and the upper opening, until it is sealed, and the wart remains open inside the buttock. This will be less painful for the patient.  The wart may heal in this way.
If, when inserting the probe into the wart, it is located on the side of the buttock near the surface of the body, along with the skin and the rim of the buttock, then use a probe with a pierced tip, like a cobbler's awl, in this manner:
And thread a twisted thread of five threads, or thereabouts, through it.  Then insert the probe with the thread into the wart until you reach its bottom. If it is perforated in the edge of the buttock from the inside, close by.
Then remove the thread from that hole by inserting your finger into the buttock and pulling out the end of the thread. Bring both ends together and tie them tightly. Leave it for a day or two.  Whenever the thread cuts into the flesh, tighten it well until the flesh between the ends of the threads breaks and falls off. Then treat the wound until it heals and is cured.
If the opening of the wart is not perforated, perforate it as best you can, but not if it is deep within.  Do not do this because of the muscle, lest you cut it. Then do with it as we mentioned until it heals.
The image of the pointed lancet, with which you cut the warts, should have a very sharp bend on one side and a blunt side on the other, so as not to cut what is unnecessary, as you see.
Chapter Eighty-one.
Concerning hemorrhoids that bleed, their excision, and the treatment of fissures.
Hemorrhoids come in two types: either they are within the anus, resembling red inflated sacs or like grapes, and are sometimes small and sometimes large, and blood constantly flows from them.
They may be single or multiple, and can also be found outside the anus, on its edges. However, those outside the anus are often less moist, flowing with yellow water or a little blood intermittently.  They are the color of the body.
The treatment for those inside the anus is to instruct the patient to defecate and strain until the anus is stretched and the small growths appear.  Quickly, grasp them with forceps or your fingernail, then cut them off at their base; if the forceps do not hold them well because of their moisture and looseness,
Then grip it with a rough cloth or a piece of sharpened wood, or pull it out with your fingers, then cut it, and after cutting, sprinkle sharp powders over it to act as cauterization, or cauterize it as described in the chapter on cauterization.
Then treat it with other remedies until it heals. If the anus does not come out, inject the patient with an enema containing a little irritant to wash what is in the anus and encourage it to come out quickly when the patient strains.  As for the growths outside the anus, their treatment is easy and simple.
To remove it, grasp it with your fingernail or forceps, and cut it off.  Then treat it as previously mentioned until it heals.  If one dislikes cutting with iron, one should use a needle.  Take a twisted thread and insert it into a needle.
Then pull the wart upward and pierce it with the needle at its base on the other side. Wrap the ends of the thread under the needle, which is positioned across it, and pull the wart firmly. Tie the thread and remove the needle.  Do this for all the warts, leaving one that is not pierced.
To cause blood to flow from it, then place a cloth soaked in rose oil or cumin oil on the anus, and instruct the patient to remain still.  Then leave it until the warts fall off. If the warts fall off, treat them with ointments and other remedies until they heal.
Concerning the treatment of fissures, they frequently arise from dryness, and constipation.  If they persist and are not helped by medication, it is necessary to scrape them with a scalpel or your fingernail until they become moist, and the upper crust that prevents their healing is removed.
Then treat it until it heals properly.  If it does not heal, repeat the scraping more forcefully than before until it bleeds and peels. Then treat it, and it will heal.
Chapter Eighty-Two.
On the treatment of ingrown nails, both ingrown and not ingrown, dry warts, and the pimple.
The nail is a round nodule the color of the body, resembling the head of a nail, found throughout the body, especially at the soles of the feet and toes.  Pain occurs when walking.
One should split the surrounding tissue, grasp the nail with a chisel or hook, and pull it out from its root. Then treat it.  Or, if desired, cauterize it, as was explained in the relevant chapter.  As for dry warts, each is a small, rough, hardened, round protuberance on the surface of the body.
They are frequently found on children's hands.  Treatment involves stretching the wart, cutting or piercing it with silk thread or a hair until it falls off. Or, if desired, cauterize it, as previously described, with fire or a strong medicine.
Inverted and non-inverted warts can be removed with the instrument I mentioned in the treatment of the pimple. The pimple is also a small, hardened, thick protuberance on the surface of the body, going quite deep. If it is affected by cold, it feels like the sting of an ant.
It occurs throughout the body, most often on the hands.  Treatment involves taking a tube made of strong goose or hawk feathers, placing it around the pimple so that the tube surrounds it on all sides, and then rotating your hand with the tube until the surrounding tissue is split.
Push it into the depth of the flesh and the pimple will be pulled out from its root.  Or, if you prefer, do this with a brass or iron tube in this manner:
The top of the tube should be solid and twisted, so that the fingers can easily control and twist it.  Alternatively, you can cauterize the pimple, as previously described in the section on cauterizing warts.

Images of instruments used for injections in cases of rectal ailments, diarrhea, and colic.
The injector may be made of silver, or pewter, or of hollow or hammered brass.  Small and large versions of this instrument may be made, depending on the intended users. Those used to treat young children or those with narrow or painful rectums should be very delicate.  Image of a large injector:.
The upper funnel, where the syringe is attached, should be wide, with a partition where the syringe is fastened, as you see.  The lower end, which enters the rectum, should be very smooth and perfectly rounded, with two holes on one side and one on the other.
The size of the hole should be the thickness of a reed or slightly thicker.  The syringe, into which the medicines are placed, should be made of animal bladder or sheep's skin, and should be the size of a small plate, one span in diameter.
Many holes are pierced along it, as it is rotated, with the distance between each hole being the thickness of a finger.  Then a strong, doubled thread of ten threads or so is inserted into those holes, and the syringe is gathered together like a plate. When the medicine is placed inside, tighten the top of the injector between the stones firmly, then inject. This is an image of the syringe and the hole.
The method of injection is to fill the bladder or skin with the medicine, warmed to the patient's tolerance.  Be careful that it is not too hot or too cold.  Then the patient lies on their back with their legs raised.
A mat or blanket is placed underneath.  Then the tip of the injector is smeared with ointment, egg white, or licorice juice, or similar.  Gently insert it into the rectum.  Then the syringe's attendant takes the syringe in both hands and squeezes it firmly until all the contents of the injector are emptied into the intestines.
Then the injector is removed, and the patient lowers their legs to the wall.  If the medicine is urging its way out, let them hold it as much as possible. If they remain in it all night, the effect on the ailment is better.  If it is injected for diarrhea, and the expulsion is hastened, repeat the injection until healed.
If there are hemorrhoids or painful tumors in the rectum, the injector should be very gentle, smooth like the syringes used for children.  This is an image of a gentle injector with its skin tightened.
Chapter Eighty-four.
In the treatment of surgeries.
I have already mentioned, in the division of treatment, the topic of cauterization, and here I am now discussing its treatment by hand and medications comprehensively. I say that surgeries differ according to the thing causing the surgery, and according to the location where the wound occurs.
The things that cause surgeries are numerous, such as a blow from a stone, a cut from a sword or knife, a thrust from a spear or a stick or arrow, and similar things.
And as for surgeries according to locations on the body, such as wounds that occur on the head, neck, chest, abdomen, liver, and similar organs.
And I will describe the treatment of some surgeries, to make them a standard and rule for other surgeries, beginning with simple head injuries, especially as those that are complex will be mentioned in the first chapter of the third book of this text.
So I say that if a simple wound occurs on the head, and it is not a bone fracture, I look to see if it was caused by a blow from a stone or something similar.  If only the skin was bruised and the wound was large, and I feared the occurrence of a hot swelling, then quickly lance the scalp at the spot. Do not delay this, and draw from him blood according to his strength, unless there is something preventing the bloodletting.  Especially if the blood coming from the wound is little; and let the bloodletting be from the opposite side of the injured area.
Warn the patient against fullness, drinking, and coarse foods. If anything prevents the bloodletting, let him lessen his food intake, avoid meat and drinks, and apply a bandage soaked in rose oil alone, or with a constricting drink, to the wound if a hot swelling occurs.
And if you fear a hot swelling, apply a bandage to the wound if it is fresh with its blood, and the air has not altered it—the air-treatment I will describe to you shortly. However, if the air has altered it, apply some ointments to it.
Until pus forms, then treat it until it heals. If the wound is large, and caused by a sword cut or similar, and its edges do not come together by themselves, bring them together by stitching, as I describe in stitching abdominal wounds.
If the skin has exposed the bone and is hanging, and its attachment is only in a small flap, cut it off and then treat the wound with medicines that will cause strong flesh to grow in place of the skin. Instruct the patient to eat foods that provide strength, such as heads, and the like.
If a festering occurs in the skin, but it has not adhered to the bone, cut off all the festering material and throw it away, and then treat it. If in these wounds there is an artery or vein that bleeds, and the bleeding does not stop with medicines, seek out the artery.
If you find it, and it does not stop bleeding, cut it with a lancet and tie it off.  If the methods mentioned are ineffective, cauterize it until the bleeding stops.  If these wounds are small and simple, their treatment is easy and straightforward; simply apply this powder while they are still bleeding.
Before the air changes it, the recipe for the powder is: one part frankincense, two parts aloes, and three parts quicklime or unquicklime.  Grind all of these together, sift them, and fill the wound with them.  Apply a tight bandage so that it adheres well.
It will clot with the blood, then bind it from above with bandages.  Leave it without removing it as long as it does not swell.  The medicine will not be removed until it heals.  The lime alone may accomplish this if the frankincense and aloes are unavailable.
This action can also be done with the powder in many large wounds if it is correctly applied and bound, and if the wounds are fresh and bleeding, as long as the air has not altered them. However, if the air has somewhat altered them, especially during summer.
Therefore, there is no effective use of this powder.  Treat it with the methods described previously: apply some ripening ointments or a paste of barley flour, water, and honey, to draw out the pus.  Then treat it with other methods until healed.
However, if a wound involves a simple fracture of the bone, draw it out with a cloth.  Treatment of head fractures has been described elsewhere, in the section on neck surgery.  If the wound is in the neck, there is no difference in treatment compared to a simple head wound.
If a nerve or artery in the neck has been severed, if it is a nerve, there is no remedy except to avoid treatments that cause intense constriction, such as verdigris, alum, and similar substances, because they injure and spasm the nerve.
Do not apply anything cold to the wound at all, because the essence of the nerve is cold, and its connection to the brain, which is the noblest of organs.  Use gentle remedies such as moistened rosewater, washed with fresh water, repeatedly moistened with oil, or rose and tutty ointment.
Also wash with fresh water and other mineral stones in this manner, and use moist ointments.  If the wound is large, use sutures or bring the edges together with bandages, then treat until healed.
If the wound has a recess and pus has collected in its depths, lance it at the lowest point.  If an artery has been severed in the wound and you see blood flowing, tie it off, or cauterize it if necessary.
If the wound has severed some or all of the cartilages of the larynx, but the veins are intact, bring the edges of the skin together with sutures along the cartilage of the larynx. Do not touch the larynx itself; rather, smooth it out and return it to its natural shape, then tie it tightly and leave it for a number of days.
Then treat it with ointments that cause contraction and drying until healed. If the wound has affected the bone, probe it. If there are fragments of bone, remove them all or as many as possible. If you can't, leave it until the wound becomes festered and healed, and the removal is easier.
If the wound is fresh, sprinkle it with the powder we described. If bone in the wound has become festered and suppurated, treat it as described in the section on chest and shoulder surgery.
If the wound is from a spear or knife and you see a hollow in it, check if air comes out when the patient breathes. If it does, know that it is a fatal wound.  If it has no hollow, and is fresh with blood, do not initially apply the powder, nor tighten it, so as not to trap blood in its hollow.
It will recede to the heart and kill the patient. However, apply a drawing ointment twice a day. If you do not have ointment, place a used cotton swab in the wound to absorb the moisture, and have the patient sleep with the wound facing up.
To drain what collects there.  If three days or more have passed since the wound was inflicted, and the patient has shown no spasms, poor pulse, or shortness of breath, and you find the rest of their condition sound, know that the wound is healthy.  Treat it with bandages and other healing measures until healed.
If the wound fails to heal and the discharge persists, know that it has become suppurated. Treat it according to the relevant section.  The patient should lie on the wound to drain the accumulated material. If the wound is on the chest or back, treat it with the previous methods of suturing.
If it is large, use the powder. If it is small. If it has affected the bone, breaking off fragments, explore the wound and promptly remove those fragments if they are loose. If they are not loose, leave them until...
It will cause the wound to fester, making removal easier. As for other wounds occurring in other parts of the body, their treatment follows the principles we have described.
Chapter Eighty-five.
On abdominal wounds, intestinal prolapse, and their suturing.
A wound exposing the abdomen may be large, small, or medium-sized.  A large wound may protrude intestines, or several intestines, making their replacement and suturing more difficult and arduous.
A small wound, too, may present difficulties in another way, making its repair more challenging.  If the intestines are not returned to their proper position promptly, they swell and thicken, making their repositioning more difficult. Therefore, the intermediate wound is the best, since the intestines can be returned without the difficulty encountered with these other types of wounds.
Know that there are four types of abdominal sutures. Two are general-purpose, suitable for abdominal and other bodily wounds; the other two are specific, though they are more suited to abdominal wounds.
I will describe them to you one by one with explanation. If a wound is small and something of the intestines protrudes, its return may be difficult for one of two reasons: either due to the small size of the wound, as we have said, or because the intestine has swollen due to a cold from the air.
If this is the case, it is necessary to warm it by soaking a sponge or damp cloth in lukewarm water, alone or possibly with cooked raisins, dates, and myrrh, and apply it to the intestines until the swelling subsides.
A drink with astringents may be used, which is better than water alone for dissolving the swelling.  If the swelling has subsided, moisten the intestines with water in which hyssop or coriander has been cooked; this will facilitate their return with less effort.
If the return is still impossible after this treatment, make a small incision in the wound with the instrument used for lancing abscesses. The initial treatment is preferable to incision, which is only resorted to as a last resort when all else fails.  This is a depiction of the instrument.
Its one curved side is limited, and the other side is unlimited.  The thin end is not as thin as a scalpel, but rather slightly blunt. It is a tool resembling a small awl, as you see. If the wound is wide and the intestines have entered, it is necessary for the intestines to be returned to their natural shape.
His specific location is best if possible. However, if the wound is large and in the lower abdomen, the patient should lie on their back with their legs raised higher than their head. If it is in the upper abdomen, the head and chest should be raised higher than the lower body.
Likewise, if the wound is on one side of the abdomen, always aim to keep the side with the incision higher than the other side. This is how it should be applied in major and moderate surgical procedures.
For minor surgeries, place it as best you can.  Then have an attentive assistant hold the entire wound with their hands, bringing the edges together, and gradually revealing portions for the surgeon to stitch.
This is the general method for single-stitch sutures: take a needle or several needles, sized according to the wound's width.  Then leave a space equal to the thickness of the little finger on either side of the wound edges, and insert a single needle without thread into the skin's edges. With the edges of the peritoneum beneath the skin, on the inside, so that it pierces through there.  Having brought together the edges of the skin and the edges of the peritoneum, creating four flaps, then tighten the doubled thread around the needle repeatedly from both sides until the wound edges are firmly joined together.
Then leave a space equal to the thickness of a finger again and insert another needle, and tie it with the thread as you did with the first needle.  Continue this with as many needles as necessary to completely close the wound. Let the needles be of medium thickness.
Because very thin needles quickly cut the flesh, and thick needles are difficult to insert into the skin, therefore, the needles should be of medium thickness.  A needle should not be inserted close to the edge of the skin.
So that the flesh is not quickly cut and the wound opens before it is healed.  Nor should the stitching be too far apart, so that the wound does not prevent healing.  Then cut the needle ends so as not to harm the patient during sleep.  Prepare strips of linen from each side of the wound to hold the ends of the needles.
Leave it until you know that the wound has healed.  This type of stitching with needles is most suitable for small surgeries, as it may suffice to use only one or two needles, or similar.
As for the method of stitching for the common people, it is to gather the four edges, that is, the edges of the skin and the edges of the peritoneum, in one stitch with a needle with a thread of moderate thickness and thinness. Then, after the needle has passed through these four edges, return the needle from the same side from which it began.
So that the thread is interwoven at the top of the wound, to make the stitching like that of bags in which goods are fastened.  Make the space between each stitch the width of a little finger.  This method of stitching is known to everyone.
With this stitching, a surgical procedure was performed on a man who had a knife wound in his abdomen. The surgical opening was more than a span, and approximately two spans of the small intestine had come out. The wound was in the middle of the abdomen.
After the intestines remained outside the wound for twenty-four hours, the wound healed in about fifteen days.  He was treated until he recovered and lived many years afterward, managing all his affairs.  Doctors had judged that he would never recover.
Surprisingly, I did not treat it with any ointment, as I was in a place where there were no medicines. I used to put used cotton on the wound twice a day, and I would wash it with honey water until it healed.
Concerning one of the specific types of stitching, I mention it according to Galen's text:  Begin the stitching at the skin, inserting the needle from outside to inside.  When the needle passes through the skin and the muscle, it should be directed straight along the length of the abdomen.
Leave the edge of the peritoneum on the side where you inserted the needle.  Pass the needle through the opposite edge of the peritoneum from inside to outside, then again through that same edge of the peritoneum from outside to inside.
Leave the edge of the peritoneum on this side, and insert the needle into the opposite edge from inside to outside.  At the same time as you pass through the peritoneum, also pass the needle through the edge of the mesentery on its side until you have passed through the whole thing.
Then, begin again from the same side, tracing the edge of the peritoneum on the opposite side.  Bring the needle out of the skin near it, then return it to that same skin, tracing the edge of the peritoneum on the opposite side, together with this edge of the mesentery.
Bring it out of the skin on its side.  Do this again and again, until the entire wound is sewn in this manner.  In summary, the characteristic of this stitching is that it sews like the stitching of furriers for furs.
That it sews the peritoneum once from one side with the edge of the skin and leaves it once from the other side until it is empty.  As for the second type of specific stitching, which Galen also mentioned, this is his statement verbatim.
It is that you sew it like some healers do, by bringing each part to its corresponding, similar part; naturally, they join the edge of the peritoneum to its other edge, and the edge of the mesentery to its other edge.  This is how I describe it to you.
The needle should be inserted into the edge of the mesentery nearest to you, from the outside, and pierce through it alone to the inside. Leave the edges of the peritoneum.  Then, return the needle and pierce from the outside to the inside through both edges of the peritoneum. Then return it again.
And pierce it from inside to outside in the edge of the other mesentery on the opposite side. This type of stitching is better than the ordinary, easy stitching, which is the one mentioned previously. This is Galen's statement verbatim. Some have said that sometimes abdominal stitching can be done with two needles. That is, inserting a single thread, and beginning by inserting the needle from your side and piercing it to the other side, and inserting the other needle from the opposite side, piercing it to your side, according to the stitching method of the leather workers.
Know that a rupture in the middle of the abdomen is more difficult to stitch than other areas of the abdomen.  As for treating the wound, its treatment is like the treatment of other wounds.  If you catch the wound fresh with its blood, before the air changes it, and you replace the intestines, stitch it, and make it strong, then apply the styptic dressings to it.
If the wound has been affected by air, apply some of the ointments that you have available until it becomes suppurated, the sutures fall out, and the peritoneum and mesentery adhere. Then treat it as you would any other wound until it heals.
If you do not have any medicines available, apply to it from the beginning of suppuration, cotton wool that has been worn.  Change it twice a day, as I have taught you, until it heals.  If the wounds are minor, you will usually not need any other treatment. If you fear that the wound may cause pain to the principal organs.
Therefore, you should dip soft wool in moderately warm oil or rose oil, and place it around the areas between the groin and armpits.  If he feels pain or putrefaction in his intestines, which often occurs, irrigate him with a lukewarm, dark astringent drink.
Especially if the putrefaction has reached the intestines and has become a penetrating wound into its cavity.  Know that the intestines that are thick are easier to heal, and those that are thin are more difficult to heal.
As for the intestine known as the jejunum, it will not heal from an injury that occurs in it at all, because of the abundance of its large blood vessels and the thinness and fragility of its tissue, and its proximity to the nervous system. If the extruded part of the wound is a portion of the intestine that has been excised and has been caught fresh, return it to its place, the same as you would return any similar section of intestine.
If it has been a while and it has turned green or black, you should tie it with a thread above the blackened area to prevent bleeding, as the extruded part contains blood vessels and arteries. Then cut what is below that ligature.
And you should leave the ends of the thread hanging from below the incision, outside of it, so it is easier to pull it and remove it when the extruded part falls out and the wound becomes suppurated.  Describing the wound that occurs in the intestine.  Now, if a perforation occurs in the intestine and it is small...
If it is possible to repair it in some people, because I have seen a man who had been stabbed in the abdomen with a spear. The wound was to the right of the stomach.  The wound festered, and feces and air were coming out of it.  I treated it, although I did not expect it to heal. I continued to treat him until he healed, and the wound closed.  When I saw that the wound had closed, I feared for the patient that a bad event might occur in his abdomen.  However, no such bad event occurred, and he remained in the best possible condition. Indeed, he ate, drank, had intercourse, went to the bath, and exercised while under my care.  Experienced people have mentioned that if a small wound occurs in the intestines, it should be treated in this manner.
Take large ants, then bring the edges of the wound together. Place one ant, its mouth open, on the edges of the wound. When it bites down and closes its mouth, cut off its head.  It will adhere and not separate. Then place another ant near the first one.
Continue doing this with several ants, according to the size of the wound. Then stitch the wound. These heads remain adhered to the intestines until the intestines heal and recover. No harm will come to the patient. The intestines can also be stitched with fine thread.
Take a strand of this animal's adhesive material from the papyrus.  Then, carefully separate the string.  Tie a fine linen thread to one end, and thread that combined string into the needle. The papyrus thread is used to stitch the intestines, then returned to the body cavity.  This method of stitching with ants and papyrus is only a matter of hope and expectation.
However, if the tear is large and extensive, especially if it is in one of the small intestines, there is no remedy and no cure at all.
Chapter Eighty-six.
On the treatment of colds and nasal polyps.
Know that any wound or tumor, if it becomes chronic, protracted, and ulcerated, without healing, and continually discharges pus, is generally called a polyp, in any part of the body, and we call it a cold, or a polyp.
It is, in fact, a hard, thickened, white mass, without pain, with a cavity like the cavity of a bird's feather.
Therefore, some called it a feather. It is sometimes moist, constantly discharging pus; and sometimes the moisture may cease.  This moisture may be abundant, or scant, thick, or thin.
I previously mentioned in my classification of surgical conditions that every ulcer that does not heal, and in which flesh does not grow, is due to one of nine causes; one of these being either a deficiency or poor quality of blood in the body, or else hardened flesh within the ulcer and on its edges preventing the growth of good flesh. Or that the ulcer is excessively harmful and dirty, or that the ulcer itself is foul, and the matter it discharges is of poor quality, or that the treatment is inappropriate, or that a plague-like disease has spread in the region, or a local affliction.
Or that the ulcer is excessively harmful and dirty, or that the ulcer itself is foul, and the matter it discharges is of poor quality, or that the treatment is inappropriate, or that a plague-like disease has spread in the region, or a local affliction. As it occurred in the city of Saragossa, where the maturation of illnesses is difficult and the healing of tumors is slow by nature, or because of a single bone or multiple bones; and I have explained all these causes, their signs, and their treatment with remedies in the classification.
Here, I must inform you about the treatment of nasal polyps and colds, which involves manual methods.  Know that polyps can occur in all parts of the body, some of which end in large veins, arteries, or nerves.
or to the peritoneum, or to the intestines, or to the bladder, or to a rib, or to a vertebra of the spine, or to a joint of the many complex joints such as the hand and foot, and some lead close to a major organ, and the like.
Therefore, those polyps that exhibit these characteristics are among the difficult-to-cure diseases that do not accept treatment, and working on them is troublesome and ignorant.  If there are polyps that do not reach the aforementioned locations and I hope and expect to treat them...
And if you wish to ascertain this, take a probe of copper or iron; if the polyp runs straight, explore it with it.  If the polyp has a curve, explore it with a thin lead probe, because lead is soft.
It will then glide upon entering and turn towards the curve. If the polyp has many openings, and you cannot identify them with the probe, inject one opening. Then the moisture you inject will travel towards the other openings and flow out.
Then, thoroughly investigate in any way possible to determine if there is bone or nerve, or if the bottom of the polyp is distant or near, or if it is a single polyp with multiple openings.  Understand all of this to the best of your ability through careful investigation and the pain felt when you touch the area.
And similar to this are the signs and causes of the tumor. If you have accurately ascertained all of this, then proceed to treatment with confidence.  It is then to be seen if...
If the polyp is superficially located, close by, or in a healthy area distant from a joint, nerve, artery, vein, or any of the locations I have described, then incise the polyp as described before, and remove the hardened matter, corrupted flesh, and excess tissue from within.
And treat any flesh or warts that grow in its mouth, until it heals. If the polyp is deep-seated and straight, you should cut it as deeply as possible, then remove all its corrupted flesh.
Then use a twisted applicator, soaked in strong medicines, and insert it into the bottom of the polyp which you can locate with an instrument. Repeat this several times until the strong medicine consumes any remaining corruption at the bottom of the polyp.
Then apply ointments that promote the growth of healthy flesh until it heals. If it does not heal this way, cauterize it, as previously described. If the cause of the polyp is bone, and you are certain of this, then probe and incise it as I have instructed, unless something prevents you from doing so.
If it is a vein, nerve, or main organ, as we said, if the bone is exposed to you and contains some corruption and darkness, then scrape it clean until the corruption disappears, and then treat it with what will knit it together until it heals. If it does not heal and the pus persists, as it previously did.
Know that you have not reached complete removal of the corruption.  Expose all that is affected again, and meticulously scrape and cleanse it to the best of your ability. Then treat it.  If it heals, well and good. If not, know that the corruption lies in a deep recess, further corrupted.  Expose all that is affected again.
Thoroughly scrape and cleanse it to the best of your ability. If the corrupted bone is small and you can remove it, pull it out with the delicate forceps suitable for that purpose.
If there are many bones, remove them all completely. Do not leave any behind. If any ligaments obstruct your efforts, and if cutting them does not pose a risk, cut those ligaments and any flesh present and free the bones.
If you cannot remove the bones at the time, apply something to the wound to cause putrefaction, and leave it for a number of days so that the flesh and ligaments surrounding those bones putrefy. Protect the wound, ensuring the opening you made during your work does not heal.
Instead, if you fear that, apply a cotton ball soaked in powdered sulfur with oil, or a cotton ball soaked in Egyptian ointment or one of the green ointments.  When the ligaments putrefy and the bones loosen, removal and extraction will be easier.
If it is a single large bone, like the tibia or femur, and only its surface is corrupted, thoroughly scrape it until the blackness and corruption disappear, then close the wound.  If a large portion is corrupted, and the corruption has reached the bone marrow, then it must be spread open.
Cut it entirely where the corruption ends.  Then treat it until it heals.  I tell you about a case that happened to a young man in his leg, to make it an example and aid in your treatment. This man was young.
About thirty years ago, pain appeared in his leg, caused by matter moving from within the body until it reached the leg and caused a large swelling. There was no external cause. Then time passed with the errors of the physicians until the swelling opened.
A large amount of matter flowed from it, and his treatment was poor, until the leg became infected with many openings, all discharging pus and bodily fluids. A group of physicians treated it for about two years, but none of them were skilled in surgical practice.
Until they came to me. I saw his leg, with matter flowing from those openings in great abundance. The man's body was wasting away and his skin had turned yellow. I inserted a probe into one of those openings, which led to the bone. Then I examined all the openings.
I found that they connected to each other from all sides of the leg.  I then incised one of those openings, exposing some of the bone. I found it corrupted, decayed, black, putrid, and riddled with holes, even reaching the marrow.  I reported what I found.
I removed the corrupted bone, and I believe that there was nothing but this corruption that I cut and exposed, and that I had excised it. Then I applied healing remedies to the wound for a long period, but it did not heal.  Then I exposed the bone again, over and above the first exposure.
I found the corruption connected to the bone, and I exposed whatever corruption appeared to me from it also.  Then I attempted to mend it, but it did not heal or close.  Then I exposed it again. I continued cutting the bone piece by piece, and trying to mend it, but it would not heal until I had cut off about a span of bone.
I removed it, along with its marrow, and mended it with remedies, and it healed quickly and recovered.  This repetition of the work and the incision was necessary due to the patient's weakness, his poor tolerance, and my fear of his death, since he often suffered fainting spells from excessive vomiting. He recovered completely.
Strong flesh grew in place of the bone, and his condition improved in his body. His strength returned and he managed his affairs.  He experienced no impairment in walking that harmed him at all. If a bone that had grown in place had broken.
It is necessary to expose it in this way: take a bandage and tie it to the end of the grown bone, and have someone pull it upward. Make another bandage of thicker wool than the first.
Then tie it to the flesh beneath the bone and pull its end so that the flesh is drawn downward.  As you expose the flesh in the area you want to expose, so that the saw does not injure the flesh, place a board or plank beneath the bone securely from below.
Because if you do this, the saw will not be prevented from cutting the diseased bone.  The exposure should be slightly above the affected area, so that there is no decay in the bone cavity which would not appear externally, requiring another exposure.
If the bone is diseased but not grown, rather connected piece to piece, and the disease is in its center or in some part of it, expose the flesh from all its sides. Then place the board underneath and expose it from the side where the decay is.
Once you have finished exposing it, expose it from the other side.  The exposure should be a little distance from the decay, as we have said. If the decay is in a joint, cut the decayed joint itself and expose the bone where it connects from the other side.
If the decay is in the connection of two joints, there is no remedy but removal. If the decay is in the hand or foot, the treatment is extremely difficult, but you must scrape away the decay as much as possible, removing and cleaning it however you can.
By whatever method is appropriate for you, provided no vein or nerve is encountered.  Know that the instruments for cutting these bones (such as saws and chisels) vary according to the position, configuration, thickness, thinness, size, smallness, hardness, and fragility of the bones. Therefore, a suitable tool should be prepared for each type of work.
Know that the work itself may indicate the type of instrument needed if you have long experience and knowledge of the arts of this craft, for the master craftsman, having observed many cases of illness, is familiar with the various ways to proceed. He may devise tools for each illness, similar to those he has already used.  I have illustrated for you a number of tools at the end of this chapter.
They are examples for you to follow and use as a basis for judging others, God willing.  Image of a saw:.

Chapter eighty-seven.
In the cutting of limbs and the spreading of bones.
The extremities may decay either from an external cause or from an internal one. If you treat this decay with medicinal remedies and the treatment is ineffective, and you see the decay progressing in the limb and nothing stops it.
Then you should cut the limb to where the decay has reached, so that the afflicted person is saved from death or a great affliction greater than losing the limb.  A sign that this has happened is that the limb will turn black, until you think that fire has burned it.
Or it may rot after turning black, so that this rot spreads to the limb's adjacent parts and affects the entire body.  So, cut it immediately.  Likewise, if the cause of the decay is a sting from some venomous creatures, such as a sea scorpion, snake, or centipede, and similar creatures.
If the decay or sting is in the tip of the finger, cut off the finger and do not delay, lest the decay spread to the hand.  Likewise, if it has reached the hand, cut it off at the base of the forearm, and do not delay, lest the decay spread until it reaches the forearm.
Likewise, if it reaches the arm, cut off the arm at the elbow, at the joint itself.  If the decay spreads and you see it reaching towards the shoulder, do not cut off the shoulder at all, for that would be the patient's death. Use other treatments to the best of your ability.
Likewise, do the same for the leg. If decay affects the toe, cut off the toe at one of the phalanges. If it affects the foot, cut off the entire leg. If it reaches the knee, cut off the lower leg at the knee joint.
If the decay has reached above the knee, there is no remedy but to leave it and allow the patient to die.  The procedure for cutting or spreading the affected limb is to tie a bandage at the lower part of the area you wish to cut and another bandage above the affected area.
One attendant pulls the lower bandage downward, another pulls the upper bandage upward. You, using a broad scalpel, carefully separate the flesh between the bandages until all the flesh is exposed.  Then, cut or spread it.  Cotton cloths should be placed around it from all sides.
So that the saw does not touch the correct spot, causing the patient excessive pain and inflammation. If bleeding occurs during your work, quickly cauterize the area or apply some hemostatic powders, then return to your procedure until you are finished.
Then bind the injured limb with a suitable bandage and treat it until it heals.  I am telling you about a case, an example, of a man who had this exact affliction in his leg; namely, there was blackness and burning in his leg like a fire.
This decay began in his toe and spread throughout his foot.  The man, seeing the decay spreading in the limb, and experiencing great pain and burning, had the limb amputated at the joint and recovered.
After a long time, this same decay appeared in his index finger. He came to me, and I applied the remedies I had prepared for the hand after cleaning his body. But the decay did not stop, and continued to spread to the other finger.
Until the decay spread to the whole hand, and he asked me to amputate it. I refused, hoping to stop the decay, and fearing that he might die from the amputation since his strength was failing.  When he lost hope in me, he went back to his town.
I was later told that he eventually cut off his entire hand and recovered.  I have related this story to be of assistance in similar cases of this disease and to serve as a guide for treatment.
Chapter Eighty-eight.
On the treatment of abscesses and how to inject medications into them.
If a tumor develops in some fleshy part of the body and its duration extends until it gathers pus, then bursts or opens, and all the pus within it is discharged, leaving the affected area empty, like a vessel.
The skin over it, like a ragged cloth, has become thin, and the damage was not severe enough to affect bone, nerve, or ligament.  Therefore, it deserves to be called an abscess, not a fistula, unless its duration is prolonged, causing the damage to affect any of these structures.
Then it is called a fistula or ulcer, and its treatment is to cut away all that skin, as it goes around, especially if it is thin and like a rag, and you are certain that it will not adhere to the affected area because of the damage.
If you hope the skin will adhere, and the damage has not reached that extent, and there is thick flesh in the skin, then treat it with injection.  Look at the abscess; if it is large and the pus it produces has a foul odor, inject it with Egyptian medicine.
Which is vinegar, oil, honey, and alum, in equal parts, mixed in a vessel and cooked over the fire until the medicine thickens and takes on the consistency of honey, then take what you need of it, thin it with water and honey, and inject it into the abscess.  Tighten the opening and leave the medicine there for about two hours.
Then you remove it by squeezing.  Do this for several days until the abscess is cleansed and the foul odor is gone.  If you do not have this medicine, you can inject with ash water. This means taking the ash of olive wood or oak wood, and pouring water over it.
Then strain it and inject with it until you are certain that the abscess has been washed out. If the patient is not likely to respond to Egyptian medicine or ash water, inject with water and honey mixed with a bit of ground alum.
Or inject with honey and a drink mixed together, because honey cleanses and washes, and the drink adheres to the abscess, especially if the drink has a quality of astringency and dryness.  If you do this repeatedly and are certain that the abscess has been cured, then inject with something that will promote the growth of flesh in it.
For example, take some palm ointment and dissolve it with rose oil and an astringent drink, or inject it with some other remedies and ointments, whose properties we have described in the chapter on ointments. If the opening of the abscess is narrow and will not accommodate the syringe.
If it is narrow, widen it slightly with an iron instrument, or place a thread soaked in Egyptian ointment or Ceriacon ointment inside it to make it wider. Also, if the opening is wide, stitch the edges together, leaving only enough room for the syringe to enter without excess.
Also, if the opening from which pus is draining is elevated, incise it at the lowest point to allow the pus to drain downwards, because if the pus is retained in the depths of the abscess, it prevents the flesh from growing there.
If you are unable to incise the abscess towards the bottom as desired, then try to position the affected part so that the pus drains easily, as best you can, and ensure that no pus remains trapped inside.
As for the cohesive remedies that are applied to the abscess from the outside, and how to apply them, take one of the cohesive ointments suitable for your needs, spread it onto a linen cloth, and ensure the cloth covers the entire abscess. Then, using scissors, cut a hole slightly larger than the abscess opening, apply a soft ointment to another cloth, sized to fit the hole, and place it over the hole, keeping it away from the abscess opening so that the pus can drain out easily.  Do not remove the larger cloth until later.
For several days, remove the one covering the abscess opening at all times to allow the collected pus to drain out, and to determine if the pus is abundant or scant, and if it is ripe or not.
Furthermore, examine the abscess itself: does the patient feel pain, or not? Is there swelling, or not?  If your treatment continues in this manner and you see the material draining from the abscess opening is scant,
Know then that the abscess has adhered, or is close to adhering. In that case, treat it again tomorrow, or on the third day. Once you have treated the wound, replace the cloths and renew the ointment. If thin pus drains from the abscess after a long time, do not despair of its adherence.
Then its healing is near, because some people have slow wound healing and others have rapid healing. If after many days, unripe pus drains from the abscess, know that the abscess has not adhered. If the abscess is slow to adhere,
Then increase the drying medications, and let the medications be moist in texture and dry in strength, like the palm ointment, if extra colocynth has been added. The most effective treatment is to use palm ointment.
It is treated by applying rose oil and sprinkling moderate, thick, old wine over it, then mixing it into a paste and using it.  A similar action may be taken if you do not have palm ointment: boil honey until it is thick and use it, or take myrrh, licorice, and kender, pulverize them all, and sprinkle them onto the honey while it is on the fire. Then apply it to a cloth and bandage it onto the abscess, or apply the boiled, thickened honey, sprinkle the remedies on it, place cloths over it, and bandage it.
In such cases, long-leaved zeraoun, the root of the asphodel, kresna flour, and rue, either individually or mixed, may be used. Grind them, sift them, and sprinkle them on the honey I described, then use them. If the abscess has lasted a long time and has not healed with this treatment, know that there is corruption within it.
If it has affected the bones or other hard nerves or ligaments, treat it with the treatment for fistula, as previously described.
Chapter Eighty-Nine.
In the treatment of the abscess of the finger, the injured nail, the excessive cutting of the finger, and the separation of fused fingers.
Daḥs is excessive flesh that grows under the nail of the thumb or toe, and perhaps on other fingers. If it persists and its treatment is neglected, it swells into a hot tumor.
Or it may become corrupted and fester, even eating away the base of the nail and perhaps corrupting it entirely.  The corruption may reach the bone, giving off a foul odor, and the end of the finger becomes broad and discolored like bruised flesh. If you treat it with what we have described in the classification and your treatment is unsuccessful,
Then you should cut with an instrument all excess flesh growing from the nail, then cauterize the wound afterward. Cauterization in this case is very beneficial. If the bone is intact, and the nail is also intact,
If the corner of the nail had pressed the flesh inward, causing it to be pricked and irritated, then a thin dressing should be placed under the corner of the nail that is pricking the flesh, lifting it upwards, and the flesh should be gently cut.
And apply to the remaining flesh the burning and corrosive medicines until it is all gone, then treat it with ointments until it heals.  If the corruption has affected the bone, then that bone should be cut out and removed, for it will never heal as long as there is corrupt bone within it.
If you see the decay and corruption spreading in the finger, amputate it at one of the phalanges, as mentioned before, and then treat it until it heals.  If the nail is struck or bruised, and intense pain occurs, you should first lance the affected area.
Then split the nail with a sharp scalpel, making an oblique split from top to bottom, taking care not to reach the flesh beneath the nail.  For this would cause the affected area intense pain, and be a cause for the growth of excess flesh at the site.  Then treat the area with something that relieves the pain.
As for the superfluous finger that develops in some people's hands, it may be entirely fleshy, or it may contain bone in some parts, or it may have a nail, and some of it may grow at the root of a joint of some of the fingers.
Or it may grow on some of the finger's phalanges, and those that grow on some of the finger's phalanges do not move, and those that grow at the finger joint might move.  Whatever is purely fleshy should be easily cut, cutting it at its base with a broad scalpel.
However, those that grow at the base of the joint are difficult to treat; avoid cutting them.  As for those that grow on the finger at one of the phalanges, it is necessary to first cut the flesh in a circular fashion, towards the bone, and then to separate the bone with one of those appropriate saws.
Then treat it until it heals.  As for the adhesion that sometimes occurs between fingers, it often happens at birth or as a result of a wound, burn, or similar injury.  It is necessary to split this adhesion.
So that the fingers return to their natural position, then place between them a bandage or a slit soaked in rose oil, so that it does not quickly adhere; and separate them, or put a thin lead plate between them until the place heals properly.
Likewise, if adhesion occurs between some fingers and the palm, split the adhesion according to what is suitable and beneficial for the shape of the limb.
Chapter Ninety.
On cutting the veins.
Veins are twisted, thick blood vessels filled with black impurities, occurring in most body parts, but most frequently in the legs, especially in the legs of travelers, laborers, and porters.  First, it is necessary to repeatedly vigorously cleanse the body of black impurities.
Then, lance the affected person with a lancet.  Treatment with iron can be done in two ways: one is to cut and release the black blood; the other is to cut the vein and remove all of it.  In the case of cutting, the leg should first be soaked in hot water.
Until the thick, murky blood is loosened. Then, the patient's leg is tied with a bandage from above the thigh to below the knee.  Then, the vein is cut in one, two, or three wide incisions.
Then, extract the black blood from the bottom of the leg upward, and from the top downward, until you have removed the amount of blood you deem sufficient, or as much as the patient's strength allows. Then, bandage it and instruct him to avoid foods that generate black bile, and repeat emesis and bloodletting.
When the veins become filled and this harms the patient, bloodletting should be performed as follows: shave the patient's leg if it has much hair, then take them to a bath and soak their leg in hot water until it turns red and sweats, or have them engage in vigorous exercise.
If a bath is not available to heat the limb, then cut the skin lengthwise next to the vein, either near the knee or near the heel.  Then, open the skin with forceps and scrape the vein from all sides until it is visible.
When it appears, you will see it as a red, glistening vein.  Once freed from the skin, it resembles a tendon.  Then, insert a curved needle underneath it until it rises and is exposed above the skin.  Hang it with a smooth, blunt hook, and then cut another incision near that one, about the width of three fingers.
Then, scrape the skin away from the vein until it is exposed.  Then, lift it with the needle as you did before and hang it with another hook as you did at first.  Then, make another incision or several incisions if necessary.
Then, dissect and cut it at the end of the incision near the heel, and pull it out.  Dissect and pull it until it emerges from the second incision.  Then pull it to the incision above it, and do this until you pull it from the third incision, above all the incisions.  Once it is all out, cut it.
If pulling and dissecting it does not work, insert a needle with a strong doubled thread, tie it, and pull.  Insert the needle underneath and twist your hand in every direction until it emerges.  Be careful not to break it, for if it breaks, it will be very difficult for you to dissect it.
This will cause harm to the patient.  Once you have dissected the entire thing, place wool soaked in a concoction and rose oil or oil on the surgical site and treat it until it heals.  If the vein is constricted, with twists and turns that have bends in different directions...
If it is not straight, as we said, you should make an incision on each bend and twisting point.  Then, hang it with the hooks until you dissect it completely.  Be careful when making the incisions not to cut or injure the vein, for this will make dissecting it difficult and you should conserve your effort.
Image of the dissecting tool used for the vein:.
Image of the blind hook:.
It should not have a bend like other hooks, nor should its tip be sharp, so as not to injure the vein.  It should be thick and smooth in its bend, because if it were thin, it would cut the vein with its thinness.  Instead, it should have a thick, as we said, a considerable thickness.
Chapter Eighty-nine.
In the vein of the arm.
This vein arises in the legs in hot countries like the Hijaz and Arab lands, and in hot, sparsely populated countries. It may also arise in other parts of the body besides the legs, arising from an abscess occurring under the skin.
As it occurs within the bodies of snakes, worms, the husk of gourds, and worms that develop between the skin and flesh. A sign of the beginning of this vein's formation is that a severe inflammation occurs in the leg, then the area becomes puffed up, and then the vein begins to emerge from the location of that puffiness.
As if it were the root of a plant or animal, and once its tip emerges, it should be wrapped around a small piece of lead weighing from one to two dirhams, tying it, and leaving the lead hanging from the leg.
Whenever something emerges from it externally, wrap it in the lead and tie it. If it grows excessively, cut off some of it and wrap the remainder, but do not cut it off from its root before it all emerges, because if you cut it off, it will contract and enter the flesh, causing a tumor, abscess, and a bad ulcer at that location.
Therefore, it should be gently coaxed and pulled out little by little until its entirety emerges from the body, and it may be that from this vein, in some individuals, what emerges is five or ten cubits in length.
I have heard that it emerged from a man to a length of twenty cubits. If it breaks off during your treatment, insert a probe into its hole and carefully press it back against the body for a long time until all the material inside is drained, and try to heal the area with medicines for a few days.
Then treat it with the treatment for tumors. This vein may have many branches, especially if it appears in a joint of the leg or in the leg itself, creating many openings and branches emerging from each opening. Treat it as described in the classification, and as mentioned previously.
Chapter Ninety-two.
Concerning the abscess on the worms that develop under the heel, called "the affliction of cattle.
This disease, in some of our countries, is called the affliction of cattle, because it often affects cattle.  It is a small single worm that develops between the skin and flesh and crawls throughout the body, both upward and downward.
Its movement from limb to limb can be felt, until it pierces the skin at a point, emerges, and forms from the putrefaction of some of the humors, like the worms, snakes, and gourd-like tumors in the abdomen.
Its danger is that if it crawls through the body and ascends to the head and reaches the eye, it might break through it and exit, thus destroying the eye. This occurs frequently.  Therefore, treatment and extraction must be undertaken when it is moving and perceptible.
Therefore, one should tie tightly above and below it with a strong bandage, then cut open and remove it.  If it has burrowed into the flesh and cannot be found, apply a cautery to the area with fire until it is burned away.  The worst outcome is its destruction of the eye, as we mentioned.
If it is seen near the eye in the head, tie tightly under it on the forehead, then cut open and remove it.  The patient should also be treated with medicines to cleanse the body of the foul, bad humors, and should avoid foods that produce putrefaction.
Chapter Ninety-Three.
On the incision of the disease known as the "nafar".
This disease, called the "nafar" in our country, is a pain that appears in some organs, then spreads from one organ to another. I have seen it as I describe to you.
I was called to a sick woman in a remote area. She uncovered her arm, and I saw a slight swelling in the vein of the arm. After an hour, I saw the swelling travel up the forearm with the ulna, like a worm ascending to her shoulder as quickly as quicksilver.
If it moves from one place to another, the pain disappears from that location and settles in the shoulder. Then, after an hour, it ran throughout the rest of the body, even to the other arm.  She then recounted that it circulated her entire body, as I observed.
I was amazed by the speed of its movement from one organ to another. Before this, I had only heard of the disease spreading from one organ to another, but I had not seen it with my own eyes in this way.  I had heard of it happening in others, but I had never before seen such an example as with this woman.
I concluded that this was because the woman was from a rural area, with a dry physique and exposed veins.  This is why the moving pain became apparent.  It is likely not to manifest in this way among those who live in comfort and whose bodies are moist, with hidden veins.
If you wish to treat it, and the patient feels pain, if it manifests as we described, then bind tightly above and below the affected area with a bandage, and lance it until the accumulated wind is released.
If you do not see it, treat it by shaking the body and dispersing the wind, using remedies such as rotten bean seeds or skirret seeds, and similar medications.
Chapter Ninety-four.
On the extraction of arrows.
Arrows vary according to their types and the locations in the body where they lodge.  Their differences in type include large and small, hollow and solid glass, and those with three or four angles.
Some have tongues, others have shards.  Regarding their location in the body parts, they fall into two categories: either they are in hollow major organs such as the brain, heart, liver, lungs, kidneys, intestines, and bladder, and the like. If an arrow lodges in one of these organs, and the signs of death, which I will describe to you later, appear, you should avoid extracting the arrow, for death will most often befall the patient. However, if these bad signs do not appear, and the arrow is not lodged deep within the organ, extract it and treat the wound.  Signs of a head wound by an arrow that pierces the skull and injures the meninges include severe headache, dizziness, and fainting.
However, if these bad signs do not appear, and the arrow is not lodged deep within the organ, extract it and treat the wound.  Signs of a head wound by an arrow that pierces the skull and injures the meninges include severe headache, dizziness, and fainting. Redness in the eyes and tongue, convulsions, confusion of mind, vomiting, possibly bleeding from the nostrils or ears, and possibly loss of speech and voice, and from the wound site, a white, porridge-like moisture, similar to the watery substance of meat.
If these signs appear, refrain from treating the patient and removing the arrow if it has not already been removed.  Concerning signs of an arrow striking the heart, if it is near the left breast and feels as if it has lodged in something solid rather than hollow...
The arrow might also pulse like the heartbeat, and dark blood might flow from the wound, followed by cold extremities, cold sweat, and fainting.  Know that death is inevitable.  A sign of an arrow wounding the lung is the discharge of frothy blood from the wound.
The vessels around the neck swell, the patient's complexion changes, the breathing is rapid, and he craves cold air. If the arrow strikes the diaphragm in the chest, it will be close to the smaller ribs, and breathing will be labored with intense pain.
He sighs and all the shoulder muscles move. If the arrow strikes the liver, intense pain follows, and blood resembling the liver in its redness flows from the wound. If the arrow strikes the stomach, undigested food may emerge from the wound.
Its condition is evident. If the arrow strikes the abdomen, causing a rupture, and excrement, or a portion of the intestines, emerges from the wound, there is no hope of treatment or arrow removal. If the arrow strikes the bladder and urine emerges, ...
If something protrudes outward and the patient's pain intensifies, know that he is doomed.  As for the other organs, such as the face, eye, throat, shoulder, arm, spine, collarbone, thigh, leg, and similar organs, in most cases they are spared.
Unless the arrow strikes an artery or nerve, and unless the arrow is poisoned, I will tell you something I have witnessed regarding these arrows, so you may use it to guide your treatment. An arrow struck a man in the bridge of his nose, near the root of the nose.
I extracted it from the other side, beneath the earlobe, and he recovered.  No harm came to his eye. I also extracted another arrow for a Jew that had struck his earlobe beneath the lower eyelid.  The arrow had receded, and only a small tip, the part that attaches to the shaft, remained.
It was a large arrow, from a composite bow, with a square, smooth iron head, lacking ear-like projections.  The Jew recovered without further eye injury. I also removed another arrow from a Christian's throat; the arrow was Arabic.
It had two ear-like projections, and I split it open between the epiglottis. It had pierced his throat, and I gently worked on it until I extracted it. The Christian recovered and healed.  I also removed an arrow from a man's abdomen; we thought he would die from it.
After about thirty days, and no change in his condition, I split the arrow open and maneuvered it, extracting it. He recovered and suffered no further harm. I saw a man with an arrow lodged in his back; the wound had closed over it.
Seven years later, the arrow emerged from the base of his thigh. I saw a woman with an arrow in her abdomen; the wound had closed, and the arrow remained.  No change in her condition occurred, and she experienced no hindrance to her usual activities.
I saw another man with an arrow in his face; the wound had closed over it, and he experienced little pain.  Many such cases exist. I extracted an arrow from a Sultan's officer, who had been struck in the middle of his nose, slightly deviating to the right.
The arrowhead was completely buried.  I was called to treat him three days after the injury.  I found the arrow wound very small.  I probed it with a fine instrument, but felt nothing.  He was experiencing a prickling and pain beneath his ear, on the right side.
I hoped that the prickling was from the arrowhead, so I applied a dressing with drawing and ripening properties, hoping that the area would swell and reveal the arrow's location, allowing me to extract it.  However, no event occurred to indicate the arrow had reached that spot.
I continued the dressing for many days, but nothing happened.  The wound eventually closed, and the patient despaired of removing the arrow.  Eventually, he felt the arrow inside his nose and informed me.  I applied a strong, corrosive medicine to the wound for many days.
Until it opened, and I probed it, feeling the thin arrowhead that was adhering to the bone.  I then continued opening the wound with the strong medicine until the arrowhead became clearly visible.  It took me approximately four months.
Then, when the wound widened and I could insert the forceps, I pulled and moved it, but it would not come out.  I continued to manipulate it with various instruments until I finally grasped it with strong forceps, as will be depicted at the end of the chapter.
The physicians had judged that the cartilage of his nose could not be set, but I set it, and the wound healed, and the patient recovered completely, suffering nothing at all.  I am telling you how I removed some arrows, so that this may be a standard and a guide for what I have not mentioned.
Because the parts of this craft and its details cannot be grasped by description, nor encompassed by a book.  Rather, the skilled craftsman judges the many from the few, what is present from what is absent, and deduces new work and new instruments when faced with unusual cases.
If I descend from this subject, I say that arrows are removed from the limbs in which they lodged in two ways: either by pulling them from the point of entry, or from the opposite side, and from where they entered.
Either the arrow is protruding in fleshy tissue, and can be pulled out.  If it does not come out at the time it entered, then you should leave it for a number of days until the surrounding flesh rots, and it will be easier to pull and remove it.  The same applies if it lodged in bone.
If it does not come out, leave it for several days and try pulling and moving it each day.  It will come out.  If it does not come out after days, you should pierce around the arrow in the same bone from every side with a fine drill, until you have widened the space for the arrow, and then pull it out.
If the arrow lodged in the skull bone and has penetrated one of the brain ventricles, and some of the symptoms I mentioned appeared, then refrain from pulling the arrow and leave it until its condition improves after several days.
Then work on pulling and removing the arrow. If it is deeply embedded and cannot be pulled out, use the drills around the arrow as I described, then treat the wound until it heals.  However, if the arrow is hidden in a place in the body, If it is hidden from sight, probe it with a probe.  If you feel it, pull it out using some suitable instruments. If you are unable to, due to the narrowness of the wound and the arrow's depth, and there is no bone, nerve, or vein in the way,
then enlarge the wound until you can get hold of the arrow and remove it. If it has two barbs, grasp them and remove all the flesh entwined around them by any means you can.  If you cannot remove the flesh by breaking the barbs and twisting them, then
If you try to remove the arrow at any place, use your hand with pincers in all directions to remove it.  Be extremely gentle, so that the arrow does not break, making it harder to pull out.  If you cannot remove it in your time,
leave it for a few days, until the surrounding flesh has festered, then try again. It will then be easier. If bleeding occurs, use the treatments mentioned in the relevant section, and take care not to cut a vein, nerve, or tendon. Use your ingenuity.
By every means you can, remove the arrow gently, carefully, and firmly, as I have described.  When pulling the arrow out, you should position the injured person in the same way they were when the arrow struck, this is the best approach.
If you cannot do that, use whatever methods you can.  As for an arrow that emerges from the opposite side, either something of the arrow will be protruding outward, or you will feel the arrowhead close to the skin, protruding.
Cut the arrow, making the cut large enough for the pincers to fit. Then pull it out, as this will make it easier to remove. If it is stuck in bone, twist your hand in a circle until the arrow has an effect on the bone and makes room for itself, then pull it out.
Otherwise, leave it for a few days, and then try again until it comes out. If the arrowhead is still in place, push it out with it. If the shaft has fallen off, and you want to use a pushing tool, insert the hollow tool into the arrow's shaft, then use it to push it out.
If the arrow is hollow, push it out with a tool that fits into the hollow. This will make it easier to remove. If the arrow is poisoned, you should cauterize all the flesh affected by the poison if possible, then treat it with appropriate remedies.
If the arrow is lodged in the chest, abdomen, bladder, or flank, and it is close enough to be felt with a probe, and you can make a cut, make the incision, being careful not to cut a vein or nerve, and remove it.
Then suture the wound if it needs stitching, and treat it until it heals.  Image of the pincers used for removing arrows:.
Its tips are like the beak of a bird, crafted to resemble a scraper. If it grasps an arrow or anything else, it will not let go.  They are made in large, small, and medium sizes, all according to the size of the arrow and the breadth of the wound.

This one has a solid tip, like a ramrod, to easily enter the hollow arrow and push it out.
Chapter ninety-five.
On the opening of veins.
Thirty veins are customarily opened on the body.  Sixteen are in the head: the two pulsating veins behind the ears, known as the *ḥasīsīn*; the two arteries visible on the temples; and the two veins at the corners of the eyes, known as the *nāẓirīn*.
The vein that stands up in the middle of the forehead, the vein at the tip of the nose, the two veins in the neck, the two veins in the upper lip of the mouth, the two veins in the lower lip, these veins known as the *jayhārak*, and the two veins below the tongue.
As for the veins opened in the arm and hand, there are five: one of them is the *qayfāl*, which is on the outer side, and the common people call it the vein of the head.  The *akḥal*, the middle vein, is composed of a branch of the *bāsiliq* and a branch from the *qayfāl*; the common people call it the vein of the body.
The *bāsiliq*, which is situated on the inner side, is also called the axillary vein. The common people call it the vein of the belly.  The *ḥablu al-dirāʿ*, situated on the forearm, is the one to which the *bāsiliq* is attached, and is clearly visible above the thumb.  The *ʾāsīlim*.
It is the vein between the little finger and the ring finger; it has two branches. In the leg and foot there are three veins: one under the knee on the outer side, the second the saphenous vein, located near the heel on the inner side, and the vein of the women, located near the heel on the outer side.
And in the other leg, there are three similar veins.  As for the two veins behind the ears, their opening is beneficial for chronic colds, migraines, scabies, and chronic, malignant head sores.  Their method of opening will be described as I explain.
This is done by shaving the patient's head and rubbing its back at the location of the two veins with a rough cloth, rubbing well. Then the patient's neck is strangled with a turban until the veins appear, their location being behind the ears at the low points of the head.  You should locate them with your finger, and where you feel their pulse under your finger, mark it with ink.
Then take a scalpel, which is known as a lancet, and insert it beneath the vein in the skin until the scalpel reaches the bone. Then raise your hand with the vein and skin upward and sever the vein with the skin, cutting it cleanly, and the length of the cut should be the equivalent of two clenched fingers.
Or similar, and release the amount of blood desired.  Then bind them with bandages and leave them until they heal.  Earlier in the book, their cutting and cauterization were discussed.  As for the two arteries in the temples, their opening is beneficial for chronic migraines, severe headaches, persistent eye inflammation, and acute, profuse eye discharge.
Their method of opening, as I describe to you, is to bind the patient's neck with a turban until the veins are clearly visible, and their pulse is felt under your finger.  Then, mark the location with ink.  Then lift the skin above the vein with your index finger.
Insert the lancet from below, lift the vein upward, and sever it as you did with the other veins. Release the blood as needed. Then loosen the patient's neckcloth and place your finger on the vein for a while.
Then place a compress and bandage on it, and bind it tightly from above. Leave it until it heals. Their mention, cutting, and lancing were previously discussed in the beginning of the book.  As for opening the forehead vein, its benefit comes after opening the temporal vein for chronic facial conditions such as ringworm, sores, and chronic redness.
How to open it, as I describe to you: Bind the patient's neck with a turban until the vein appears.  Then, take the instrument called the lancet, and here is its image:.
Place the pointed tip of the lancet on the vein, strike it from above with a mallet or similar object, and allow the blood to flow as desired.  Then loosen the patient's neckcloth and bind it until healed.
A wide lancet may also be used, but it should not have a sharp tip like other lancets.  It should be slightly wide at the tip.  Open it using a twisting motion, because the bone is close by; the lancet might break if it is too thin.
As for the two veins in the eye sockets, they are beneficial for eye ailments such as scabies, redness, and other facial diseases.  To open them: have the patient tighten their neck with a turban, then open them while standing over their head. The incision should be made slightly twisting in a lengthwise manner, using a small, slightly wide lancet.
If the area has little flesh, the lancet will break if it is too thin.  Take the desired amount of blood, apply a bandage, and secure for one night. Then, remove the bandage.  Opening the nasal vein is beneficial for acute fevers.
Severe headaches and facial diseases, such as red pustules on the nose, especially if chronic, are also treated this way.  To open the vein: have the patient tighten their neck, hold their nose with your left hand, and use a thin, long lancet.
Insert the lancet into the middle of the nostril itself, between the nasal passages in a straight line, because the vein is not apparent there. Blood will immediately appear.  You should press the lancet in slightly, take the desired amount of blood, and then bandage it for a night, as it will quickly clot.
As for the jugular veins, opening them is beneficial for shortness of breath, the onset of leprosy, and melancholic diseases appearing on the skin's surface, such as black vitiligo, scabies, foul ulcers, and cankers.  To open them: the patient should tighten their neck beneath them with a bandage, and the surgeon should stand over the patient's head.
The patient sits on a chair, and the vein is opened lengthwise, a somewhat wide opening. Then, drain a moderate amount of blood, or as much as is needed.  Do the same with the other vein, then remove the bandage.
Apply a moderate pressure to both veins to prevent suffocation, and leave them until the next day; the wound will heal.  As for the veins of the temples, opening them after opening the cephalic veins is beneficial for mouth sores, diseased gums, foul ulcers, cracked lips, and foul ulcers.
Those that are in and around the nose.  To open them, have the patient sit before you, and secure their neck with a turban.  Then, turn their lips and look for the veins, one on the right of the lip and the other on the left.  Identify them by their blackness.
Around them are also thin, dark veins, which you should cut off cleanly.  If it is unclear and you don't know which one it is, aim for the largest and most prominent ones.  Do the same for the veins in the lower lip.
As for the veins under the tongue, opening them after opening the cephalic veins is beneficial for the constrictions that occur in the throat due to the disease of sore throat and mouth diseases.  To open them, have the patient sit before you facing the sun. Raise their tongue, and look under the tongue on one side and the other side for a vein; their color is dark.
Open them, but be careful not to cut them deeply, as there are arteries underneath, and excessive bleeding from those arteries might occur.  The three veins opened at the elbow are those customarily opened by people in general, and opening them is done in two ways.
Either with a wide, gentle lancet, or an olive-shaped one, until it pierces.  Or by slicing with a lancet, which is cupping [and this is its image].  Image of the wide, gentle lancet:
It is wide, as you see, to be suitable for opening hollow, full, prominent, visible, thick veins that contain thick, dark blood.  This is the image of the olive-shaped lancet:
This lancet is narrower and has a thinner tip, suitable for opening thin veins containing thin, yellowish blood.  This is the image of the cupping lancet:
This cupping lancet, suitable for slicing, comes in various widths and thicknesses, depending on the width or narrowness of the veins.  It can be used as a guide for other instruments.  It is well-known among artisans.
Now, concerning the basilic vein, one of these three veins.  The benefit of opening it is that it draws blood from illnesses located under the throat and neck, towards the chest and abdomen.  The phlebotomist, when opening it, must be cautious and positioned above it; if an artery lies beneath, any mistake or excess lancing will sever that artery.
This will cause bleeding, so it is important that it not be opened with a pointed lancet, but rather be sliced open with the cupping lancet.  If the basilic vein is not clearly visible, it should be avoided, and one should move to another vein or seek out a branch of it.
Or open the arm's cord, for it is evident, and slice it with the cupping lancet, as we have said.  If you wish to open it directly, then before tightening the arm, you should feel the location to identify the pulse, and then mark it with ink.
Then the arm is tied, and the vein is sliced at an oblique angle with the cupping lancet, as we said.  Ensure that the incision is made away from the artery's position.  When you see swelling at the location you marked with ink after tightening the bandage, that swelling is the expansion of the artery.  Avoid it.
If you see the blood during the phlebotomy surging like a child's urine, and it is thin, red blood, know that it is arterial blood.  Immediately, place your finger over it for a long time, then remove your finger; if the bleeding stops, it often stops.  Tighten the arm.
Leave it be, and warn the patient against neglecting it. Let it be on a pillow and do not move it for days until it heals.  If the bleeding does not stop, and you are overwhelmed and do not have a remedy available, sever the artery if it is visible to you, for its ends will contract and the bleeding will stop.
Or take a pistachio shell, split it, and take one half and tightly bind it to the vein with bandages and ligatures until the next day. If the bleeding stops, then do so; otherwise, treat it with the previously mentioned methods of applying cauterizing agents to stop bleeding. In most cases, cutting off its blood flow is not difficult.
Because of the small size of the wound and the secure binding of the arm, know this.  As for the dark vein, the benefit of its phlebotomy is to draw blood from the top of the head and the lower part of the body, because it is composed of a branch of the basilic and a branch of the cephalic, as we said.
The phlebotomist should be careful in his phlebotomy, because there are nerves beneath it.  If he increases the thrust of the lancet and strikes a nerve, numbness will result, difficult to resolve, and perhaps it will not heal at all.  This nerve is often apparent to the touch.
If, in some people, it is hidden and delicate, not clearly visible, then you should make your incision in it with a pulling motion, avoiding the nerve to the best of your ability. If the vein is between two nerves, then cut the vein lengthwise. As for the cephalic vein, the benefit of its phlebotomy is that it draws blood from the head.
It is beneficial for eye diseases, and in this vein, especially, if you wish to perform phlebotomy,  you should make the incision with an olive-shaped or wide rue-shaped lancet.  This is the safest of all veins, because there is neither an artery nor a nerve beneath it.
However, when performing phlebotomy, you should avoid striking the head of the muscle with the lancet and instead seek the soft area.  If the vein is not hit on the first attempt, it is not harmful to repeat the phlebotomy several times, though it may cause swelling in some individuals if not lanced on the first try.
But that swelling will cause no harm.  Regarding the method of phlebotomy, its symptoms, and what must be done to remedy them: first, one must know that phlebotomy is used either to preserve health.
Or it is used for diseases.  The type used to preserve and maintain health, and to prevent illness, should be performed on one of the three veins in the elbow: the cephalic, the basilic, and the median cubital vein.  Phlebotomy should be performed in early spring if signs of fullness appear.
Phlebotomy should be performed on a Sunday or a Tuesday after three hours of daylight have passed.  Phlebotomy used for illnesses, however, does not have a set time, but is performed when necessary, whether night or day.
At any hour and at any time.  Boys should not be bled until they reach fourteen years of age, nor should elderly men over sixty years of age.  If someone intends to perform phlebotomy for any reason...
He should cleanse his bowels before phlebotomy with a gentle enema if there is much stagnant phlegm, so that foul impurities from the bowels are not drawn into the veins during phlebotomy and harm the major organs.  The feverish, the intoxicated, and the drunk should not be bled until these conditions have passed.
One should also avoid phlebotomy after dysentery, vomiting, diarrhea, excessive sexual activity, strenuous activity, exercise, late nights, fasting, and any physical or mental exertion that weakens the body.  Then one should consider thinning the humors before phlebotomy if the blood is thick.
With food, drinks, and medications, if possible.  Then he should take a bath if nothing prevents him, or engage in some exercise, to thin the blood.  He should perform the phlebotomy in the middle of the day, as we have stated.  And he should clear his mind of all bad thoughts that day.
He should avoid worries, anger, and fear, and all bodily afflictions such as extreme fatigue, exhaustion, and sexual activity, and the like.  He should have in his room things that people are accustomed to using, such as fragrances, herbs, and amusements, as much as each person can afford.
Then the phlebotomist should sit on a higher cushion than the patient, then extend the patient's arm and the phlebotomist should rub it with his hand two or three times, then tighten the bandage with the ligature and twist it two or three times, and the tightening should be moderate.
Because if the tightening is not moderate, either excessive tightening will prevent the flow of blood, or if it is too loose, it will also prevent the flow of blood.  Then, after tightening, the patient should rub his entire hands together.
Until the veins swell and become noticeable to the touch.  Then the phlebotomist should wipe the lancet with a little old oil, especially.  Then he should place his left index finger on the same vein just below the spot where he intends to lance it slightly, so that the vein does not move and avoid the wound. Because some veins are like tendons, and they move during the lancing. And some are filled with air, so when the lancet is placed on them, they sink under the lancet and deceive the phlebotomist, and the lancet does not open the vein. And if it does open it, the opening is narrow.
Therefore, the phlebotomist should be firm and careful in all these matters. Then he lowers the lancet.  If the vein opens on that first attempt, then he does it; otherwise, he repeats it once more just below or slightly above that spot quickly if the area hasn't swollen.
If the patient's arm swells or hurts, leave it alone for a day or two, and do not tighten the bandage, for it may cause a hot swelling.  He should not enter a bath.  Then he can repeat the lancing if he wishes. If the lancet is inserted and the opening is small and the blood flow is thin.
And fear that not the desired amount of blood will come out, so reinsert the lancet into the same opening, gently and straight, and increase the opening slightly. Do this quickly before the area swells, for in many people, the area may swell with a small opening.
If you see that it has swelled, do not reinsert the lancet at all; it will not help.  Place some clarified oil on it.  It facilitates the flow of blood and is better in this location than plain oil or other ointments.
Use clarified oil in all your venesections when the blood flow is difficult.  The miraculous remedy and the schokhnaia may also do this, if one of them is applied to the area. The blood will become thin and dissolved if it is thick.
If a large swelling occurs at the site of the venesection, which often happens, especially in those who have not had it done before or if the vein opening was small, then quickly apply a sponge dipped in warm salt water to the swelling and bandage it for an hour. It will dissolve.
You should do this after the blood has completely exited the vein itself or another vein.  If a dark or greenish discoloration remains at the site after a few days, this does not harm.  If you wish, apply some dissolved gum and aloes.
Or something from the juice of the Foudang and the like.  A swelling and bump often occur when venesecting the Basilic vein.  Place your hand on it, and if you feel it pulsating when you press on it, it is a bad bump. Beware of applying any of the aforementioned remedies.
For it might bleed arterial blood, but bandage it with something astringent to firm the area, then treat it with the rest of the treatment until it heals.  One should remove from each person an amount of blood according to their strength and the prevailing color of the blood.
If the blood is black, let it flow until it turns red.  Likewise, if you see it thick, let it flow until it becomes thin.  And if it is sharp, let it flow until its sharpness subsides.  For those who are robust and full-bodied and require bloodletting in one session...
...the vein incision should be wide, and the lancet wide.  For the weak, the opposite; and it should be removed in stages and the opening narrow.  The best tool for venesection is a curved, oblique incision, not a piercing one.
This type of venesection is free of bleeding and of nerve damage. It is better and safer than transverse or longitudinal venesection.  If someone is prone to fainting during venesection, they should be given something to eat beforehand, such as bread soaked in pomegranate juice or sherbet.
If the patient is free from illness and blood is drawn in three or four sessions, if they are cool-natured, they should eat bread soaked in date syrup, or honey syrup perfumed with flowers, or good aromatic syrup before venesection.
If fainting occurs during venesection, and it is due to excessive blood loss, then the patient should be given meat broth and a delicate aromatic drink.  Perfume with rose water should be used, and the chest should be rinsed with it.  All other treatments mentioned in the section on fainting in the division should also be used.
This [treatment] is for vomiting.  However, for those who wish to further release blood flow in the arm, if the venesection was due to a great deal of vomiting and their strength is weak, then the blood should be released gradually, little by little, according to their strength over a series of days.
And if someone wishes to release more blood from the arm, and their body is strong, let them do so seven or nine hours after the initial venesection.  However, if one wishes to draw blood from the body to the opposite side from which it has flowed, then it should be done on the second or third day.
If a person has a lot of hot, inflamed blood in their body that has caused a fever, then blood should be released in one session, a large quantity being removed, and the opening widened until fainting occurs, after carefully observing all the conditions for venesection. And you should place your hand on their pulse while the blood is flowing, to prevent death from occurring instead of fainting.  This often happens if the surgeon is careless and inattentive.  This is not necessary if you intend to further release blood from the arm.
If the vein opening closes and blood flow is difficult, do not forcefully probe or twist it, as this is very bad.  Rather, either leave it until it can be opened again, or use the scalpel to remove any blood clots in the vein opening.
Or apply something dissolved in water, like salt, or a remedy like *al-fāriq* or *al-shaqazānī*, and gently probe it until blood flows. If the vein is swollen, leave it.
Do not touch it until the swelling subsides.  If further bloodletting is absolutely necessary, then either perform it above the affected area or in the other arm, or another vein.
As for bloodletting from the arm's vein, it is done in place of bloodletting from the *akhal* and *basliq* if they are unavailable or hidden, since the arm's vein is composed of them.  The procedure for bloodletting is that the patient should immerse their hand in hot water until the forearm becomes red and the vein is clearly visible. Then, a moderate ligature is placed slightly above the vein.
Then, incise the vein slightly off-center, neither horizontally nor vertically, and make the opening wide.  Incise it just above the wrist joint. If the blood does not flow easily, re-immerse the arm in hot water and let the blood flow into the water.
Until you have extracted the required amount.  If it is summer, you may not need to re-immerse the arm in hot water.  Using hot water is mostly necessary during the winter.  Bloodletting from this vein is safer than from all other veins. Because there is no important vein or nerve underneath it.  As for bloodletting from the ulnar vein in the right arm, it is beneficial for liver ailments. The procedure is to tie the wrist with a ligature, or with your hand, after immersing it in hot water until the vein swells.
Because there is no important vein or nerve underneath it.  As for bloodletting from the ulnar vein in the right arm, it is beneficial for liver ailments. The procedure is to tie the wrist with a ligature, or with your hand, after immersing it in hot water until the vein swells. The vein will be clearly visible.  Then, incise it slightly off-center.  Even if you sever it completely, it will not harm him.  Take care not to use the lancet vigorously, for beneath it lie the nerves of the fingers. The area is also bare of flesh.  Then return the arm to the hot water.
Leave it [the arm] to continue bleeding. If you do not return it to the hot water, the blood will clot in the opening of the vein and cease to flow. When you have drawn out the required amount of blood, apply grease and salt to the vein so that it does not clot too quickly.
Similarly, this procedure should be followed for any narrow vein.  As for the benefit of bloodletting from the left arm, it is beneficial for ailments of the spleen.  The procedure for bloodletting is the same as for the second [type of vein].  As for bloodletting from the saphenous vein, its benefit is for illnesses in the lower part of the body, such as ailments of the uterus.
And [for] retention of menses, kidney diseases, chronic ulcers of the thighs and legs, and similar ailments.  The method for bloodletting is to immerse the leg in hot water and apply rubbing until the veins dilate. Then, tie above the joint of the leg with a ligature. The vein is located near the heel, visible towards the big toe.
Many branches extend from it [the vein] along the leg. Bloodlet in the widest branch or at the point where it joins the heel; this is better and safer.  If you draw blood in the area along the leg, take care to avoid the nerves beneath the skin of the leg.
Make your incision by angling the lancet as if you were about to sever it, and let the lancet be sharp.  If the blood flow is difficult, then return the leg to the hot water and let the blood flow until it is drained. If the bloodletter misses the vein the first time.
If the bloodletter misses the vein the first time, he should return to the incision a little higher.  The area is safe, so there is no danger if you avoid the nerve, as we said.  The same method applies to the saphenous vein of the other leg.  As for the saphenous vein, its location is, as we said, at the heel on the outer side.
Its benefit for hip pain, if it is caused by hot blood, is as follows: Have the patient enter a bath and rapidly apply pressure, tightening their leg from the hip towards the heel with four fingers using a thin, long bandage. This is the only way it will be visible.
If it appears, then lance it in any manner; either by angling the lancet, which is preferable, or by severing it or making a slit, for its location is safe.  It is very hidden in most people, and if you do not find it...
If it does not appear at all to the touch, lance some of its branches, which appear on the back of the foot near the pinky and ring fingers, avoiding the nerves.  Release the amount of blood you desire.
Then loosen the bandage, place a compress on the lanced area, and bandage the site.  It will quickly heal.
Chapter Ninety-Six.
On Cupping and its Use.
Cupping vessels can be made of horn, wood, copper, or glass.  Cupping is done in two ways: one is cupping by incision and drawing blood, and the other is cupping without incision.
This cupping without incision is of two types.
And the cups for the cheekbones, which are the sides of the neck on both sides, and the chin cups, which are under the lower jaw from the mouth, and shoulder cups, and sacrum cups on the tailbone, and elbow cups, which are the middle of the arms, and leg cups, and heel cups.
Cupping draws blood from the fine veins spread throughout the flesh.  Therefore, it does not deplete strength like venesection, and cupping, whether with or without fire, should not be used in any disease arising from fullness until the entire body is emptied.
If cupping is needed for illness or custom, we use it at any time, at the beginning, end, and middle of the month.
For some people, when blood increases to the point where cupping is needed, they experience heaviness and headaches in their heads.  Some experience fullness and redness in their face, head, and neck. Others experience itching in their face, temples, and eyes, and dark circles and soreness in their eyes.  Some itch the site of the cupping.
Some laugh excessively, some taste blood in their mouths, and gums bleed, and others spit blood. Some sleep excessively, and some see blood, redness, slain people, and injuries in their dreams. Whenever we see any of these signs...
Especially if it's in the middle third of the month, we order cupping after two or three hours have passed.  The benefit of a cupping puncture is for heaviness in the head and water dripping down the eyes.
However, it is necessary to do this after the body has been emptied.  This cupping can be a substitute for venesection of the temples.  Caution should be taken not to use it for those with a cold head or those with a cold, as it will cause great harm.
Therefore, it should not be used by the elderly, nor by those with cold ailments in their heads, and those who habitually use it may experience forgetfulness.
Therefore, the cupper should lower the cup slightly to avoid causing forgetfulness.  As for cupping the shoulder, it is a substitute for bleeding from the temples and the jugular vein.
Therefore, it is beneficial for asthma, shortness of breath, rupturing of the breathing apparatus, coughs, and fullness.  The cupping of the shoulder should be raised somewhat, as if it is lowered, it will cause weakness in the heart and stomach.
As for cupping the temples, it is beneficial for head pains, ophthalmia, migraine, sore throats, and toothache. It is a substitute for bleeding from the jugular vein.  The cupper should be instructed not to insert the instrument too deeply to avoid cutting a blood vessel and causing excessive bleeding.
As for cupping under the chin, it is beneficial for sores in the mouth, gum disease, and similar mouth ailments. It may take the place of bleeding from the veins in the lips.  As for cupping the shoulders, it is beneficial for palpitations resulting from fullness and heat.
As for cupping the hollows of the forearms, it is beneficial for what is beneficial from bleeding the three veins: the jugular vein, the temple vein, and the vein of the forehead.  Because it draws blood from all the thin veins within the flesh and draws those thin veins from other, thicker veins, until the drawing reaches the three thick veins.
The cupper should be instructed not to press too hard with the instrument, as the area is thin and has nerves and blood vessels underneath.  As for a single cupping on the coccyx, it is beneficial for hemorrhoids and sores of the lower parts.
The cupper should be instructed to use a large, brass cupping vessel, as the area requires strong suction, and glass cupping vessels might break.  Cupping the legs noticeably reduces fullness.
Because it draws blood from the whole body, it is beneficial for chronic ailments of the kidneys, uterus, and bladder.  It promotes menstruation, and is beneficial for boils and abscesses. It takes the place of bleeding the radial and ulnar veins, although it greatly weakens the body, and fainting occurs in most people.  Cupping the ankles is similar in benefit to cupping the legs.
The method of applying cupping is to first place the empty cupping vessel and apply moderate suction without prolonging the application.  Place and remove the cupping vessel quickly, to allow the humours to rise evenly to the area.  Repeat this until the area becomes red and open.
When the redness of blood appears, then gently apply pressure, and resume suction gradually.  Then assess the condition of the body.  If the patient's skin is delicate and porous, only one application of pressure should be made, to avoid causing a sore.
The cupper should widen the pressure slightly and deepen it a little, and regulate the suction gently and with light movement.  If the blood is thick, the pressure should be applied twice.  The first time, to open a path for the thin, watery blood; and the second, to remove the thick blood.
If the blood is very thick, the pressure should be applied a third time to achieve the desired result.  In general, if a little blood is to be drawn, one pressure is sufficient.  If a lot of blood is to be drawn, more pressure is applied; and if the blood is judged to be thick.
The pressure should be deep. The moderate limit in pressure is to only penetrate the skin.  What ointments should be used when applying cupping, and what waters, and what should the cupper beware of?  As for those whose skin is thick, hard, dry, and pores narrow...
The sites for cupping should be anointed with softening, relaxing, and dissolving ointments.  In summer, examples include  the ointment of Khirri, or violet ointment, or sweet almond ointment, or pumpkin seed ointment.
In winter, examples include narcissus ointment, lily ointment, chamomile ointment, or hyacinth ointment, and similar ones. If the excess is thick and cold, the ointment should be one of  marjoram ointment, hyssop ointment, benzoin ointment, or rue ointment, and similar ones.
If the cupper has wide pores and soft flesh, the use of ointment should be avoided.  These individuals should wash their cupping marks after the procedure with rose water, or cold water, or elderberry water, or gourd water, or borage water, and the like.  And as for those whose blood is excessively moist...
He should wash his cupping marks with vinegar, or rue and sumac water, and the like.  As for those whose excess is thick, he should wash their cupping marks with old wine, or marjoram water, or rue or chamomile decoction, and the like.  It is important to avoid cupping in the bath, and after the bath.
Rather, it is necessary to use [the remedies] an hour or two after emerging from the bath.  And it is not appropriate for anyone to sleep after cupping.  This is what the cupper and the leech should consider before and after cupping.
One must first consider whether the cupper or leech is bilious, and if the blood is predominantly sharp and inflammatory.  Then they should take cooling foods such as pomegranate, endive, vinegar, lettuce, sassafras, and the like. Their diet should consist of poultry, mutton stew, and similar meats.
And if one's temperament is cold, they should be given honeyed drinks, and drinks made from myrrh or sassafras sassafras, and consume moderate fragrant wine, which is between old and new.  They should be ordered to eat less food, and their diet should consist of poultry, quail, sparrows, and pigeon stew.  On the day of cupping and bloodletting, drinks should be more plentiful than food.
Sometimes, certain individuals may be given antidote, musk medication, or shiltha before cupping and before or after bloodletting to strengthen the principal organs and thin the blood.  However, this should not be given to those who are feverish.
As for cupping that does not require a specific condition, it is the cupping placed on the liver, spleen, breasts, abdomen, navel, kidney area, and hip joints, because these organs cannot tolerate the condition.  Instead, the intent is to draw blood from one organ to another.
For example, placing a cupping on the breasts in cases of epistaxis, or to remove a cold wind that may have affected an organ, such as placing a cupping on the abdomen and navel. This loosens the organ, warms it, and alleviates pain by resolving that wind.
It may also be placed on the kidneys if blockages or stones are present.  Through its strong suction, it may open the blockage or dislodge the stones.  Likewise, it is used on the liver and spleen when wind affects them. These cuppings may also be used by suction alone, without a cup.
It may be used with fire, or filled with lukewarm water for conditions of lameness.  This involves filling a large cupping with hot water alone or water in which herbs suitable for this purpose have been boiled.
Then, filled, it is placed on the affected area, held, and removed, repeated as needed. This is the method of using a cupping with fire.
Its mouth opening should be two fingers wide, as depicted, and its depth about half a span.  A small hole, large enough for a needle, should be made in one side, near the middle.  Made of thick-rimmed Chinese or brass.
It should be smooth, flat, and polished so as not to injure the organ when placed upon it.  A transverse bar of brass or iron is placed in the middle to hold the candle for the fire. This cupping can be made larger or smaller, according to the ailment.
The practitioner must consider the user's constitution; cupping for children and thin individuals is different from cupping for strong, robust people.  As for how to apply this cupping with fire to the affected area, a wick made of tightly wound linen or a small candle of pitch is placed on the central bar in the cupping device.
So that the heat rises from the bottom to the top of the cupping device, to avoid burning the patient. Then it is placed on the affected area, and a finger is placed on the hole we mentioned.  So when the cupping is held, the finger need not be removed.
Steam will then emerge from that hole, and the cupping device will adhere to the area. Then the wick is adjusted, and it is replaced if necessary.  However, the cupping used for dropsy is without a central bar and without a hole.
Instead, it is used by filling it with water and placing it directly on the affected area.  This is its image/form.
The larger the cupping device, the better, as it can hold more water.
Chapter Ninety-Seven.
On applying leeches.
Leeches are used mostly on parts of the body where cupping cannot be applied, either because the area is small, such as the lip, gums, and the like, or because the body part is exposed, such as the finger and nose, and the like.
To use them, select leeches from pure, unpolluted freshwater, then leave them in fresh water for a day and a night so that they become hungry and have nothing in their bodies. Then the body is first bled by phlebotomy or cupping, and then the affected area is cleaned.
Until it turns red, then a leech is placed on it.  If it fills up and falls off, that is good.  If it's possible to draw out the matter with cupping, this is more beneficial.  Otherwise, wash the area with vinegar, then with plenty of water, and massage and squeeze it.  If blood continues to flow after the leeches fall off, and it is a trickle, then soak a linen cloth in cold water.
Place it over the area until the trickle stops. If there is a lot of blood, sprinkle powdered alum or astringents of similar kinds over it to stop it, or put peeled halves of chickpea over the area.
Leave it until the chickpea adheres to the area, and the bleeding will stop.  If the leeches need to be reapplied, and other leeches are available, do not reuse the same leeches.  If the leeches refuse to attach, then the area should be wiped with fresh blood.
Or, insert a needle into the area until some blood comes out, then place the leech.  If it senses blood, it will attach to the spot. If you want it to fall off, sprinkle some acacia, salt, or ash on it, and it will fall off the spot.
Chapter Three.
On Fractures.
This chapter also, from the craft of medicine, concerns the setting of fractures and dislocations in bones.
Know, my children, that this chapter is claimed by ignorant physicians and laypeople, those who have never examined the writings of the ancients or read a single word from them.
For this reason, this art of medicine is lacking in our land, and I have never encountered a skilled practitioner in it. However, I gained what I gained through extensive reading of the writings of the ancients and my diligence in understanding them, so that I extracted knowledge from them.  Then I adhered to practice and expertise throughout my life.
I have presented to you in this chapter everything my knowledge encompasses. My experience has been applied to it after I brought it closer to you, purifying it of unnecessary length, and condensing it to the utmost brevity.  I have clarified it completely and have depicted for you many images of the instruments used in it.
This is, as in the preceding chapters, an enhancement of clarity. There is no power except with God, the Most High, the Great.
The first chapter.
This chapter contains summaries and essentials concerning the breaking of bones.  Before we begin to discuss the fractured and dislocated limbs individually, it is necessary to offer general statements and sections at the beginning of this chapter. This will first require you to understand them and grasp their true meaning, you and all others who are eager to learn this noble craft.
If someone suffers a fracture, dislocation, sprain, or fall, one should first attend to the reduction or easing, or both, of the injury. Unless prevented by factors such as weakness, or if the affected person is a child or an old man, or if the weather is extremely hot or extremely cold.
Then, his diet should be limited to cold legumes, poultry, and hare.  Drinks, fatty meats, overeating, and any food that causes a flood of blood to the veins should be avoided until swelling subsides and the risk of further fluid buildup in the affected area is gone.
Then, the patient should return to his usual regimen.  If the fractured bone is beginning to knit, the patient should consume foods that are nourishing, dense, and strong, with a viscous quality, such as barley, rice, heads of grain, and the bellies of cattle. Eggs, soft fish, and thick drinks, and similar things, will expedite and improve the healing of the fracture.  Know that broken bones in strong men and old people will rarely rejoin as perfectly as originally.
Due to the dryness and hardness of their bones, bones that are extremely flexible, like those of young children, may knit together. However, nature forms a substance resembling glue, thick and adhesive, around the fractured bone on all sides, binding the fragments together.
And binds them together until they attain their original strength and firmness, so that nothing interferes with their function.
Therefore, the patient's diet should consist of foods with strength, viscosity, and density, as mentioned. Know that fractures vary according to the affected body part, as a fracture of the leg differs from a fracture of the head, and a fracture of the chest differs from a fracture of the spine.
And so do all other body parts. We will describe each type of fracture in detail in its own section, and the nature of a bone fracture may also vary within itself.
For the fracture may be a simple crack without splinters, or it may be lengthwise with splinters and detached or non-detached fragments.  The fracture may also be accompanied by a wound or tearing of the skin, or it may be a slight fissure.
Each type requires a specific method of reduction, as will be detailed in its proper place.  A sign of a fractured bone is its distortion, unevenness, visibility, and grating sound when touched with the hand.
If there is no visible distortion, grating, or discomfort when palpating the bone, and the patient does not experience significant pain, then there is no fracture; it may be a sprain, a minor fracture, or a minor fissure.  Therefore, it should not be moved or prodded at all.
Instead, apply suitable medications to be mentioned later, then gently bind it.  Know that if a bone is fractured in two without splinters, each piece has separated from its neighbour.
Therefore, you must promptly realign and straighten it before a hot swelling occurs. If a hot swelling does develop, leave it for a few days until the inflammation subsides, then realign it gently and skillfully.
Know that setting and straightening a bone without splinters is easier.  Then it is bandaged as will be described later. If the bone has splinters, the injured limb (arm or leg) must be extended from both sides.
Either by your hands, if the limb is small, or with two ropes, or with both rope and hands.  Place the limb on a level surface in its natural position.  Once the fractured bone pieces are extended, then carefully return the protruding parts to their correct place using any method that you can devise gently.
Make every effort to avoid causing the patient pain or discomfort.  Make every effort to fit one bone piece against its mate in the best possible position.  At that time, you should touch and feel the pieces with your hands. If you find any irregularity, correct and realign them to the best of your ability.
Beware of excessive stretching and forceful prodding, as many ignorant people do.  Often, their actions cause inflammation or swelling in the limb, as I have repeatedly observed.
Then, after the alignment, precision, and bandaging, keep the limb at rest and quiet. Warn the patient not to move it during wakefulness or sleep, and during changes of posture, restlessness, bowel movements, or any other movement to the fullest extent possible.  Ensure that the limb's position is safe from pain.
If, in the course of maintaining the limb's position, the patient feels pain, then move the limb to a position in which no pain is felt.  Ensure that this new position is straight and aligned.
To prevent the limb from becoming crooked if it is set.  As for how to bandage a fractured limb, as I am describing to you, understand that broken limbs vary in size, and their conditions.  Smaller ones, like the arm, fingers, forearm, and similar parts...
Therefore, the bandages for small parts should be soft and gentle.  For larger parts, such as the thigh, back, and chest, the bandages should be firm and strong.  A wide bandage is necessary for large limbs, to apply even pressure on all sides, without any inconsistencies.
Then, after you have finished aligning it, apply the appropriate plaster. Apply a soft bandage to the fracture site.  Then start wrapping the bandage around the fracture itself three or four times, depending on the limb's size.  Slightly tighten the bandage, then continue wrapping it to the upper portion of the fracture.
Tighten the bandage less than you did for the fractured area, and then move the wrapping away from the fracture slightly, loosening the bandage gradually until the correct position is attained.  Then take another bandage and wrap it around the fractured area as well.
Wrap the bandage further, continuing towards the lower part of the fracture.  Maintain the tension and looseness as described in the first wrap on the upper part.  Then place soft bandages or cloths between the layers to correct any misalignment of the fracture.
If there is misalignment, correct it; otherwise, do not insert anything.  Then wrap another bandage around it.  Then, if there is no swelling or inflammation in the limb, apply firm splints to the bandages.
If there is swelling or inflammation, apply something to reduce the swelling and inflammation. Leave it for a few days, then apply splints at that time.  Let the splints be made of cut, prepared strips of reeds or from the wood of sieves.
Made of pine, palm fronds, rushes, or similar readily available materials.  Each splint should be of the same size and shape.
However, the splint placed directly on the fracture should be slightly thicker and wider than the others.  The length of the splint should be appropriate for the size of the fractured limb.  Image of the splint:.
Then, wrap the splints with another bandage, tightening it in the same way as the first bandage.  Then tie securely with strong threads, as we described earlier, making sure the tightening is greater over the fractured area. The tighter the wrap, the closer it is to the fracture.
The threads should be of medium thickness and not too thin.  Preferably, use damp linen threads, as thick threads, like those used by the ignorant, made from twisted linen strips, is a serious error.
Because tightening with them is disproportionate, and thin threads are also unsuitable, as you cannot achieve the desired tension.  Also, there should be at least one finger's width between splints.
If the patient is irritated by the edges of the splints after proper tightening, place soft pads or fluffy wool beneath them so nothing irritates him.  If the fracture is accompanied by a wound and the skin has been punctured, we will discuss this separately.
Know that not every fractured limb should be splinted from the first day.  If the limb is large, splints should not be applied until five, seven, or more days later, depending on the risk of a hot swelling.
This is a description of the bandages used by the ancients to treat fractures, dislocations, and sprains—a concise, common bandage for fractures, suitable for most temperaments, especially children and women, as it is neither excessively hot nor cold.
Take the flour dust, the fine residue that clings to the millstones during grinding. Knead it as it is, without sifting it with egg white, into a consistency that is neither thick nor thin, then dry it in the sun.
Another bandage for fractures, dislocations, and sprains: Take ten dirhams each of mastich, ladanum, acacia, rasīn, and mugath, five dirhams each of myrrh and saﬀlower, and twenty dirhams of ashl (a type of wood).  Also, twenty dirhams of Armenian or Roman clay. Grind all the ingredients together, mixing them with ashl water or egg white if the patient's temperament is hot.  Then use this bandage; it is well-suited, quickly sets fractured bones, and is suitable for most people because of its balanced nature.
Another bandage useful for fractures and sprains: Take ten dirhams each of mugath, mastich, and white hellebore, five dirhams each of myrrh and saﬀlower, six dirhams of acacia, and twenty dirhams of Armenian clay. Grind all together finely, sift, knead with water or egg white, and apply.
A bandage for joints and bones dislocated from their sockets, which relieves the pain and throbbing of bone and fractures: Take prepared wool, dip it in boiled vinegar and oil, and apply it to the affected area. This bandage is not a strong means of setting the bones.
However, it is excellent for relieving hot swelling and pain. Another bandage for setting broken bones: Take fig leaves and wild poppy leaves, grind them together, and apply them as a wet compress. Another concise bandage is used in the case of a fractured bone's displacement.
To further reduce the swelling, take one part each of hellebore root, chamomile, pansy, and carnation flour. Grind all together and knead into a poultice if the limb is not inflamed. If it is inflamed, knead it with coriander water or regular water and apply.
Another stronger resolving bandage is used when a hard swelling occurs with bone displacement: Take one part each of hellebore root, flaxseed, fenugreek, rosemary, pansy, and chamomile.
Grind all together and knead with vinegar water, fresh water, or a poultice, according to the heat of the limb and its cooling.  Hippocrates, however, did not mention in his book that this should be applied to a fractured limb during setting.
However, the preparation made of wax and oil alone, should be of a medium consistency between thick and thin. Galen, on the other hand, believed that dry things with some heat, such as myrrh, aloe, and frankincense, and similar substances, should be applied to the fractured limb during setting.
A dressing for weakness and pain: Take equal parts of mugwort, roasted chickpeas, scraped human hair or bird feathers, hellebore, and salt. Grind, sieve, knead, and apply as a dressing.  The amount of ligament that should remain...
Then, it should be loosened.  Observe; if the injury does not cause pain, irritation, or displacement of the fractured bone, do not loosen it for many days.  If, however, there is severe irritation, disturbing pain, or swelling at the site,
Then, immediately loosen it and do not delay; remove the dressing.  Then take a soft cloth or a wet sea sponge, dip it in lukewarm water, and wash the area until the irritation and pain subside.  Then allow the limb to rest for an hour.
Then, apply softened wool soaked in vinegar and oil, or rose oil, and bandage it overnight, so that the hot swelling subsides, the limb's swelling is reduced, and the pain disappears.  Then, reapply gentle tension and a light bandage, but do not tighten it as much as before.
And treat it gently until it heals.  If you see that the swelling, redness, pain, and inflammation, and all symptoms have completely gone, and a bandage and tension are needed, then redo it as you did originally.  If nothing of what we have mentioned happens to the limb,
Then, do not loosen it until three, four, five, or seven days, or even twenty days, all depending on the condition of the limb, as we said, until the fracture is set and the flesh around it begins to heal.
Then, increase the tension more than your original tension, and also increase the patient's nourishment, as mentioned before.  If you see the fracture site has dried and wasted more than necessary, know that nourishment is not reaching it.
Loosen it with lukewarm water each time you loosen it, every three days, and slightly reduce the tension.  In this way, nourishment reaches the limb and it heals quickly.  As for what the ignorant among the setters of fractures do, of breaking the limb again...
For if it is not set correctly the first time, but is set crookedly, that is an error on their part and a great deception.  Even if it were correct, the ancients would have mentioned it in their books and practiced it.  I have seen no trace of this from any of them. And the correct course of action is not to do it.
The second chapter.
In fractures of the head.
Fractures of the head are numerous, their forms varied, and their causes diverse.  Some fractures are caused by a sword blow, and these can extend all the way to the peritoneum beneath the bone. As the ax does to wood.
And so this type of fracture is called "ax-like".  Alternatively, the sword may have cut only a portion of the bone, exposing only one side, without penetrating to the other side. This type of fracture is called a "simple extraction," and the wound from these two types of fractures can be either large or small.
Some fractures are caused by contusion or impact, such as a blow from a stone, or a fall onto a stone, or similar. This fracture may either penetrate the membrane beneath the bone, or it may be on the surface of the bone.
And the wound from these fractures can also be either large or small.  Some fractures are hidden within the bone, hairline cracks, very slight separations.
Therefore, this type of fracture is called a hairline fracture.  One such fracture occurs from a fall, or a blow from a stone or similar, where the surface of the bone is driven inward, causing a depression in the area, similar to how a piece of copper is indented when struck, a part of it moving inwards.
This is most common in the soft skull, such as in young children.  All of these types of fractures may have detached or non-detached fragments. We will discuss the treatment for each in its place, and we will learn to recognize all these types of fractures through examination.
Examination with probes and removal of putrid flesh from them.  The hairline fracture is recognized by examining the bone, smoothing it, and staining it with ink; the fracture will then appear black.  As for the treatment of the fracture, first look at the patient's symptoms.
If you see symptoms that clearly indicate fear, such as vomiting bile, stretching, loss of intellect, loss of voice, fainting, high fever, bulging and redness of the eyes, and similar symptoms, do not approach the patient or treat him, for death will almost certainly befall him with these symptoms.
If you see symptoms that do not alarm you and hope for his recovery, then take action in treating him.  This is if the injured person comes to you in the initial stages of the injury, and this is in the winter.
In any case, you should strive to remove the bone before the fourteenth day.  If it is in the summer, you should hasten the removal of the bone before the seventh day, before the membrane beneath the bone deteriorates, leading to the symptoms we described.
If the bone fracture has reached the membrane covering the brain, and there is also shattering and contusion, then you should cut away the shattered and contused portion, as I describe to you: shave the head of the injured patient.
Expose the bone in any way possible, according to the nature of the wound and what is easiest for the patient. If, during the exposure, you encounter bleeding or a hot swelling, then deal with it appropriately.
This means to fill the area with rags soaked in a drink of rosewater and oil, and clean the wound until the swelling subsides and the bleeding stops. Then begin to adjust and remove the bone, in one of two ways.
One way is to cut the bone with a thin, narrow blade.  This is its depiction:.
Then use another cut, a little wider than the first. This is its depiction:.
Then use yet another cut, wider still than the second.  You should have a series of different cuts, some wider, some narrower, all with extremely sharp edges, made of Indian steel or good-quality wootz.
Use gentleness when striking the cut, so as not to dislodge the head and injure it. If the bone is strong and solid, it is necessary to pierce around it before using the cuts, with the so-called non-piercing awls.
Because they do not penetrate beyond the skull bone, as the awl's head, sharper than the rest of the tool, is rounded like a ring or small circle. This prevents it from sinking and passing through the thickness of the bone.
You should have many such awls, each suitable for the thickness of the bone.  Thus, for each skull, you should have an awl with a sharp point of the appropriate length and width, corresponding to the skull's thickness. Here is an illustration of three types. Of large, medium, and small awls.
To pierce around the fractured bone, place the awl on the bone and rotate it with your fingers until you know the bone has been penetrated. Then move the awl to another spot, leaving a space between each puncture the thickness of a lead rod or similar.
Then, with the nippers, cut between each pair of holes.  Do this with as much gentleness as possible, as we have said, to remove the bone, either by hand or with another appropriate tool.
Such as the rasps and fine forceps.  One must be extremely careful not to touch the peritoneum with the awl or nippers. If you have scraped the bone free of the peritoneum, if it was attached, and have removed it, it should then be prepared.
The roughness remaining on the bone is smoothed with another tool similar to the nippers, but it should be finer and gentler than other nippers.  If any small bone fragments or splinters remain, carefully remove them with the appropriate tools.
Then, after that, treat the wound with the compresses and ointments described later.  As for the other approach, it is a straightforward method, free from risk. Galen mentioned it and praised it greatly. This is what he said. First, you must begin by exposing the part of the bone where the fracture is most severe and prominent. Once you have exposed that part, place the tip of this lens-shaped nipper under it. This is its image/form:.
The lens-shaped part of it is smooth, cutting nothing.  The sharp part extends along its sides, as you see, so that the lens-shaped part rests against the peritoneum, and the sharp edge of the nipper is against the bone. Then strike the nipper from one side.
With a small hammer, so that you carefully sever all the bone as it turns, and you are safe from harming the membrane; there will be no frightening accident, even if the surgeon is the most ignorant and timid person, yes, even if he were asleep.
If any part of the membrane remains attached to the bone in some places, scrape it off with the tip of the lens-shaped nipper itself, removing it gently.  It will come off without harm or fear.
If the fracture of the bone did not reach the membrane, and the broken surface of the bone remained rough and with splinters, then you must remove that roughness and those splinters with small, various-sized tools.  Choose the one best suited for each spot, according to what the work requires.
The broken bone, with its shape, should be scraped first with the widest of the tools, then with a narrower one after that. Continue in this way, using successively narrower and finer tools until you get to the finest and most delicate one.
For all smaller, hairline fractures and delicate breaks, a treatment must be used for each one according to what promotes its repair.  This is something not hidden from anyone with even a slight understanding of the craft, and who has considered what we have written and shown about major fractures.
If the membrane remains exposed after removing the bone, a linen cloth, sized to the wound, should be soaked in rose oil and placed over the wound's opening.  Then, another cloth, folded or triangular, should be taken. Soak it in rose water and oil, place it over the first cloth, and do this with the least possible weight to avoid burdening the peritoneum.  Then, apply a broad bandage over it, tightening it only enough to hold the wound in place.
Leave it with this treatment for one or two days until the hot swelling subsides. Then, remove the bandage and use the following drying remedies:  iris roots, caraway flour, kandar pollen, and zarand and similar substances.  Make these into powders.
Dust the wound with these dry powders.  In general, use a remedy that cleanses but does not sting.  Strive, during your treatment, to keep the wound clean, free of fat, filth, or pus.  Do not allow pus to accumulate.
For if pus accumulates on the brain membrane, it corrupts and rots it, causing the afflicted great harm.  This may occur in the peritoneum of the head when the bone is exposed, especially if its treatment is neglected.
If a dark discoloration appears on its surface, and the affected person presents the symptoms we mentioned, know that he is certainly doomed.  If the discoloration resulted from a medicine applied, and the medicine's potency is such that it caused this discoloration,
You should take one part honey and three parts rose oil, thoroughly mix them, and then apply the mixture to a cloth.  Place the cloth on the peritoneum, and treat it with the appropriate remedies until healed.
Chapter Three.
Fractured nose repair.
Know that only the upper portions of the nose, or one of them, can be broken, because they are bony.  The lower part is cartilaginous; it does not break but may be injured, bent, or punctured.
If one side of the nose is broken, you should insert your little finger into the nostril, and straighten the fracture from the inside with your index finger and thumb on the outside, returning the nose to its normal shape.  Do this gently, avoiding causing the patient pain.
If the fracture is high up on the nose and cannot be reached by the finger, it should be straightened with a blunt, slightly thickened instrument. If the fracture is in both sides, do the same.  Promptly treat the fracture on the first day following the break.
If possible, or else after the seventh or tenth day, when the hot swelling subsides, insert a thread of linen into the nostril, if the fracture is on one side, or two threads if the fracture is on both sides.
Let the threads be thick enough to fill the nostril. Some early bone-setters said to soak the threads in clarified butter and change them every day.  I do not agree with this, but the threads should be soaked in egg white mixed with mill dust.
Then leave the threads until the bone is set and the cartilage hardens. You may insert goose quill tubes, wrapped in soft linen, into the nasal cavity where the threads are placed, to hold the fractured nose more firmly and prevent the patient from difficulty breathing.
This is not essential; if you wish, do it, or if you wish, make the threads. If, during your work, a hot swelling appears on the nose, bandage the nose with linen or with cotton soaked in vinegar and rose ointment or some diachylon ointment.
If no hot swelling appears, you should bandage it from the outside with semolina flour and crushed kandar mixed with egg white, then place soft linen over it. Do not bind the nose at all, if the nasal bones are fractured in small pieces.
Or if it shattered, you must cut through it and remove it with the appropriate instrument. Then sew up the gap and treat it with ointments suitable for healing and causing suppuration. If a wound occurs inside the nose, you must treat it with threads and use lead tubes. Until it heals.
Chapter Four.
On the setting of the lower jaw if it is broken.
If the lower jaw is broken, but the fracture is not accompanied by a wound, and if the fracture is only from the outside and it is not broken in two and does not curve inward, then its identification is easy.
If the fracture is on the right side, the index finger of the left hand should be inserted into the patient's mouth.  Likewise, if the fracture is on the left side, the index finger of the right hand should be inserted, and gently lift the bump of the fracture from the inside to the outside.
Your other hand, from the outside of the bone, controls its alignment.  If the jaw fracture has broken in two, then traction should be applied from both sides in a straight line until its alignment is achieved. If it has affected the teeth, they should be treated.
Or, if parts have separated, tie together what you hope to remain joined, with a golden or silver thread or silk thread. Then place a splint of wood on the fractured jaw.  Then place a folded cloth over it, and over the cloth a large, tight bandage or a piece of leather equal in length to the jaw. Then tie it from above according to how you can tie it to match its joining, so that it does not dislocate.  Instruct the patient to rest and abstain from strenuous activity. Provide the patient with soft, easily digestible food.  If you suspect a change in form has occurred, then begin treatment again on the third day.
Then tie it from above according to how you can tie it to match its joining, so that it does not dislocate.  Instruct the patient to rest and abstain from strenuous activity. Provide the patient with soft, easily digestible food.  If you suspect a change in form has occurred, then begin treatment again on the third day. Then repair the bandage with flour from a millstone and egg white, or with semolina flour, after you have removed the splint.  Place a soft compress over the bandage.  As long as the bandage adheres and the bone's condition hasn't changed, leave it in place.
Do not remove it until the fracture heals and strengthens.  Often this fracture takes three weeks to strengthen.  If, during that time, a hot swelling appears, use the methods we mentioned previously to reduce it, until it subsides.
And if the fracture is accompanied by a wound, then if a piece or pieces of bone have become detached, gently remove them with an appropriate instrument.  If the wound opening is narrow, widen it with a forceps, as needed.
Then, if you have removed all the bone fragments, if the wound is wide, suture it.  Otherwise, apply one of the suitable ointments. And treat the wound until it heals.
Chapter Five.
On the setting of the clavicle if it is fractured.
The clavicle is most often fractured from the front, at the acromial end.  Its fracture occurs in one of three ways: either it fractures and splinters into two pieces without causing any fragments, and this is easiest to set.
Or the fracture may include fragments, which is more difficult to set.  Or the fracture may be accompanied by a wound.  If the fracture is without a wound, have two assistants; one to hold the arm adjacent to the fractured clavicle, and the other to extend the neck towards the opposite side.
Then straighten the fracture with your fingers until its shape is correct, and there are no protuberances or irregularities. If further extension is required, place a ball of linen or wool under the patient's armpit.
Adjust the bone to the extent needed, extend and raise the clavicle, and press the ball with your hand until the fracture is properly aligned. If you cannot draw the clavicle outward because it has retracted into the body, the patient should lie on their back.
Place a moderately sized cushion under the patient's shoulder, and have the assistant press down on the shoulder to raise the retracted clavicle. Then, correct and align the fracture with your fingers.
If you feel that a fragment of the clavicle has broken off and is moving, you should carefully separate and remove it. If the fragment is lodged in the bone, use one of the prepared instruments to cut it out. After placing the instrument that supports the diaphragm, which is made of wood or iron, underneath the clavicle... (and here is its image).
It resembles a spoon without any ornamentation, its width adjusted to the size of the bone, and its length to the extent of the work needed.  Let it have two ends; one wider and the other narrower, as you see.
If the wound you made while removing the bone fragment is wide and you fear inflammation, stitch the edges of the wound together. If the wound is small, or you fear serious inflammation, close the wound with sutures and bandages, in proportion to the size of the wound opening.
If there is a spreading inflammatory swelling, soak the bandage in rose-water and vinegar or a medicinal drink and apply it.  If the bone is fractured without a wound or incision, apply a bandage made of mill-dust and egg white to the bone. Place the soft splint on it, and then place a pad under his armpit if needed. Then take a bandage very long, with a width of one span or thereabouts.  Then apply a folded bandage over the splint and the dressing.  Then take a splint of thin wood. Its width should be three fingers' breadth and likewise in length.  Then enclose it in a cloth, then enclose that cloth with the splint in the part of the bandage that falls on the fracture site.  Then bind the bandage around the fracture as you wrap. And bandage it around his neck and under his healthy armpit and under his injured armpit, and repeat on every side, and how you see that the bandage will securely set the fracture is something clear to you.
The entire aim is that the splint not move from the fractured bone. Therefore, you should examine the patient every day.  Whenever the ligament loosens and you see the splint has shifted, correct it and tighten the bandage.  Then have the patient sleep on their back, and place a small pillow under their armpit when they sleep at night.
So that their arm is raised from their side, and the fractured collarbone is raised with the shoulder or the arm is tied to the neck.  Do not loosen the bandage unless a wound or swelling occurs in the area within twelve days.
Then renew the dressing if you see reason for it. Maintain the compression and leave it until the fractured collarbone is healed and firm, and it strengthens and becomes more stable within twenty-eight days. And in some people, it may be in less than that.
Chapter six.
Concerning the setting of a fractured shoulder.  The shoulder rarely fractures at its broad part; rather, its bones fracture.  When a fracture occurs in one of its parts, or if it breaks in the middle, the type of fracture is identified by palpation.  Then, according to the appearance of the fracture, apply a compress.
Adjust it and return it to its natural shape by every means possible.  Then, apply a mixture of mill dust, egg white, and soft flaxseed. Place a folded cloth over it, then put a wide splint of wood on top.
Make the splint as wide as the entire shoulder, or slightly wider. If there is a swelling under the splint in any part of the shoulder, smooth that swelling with soft flaxseed until the splint lies flat. Then, tie a long bandage over it.
Tie it firmly and secure the splint so it does not shift from its position.  Examine the bandage every day; whenever the bandage loosens, tighten it and adjust the splint if it moves.  Let the patient lie on their sound side.  The shoulder will be healed within twenty days.
One or twenty-five days.  When this period is complete, loosen the bandage and you will be safe, for it is among the bones that do not fear shattering or dislocation. If a piece of bone protrudes and is irritating the skin, then cut into it and remove it. Do what was mentioned regarding the treatment of a fractured collarbone, in terms of relieving any heat or swelling that occurs.
Chapter Seven.
On setting a fractured rib.
The chest can break in the middle, but this is rare.  However, the ends are more likely to fracture and splinter.  Symptoms of a fractured middle section include tilting downward, severe pain, and difficulty breathing, as well as coughing.
Sometimes blood may be coughed up, and the fracture in the bone will be evident and perceptible to touch.  Treatment involves the patient lying on their back with a cushion between their shoulders.  Then, their sides are pressed together and the ribs are brought together manually, gently smoothing out the affected areas from all possible angles.
Keep applying pressure until the bone returns to its proper shape. Then, apply a bandage and splint, placing a thin board made of poplar, willow, or a similar lightweight wood over the bandage. Then gently secure the board to the fractured bone to prevent its displacement. Wrap the bandage around the back in a circular motion, tightening it firmly.  Inspect the bandage frequently, and whenever it loosens, tighten it again.
If the bandage needs to be removed due to swelling, pain, or inflammation at the site, then promptly remove the bandage and correct the affected area appropriately.  Replace the bandage if deemed necessary. Apply a remedy and maintain the pressure until healing occurs.
Chapter Eight.
In the treatment of fractured ribs, know that fractures typically occur in the thick parts of the ribs near the spine, and their anterior ends.  This is because they are cartilaginous; this fact is readily apparent when examining them with the fingers.
To set a fractured rib, align the fracture with the fingers until the shape is corrected. Then, bandage and splint the fractured bone if necessary. If the fractured rib is angled inward, it will cause the patient intense pain.
And the pain is like the pain that comes from a ruptured bladder, because the bone pierces the diaphragm, and also causes shortness of breath, coughing, and significant blood spitting.  This is difficult to treat, and many complicated remedies have been attempted in the past.
Some have said that the patient should eat foods that produce gas and wind, so that the abdomen inflates, expands, and the fracture is pushed outward.  We dislike this, lest it exacerbate inflammation if it has not already occurred; if it has already occurred, it will worsen and confirm it.
Some said that a cupping device should be applied to the area and then vigorously suctioned.  This is more analogous to a logical approach, but there is concern that the cupping device, due to the area's weakness, will pull excessively at the site. Others suggested that the area should be covered with wool soaked in hot oil.
The space between the ribs is filled until the ligaments are flattened when wrapped around. Then, the patient is treated for a ruptured bladder, with dietary and medicinal remedies. If the patient is severely afflicted, they cannot bear it. The bone was piercing the diaphragm painfully, and we feared for the patient.  Therefore, we must incise the area, expose the fractured rib, then place the instrument that protects the peritoneum (previously described) beneath it, and carefully cut and remove the bone.
Then, if the wound is large, we bring the edges together with stitches and treat it with ointments until it heals.  If a hot abscess occurs in the meantime, promptly apply remedies soaked in rose oil to the area and treat the patient internally to relieve the swelling.
He should lie on the side on which he sleeps more easily until he heals.
Chapter Nine.
On the setting of the vertebrae of the back and neck.
Concerning the bones of the neck, if they are fractured, this rarely occurs.  More often, they are bruised.  Likewise, the vertebrae of the spine.  If this happens to someone, and you wish to know whether they will heal or not, If you see that his hands have become relaxed, numb, and dead, and he cannot move them, extend them, or close them; and if you pinch or prick them with a needle, he feels no pain, then know that in most cases he will not recover, and is doomed.
But if he moves them and feels the pinching and pricking, then know that the spinal marrow has been spared, and the patient will recover with treatment.  If a similar injury affects the vertebrae of the spine, and you wish to know whether they will also recover or not,
Examine his legs. If you see that they are relaxed and the same condition has occurred in them as in his hands, and then, if he lies on his back, urine and feces are expelled involuntarily, and if he lies on his stomach, urine is expelled involuntarily. And if he lies on his back and tries to urinate, he cannot, then know that he is doomed.  Do not bother with his treatment.  If none of these things occur, the matter is less serious.  Treatment for what has occurred should involve attempts to alleviate the hot swelling.
By applying rose oil alone, or with roasted egg yolks, to the injured vertebrae three times a day, until the hot swelling subsides. Then, apply a strengthening, dry dressing to the area, securing it with a bandage.  Order him rest and stillness.
He should sleep only on the side that does not cause him pain until he recovers. If a splinter or something else has broken off the bone from the injury, then it is necessary to cut open the skin and remove that piece of bone. Then, if the wound is large, bring the edges together with stitches, and treat with healing ointments until it heals. If the last bone of the coccyx (the tailbone) is fractured, then insert the thumb of your left hand into the anus.
Then, align the broken bone with the other hand, as much as possible and achievable.  Then apply a bandage and splint, if needed, and secure it.
If you feel a fractured splinter in it, cut open the area and remove it. Treat the wound with the previous treatments until healed.
Chapter Ten.
On the setting of a fractured hip.
Hip bones rarely fracture; if they do, the fracture typically involves splintering at the ends, longitudinal cracking, and inward tilting.  The patient experiences pain, throbbing, and numbness in the affected leg.
To set it, run your hand over it to determine the nature of the fracture. If the fracture is only at the ends, adjust the ends so they match the natural shape.
If the fracture is longitudinal or has tilted inward, lay the patient on their stomach to facilitate setting the fracture.  Once set, apply a bandage, then a splint of wood or leather, and bind it firmly.
Do not worry about the fracture shifting or the splint coming loose.  Fill in any hollows in the hips to ensure the binding is even.  Instruct the patient to sleep on their back or healthy side, if a hot swelling appears.
Refrain from manipulating or setting it until the hot swelling subsides.  Apply what was previously mentioned to soothe it. Then, return to setting and binding it properly. If fragments or splinters are visible in the bone, do not remove them.
And do not touch it internally, but rather adjust it externally as described.  Leave the binding until it heals.
Chapter Eleven.
On setting a fracture of the humerus.
The humerus is the bone between the elbow and the shoulder. If it is fractured, set it using one of two methods.  One is to take a curved, smooth stick of medium thickness, like this:
Tie straps to each end of the stick. Then hang it from a high point.  The patient sits on a chair, and then lays their fractured arm over the stick until their armpit is positioned in the middle of the curve.  Then hang a heavy object from above it.
Or a servant supports the arm downwards, and the physician then straightens the fracture with their hands until it is restored to its proper position. The other method is for the patient to lie on their back and for their arm to be hung from their neck by a strap.
Then instruct two servants, one to hold the upper part of the fracture with their hands, and the other to hold the lower part, and each to pull in their direction.  If you want a stronger pull, secure a strap below the fracture and one above it, and have each servant pull in their direction.
If the fracture is near the shoulder joint, the strap should be positioned under the armpit and the other below the fracture, near the elbow. Similarly, if the fracture is near the elbow, the strap should be placed at that location and on the elbow itself.
Then gently straighten the fracture without force until it is properly aligned and fits well.  Then bind it, unless a hot swelling appears. If a hot swelling does appear, refrain from binding for seven days. Apply moistened wool soaked in vinegar and rose ointment.
Until the swelling subsides, then bind it.  The method of binding is to place the bandage on the fracture, then a layer of new cloth on the bandage. Then bring the arm to the upper arm, and place the hand open on the shoulder.
Hold the cloths and binding on the upper arm and forearm so that the arm acts as a splint, if nothing prevents you from doing so and the fractured bone shows no change. If you fear that the bone may shift, use splints.
This means placing a splint on the fracture itself, wider and stronger than the others.  Keep a finger's width between each splint.  The length of the splints should be according to the fracture, with an additional three fingers on each side.
Then apply the binding described in the first section to the splints.
The binding should be tighter at the site of the fracture.
The further from the fracture, the less tight the binding should be.  If you see the positioning of the splints and binding, as we mentioned in the context of setting the limb, then do so.
If you fear inflammation, leave the binding and splints until the seventh day, as we stated. Then check the joint every three days to prevent irritation, swelling, or impaired nourishment of the limb due to excessive binding. Correct all of this as described.
If you are certain that none of this will occur, do not loosen the bandage until several days have passed.  The patient should lie on their back, with their hand on their stomach, and a padded, moderate-sized arm sling should be placed under the elbow.
And check at all times, day or night, to prevent the deformed limb from becoming more displaced or the bandage from loosening. Correct all of this diligently. Make the patient's diet as we previously described, first with a soft diet, until the bone strengthens.
Then the diet should be thickened.  The arm and leg typically strengthen in forty days. At that time, the bandage should be loosened, and the patient should use a bath and be treated with suitable ointments, if the fracture is severe and comminuted.
Do not remove the bandage until fifty days, or even two months.
Chapter Twelve.
On the setting of a fractured arm.
The arm is composed of two bones, called the radii. One is small, located next to the thumb, and the other is large, located beneath the small one, further down.  Sometimes only the larger radius is fractured, sometimes only the smaller one, and sometimes both are fractured.
If the smaller upper radius is fractured, its setting is easier and its healing faster.  If the lower radius is fractured, the fracture is worse and healing more difficult.  The worst case is when both bones are fractured.  If the fractured bone is the smaller upper radius...
When setting it, the physician should apply a gentle, slight traction to align it.  If the larger radius is fractured, the traction should be stronger.  If both radii are fractured, the traction should be considerably stronger.
The hand should be positioned, during the setting and traction, extended on a cushion, with the thumb positioned higher than all the other fingers, and the little finger lower than the other fingers. The patient should be seated upright.
Let the cushion be at the appropriate height so that the patient does not have to strain.
Then, one attendant supports the arm from below, either with their hand or a bandage, and another from above, similarly.  Then, the physician aligns the bone, returning it to the best possible position.  If the fracture has splinters, they must be addressed.
Return each fragment to its proper place, using all your effort.  If a fragment protrudes, pierces the skin, and you have no hope of setting it, incise it and remove it as described previously.  If the fracture involves a wound, this requires a separate treatment.
Then treat that accordingly. If a hot swelling appears at the initial setting, apply a cloth soaked in rose-oil ointment and white wax, neither too thick nor too thin. Bind it firmly to the area until the swelling subsides.
Remove the cloth, apply a bandage prepared from mill dust mixed with egg white, then apply splints.  Let the splint placed directly on the fracture be wider and stronger. Know that in most cases, six splints are needed for the arm.
The fracture may be in one ulna or both ulnae.  Then, make your binding stronger and tighter over the fracture site.  As you work upward or downward with the binding, make it progressively looser, as previously mentioned in the beginning of this chapter.
Let the bandages wrapped around the fracture be soft and moist, not too firm.  Let the thread used for binding be linen, of a medium thickness, as previously described.  Check the limb and ligaments after several days.
If something needs correcting, such as an irritation appearing on the limb, the limb should be bathed in warm water until the irritation subsides.  Leave the limb unbound for the night to rest, then resume the binding.
If the binding has become loose and the bone has shifted or something similar, rectify it to the best of your ability.  Also, if the limb is deprived of nourishment due to excessive binding, loosen it slightly and leave it for several days to allow nourishment to reach it, then re-tighten.
If the patient experiences none of the issues mentioned, the bandage should not be removed until twenty days or so.  Then, suspend the patient's arm from their neck, keeping the arm straight.  The patient should refrain from strenuous movements and sleep on their back.
Know that this arm fracture can be set in thirty, or thirty-two days, and perhaps in twenty-eight days, all according to the patient's temperament and strength.
Chapter Thirteen.
On setting fractures of the hand and fingers.
The metacarpals of the hand and the phalanges of the fingers rarely fracture, but are often bruised.  So, when a fracture or bruise occurs in the hand...
The patient should sit cross-legged with a chair in front of him at the same level.
Then, he places his hand on it outstretched, then the attendant stretches the fractured bone and the physician straightens it until, when it is well aligned, then the bandage and splint should be applied if no hot swelling occurs, then a splint should be applied on top, according to the affected area.
And you should wrap it in a soft cloth.  If the fracture is toward the palm of the hand, create a ball shape from a cloth and instruct the patient to grasp it with their injured hand, then secure it with a long cloth.
The splint should be made of soft leather so that the skin can heal with the flexing of the entire hand, and it should be secured properly. If the fracture is outward, then a splint should be placed above and another below the hand so that the hand remains open and upright.
Then, the splint should be applied as the hand rotates and fastened between the fingers with a bandage. If the fracture affects one of the fingers, if it is the thumb, it should be straightened properly and then secured with the hand; if desired, a small, upright splint can be applied to support the fracture.
And do not move it.  If the fracture is of the other fingers, like the middle, index, ring, or pinky finger, they should be aligned and bandaged with the healthy adjacent finger, or all of them should be bandaged together, which is better, or a small upright splint can be placed on them.
As we mentioned regarding the thumb, and examine during and after your treatment of the inflammation.  If any of that occurs, treat it as described previously.
Chapter Fourteen.
In the treatment of a fractured femur.
The femur frequently fractures and is apparent to touch, since it moves forward and backward.  Its treatment is by tying a bandage above the fracture and another below the fracture, with the patient lying on their face.
Then each attendant stretches the bandage towards its side evenly, if the fracture is in the middle of the bone.  If it is close to the origin of the femur, a soft bandage should be tied, either of wool or similar material.
At the origin of the femur, towards the pubic area, the stretching should be upwards, and the other bandage below the fracture.  Similarly, if the fracture is near the knee, the bandage should be near the knee, to be stretched downwards.  Then the physician straightens the bone with both hands until it is restored to its natural shape.
And the bone will unite well.  Then, the bandage and stretching should be maintained, unless a hot swelling develops on the limb. If a swelling occurs, leave it for a few days until the hot swelling subsides, then return to its treatment.
As for the stretching, a wide, firm bandage should be wrapped around the fracture two or three times, leaving some excess.  Then the leg should be wrapped until the heel reaches the origin of the shin, and a long thread should be inserted between the thigh and the leg near the knee from below, with the ends of the thread being on top on both sides.
Then wrap the excess bandage around the leg and thigh.  Then place splints on the thigh at the site of the fracture itself, and make one splint on the shin bone. Then fill the gap between the thigh and leg with soft cloth to make the stretch even.
Then begin with firm stretching from the middle, over the fracture site, three or four turns.  And as you move the bandage away from the fracture site, let your stretching become less firm, softer, and looser.
Then take the ends of the thread that you inserted between the thigh and leg, and tie to it the adjacent splints from above. Then pass the ends of the thread downwards until you reach the ankle of the leg, and with them tighten the ends of the splints on the other side.
So that the bandage will not shift from its place.  Then leave the stretching on it as long as the limb shows no sores, swelling, or puffiness, or anything similar.  If anything of that sort happens, immediately loosen it, and rectify whatever has occurred as we have repeatedly mentioned.
If there is a splinter in the bone that is piercing, then you should smooth it if possible. Otherwise, cut around it and remove it. Treat the wound as described previously until it heals. This fracture of the thigh may be treated without adding the leg with splints.
As we mentioned regarding the humerus and forearm, except that setting it this way will not cause lameness for the patient. However, if you set it alone without adding the leg, the patient will always limp.
Know that the thigh takes fifty days or a little more or a little less, all depending on the varying temperaments and other conditions.
Chapter Fifteen.
In the fracture of the kneecap.
The kneecap rarely fractures, but is often bruised. If a fracture does occur, it is either a split or a fragmentation of its parts, and this can happen with or without a wound.
And all of this is done by feeling; the fracture is set by bringing the separated parts together with the fingers, in a manner that is achievable with gentleness and care, then a bandage and a circular splint are applied, if needed.
And it is held together with an appropriate bandage on top of that, then all the conditions described in other fractures, such as a hot swelling and the like, are managed by addressing each symptom appropriately until recovery.
Chapter Sixteen.
On setting fractures of the leg.
The leg has two bones, one thick, called the tibia, and the other thin, called the fibula.  They are subject to the same types of fracture as the bones of the arm. Therefore, its setting is like that of the arm, and the procedure is the same. If both bones are fractured, the leg is displaced in all directions. If the thinner bone is fractured, the leg is displaced forward. If the thicker bone is fractured and this occurs from below, this is obvious to you.
Therefore, use traction and alignment, and bind the splints accordingly, regardless.  However, if the fracture of the leg is severe and has many fragments, the traction should be less and gentler, and exert your effort carefully in setting it.
In the case of the leg, there is a supplementary procedure compared to the arm.  After you have aligned the splints and completed all your work, take two pieces of pine wood, which are used in levelling ceilings and are placed between the gaps of the planks or are made of palm leaves or similar materials.
Select from them one that is slightly thick, not thin, and whose length is the length of the leg from the knee downwards. Then wrap each one with a cloth twice along its length, placing one on the leg and the other on the opposite side.
Let them be from the knee to the bottom of the foot. Then tie the two pieces of wood in three places, at the ends and the middle.  With this restraint, the leg will not tilt to either side and will be properly supported.  A wooden gutter may also be used along the length of the leg.
It is placed in it to prevent movement, and this is especially important in fractures accompanied by a wound.  Then, examine the leg daily and meticulously for swelling or inflammation, or any other such problem. If anything of that sort occurs, treat it as appropriate until it heals. The leg bone will be set within thirty days or so.
Chapter Seventeen.
On fractures of the leg and fingers.
The heel bone is not susceptible to fracture.  The leg bones may be fractured, and the fingers are rarely fractured, but more often suffer contusions.
If a fracture of the leg bones occurs and you see the bones are displaced, have the patient stand upright on the ground like a walker.  Then place your foot on the displaced bone, and press down to realign it.
Until it returns to its proper position, then apply the bandage and splint. Place a small, flat board with two ends underneath the sole of the foot. Secure the foot firmly with bandages and other necessary materials.
After three or four days, remove the splint.  You will find the bones aligned, whether they were fractured or dislocated.  The procedure is as described.  If some of the fingers are fractured, realign and set them as described in the section on setting finger fractures.
Then make a splint for the fractured finger that is the length of the finger, slightly wider.  Place the board, as described, under the foot, and secure it firmly. If two, three, or more bones are fractured.
Place a splint on each finger, sized to fit, wrapped in soft cloth. Secure the board under the foot, ensuring each end of the board extends outside the foot's sole for a good fit.
You should not forget to consider all the symptoms of fractures, as described, and treat each symptom appropriately.
Chapter Eighteen.
In fractures of the female pubic bone and the male penis.
When the woman's vulva is fractured, have her sit on her heels, then gently lean her back slightly, holding her from behind.  Then have the midwife pack her vulva with cotton until it is full, like a ball.
Then, the woman is shaken, and her pelvis is raised slightly, bit by bit, and the cotton will come out until it is like a ball at the opening of the vulva and the broken bone is returned to its place.  Then, a pad is placed on her back. When she wants to urinate, the cotton is removed gently so that she can urinate.
And it is returned to the position it was originally in. Then she returns to her first pad. Do this for seven days or so, and it will be healed.  If you wish, you can take a sheep's bladder, tie a reed tube over its opening, and insert the entire bladder into her vulva.
Then, blow into the tube forcefully until the bladder inflates inside the vulva, and the fracture will return.  Then pack it with cotton, and keep her as described for a few days until it heals.  As for when the pubic bone of a man or woman is fractured, this is used in its treatment.
Its treatment is the same as described for the hip bone. The correct approach to these rare fractures, especially for those with some skill and who understand this book, is apparent; because the fracture itself often reveals the way forward.
For the correct way to set and secure it, understand this. Now, if a man's penis is fractured, take a goose's windpipe, insert the penis into it, then place a bandage of cloth over it and tie it.  Leave it for three days or so until it heals.
Chapter Nineteen.
On setting broken bones if they are accompanied by a wound.
If someone presents with a fracture accompanied by a wound, especially if the bone is large, such as the femur or humerus, or similar, one should promptly perform phlebotomy if the conditions for it are met as previously mentioned.
If the wound is bleeding, one should immediately cauterize it with powdered alum if nothing else is available. Then, proceed to set the fracture on the same day and do not delay.
If no inflammation occurs, if inflammation does occur, then postpone the setting of the fracture until the ninth day, so that the inflammation subsides. Do not approach it at all on the third and fourth days, as it exposes it to poor symptoms.
If the fractured bone is protruding and exposed on the skin, you should gently attempt to reposition and align it with your hands and a slight pull. If you cannot reposition and align it with your hands, reposition it with this instrument, which is made of iron, seven or eight fingers in length. And its width should match the size of the wound.
Therefore, the physician should use three or four of these, according to the treatment required for each type of fracture.  They should be round, with a slight thickness so that they do not bend when used.
It should be sharp-pointed, with a bend at the end.  The top should be thick, and from the middle to the bottom, much thinner.  This is its illustration:.
It is called a "perim" in Greek, meaning a small lever.  The sharp, bent end should be placed on the protruding bone end, and used to push it back once.  If the bone has been repositioned and is somewhat aligned, then complete the alignment by fitting the broken bone ends together.
If the fractured end is thin and the instrument does not grip it well, then the end of that bone must be cut so that the instrument can hold it.  If you cannot reposition the bone as described, then cut it using similar cuts as mentioned previously.
Or spread it open with one of the saws, as you can. Then remove any remaining roughness and thin scales from the bone.  If, after repositioning the bone, the patient experiences severe, painful discomfort, then know that the bone has not returned to its natural position.
If you can reposition it to its natural place, do so, as you will greatly benefit the patient.  Once the bone is fully set, dip a cloth in a dark, astringent drink, especially if it is summer. Do not apply any bandages or anything greasy to the wound.
So that no rot or decay occurs.  Then, use splints when you are finished setting the bone, and leave the wound uncovered by cutting a hole in the bandages just large enough for the wound with scissors.
Beware, very much, of tightening the wound with the fracture, as ignorant physicians often do this, causing their patients either death or ulceration or cold sores.  Make your tightening gentle and loose, different from the tightening of other fractures.
If the wound is bad or large, and you fear some of the bad symptoms we described, and if he feels disturbing pain in the area, then you should not apply splints. Make bandages of strong cloth where the splints would go, and tighten them with these.
If after a day or two, you see the wound beginning to produce pus, remove the cloth you applied with the drink. Then use the dressings and ointments that we customarily use to treat wounds, such as the four-fold ointment, and similar ones. You should also loosen the bandages.
Examine the wound every evening and morning until it heals and is cured.  The limb should be positioned so that the pus drains downwards easily. If the wound takes many days to heal, and the pus does not stop, know that there are small pieces of bone fragments.
Then you should probe the wound.  Remove and extract any of those fragments that have loosened, and if any of them remain unloosened, causing the limb to be pierced and creating pain, then cut and extract them in any way possible.
If the wound develops a cold, or eating away, or any other type of corruption or putrefaction, then you should treat each symptom with the similar treatment described in its section.
If a large, prominent bone, such as the femur or humerus, or similar large bones, is fractured, do not attempt to pull or remove it. Often death results from this; rather, leave it until it becomes putrid.  Perhaps it will fall out on its own after twenty or thirty days.
Then treat the wound if you see an area for treatment; otherwise, leave it.
Chapter Twenty.
On the treatment of the complications that arise after some fractures.
This complication often arises after the fracture heals, especially when it is near the joints.  It makes the limb's appearance unsightly and may prevent the limb from its natural function.
If the complication is recent, use astringent medications such as dates, frankincense, myrrh, asphodel, acacia and the like, taking some or all of them and mixing them with an astringent drink, or egg white, or vinegar.
Apply it to the complication with difficulty and tie it firmly.  Leave the bandage in place for many days, then remove it and repeat with another bandage until the complication disappears, God willing, or attach a tight lead plate to it.
Lead has the property of removing any abnormal tissue growth from the limb. If the complication has hardened and become severe, and necessity dictates its removal, cut into it from above and remove the excess tissue, or scrape it away with appropriate instruments until it's gone. Treat the wound until it heals.
Chapter Twenty-One.
In treating a fracture, if the limb, after being set, remains thin and weak, unlike its original condition.
If a broken bone is set and the limb remains thin and weak afterward, this is due to many reasons. One reason is either excessive loosening and tying of the ligaments improperly, or excessive tightening of the ligaments, preventing nourishment from reaching the limb; or excessive and improper poulticing; or excessive movement at inappropriate times; or insufficient and weak blood in the patient's body.
The treatment for this is to nourish the patient and strengthen his body so that blood increases, using baths, bringing cheer and joy, and the like. Then apply pitch to the limb to attract nourishment, or poultice it with lukewarm water. Until nourishment flows to it and it returns to its natural form.
Chapter Twenty-two.
On treating fractured bones that have been rejoined crookedly and are prevented from functioning properly.
If, after a limb has been set, a fracture exhibits crookedness, protrusion, or irregularity, and the appearance of the limb is thus marred. However, if the limb is not prevented from its natural function, one should not accept the claim of those who assert that the limb should be broken from the head, since many ignorant physicians and bone setters in our country do so.
This action is highly reprehensible and leads to great harm, even resulting in injury.  However, if the crookedness and irregularity are recent, it is appropriate to apply water in which relaxing herbs such as marshmallow leaves, roots, and crown flower, and similar items have been boiled.
And the limb is bandaged with relaxing dressings, such as well-made diachylon, or the juice of the marshmallow root is taken, mixed with chicken fat and ghee, and bandaged with it; or ripe figs are taken, pounded with pigeon dung, and similar medications called resolvents.
And the irregularity may be resolved by gentle continuous rubbing with the hands, and the limb is moved in all directions at all times. If the crookedness is old, severe, and hardened, and if treatment with iron is necessary.
Then it is necessary to cut it [the bone] above and release the connection of the bone and cut away any excess irregularity or bone with fine instruments, employing gentleness and care. Then treat the wound with what was previously mentioned until it heals.
Chapter Twenty-Three.
The jaw is the displacement of a joint from its position, hindering movement, disfiguring the limb, and causing severe pain and suffering to the patient.  Therefore, when a jaw is dislocated, one should immediately attempt to realign it.
Delay this absolutely not, for if delayed, the area will swell, forming a mass that makes realignment difficult.  Therefore, one must not delay or move or stretch it while it is swollen, because it often causes painful spasms and suffering to the patient.
However, if this occurs, one should first bleed the patient, then wait until the swelling subsides somewhat, and then apply warm water and ointment to the limb.  Then, gently realign it and treat each part as described in its respective section.
The sections on the jaw are also arranged, as previously presented in the fractures, from the upper to the lower body.
Chapter Twenty-Four.
On the treatment of the lower jaw.
The jaws dislocate rarely.  Their dislocation occurs in one of two ways: either they depart slightly from their positions, becoming somewhat relaxed, or they completely and entirely dislocate, becoming relaxed. They may be displaced toward the chest, so that the patient's saliva runs and they cannot retain it, nor can they close their jaws or articulate words, their tongue trembling.  If the dislocation is slight, it will usually return on its own with the least effort.
However, if the dislocation is complete, one must quickly restore it and delay nothing.  The patient's attendant should hold the patient's head while the physician inserts the thumb of one hand into the base of the jaw inside the patient's mouth, if the dislocation is on one side.
Or if the dislocation is on both sides, both thumbs should be inserted; and the rest of his fingers should adjust from the outside.  He should instruct the patient to relax and open their jaw in every direction. The physician should adjust and push the jaw back to its proper place.
If restoring them is difficult, especially if both jaws are affected, apply warm water and ointment compresses to ease their return.  Do not delay their repositioning, as we have said. When they have been repositioned correctly and the patient's mouth is closed and not relaxed, then apply strips of cloth with a salve made from wax and rose ointment.
Then gently tie with a loose bandage. The patient should sleep on their back, with their head supported between two pillows, so that they do not move it to the right or left, or chew anything.  Their diet should consist of soft, easy-to-swallow foods.
Until the pain subsides and the jaw sets, let him eat whatever he desires.  Use gentleness in this, and do not force his mouth open for eating, drinking, or yawning until the jaw is firm and healed.
If the jaws are difficult to reposition after they have dislocated and not returned to their proper places, fevers and persistent headaches often occur, and the patient's abdomen may become distended, and vomiting may frequently happen.  If you see this, know that the condition is serious.
Often, death occurs within ten days for those experiencing this condition.
Chapter Twenty-five.
On repositioning the clavicle and shoulder joint.
The clavicle does not dislocate from the inner side due to its connection to the chest.  It may dislocate outward, which is apparent to the touch.  To reduce it, the patient should lie on their back with their arms extended.
Then, press firmly on the affected area with your hand, and it will return to its place.  Then apply a bandage and splints, and secure them tightly.  The portion of the clavicle near the shoulder, where it connects, rarely dislocates.  If it does, it should be repositioned as we have described, using whatever methods seem appropriate to you.
Then apply a bandage, splints, and binding.  Instruct the patient to remain still and quiet until healed.  This same treatment will reposition the shoulder joint if it also dislocates.
Chapter Twenty-six.
In reducing a shoulder dislocation.
Know that the shoulder dislocates in three ways: one, toward the armpit, downwards; two, toward the chest; and three, occasionally, upward, above the shoulder.
It does not dislocate behind the shoulder blade, nor in front of the nerve.  Most often, it dislocates downwards, towards the armpit, especially in those with little muscle, as it moves quickly in and out in them.
However, those with substantial muscle are different, meaning that it comes out with difficulty and goes back with difficulty.  Sometimes, someone might experience a blow or fall, causing the shoulder to swell and become a hot lump.  They might think it is dislocated, but it is necessary to examine this to determine the truth of the matter.
Then, in treating it, if the dislocation is downwards towards the armpit, if you align the dislocated and healthy shoulder, you will find an obvious difference between them. You will find a prominence on the head of the dislocated shoulder and, when palpating under the armpit, the head of the dislocated shoulder will feel like an egg.
The patient cannot raise their arm to their ear or move it in any way.  Similarly, if it dislocates towards the chest or upwards, you will find it obvious upon palpation; it will not be hidden.
This dislocation may be easily reduced if it is fresh or the patient is a child.  To reduce it, have the attendant raise the patient's arm upwards. Then, place the thumb of your hands under their armpit and forcibly raise the joint upwards to its proper position while the attendant raises and extends their arm upwards.
Then, bring it downwards, and it will return quickly. If it does not return as described, and the dislocation has been present for many days, the patient should bathe in hot water and use poultices that relax and soften, such as cooked nose-root, fenugreek, and crown-of-thorns in water and apply them.
Then the patient lies on their back, and a ball of wool of moderate firmness is placed under their armpit.  The physician places their heel on the ball, and holds the patient's hand in their hand, extending it downwards.
And the physician pushes the ball with their foot, and it will return to its place.  Or, if you prefer, you can reduce it in this way: Have a man taller than the patient stand by the side, and place his shoulder under the patient's armpit, raising the armpit upwards, so that the patient is suspended in the air. And another attendant pulls the patient's hand downwards towards their stomach.  If the patient is light, then something else should be hung from them to weigh them down, and the dislocation will return immediately.  It may also be reduced in another way.
Another method is to place a long, round-headed piece of wood on the ground, like the pestle head of a mortar—not thick, nor thin.  A soft cloth is placed on the top of the wood, and then the wood is placed under the patient's armpit. The patient stands along the length of the wood.
Then the patient extends their hand downwards on the other side, and also stretches their body powerfully on the other side. The joint will quickly return to its place. If the dislocation resists all the previously mentioned methods, use this treatment: take a piece of wood about two cubits long. And its width should be about four fingers, and its thickness about two fingers.  It should have a rounded head to easily enter the armpit in this way:
Then a soft cloth is tied to the round head so that the wood does not injure the patient.  It is then placed under the armpit. The entire hand and arm are extended along the wood downwards, and the wood is tied to the upper arm, forearm, and hand.
Then the arm is placed on a crossbar.  The arm is extended downwards, and the rest of the body is left hanging on the other side.  The joint will then enter its place. If it has entered in any way possible, a moderate-sized ball of wool should be placed under the armpit.
Then the prepared dressing, made of mill dust, frankincense, and egg white, is applied to the entire shoulder, moving from top to bottom.  The ball is then firmly tied under the armpit, and the bandage is wrapped around the dressing from above. The patient's hand is tied to the neck.
The hand should not be moved for seven days. The patient should be given little food to strengthen the limb, which promotes quicker healing.  Then, after seven or five days, the bandage is removed, and the limb is exercised. If the limb remains firm and does not relax, the patient is healed.
If the joint frequently dislocates due to moisture or another cause, cauterization with three cauterizing agents should be used, as previously described in the chapter on cauterization. If all this is done, and the bandage is removed after seven days, and the joint does not become stable,
If the dressing and bandage are repeatedly applied without success, and the joint dislocates and relaxes, and the arm cannot be raised, know that the nerve in the shoulder's upper part has been severed, stretched, or relaxed. In this case, know that the joint will never become stable.
As for the dislocation of the jaw, located near the chest and breast and behind it, it is returned by pushing and pulling with the hands until it returns to its place.  All other binding and treatments should be used until healed. If after healing, the limb feels tender and movement is slow,
The patient should use baths repeatedly until the tenderness subsides and returns to its original condition.
Chapter Twenty-seven.
On treating dislocation of the elbow.
The elbow joint dislocates with difficulty, and similarly returns with difficulty.  It dislocates in all directions, especially forward or backward.  Its dislocation is not hidden from you, since it is visible and palpable, in whatever manner it is dislocated.
If you compare the dislocated elbow to the healthy one, the dislocation will be clearly apparent by the depression of the joint. The arm cannot be bent, nor can the shoulder be brought to it.  You should quickly reduce the dislocation before a hot swelling develops.
If a hot swelling develops, reducing the dislocation becomes difficult, and it may never heal, especially if the dislocation is backward.  This is the worst type of dislocation, the most painful, and often leads to death.
If it can be reduced, have an assistant extend his/her arm with both hands, while the physician's hands are positioned above and below the elbow.  The physician pushes the joint back into place using the thumbs of both hands or the base of both palms.
If the dislocation is forward, the hand may be bent once so that the base of the palm strikes the corresponding shoulder.  If this does not return the dislocation, use very strong extension;  two assistants should extend the arm.
And the patient should also be held by two assistants so that he doesn't move during the extension.  Then the arm should be rotated in every direction after wrapping a folded cloth or wide bandage around it.  When the physician begins to manipulate the joint with his hands, he should rub the joint with ointment to facilitate its easy movement.
Then the joint should be pushed forcefully until it returns to its place.  After its reduction, the bandage containing a compress, drying agent, and egg white should be applied tightly, and the arm should be suspended from the patient's neck and left for several days.
Then it is released.  If the joint is firmly in place, release the bandage and leave it.  If you see that the joint is not sufficiently strong, reapply the bandage and bandage and leave it for several days until it strengthens, and then release it.  If the joint experiences discomfort after its return and release.
If movement is difficult, use moist heat in a bath, gentle massage, and gentle prodding until it softens, or apply a thick, fat sheep's fleece to the joint, then bandage it and leave it on for a day and a night.  Then remove it and bathe him.  When he sweats, massage the joint moderately.
Then apply the sheep's fleece again, twice, and three times, in conjunction with bathing, until it softens. If you prefer to apply dampened cow dung mixed with clarified butter and bind it to the joint, do so repeatedly. This will also soften and restore it to its original condition.
Chapter Twenty-Eight.
On the treatment of a dislocated wrist.
The wrist frequently dislocates and its reduction is easier than with other joints, but it is necessary to expedite its reduction at the moment of dislocation, before inflammation or a hot swelling appears in the area.
To reduce the dislocation, place the patient's wrist on a board.  A helper should extend the patient's arm. The physician should place their hand on the prominent part of the joint and push it until it returns.  However, one must check if the dislocation has moved to the inside of the hand.
Let the patient place the outside of their hand on the board during extension and reduction. If the dislocation is outward, then the patient's inside hand should be on the board so that the physician's hand can be positioned on the same prominence of the joint. If it returns immediately, well and good. Otherwise, apply a bandage to soothe the swelling.
Leave it alone; do not attempt to repeat the procedure.  After several days, you will not be able to reduce it, and the joint will remain crooked.  This will not harm the patient, unless the hand becomes weak and is unable to grasp anything.
At that point, you know that the nerve is severed or injured, and there is no remedy except to apply cauterization.  Perhaps this will help, perhaps not.  Once the wrist is reduced, apply the bandage we described, then bind tightly and leave it on for five days.
Then it is removed, and the hand is exercised. If its movement is difficult and there is any stiffness, soften it with warm water and rub repeatedly until it softens.
Chapter Twenty-Nine.
On the treatment of dislocated fingers.
Fingers may dislocate in any direction. When a finger dislocates to the back or palm of the hand, extend the finger and push the dislocation back with your thumb until it returns to its place. Then bandage the knuckle and sling it towards the direction of the dislocation.
Leave it for two days, then release it and extend it until it is straight the following day.  If it is nighttime, bandage it in the same way.  Continue to unbind it during the day and exercise it with movement, then bandage it at night. Do this for several days until it strengthens.
And do likewise if it dislocates to the palm of the hand, bandaging it towards that same direction, and do with it your initial procedure until it heals. And do likewise for any other direction of dislocation.
Chapter Thirty.
In treating the dislocation of the spine.
If a vertebra of the spine or neck dislocates completely, or many vertebrae are displaced from their positions, there is no treatment, for death rapidly comes upon the patient.
A sign of this is that the patient's stool comes out involuntarily; he cannot contain it.  Often, some of his limbs, either his legs or arms or one of them, become relaxed.  If only one vertebra is displaced, it often shifts.
And its displacement can occur in four directions.  The one that moves backward is called a hump.  There is no treatment for a hump that developed from childhood; it will not heal at all.  But for one that developed from a fall, blow, or similar injury...
The ancients have described various treatments with lengthy explanations, most of which are of little benefit.  I have condensed this to what is sufficient, encompassing much of what they proposed by approaching the matter from a different perspective and clarifying it, as well as illustrating the mechanism in a different way from what they have explained and described.
So I say that a hump that forms in the front of the chest cannot be treated or cured, and neither can one that forms to the sides.  However, the one that occurs in the back is treatable, specifically by the method I describe: the patient should be laid on their face.
On a flat surface, near a wall, spread a damp cloth underneath to avoid injuring the chest.  Then place a vertical plank, planted in a hole in the ground, near the head, and another plank near the feet at the opposite end of the platform.
A servant holds one plank, not fixed in the hole, and another servant holds the other in the same manner.  Then, a soft, strong bandage is wrapped around the patient's chest and under the armpits.  The end of the bandage is extended to the plank near the head and tied to it.
Then another bandage is tied around the hips, knees, and ankles.  All the bandages are gathered and tied to the other plank near the feet.  Then each servant pulls on their plank with the bandage, and the planks remain in their fixed positions.
However, as we said, they are not fastened. The physician places both hands firmly on the hump until it straightens, or places a board on it and leans on the board with his feet until it straightens. If this treatment is ineffective, take a board about three cubits long.
A hole is made in the wall, which we said should be near the patient, to accommodate the end of the board.  The middle of the board is placed on the hump, and the physician places his feet on the other end, pulling firmly to compress the hump.
And it returns to its place. If you wish, make it with a hand-wound coil, by driving two planks, each one cubit long, into the ground at the patient's head and at the feet, at the far end of the shop.
Let there be a span between each plank.  A hole is made in each plank for the coil to pass through.  All the planks are firmly anchored to the ground so they cannot move. A twisted stick—the coil—is inserted, into the holes in the planks, and the bandage is wound around the coil in the holes of both planks.
A hole is made at its end, in which a stick, one span long, has been secured by winding, and the same is done on the other two planks.  Then the bandage that was tightened around the patient's chest is tightened onto the coil at the head, and the bandages around the legs are tightened onto the coil at the feet.
Then a servant stands by each coil, twisting the coil with the twisting tool.  The physician adjusts the hump as previously described. This is the image of the coil, the shop, and the patient.
Then, after the hump returns and the area is even, it is necessary to apply a bandage soaked in egg white, followed by a linen dressing. Then, place a splint of wood over the bandage, with a width of about three fingers, and a length that covers the hump.
And apply some correct beads to it, then tie with the necessary bandage. The patient should consume mild foods until recovery. If some protrusion remains at the site after recovery, then use medicines that relax and soften, along with the splint described for a long time.
A lead plate may be used in this case.  A protrusion might appear at the end of the spinal beads, leading to the suspicion of dislocation. This may be an extra bone that has protruded.  Do not apply this treatment to it, for death may result.
Chapter Thirty-One.
In the treatment of the dislocated hip.
Know that the hip joint and the shoulder joint are only subject to dislocation, and not to the slight displacement and subluxation that occur in other joints.  The hip joint dislocates in four ways.
This is because it dislocates inwards, outwards, forwards, and backwards.  It dislocates inwards most frequently, and rarely forwards or backwards.  A sign of dislocation inwards is that if you align the patient's healthy leg with the affected one, the affected leg will appear longer.
The knee will be more prominent than the healthy one, and the patient will be unable to bend their leg at the hip.  The area below the hip will be swollen and distinctly swollen, indicating that the head of the thigh bone has moved there.
The signs of dislocation outwards will be the opposite of these signs.  The sign of dislocation forward is that the patient straightens the leg completely, but cannot bend it without pain, and if they attempt to walk, they cannot walk forward.
The patient retains their urine and their hip is spasmed.  When walking, the patient walks on the heel.  The sign of dislocation backward is that the patient cannot straighten the knee, nor bend it before bending the hip, and the leg is also shorter than the other.
The hip is relaxed, and the head of the thigh bone is visible near the waist.  As for the reduction of these dislocations, if the dislocation has been longstanding and the patient has not attempted reduction, and it remains in its state, there is no cure at all.
Therefore, one should not treat it.  As for a recent dislocation, regardless of which of the four types of dislocation it is, quickly move the joint, extending it inward and outward and moving it left and right, perhaps...
If it returns, no further treatment is needed. If it does not return this way, a strong assistant should be positioned to pull the leg from below, either with their hands or a bandage tied above the knee, and another assistant pulls from above.
By placing their hands under his armpits, then tightening a soft bandage on the thigh's root, a third assistant grips the bandage's end, and pulls, either forward from the hip to the collarbone, or backward to the back.
All of them pull simultaneously until the patient raises his body from the ground and remains suspended.  This type of pulling is common to all four types. If the dislocation returns as described, otherwise, each type requires its own specific treatment as described.
For its specific return, if the dislocation is inward, the patient should lie on his healthy side, then a bandage is placed on the thigh root, between the head of the thigh and the area below the groin.
Then the bandage is pulled upward from the groin towards the upper body, towards the collarbone.  Then a strong assistant with both arms embraces the thick part of the affected thigh and pulls outwards forcefully, and it will return to its place.
This type is easier than other methods of returning this limb.  If this method is unsuccessful and the limb does not return, then the patient's legs should be bound with a strong, soft bandage around the heels and knees.
Each bandage should be a distance of four fingers from the other.  The affected leg should be extended farther than the other, by a distance of two fingers.  Then the patient is suspended from the head by a beam in the house, and this is a distance of two arms from the ground.
Then, a strong boy is instructed to embrace the head of the thigh, while another boy holds the patient and pushes the boy holding the thigh forcefully. The joint will return to its place quickly.  As for its specific return, if the dislocation is outward...
The patient should lie on the bed, as described for the humpback patient.  The bandage should be tightened around the affected leg and chest. Then, two beams are placed, one at the patient's feet and the other at the head.  A further beam is placed firmly in the middle of the bed.
Damp cloths should be wrapped around it to prevent injury to the patient. The beam should be positioned between the patient's thighs to prevent downward displacement during stretching.  Each attendant pulls in their direction, and the physician adjusts the hip with his hands. If it returns to its place...
Otherwise, place the board on him and press it as described for the humpback, except that the patient should lie on his healthy side.  If the dislocation is forward, the patient's leg should be stretched in this same manner on the bed.
The physician places the right hand on the affected groin, and presses it with the other hand.  The pressure should be extended downward toward the knee. If the dislocation is backward, the patient should not be stretched downward.
He is raised from the ground, but should be positioned on a firm surface.  Also, the dislocated hip should be outward, as described in the patient's position on the bed, face down, with bandages tight.
As previously stated, the board should also be used to press the area where the joint has dislocated.  When the hip joint returns properly, the sign of its return is unmistakable:  stretch the patient's legs.
If you see them level, and the patient can flex and extend the leg without difficulty, know that the limb has returned to its proper position.  Then, bring the thighs together, apply the bandage, and tie it tightly with a turban, ensuring the hip does not move in any direction.
The patient must rest for three or four days.  Then, remove the bandages and dressings.  Compare the legs; if they are the same size, know that the joint has set.  Release the patient to walk, unless you see some weakness in him.
Return and bandage it again, tightening it as you did initially. Leave it for three more days, then remove it.  Gradually allow the patient to walk over several days until it strengthens, God willing.
Chapter Thirty-two.
On treating the knee joint.
The knee dislocates in three ways: inward, outward, and downward (i.e., backward).  It does not dislocate forward.  A sign of dislocation is to tell the patient to bring their leg close to their thigh.
If the leg does not adhere to the thigh, know that the knee is dislocated.  To reduce all types of dislocation, the patient should sit down with their legs extended, if they are strong enough to do so.  A helper should sit behind the patient, holding the patient's torso and gently pulling it backward.  Then, you should sit on the patient's thighs.
Place your back against the patient's face, and put the patient's leg between your legs.  Then, grasp the knee with both hands, interlocking your fingers on the knee.  Then, firmly press the sides of the knee with your hands.  A second assistant should extend the leg until the knee returns to its place.
A sign of its return is that the leg will adhere to the thigh gently, without resistance.  Then bandage it, and keep the leg attached to the thigh.  Then, bind them both with a bandage for three or four days, then release them.  Only allow the patient minimal walking for several days until the strength returns.
If you are unable to return it using the method described, then use strong traction with bandages as previously described in the treatment of the hip until it returns.
Chapter Thirty-Three.
On the treatment of a dislocated heel.
The heel may be displaced slightly or completely dislocated.  Dislocation may be inward or outward.  A sign of dislocation is that the heel appears swollen and protruding towards the side to which it has dislocated.
As for treating a slight displacement, it is easy to return it.  Gently pull with the hands and straighten it until it returns.  However, if it is completely dislocated, the patient should sit down, and a strong attendant should hold it from behind in the middle of his back.
Then, with your right hand, grasp his foot from the top, and with your left hand, from the bottom, at the heel. Then pull the foot towards you with your right hand, and then with your left hand, twice. Then extend it with the left hand, and push the front of the foot towards the leg with the right hand, without force.
Repeat this twice as described. Then, on the third time, push the front of the foot toward the leg while pulling at the heel. If it returns in one or two repetitions with the foot aligned, then stop. Otherwise, repeat the procedure; it will return.
If it does not return using the method described, lay the patient on his back on the ground.  Securely drive a stake into the ground, placing it between his legs, wrapped in cloth to prevent injury to the patient.  Then an attendant should hold his thigh.
Then, another attendant extends the leg, either by hand or with a bandage tied around the patient's leg. Each attendant pulls in a direction opposite the other. The stake remains positioned between the patient's legs, holding the patient to prevent his body from moving downward during the pulling. Then the physician straightens the joint with his hands.
Another attendant holds the healthy leg below.  If the joint returns quickly, then take the bandage and splint, and tie it firmly with bandages. Tie the foot with a bandage downward.  Care must be taken to avoid the nerve which is above the heel from behind.
So that the bandage is not too tight and causes him pain.  Then leave it for two or three days.  If the bandage loosens, tighten it, and then release it on the third or fourth day. The patient should avoid walking for forty days.
If he attempts to walk before this time, you cannot be sure that the joint will not dislocate and become unfixable.  Treatment will not be accepted thereafter. If a hot swelling appears, you should apply the treatments described previously, in other parts of the medical text, for soothing until it subsides.
Chapter Thirty-Four.
On the treatment of the joint of the toes.
One should gently realign any dislocated toes by a slight stretching, without force. This is not difficult but easy. If the dislocation is in one of the toes of the foot, the patient should place their foot on a level surface.
Or, standing like a walker, place your foot on the protruding joint. Then press down firmly with your foot until it returns to its proper position and no protrusion is visible.
Then, place a board under the sole of his foot, covering the entire foot, with two ends.  Secure it tightly for three days. Then, release it and keep him from walking for many days, until it strengthens, and a return is avoided, God willing.
Chapter Thirty-Five.
On the types of dislocation that occur with a wound, or with a fracture, or with both.
When something like this occurs and you attempt treatment and reduction, it often results in death.
Therefore, one should not undertake such treatment unless one is skilled in the craft, experienced, gentle, compassionate, cautious, and not rash or reckless.  Initially, one should use remedies that alleviate only the inflamed swellings and allow the patient to recover.
Except by Your grace, O God, if you hope for the patient's freedom from harm, along with the mildness of the illness, and some hope appears to you, then return it in its first instance, before the inflamed swelling occurs.
If the limb returns to its proper position, use the treatment that relieves inflamed swellings and treat the wound with appropriate drying ointments. If the dislocation is accompanied by a fracture and detached fragments have formed in the bone, remove them. Adhere to what we have previously mentioned regarding similar simple ailments in their respective sections.
Strive diligently and purify yourself from entering the path of recklessness, as I have previously instructed.  This will preserve your reputation and safeguard your standing, God willing.
