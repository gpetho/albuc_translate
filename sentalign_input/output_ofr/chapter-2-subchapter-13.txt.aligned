of the rotting of the eye When this disease, which is called "alacratia" or rotting, affects the eye, there are two types:	The eye that suffers this inversion of the lid is called 'leporine' (i.e. hareeye).	0.5151706
one natural, and the other unnatural.	Now sometimes this inversion is natural, sometimes acquired.	0.4614256
And it occurs from a sudden wound, or a cut, or a cautery, and similar things.	It is acquired either from the cicatrization of an injury, or an incision, or cauterization, or the like.	0.7174823
And the method of treatment is that you cut open that seam/suture, and separate its lips/edges, and put linen tents inside, and bind it until it is healed;	The idea of the operation is to excise the scar, separate the edges of the wound, pack linen between them, and bandage up till healed.	0.6454937
and you must not use in its treatment things that dry and constrict. For if you do this, the illness will return worse than the first time;	In the treatment of it you should not use anything styptic or drying, for if you do the inversion will return worse than ever before.	0.71092653
but treat it with softening things, such as fenugreek; and bathe it with water in which marshmallow and linseed have been boiled, and ointments of melted diachylon in some oil, and wrap a tent in it, and treat it with this.	Employ relaxing substances such as fenugreek; and fomentation with water in which mallows and linseed have been boiled; and diachylon plaster which has been previously softened with one of the oils and spread on the packs; and treat it with this.	0.8516381
And the key to your treatment is to be careful that it does not heal in the same shape as it was before;	The main thing in the treatment is to use every device to prevent the healing up of the place as it was before.	0.603982
and this work that we have described is nothing other than the correction of this illness, so that it does not return in the form it was before.	This operation which we have described is but some correction of the inversion, not that the appearance of the place will necessarily revert to what it was.	0.6609117
