When the afterbirth is retained after childbirth, you must instruct the patient to hold her breath, and then make her sneeze using pepper, and hold your hands over her mouth and nose; and if it comes out because of this, it is well.	When in a confinement the afterbirth is left behind, you should bid the woman hold her breath then make her sneeze with ptarmica, with your hand holding her mouth and nose; and if it come away thus, good.	0.8623294
If not, then take a pot, and make a hole in the lid, and put in herbs that can open the mouth of the marrow, such as calamintha, rue, anise, chamomile, birthwort and centaury; all these herbs, or some of them, should be cooked in the pot with water over the fire; then put one end of a reed in the hole of the pot, and the other end in the mouth of the marrow, and hold it there until the vapor enters the marrow; then make her sneeze, as we have said.	But if not, then take a pot, pierce a hole in the lid, and put in it herbs that will open the womb, such as pennyroyal, rue, anise, chamomile, artemisia, cassia, and centaury, some or all of these remedies, submerge them in water, and place on the fire. Then fix a silver tube to the hole in the cover and bring the other end into the orifice of the womb and hold it in position so that the vapours may reach the body of the uterus.	0.8543217
Then the afterbirth will come out quickly.	Then let her sneeze, as we said, and the afterbirth will quickly come away.	0.5077703
And if it remains after this treatment, and does not come out, instruct the midwife to moisten her left hand in sesame oil or in althaea mucilage, and then insert it into the vagina, and search for the afterbirth; and when she has found it, she should take it and pull it gently and straight, so that the marrow does not fall out during the extraction; but she must move it gently to the right and to the left, and then pull; so it will come and be released.	But if, after this treatment, it still remains and does not come out, then tell the midwife to dip her hand in oil of sesame or mucilage of marshmallow and introduce it into the vulva and search for the afterbirth, and when she has found it, to take hold of it and very gently draw it until she bring it out.	0.81224865
And if the opening of the marrow is too narrow, we have described the treatment of sneezing, and fumigation with herbs; and if it does not come out with all that we have said, be careful not to be foolish in pulling; but you must tie what is at the opening of the marrow to the woman's thigh, then give her an enema of tetrapharmacum ointment; this will rot and loosen it, and it will come out; but nevertheless, when it rots, a bad odor comes to the stomach and head, and harms the patient.	But if it be adherent to the depths of the uterus, then let her pass her hand in as we described until she find the afterbirth; then let her draw very slowly and gently lest by violent pulling she cause a prolapse; and she should slowly move it from side to side, left and right; then let her increase the traction, for then it gives way to the pull and is freed from its adhesions. If the uterine opening be narrowed, we have earlier mentioned the treatment by induced sneezing and that of the pot and herbs. But if it does not come away by all the means we have described, beware of treating her roughly with repeated traction. Whatever of it comes out of the opening should be tied to the woman's thigh, and then syringe her with Tetrapharmacon ointment; for that will cause putrefaction in a few days and it will loosen and come out.	0.8144799
Suitable fumigations are therefore necessary for this: some of the ancients have tried fumigation with watercress and dried figs.	One of the Ancients tried suffumigation with nasturtium and dried figs.	0.5273554
The form of the instrument with which one fumigates the woman for the retention of the flowers and of the afterbirth is this:	The form of instrument for suffumigating a woman for retention of the menses and of the afterbirth and the like.	0.74481153
And it is made of glass, resembling a tube, and the narrow end is placed in the vagina, and the wide end over the fire; and the fumigation should be over coals, and continue until it is consumed, and start another.	It is made of lead, resembling a funnel, or it may be made of bronze. Its narrow extremity is introduced into the pudenda and the wide end is put over the fire, and the suffumigation is produced on the hot coals. Keep it there until all the fumes are gone, and repeat once.	0.75371563
