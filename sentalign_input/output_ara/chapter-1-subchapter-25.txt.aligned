If the head of the humerus is dislocated due to slippery humors, or it does not stabilize when reduced from its dislocation, so that this becomes a habit for it - it is reduced and then dislocated at the slightest movement that occurs, as we have witnessed - then the jaw should first be reduced. Then the patient lies on his back or on the healthy side, then you lift the skin that is inside the armpit upwards with the fingers of your left hand if the joint is dislocated inwards.	When the head of the humerus is dislocated on account of the synovial fluid or when it does not remain in the correct position after the dislocation has been set, so that this becomes a regular occurrenceâ€”it is set and then dislocates with the least movement, as we have ourselves seen; you must first set the luxation, then make the patient lie down on his back or on his sound side; then with the fingers of the left hand lift up the skin of the axilla if the joint has dislocated downwards.	0.86907375
Then you heat the cautery with the two skewers, whose image is this.	Then heat a cautery provided with two spits in this manner.	0.69354427
Then you cauterize the skin with it until you penetrate it to the other side, and the shape of the cautery mark is four burns, and it may be cauterized with a cautery with three skewers, so the shape of the cautery mark will then be six burns, and the skewers are the thinness of the file.	Then with that burn through the fold of skin till you have perforated to the other side, getting four cauterizations. The cautery may be of three prongs and then the form of the cauterization will be six burns. The prongs should be of the fineness of a probe.	0.89036715
This is the image of the cautery with the three skewers.	This is the figure of the cautery with three prongs.	0.87592196
And one may be added to this number, so the burns become eight, then you apply to the burn the crushed cress with salt, then you order the patient to rest and not to move the limb for a while until it strengthens, and if the dislocation is upward, which is rare.	Sometimes there is added yet one more so there will be eight burns. Put on the burns leeks well pounded with salt; then keep the patient absolutely quiet so as not to move the joint for a time till it gains strength.	0.6848098
Cauterize it above the shoulder with one good nail-shaped cautery, or many cauterizations by dripping, for the joint will tighten, the moisture will go away, and the patient will recover.	If the dislocation has gone upwards, which very rarely happens, then cauterize him above the shoulder with one good claviform cautery or with multiple punctured cauterizations. Thus the joint will gain strength and the humidity will disappear and the patient will be cured.	0.7556742
