Oh, my sons, since I have completed this book, which is the last of the science of medicine, and its completion has brought its end, and through its expositions and clarifications, it is clear to me that I should complete it for you with this treatise, which is a part of the operation by hand, known as surgery.
For the operation by hand has fallen into our region and time, being completely deprived of it, until very few people know about its science, and its traces have vanished; and only some small descriptions remain in the books of the Ancients, which have been altered most and led to errors and confusion, so that their meanings are closed and their power and art are distant.
And it is clear to me that I should revive that by arranging this treatise in accordance with the method of explanation and clarification and abbreviation; and because it comes with the forms of the cautery tools and other instruments of the work as it is by addition of the declaration, and for its preparation, which is necessary. 😊
However, the reason why a good craftsman with his hand cannot be found in this our time is that the art of medicine is lengthy, and its actor must first be trained in the science of anatomy, which Galen taught to know the connections and separations of members, their forms and their forms; and to have knowledge of bones, nerves and ligaments, and the number of them, and their description; and of pulsating veins and quiet ones, and the places of their exit.
And for this, Hippocrates said that with a name it is nothing, but in action it is little, and mostly in the art of the hand.
But we have already said that about him at the beginning of this book; for whoever is not knowledgeable in what we have said about anatomy will fall into error through which men will die, as I have seen happen to many, because some are educated in this science and abandon it without knowledge or experience.
Because I saw a foolish and inexperienced doctor cut an scrofulous abscess on the neck of a woman, and he cut some arteries of the neck so that much blood flowed out until the woman died in his hands.
And I saw another doctor who tried to remove a large stone from a man who was in critical condition, and the stone came out along with a piece of the bladder, so that on the third day the man died.
And I was already called to remove that [stone], and I saw that due to the size of the stone and the condition of the patient, I understood that he would die.
And I saw another doctor who received a fee of one ducat from a lord of our land for surgery, and he came upon a black man who was crippled due to a fracture in his thigh; and the doctor, with his ignorance, opened up the wound, and placed cushions and plasters on it with great strength, but did not allow the wound any air.
Here is the translation of your sentence:
And I was called to him, and prepared to loosen the bandage, and once it is done, there will be calmness and also relief from his pains.
However, the corruption had already taken hold in the limb, so it could not be restrained, and the corruption continued to spread throughout the limb until the patient was in danger.
And I saw another physician who pierced a cancerous abscess, and it was ulcerated after several days, until the evil was greatly magnified in him with his master.
The cause of which is that the cancerous growth is full of melancholic humors, therefore it is not beneficial for it to be pierced completely with iron, but rather only in the part where it hurts the most.
And therefore, sons, it is necessary for you that the operation by hand be divided into two divisions: one is the operation associated with health, and the other is the work accompanied by great danger in the highest dispositions.
And I have already mentioned this in every place of this book where there is an operation that involves error and fear; therefore it is necessary for you to guard against this and leave it, so that the pages do not find a way to speak and bring dishonor to you.
And so take up your weapons with fervor and with the protection of God, and your patients with joy and determination.
And use the best way by the grace of God to achieve health and a praiseworthy outcome, and leave behind the terrible diseases of difficult healing, and remove from yourselves that which makes you afraid, so that trust in your faith and in your name may not escape you: for it is more fitting to your glory, and both now in this world and later to your sanctity.
France has already been divided into some of its regions: "Do not treat illnesses badly, lest you be called bad doctors.
And I have divided this book into three chapters.
Here begins the division of the book, and first of the first chapter. The first chapter is about the feet, their shapes and the instruments used, as well as the irons of the cautery and what is necessary for the operation.
The division of the second part. The second chapter is about incisions and perforations, cupping glasses, blisters, the extraction of arrows and similar things, all categorized and ordered according to the shapes of the instruments.
The third chapter, on restoration and dislocation, and on the treatment of twisted limbs and similar conditions; a chapter ordered from head to toe, including descriptions of the instruments.
I must explain the characteristics of that cauterization and its adverse effects, as well as in which conditions it should be avoided.
Thus, I say that the discourse on the quality of the benefits of cauterization and its adverse effects is long and intricate, subtle in knowledge, and hidden in secret; and many wise men have spoken about it, and they have disagreed about it, and I am only able to touch upon a small part of their discussions, fearing prolixity.
And so I say that you should apply cauterization in all conditions universally, whether they have matter or not, with the exception of two conditions which are cold conditions without matter.
In the cold and dry condition with matter, I will disagree; for some say that cauterization is beneficial for it, and others say the opposite, that cauterization is not suitable in an illness which is due to quality and dryness, because the nature of fire is heat and dryness, and it is not suitable that a cold and dry illness with water, which is hot and dry, be healed.
And say to the one who says the opposite of this: that by cautery it is done as a remedy in every dry and warm disease that appears in men's bodies; for when you compare the human body and its humidity to the nature of fire, you find the human body cold.
And I say by the words of that person, that I have already experienced this many times myself.
But nevertheless, it is not suitable for that person who has already been tested and practiced in the chapter of cautery by recent practice, and who knows the diversity of human constitutions and the nature of diseases within them, and the causes of those diseases, their symptoms, and their duration.
But in other constitutions, there is no need to fear this, and especially in cold and moist diseases, for all physicians have agreed on these matters, and they are not disagreed upon the remedy with cautery in those cases.
And know, children, that the secret of healing with cautery and fire, and its usefulness, has been discussed in comparison to medication that burns. This is because fire is simple, and its effect only reaches the member that is being cauterized, and it does not harm the other members connected to it except with a small injury.
Here's a line-by-line translation of the given sentence:
Here's a line-by-line translation of the provided text:
And know, children, that they disagree about the time in which it is suitable to perform cautery and consider the best time to be spring.
And I say that cautery is suitable at any time, because the damage caused by accidental circumstances is mitigated by the benefit derived from the cautery, and especially if the cautery is for necessary pains or diseases, such as strong and fistulous ones, which do not tolerate delay because it is feared that evil may come, which is greater than a small harm entering due to time.  (Translation: Cautery is appropriate at any time because the benefit of cautery outweighs the potential harm caused by performing it at the wrong time, especially for urgent or severe conditions where delay could lead to worse outcomes.)
And this does not enter into your thoughts, or, children, only the common people and foolish doctors think that way, for they believe that such an illness, which is cured by cautery, will always recur, and they consider that consequence. (Translation: Don't be swayed by such ideas, my children, for only ignorant laypeople and unwise physicians hold this belief. They mistakenly believe that an illness treated with cautery will inevitably return, leading them to this conclusion.)
And the reason is not as they think, because cautery is only used in cases where medicine cannot change the complexion and dry out the humors that cause the pain. (Translation: The true reason is different from what they believe. Cautery is employed when medicines are unable to alter the body's constitution or eliminate the moist humors responsible for causing pain.)
It seems like you're looking for a translation of a medieval medical text. Here's my attempt to translate the sentence:
And it is possible that the patient's illness may return at some point in time, according to the patient's constitution, the location of their illness, and their strength. This also depends on what has been prepared in their body regarding the accumulation of excesses within them, as well as what they have consumed in their diet and similar causes. However, if the illness for which cautery is administered is a subtle illness with few excesses and moisture, such as cautery for tooth pain and similar cases, it is possible that the pain will not return to them, but rather diminish over time.
And it is commonly said that cautery is the last resort in medicine, and this is a true statement, not because I understand it, but rather because I believe that there is no cure that benefits from medicine or any other means before cautery.
However, the opposite is true; and the belief that cautery is the last resort in medicine is only because one has tried all other methods of cure for some illnesses, and those medicines do not work, and so in the end, one administers cautery, which proves beneficial for that purpose. And then it is said that cautery is the last resort in medicine, not according to my opinion but according to the common belief of foolish doctors.
And the ancients said that cautery with gold is better than cautery with iron, and they did not say this except for the equivalence of gold and the sublimity of its substance.
And they said that the place of cautery does not burn, which is not entirely true, for I have already proved and found that it does so in some bodies but not in others; and cauterization with gold is good and better than with iron as they said; however, when you perform cauterization with fire using gold, it is not declared to you, because it ignites according to the amount of gold you want due to the roughness of the gold, and it prepares to receive cold; and if you place a flame on it, the gold will melt in the fire, and some sheets fall into the fire for the craftsman to catch.  (The translation may not be perfect, as there are some ambiguities in the text.)
And therefore, when performing cautery with iron, you must do so more lightly and precisely to ensure the success of the operation.
And I have already organized this chapter on cauterization according to chapters, and I have ordered those from the head down to the feet, so that the inquirer can find what he wants of it.
"The first chapter.
"This cauterization addresses the moisture and cold that cause this accident, which has two causes: it is caused by sodium and an abundance of rheumatic flux, called corissa, flowing from the head to the areas around the eyes and ears, and an abundance of sleep, and toothache and throat ache, and universally all sickness that comes from cold, such as paralysis, dropsy, apoplexy, and similar conditions in those illnesses.
"The method of this cauterization is as follows: first, instruct the patient to take a laxative medicine to cleanse the head for three or four nights, depending on the strength of the patient, their age, and their habits.
"And then instruct them to shave their head with a razor, and then make that person sit between your hands on an inclined bench and place their feet on the ground.
"And then place the edge of your palm close to the bridge of their nose, between their eyes. "However, when your finger reaches the middle of their forehead, mark that spot with a probe, and then ignite the cautery, which is shaped like an olive.
Certainly! Let's translate the text step-by-step:
And then gently lift your hand and look at the area, and if you see any part of the bone exposed, even as small as a grain of sand, then raise your hand. If not, return your hand with that iron, or another similar one if it is cold, until you see what I have told you.
And then take a little salt and dissolve it in water, and let it sit on the area for three days.
And then place upon him a cloth soaked in vinegar and let it rest on him until the scab of the fire is destroyed. And then treat the area with tetragrammaton ointment until it heals.
And they say that as long as the wound remains open, it is better for the arm, because it is more beneficial and healing.
And some of them say that the tendon should be cauterized up to the bone, and the cautery should be held in place until a portion of the appearance of the bone is blackened.
And then scrape away what is adjacent to the bone, and then it should be treated.
And others say that with the cautery it should reach to the end, until it presses strongly into the bone until the bone cracks, and this is the manner of small incision: And they believe that from that place, the vapors of the head escape.
And let the wound be kept open for a long time, and then it should be cured until it is healed.
But I have not seen these two kinds of cautery in all cases, only in some men according to the way of fear; and leave that one, in my opinion, it is better with health than without, because the head is weakened by a break in its continuity, just as we have shown in other members, and especially when the patient's head is of a frail nature.
And the first kind of cautery is safer and better in my opinion, and with that you should work for health.
Chapter two.
On the Cautery of the Head.
When chronic and prolonged pain occurs throughout the entire head, and various remedies such as cupping, bloodletting, purgatives, plasters, poultices, baths, warm compresses, and similar treatments have been used on the patient without success, especially if the head has already been cauterized with a cautery that did not benefit him in any way, then consider whether the patient's head is of strong constitution by nature; and it is not frail, but finds great relief, then cauterize that one with another cautery after that one for a little while. And then cauterize that area on the crown of the head with a pointed cautery until the skin is broken. You cut through the skin and expose the bone to the extent we have measured, and then cauterize that area with a pointed cautery in the back part of the head in the place called "vas," which is where a cupping glass is placed. And be careful with your hand in this matter, and do not expose the bone, because the patient finds very great pain from this, different from the pain of all other cauteries on the head.
And I say this about the location of this cautery, because the cautery used for the horns of the head and the occiput should be finer than that used for the middle part of the head; and that is how it is done.
Chapter ten.
On the cautery for non-chronic migraine.
When there is severe pain in the part of the head, or when the pain spreads to the eye, it should be treated with purgative medicines, and other treatments should be administered as I have described in the sections on illnesses; if this does not help, then cautery can be performed in two ways: either by burning with a sharp instrument, or with an iron. >".
The text appears to be a medieval medical treatise, likely written in Old Occitan or another Romance language with similarities to Latin, Italian, Spanish, and French. Let's translate the given line: And then cut the painful area in the temple with a sharp lance until it reaches the bone, so that it is hidden.
And then strengthen the patient with a poultice to reduce swelling, and leave it on for three hours; then remove it and apply aloe, and leave the wound open for two or three days, and then place a wet cloth over it until the area becomes soft.
And then cure that with an ointment until it is healed.
And if you wish, do so with some warming medications that I have written about in the twelve treatises on warming medications.
But cautery with iron is done in this manner: heat the iron for cautery, which has this shape:
and it is called a "nail," because its head is like the shape of a nail, which has some curvature, and in the middle of it there is a small protuberance.
And then place it on the painful area, and hold your hand — so that the handle is not burned — and turn the iron little by little with speed.
And if the quantity burned by the bone's tip is half of it, lift your hand so that the artery beneath is not burned, to prevent blood flow.
Sure, I can help translate this line:
And if you proceed with cautery using the tip of a lancet as a cautery tool, be careful not to cut an artery in this ancient practice.
Chapter four.
On the ancient practice of cauterizing migraines.
When you treat a migraine with the previously mentioned methods of treatment and it does not benefit from the treatment, sometimes due to the intensity of the illness, what has been said about the first cautery with medicine or the cautery with fire is not enough. Then you must heat the lancet until it is white-hot. This means applying the heated tip along the length of the pain, which is the majority of the finger or toe; and place your hand once and hold it there until you have cut through the artery and reached the bone.
However, it is necessary for you to be careful not to affect the continuation of the jawbone, which is used in chewing, so that the ligaments and nerves connected to it are not damaged, lest a spasm occurs.
And concerning the prevention and caution of bleeding from an opened artery, as there is fear in its opening, especially for those who do not know what they are doing and are not well-studied or experienced; leave the operation to one who knows at first.
"And I will come with a reminder of the regimen for blood flow issues caused by archery, according to its manner, in its place within this book.
"And if this condition does not cease with the use of this cautery, and you see that the patient's body can tolerate it, then cauterize them in the middle of the head as we have described, and care for the wound until it is healed.
"And if you wish, administer the cautery that we mentioned in the chapter on archery injuries, using a cautery with two blades, and this is a better and more effective cauterization.
Chapter 5.
"On the Cauterization of Earaches
"When there is pain in the ear due to cold and it is not cured with purgative treatments or other care that I have mentioned earlier, then apply heat with a cautery. And this one has the name 'punctum,' of which this is the form:
"And the cautery should be as close to the fire as possible, and it should be directed around the entire ear like a wheel is turned, or around each part if the pain is in each specific area. Along you with the cautery of the ear's root, little by little more than you have sensed the place with your finger.
And if the cautery of those points is on the whole ear, and it happens like that, then cure the places inside until they are healed.
Chapter VI
Of the cauterization of the tongue.
The tongue, which is cured and healed by cauterization, is only done with the herbs that come through phlegm, as we have said in the divisions of illnesses.
Avoid cauterizing the herb that comes from dryness or nerve spasm.
When you cure this type of tongue illness with jars and emetics and gargles, and your treatment is not effective, then it is necessary for you to cauterize the patient with three cauteries: one at the root of the ear, the second a little below the temple, and the third at the junction of the two lips. ︎
And place your cautery in opposition to the affected area, because softening only occurs in the area that appears healthy.
And the method of cauterization is that you cauterize it with a cautery on the right side of the ear's tip, a little higher than the horn of the head, and in the temple another one, whose length should be according to the length of the thumb, and hold your hand with the cautery until half the size of the tongue is burnt.
And this is the shape of the cautery, and it is similar to that of a knife, whose shape is in front of the table. But nevertheless, it should be more subtle than that one, a little like a needle; and it is appropriate to remove some of its excess thickness.
And then cure the area with water that has been processed beforehand until it is healed.
Chapter VII.
On the Cauterization of Ancient Apoplexy.
When apoplexy is advanced and you treat it with the water we mentioned, and the patient does not have a fever, then cauterize them with four cauteries: on all the corners of their head; and with a cautery in the middle of the head, as we have said; and with a cautery in the nape. And the manner of the cautery is done as has been said above.
And it has been cauterized on the mouth of the stomach; and it is even more urgent; and then it should be cured with processed water.
Chapter VIII.
On Cauterization for Forgetfulness caused by Flame.
It is necessary to give the patient, at the beginning, large cups and pills that serve as purifiers.
And then shave the entire head of the patient and place on his crown the plaster made from wax, as described in the treatise on plasters.
And place it in this manner several times, for this is the method of cauterization. And do this following that same order which I have already mentioned.
And if by this he is cured well; and if not, then make three cauteries on the lower part of his head, which should descend from the highest part of the head down to the lower part of the neck. And place between each cautery the thickness of a finger, and then cure the cautery with water that has been heated.
But if there is swelling and the patient tolerates it well, then make a cautery in the middle of the area; and if the swelling is more severe, then cauterize that on both corners.
Then treat it so that it is healed; and let the cauteries be olive-shaped according to the form given before.
Chapter IX.
On the cauterization of hemorrhoids and the softening of the entire body.
First, you should cleanse the head with cupping and with water as we have said; then shave the patient's head, and then cauterize it in the middle of the head, and with cauteries on all corners of the head, and with cauteries on the back part of it, and with three cauteries on the vertebrae of the neck.
And if it is necessary in the disease of softening of the body from too much and the patients tolerating and the disease is strong, then cauterize with four cauteries on the vertebrae of the back, and afterwards cauterize until it is covered by the scab of him, and raise your hand. And then care for him until he is healed, and this should be done with olive oil.
Chapter 10.
Of the Cauterization of Epilepsy.
Do not cauterize the epileptic unless his epilepsy is due to phlegm.
Therefore, it is necessary to cleanse his brain at the beginning with years and with the other treatment which we have said in the division when the patient is great and tolerating the rejection of the medications.
And if it is a child who does not tolerate the medications, then administer purgatives and masticators, which cleanse the servants, in front of him by mouth for many days, with the improvement of the food.
Then shave the head of the patient, and then cauterize him with one cautery in the middle of the head according to the aforementioned method, and with another cautery on his occiput, and on each corner of his head you should cauterize. And if the patient is strong and tolerant, then cauterize them with the cauteries I mentioned earlier, having first prepared a paralytic and softening of the body on the vertebrae of the neck and the vertebrae of the back.
And perform the cautery as has been described previously.
But if the patient is a child, then apply a subtle cautery in this manner.
Chapter XI.
On the Cautery of Melancholy.
When the causes of melancholy are corrupt humidity and thick phlegm, then cauterize with the cauteries we have mentioned, having prepared a paralytic agent first.
And if the cause of melancholy is an excess that inclines toward melancholy, and the patient's body is moist, then give them water to drink that purifies the brain according to what was mentioned earlier in the division.
Then shave the patient's head, and then make a well-formed tonsure from it on the crown, and then place that in the middle of the head.
And let the patient be seated upright, and let them be held on all sides.
Then apply a liniment; and it is more fitting to use old sheep's wool for this. And heat him over a controlled fire, whose degree of heat he can tolerate when he is most sensitive. And approximately place him in the middle of his head in the circle, and let him enter until he is submerged.
And do this with the patient once a week for the entire week, along with his other treatments until he is healed; or if you prefer, cauterize him making small points according to his ability, unless you have your hand with a cautery thus prepared: this type of cautery moistens the brain equally.
And then place that bandage soaked in vinegar or gray gallnut.
Chapter XII.
On the cautery of water descending into the eye.
When you have detected the beginning of water in the eye by the signs I mentioned in the division, then begin and give the patient something to drink that will cleanse his head, and keep him away from all moisture.
And have him bathe in warm water for several days.
And then instruct him to shave his head, and cauterize him with a cautery in the middle of his head; and then cauterize him with two cauteries on both temples if the water's issuance begins in both eyes, or with one stroke if it begins in one eye.
Incise with a cautery all the veins and arteries that are under the tongue; and let the cauteries be in that direction, towards the temples.
And be careful of blood flow when it is cauterized; and if you see blood flowing from it, stop the flow with some medicine that is available to you.
And I will come with wisdom in the extraction of arteries and in their amputation, as well as in preventing blood flow.
And sometimes it is cauterized on the neck under two bones with two carefully prepared cauteries.
Chapter XIII.
Of the Cauterization of Old Tears.
When tears of the eyes are old and continuous, and it is verified that this is due to an excess of phlegmatic humors in the veins and arteries located on the outer part of the head, then cauterize with a cautery as we have mentioned in the chapter on water falling into the eyes, and with a cautery in the middle of the head, and with two cauteries on the neck under two temples, and with two cauteries on the neck under two bones. And if you need additional treatment, then cauterize it along the entire length of the lower eyelid's edge with a small cautery.
Chapter Fourteen
About Cauterizing Nasal Odor
When you treat someone with the water we mentioned in the division and your treatment does not work, then prepare and give the patient three nights of drinking cochineal; after that, shave their head, and cauterize them with a mixture of half cautery oil and half olive oil. Then cauterize that area with carnation oil, using two cauteries on the two eyebrows, a little below the hairline.
And be careful not to burn too deeply in that area.
And this is the way of carnation oil cauterization.
Chapter Fifteen
About Cauterizing to Soften the Eyelids
When the eyelid of the eye is softened by illness or moisture, then cauterize that eyelid with a lunar cautery; and this is its form:
And if you choose to cauterize that area on the two eyebrows a little, use two cauteries in all parts, and they should be elongated from the temples. And let the length of each cautery be according to the thickness of the skin.
And do not press too hard with your hand on the cautery, but rather according to the amount that the lower third of the eyelid is numb.
Chapter XVI
About the cautery of the eyelid, when the eyelashes turn inwards and punch the eye.
When the eyelashes are turned inwards to such an extent that they poke the eye, cautery is done in two ways: either by burning or with a burning medicine.
If you are cauterizing with fire, command the patient before this that he pull out his eyelashes as those who pluck them, until they grow back and are trimmed; and if it hurts him, then strengthen his eyes with a bandage so that he is not disturbed until the eyelashes have grown back.
Therefore, when they have grown back and been trimmed, then place the patient's head in your lap, and then mark on his eyelids with a probe according to the shape of a holly leaf, and let the beginning of the mark be near the lashes.
And then place a cotton ball soaked in egg white or paste of flaxseed on the wound.
Then heat up the cautery, which is shaped like this.
Then cauterize on the figure you have marked, little by little, in small areas, until the surface of the skin is burnt and appears like a myrtle leaf, completely clearly.
The sign of the healthiness of this work is that you will see the eyelid of the wound already contracted and the hairs of it raised towards the point of the wound.
Therefore raise your hand and leave it for three days, and then place on it a cotton pad with a border until the scar is healed. And then treat it with ointment until it is healed.
But if the hairs return for some reason and the eyelid becomes softened, then do the cautery again on that area just as you did at first.
But if the hairs are on the eyelid, then cauterize it until it is raised to its natural place and is healed, and that the hairs do not touch the eye.
Here's the translation of the given sentence:
Sure, let's translate this line by line:
And place the tongue [or perhaps: the instrument] on the medicine and press it a little and do not move it until the patient feels the burning of the medicine, for the burning is in them as if by fire.
And when you perceive that he has found the burning, then remove the medicine and move it away with your tongue; and when the burning ceases, then return the medicine and wash the wound with water; and then consider if you see the eyelid raised as if washed by the constriction with fire or incision, for then it is well; and if not, return to the place of the medicine where you have not pressed the medicine and do not move until your operation is completed and the wound is healed.
Then place over the wound with a bandage until the swelling of the injury subsides, and then cure it with an ointment of rosemary or another until it is healed.
And it is necessary for you, in your operation, to guard with vigilant diligence that no residue of the medicine falls into the wound. And if after some days the eyelid becomes softened and any hair is stuck in the wound, then repeat your medicine on the place where the eyelid is softened, and just as you did at first, and then irrigate it until it is healed.
And this is the shape of the myrtle leaf.
And know that human feet are differentiated by size and smallness, so your treatment should be based on this.
And do not hide the way of correctness from those who study in this art.
Chapter XVII.
On the cauterization of a fistula that is in the tear duct of the foot.
When you treat a fistula as mentioned in the divisions of diseases, and your treatment does not work, then you should cauterize it in this manner: instruct the patient to place their head on your shoulder, and have someone hold their head between your hands so that it is not moved or shaken by their own head.
And then place cotton wool filled with egg white or pillowcase stuffing on the patient's foot.
And then heat the cautery, which has this form:
Which should be concave, like the shape of a reed or a vulture's feather, and with one end used for the cautery.
And if you wish, it may also be penetrating at the other end. If you want it to be so, try as I suggest.
But nevertheless, the one who is skillful is better suited for the task.
Then press the fistula if it is open, and draw from it blood and dry it up. And if it is not open, then open it and extract the pus from it.
Then place over it the cautery which is well-lit, and with that skillful hand a little below the cautery of the lip toward the nose, so that your hand does not err or disturb the patient, and then place the cautery on the corners of the lip and burn it.
And thus, if at the beginning of your cautery it goes into the bone, that is good; and if not, then repeat the cautery one or two times, if necessary; and leave it like this for three days, and then place over that point a compress and surround it with an astringent ointment until it is healed.
But if eleven days have passed and it is not healed, then place over it a caustic, corrosive medicine until the bone is exposed and scrape it according to what you find appropriate in your judgment.
And there is another method of cauterizing a fistula, which some earlier people said: take a thin wire whose shape matches the shape of it; and pour into it the amount of one ounce of melted lead; and hold it with your hand firmly, so that the patient is not disturbed and the melted lead does not reach the lip of that; and it is necessary to place over the lip of the patient a compress filled with egg white or water, because lead adheres to the place of the fistula and heals it through wonderful healing.
Here's the translation of the given sentence:
Chapter XVIII.
Of the cauterization of the cleft of the feet.
Many times these fissures occur in the lips, and most commonly in the lips of children.
Therefore, when you treat those fissures with the water we mentioned in the sections and your treatment is not effective, then heat a small pointed knife with fire and burn it as follows:
And let the cavity of it be according to the subtlety of the knife.
Then place that gently in those fissures until the cautery reaches the bottom of the fissures.
And then treat it with ointments until it is healed.

On the cauterization of a fistula in the mouth.
When an abscess develops at the root of the uvula or on the palate or at the root of the teeth, and it grows large, and then bursts, and becomes chronic, and runs pus and a fistula is formed, and you treat it but the treatment is not effective, then you should heat a cautery according to the size that fits into the fistula, and then insert the heated cautery into the opening of the fistula, and hold your hand until the red-hot iron reaches its depth; and do this once or twice; and then treat it with the water we have mentioned for treatment until it is healed.
And therefore if the wound is cut and healed, it is good; but if not, then it is necessary to uncover the area and remove the decayed bones according to what will be found in its chapter.
Chapter 20
On the Cautery of Teeth and the Softening of the Tongue
When the tongue is softened by moisture and the teeth are rotten, and you treat them with medicines but they do not heal, then place the head of the patient in your lap, and quickly ignite the cautery whose shape will be shown to you hereafter, so that you place the little spoon over the tooth and insert the cautery into it swiftly, holding the back of the hand a little behind so that the patient feels the heat of the fire reaching the root of the tooth.
Then lift your hand, and then apply the cautery several times as you wish.
And then have the patient rinse their mouth with salt water and hold it for an hour, and then stop it, because the rotten tooth is now stopped and the softened gum is strengthened and the corrupt moisture is dried up.
Chapter 21
"About the use of cautery for tooth pain.
"When tooth pain is due to coldness, or if there is a blister or worm, and you cannot cure it with medicine, then cauterize the affected area in two ways: either with the edge of a cow's horn, or with fire.
"Cauterize with the horn by taking the horn of a cow and heating it in the fire until red hot. Then take a cloth and wrap it around the tip of the horn to protect your hand. Next, quickly press the heated horn against the painful tooth until it is numbed.
"And then repeat this process several times until the heat reaches the root of the tooth.
"And if you wish, dip wool or cloth in the heated horn's liquid, place it on the painful tooth, and then place hot iron on top until the heat reaches the pulp of the tooth.
"However, the cauterization with fire is performed using an ear spoon or a metal rod that is thick in the middle to prevent the heat from reaching the patient's mouth too intensely.
"Then heat the cautery to the desired shape and place it on the tooth, holding it with your hand until the cautery is hot enough; do this several times, as the pain should subside either that day or the next.
And it is necessary that the patient fills his mouth with good cloth and holds it for an hour, and then spits it out; and this is how to prepare the cautery.
And cauterize with whatever extreme measure is possible for you.
And this is how to prepare the cannula.
Chapter XXII
On Cauterization of Extrusions
When extrusions are caused by phlegm and cold humors and do not respond to digestive medicines, you should apply heat gently. Then you should prepare the cautery in the following shape: it has two openings, one for the smoke to exit, and the other is for applying the heat to the abscess once, or twice if needed, until it reaches the center of the abscess.
And if the abscess is small, then apply the cautery according to the size of the abscess, and leave it there for three days, and place a cloth soaked in vinegar on it until what has been burnt by the fire is removed.
And then treat it with ointments, poultices, and dressings until it is healed.
"Chapter XXIII
"On cauterizing hoarseness of voice and constriction of breath.
"When humidity affects the canal of the lung, especially when it is accompanied by coldness in the chest, then the patient should first be evacuated with purgatives, and afterwards you must cauterize the affected area at the bottom of the throat.
"And be careful not to reach the throat with the cautery or burn the windpipe, but only a little.
"And you must cauterize it with another cautery at the joint of the neck on its last vertebra. "And the cautery should be shaped like a nail, according to the previously described method.
"Then you must treat it with the remedy that has been mentioned earlier until it is healed.
"Chapter XXIV
"On Cauterizing Lung Ailments and Coughing
"When cough and lung ailments are due to cold humors and the patient does not have fever or phlegm and the condition is chronic, then you should cauterize with two cauteries on the furcula [clavicle] in the depressed places, front and back; and with another cautery in the middle of the foot between two small bones; and the cauteries should be shaped like nails according to the previously described method.
And if you want, let your cautery point be made with the pointed instrument that is called a "point," and its form should precede in the treatment of earache pain.
And let points be placed inside those; then cure it with water that has been consecrated beforehand so that it may heal.
And the pointed instruments should have three prongs because cautery is done with them: with one motion you can make three cauteries following this form.
Chapter XXV.
Of the cauterization of the nipple, which is the head of the teat.
When the nipple is dislocated due to moist lubricants and does not return to its proper place at the time of its return, you should remove the dislocation until it returns to its customary position. Then, with a slight movement, it should be put back in place as it should be, as we have experienced. Therefore, it is necessary that you first reduce the dislocation, and then turn the patient onto their side or onto their left flank. Then raise the handle which is in the inner part of the nipple to the outer parts with your left hand, if the joint is dislocated to the inner parts.
"And the cautery should have two tips; this is its form:
"And then cauterize the cord until it penetrates from one side to the other; and thus the figure of cautery will have four tips.
"And sometimes it is adjusted according to this method, and because there are eight cauteries.
"And then place the powder of salts on the cautery, and then make the patient rest in tranquility, so that the member is not moved for any time until it is comforted.
"And if the dislocation is in the upper parts and is done later, then cauterize on the muscle with a pointed cautery or with several pointed cauteries, because the joint is strengthened and the moisture is dried up and the patient is healed.
"Chapter 26.
"About cauterizing the stomach.
"When there is cold and damp humors in the stomach that cause it to become distended and many ulcers appear, and if you continue with the usual methods of treatment without improvement, then the patient should be placed on their back, stretching out their hands and legs, and then cauterize that area with three cauteries: one cautery below the feet, equal in length to a finger's width, using a pointed cautery; and two cauteries below the ribs of the first cautery, so that the figure of the cautery becomes triangular; and make sure that they are not too close together as this will cause burning.
And if the depth of the cautery is equal to two-thirds of the thickness of the cord.
And let the figure of the cautery be according to this shape without addition. And if you wish, cauterize with a large cautery in the middle of the stomach according to this shape; and let this be a cautery in the shape of a circle according to this shape:
And let the stomach be punctured at that point which is indicated by this cautery: and it is that you should know on the stomach, a point according to the quantity that you want with a probe, and then cauterize that point with a cautery; and then heal that with the healing method that has been described previously until it is healed.
Chapter 27
On the burning of the free foot
When pain occurs in the foot due to cold or humidity or excessive flatulence, and its natural state is disrupted by superfluous exit, and the patient is treated with the water we mentioned earlier without fasting, then it is necessary that the patient be placed on their back, and feel with a probe three cauteries according to this shape and quantity, placing them on the foot below the hypochondria, which is the human position.
And let there be a space between each cautery according to the size of the finger, and let the cauteries be placed according to the length of the body straight.
And do not press too much with the cauteries.
And if the amount of water that is administered is not equal to half of a cup's measure, then it should be adjusted accordingly; and if the patient is standing on their feet, they should sit down; he who has already spread out his bedclothes, and raised his arms.
And it is possible for you to perform these cauteries with a pointed knife, when you have skill and discretion in the art.
And be careful not to incise too deeply in the cauterization, and let the measure of all the cup be administered so that it may be evenly distributed throughout the body and reach into the intestines, for the intestine is subtle here; and know this.
Chapter XXVIII.
Of the perforation of an abscess in the foot with a cautery.
When a swelling or abscess appears in the foot and you want to know if that abscess is in the flesh of the foot or in its membrane, then if it is in the flesh of the foot, the patient will experience heaviness and pain without sharpness.
And if it is in the tunic of the spleen, with great pain and often doctors are already exhausted from caring for him.
Therefore, it is necessary that the patient be turned onto their back; and then indicate the location of the abscess with a tent; and then heat up the cautery which resembles a needle, whose form has been described on the previous page. And cauterize with that and the cautery until the entire cord is burned, until it reaches the hipbone, until sanies appears.
And then treat that with other abscesses' treatment until it heals.
And it is not necessary to use this form of cautery except that which has been studied in the art of medicine and which many sick people have known; but this one with some experience has been daring about this operation, nevertheless leave that one for us, and it is better.
Chapter XXIX
On the Cauterization of Plaure.
The ancients used to cauterize the plaure with this method: take a long, dry, thin reed of the size of a finger, as thick as your little finger.
Sure, I'll provide a line-by-line translation of the text you provided:
And it is not necessary that you grasp the cautery with your hand, rather let it be at the tip of the chain in operation.
And some ancient doctors said that among men who use a cautery made of iron like a ray and glowing hot, placing it in the location between the ribs until it reaches the abscess and expels pus, as we have said about the abscess on the foot.
But in this procedure with a cautery there is fear, because if one dies quickly from an accident at the site of the fistula, it does not heal.
Chapter .xxx
About the cauterization of the spleen.
When you treat the illness of the spleen with what we have said about treatment in the division and do not complete your treatment, then cauterize it according to three methods, all of which are correct, one of which is that you make three or four lines according to the length of the spleen like the figure of the cauteries of the foot, whose figure has been shown before.
And between each cautery let the width be about a finger's breadth or slightly more, and the manner of cauterization is the same as we have said for the cauteries of the foot likewise.
And do not compress your hand with the cautery; let the patient be on their back.
And there is another way to cauterize, which is to heat the cautery with two applications, as we have mentioned in the chapter on dislocation of the muscle, and raise the chain that is at the place of the spleen where the patient's left side rests.
And let your elevation with which you raise the chain be according to the length of the body, so that cauteries are made according to the width of the body.
And then introduce the two applications, heating them well, into that entrance where you will penetrate the chain from the other side.
And then remove the cautery; thus four cauteries are made.
And if you wish, cauterize with a cautery having three applications.
And then you take care of the cautery after it has been used for too many days, because it is more convenient than the other causes mentioned earlier in the treatment.
Chapter .31
On Cauterizing Dropsy Patients
Do not cauterize dropy patients except for ulcers specifically.
When you treat a dropy patient with the methods of treatment that we have mentioned in the division and do not agree with your treatment, then it is necessary that he be cauterized with four cauteries around the navel and one cautery on the stomach, and another cautery on the spleen, and another cautery on the liver, and two cauteries between the vertebrae of the back, and one cautery on the right foot, and another cautery on the stomach. And let the depth of the cautery be proportional to the length of the spine.
And then leave the cautery open so that you may keep your arm in place for a long time.
And do not remove the patient from treatment near the cautery with water that is needed so that two things are added to him: hastened healing and fast help.
The shape of the cautery with which the belly is cauterized should be like a nail according to its form as mentioned before, and that with which the back is cauterized should be like an olive tree according to its form.
Chapter XXXII.
On Cauterization of Feet and Hips.
When the feet are swollen from edema and filled with water, it is necessary to cauterize the soles of the feet in the space between the auricular vein and the anular vein, and raise your hand with the cautery and do not twist it; and then raise your hand, and do not lower it completely, because the water will return.
The cautery should be done in this manner: And then make two cauteries on both hips, and on each hip a cautery should be made with the pointed end of the cautery. Here is the translation for the given sentence:
And let the wound remain open without treatment for a long time so that some water drains from it.
Then treat the patient with those causes that we have mentioned.
Chapter .33
About Cauterization of the Abdomen
When the abdomen is due to cold and humidity entering it, weakening the faculties - the digestive and retentive faculties which are in the stomach and intestines - it is treated with various methods of treatment, and sometimes patients endure cautery of the faculty, then cauterize them with a large cautery on their own stomach as previously mentioned in the cauterization of the stomach, with circular cautery and four subtle cauteries around the navel, and a subtle pointed cautery; and also cautery above the groin with a large cautery or two cauteries.
And if sometimes excessive humidity occurs and the patient can tolerate it, then cauterize that area on the pubic region and on the intestines, and carefully place two cauteries on the stomach near the groin, for this is a perfect cure from which there will be no error.
Capítulo xxxiv. (This means "Chapter 34")
About the Cauterization of Old Hemorrhoids.
When old hemorrhoids are in nature due to thick humor fringes or corrupt humidity, and they are treated with the water we mentioned earlier and do not confer their cure, then cauterize with three cauteries below the little spine of the back, small and triangular, and with a cautery above the navel that goes for two times.
And if you think his stomach is cold and his food is not digested, and his face is often pale, then cauterize with a large cautery on the stomach as has been said before; and with one cautery on the liver, and with another cautery on his spleen with a nail-shaped cautery, and leave the cautery open for some time, and then cure him within so that he is healed.
Capítulo xxxv.
On the Cauterization of Atheroma Near Their Absorption.
When you incise an atheroma, then heat the cautery that is like a ray. Then insert that heated into the incised atheroma, and finish your hand inside until the cautery reaches the orifice of the vein from which the blood comes.
And do this once or twice, because if the blisters are too many, then cauterize each of them as we have described, and then treat them with what is suitable from the ointments until they are healed.
And if you cauterize with a large cautery on something, it will take longer to heal.
Chapter .xxxvi.
Of the cauterization of fistulas which are made in nature due to their parts.
When nature does not comply with the work we have recommended in its place, and the patient is afraid of it, let them be healed with a cautery.
Therefore, when someone has a fistula in the nature behind them, and it is old, and it has corrupt sanies and corrupted humidity, and so what is most deserving is that you should test it with a subtle probe, and then know the quantity of its depth with the aforementioned probe. ›
Then ignite the cautery that is similar to a ray. And then place this ignited cautery in this fistula, according to the quantity in which the probe enters.
And repeat with this cautery until those corrupted parts are burnt once or twice or three times, according to your necessity.
And beware of the burning of nerves and veins; or if a fistula goes to the body of the bladder or the body of the intestine, then beware of all those places; and do not do this unless the fistula is in a fleshy and thick place that does not penetrate.
And then heal the place so that it may heal.
And if the place is closed, and any foreign matter has been removed from it, and it remains thus for a long time, then know that it is completely healed.
And if the foreign matter is not removed from it, then know that it is penetrating or in the marrow of the bone is rotten, or this comes from those causes which will be remembered in their place.
Chapter 37.
About the Cauterization of Wounds.
When pain occurs in wounds due to cold or excessive moisture, and for this reason the patient's flesh is emaciated, then you should cauterize that [area] on the wounds with a cautery over each wound, using a small pointed cautery as previously mentioned.
And make the second cautery strongly with a small one afterwards, so that three lined cauteries will come, and thus they will be more lasting in healing.
Chapter 38
About the Cauterization of the Bladder
When there is debility and softening in the bladder due to cold and moisture, such that the patient cannot retain urine, then cauterize in the area below where the pubic hair begins, towards the front of the bladder, and cauterize with a pointed cautery on the right side of it, and with another on the left side of it.
And the length of each cautery should be according to the size of the navel; and cauterize that area with a pointed cautery in the lower back region, or with two cauteries if necessary.
And let the cautery be sharp according to what is needed.
Chapter 39
About the Cauterization of the Womb
When cold and moisture affect the womb, making conception difficult, corrupting the menstrual flow, delaying its onset, and causing pain during menstruation, then the area should be cauterized with three cauteries around the navel, as we have said for the cautery of the bladder; and with a pointed cautery in the lower back region, or with two cauteries, and let the cauteries be sharp.
Based on the provided text and the similarities with Latin, Italian, Spanish, and French, here's my attempt at translating "Capitol .xl." into English:
"About the use of cautery for ankle dislocation.
"When mucus is infused in the part of the ankle, and this causes the bone to leave its place, a sign of this is that one limb appears elongated compared to the other. "And the location of the dislocation is found by seeking out the swelling.
"Therefore, it is necessary to cauterize the patient on the part of the ankle with a circular cautery tool, since you will have identified with a probe in the circle of that part as it turns around, and so that the part falls into the middle of the circle.
"And let the previous cautery tool be used for the cautery of the stomach.
"And if this cautery tool is not available to you, then cauterize with three cauteries using a large olive-shaped cautery.
"And let the cautery be performed according to the thickness of the entire ankle; and then care for that until it heals.
"Chapter 41.
"On the use of cautery for sciatic vein issues.
"When pain occurs in the ankle area due to cold and dampness, and the treatment mentioned above is not effective, it means that the patient has thick humors. Therefore, you must purge the patient of these humors with either foul-smelling pills or artificial pills; then cauterize accordingly.
The method of using a cautery in this manner is according to two methods: either using a cautery with burning medicine or using a cautery with fire.
The procedure varies according to two scientific methods. One of these methods is to cauterize that part at the base of his ankle with three triangular cauteries like this; and do so with good depth. And the space between each cautery should be equal to the thickness of a finger, whether the cauteries are small or large.
However, sometimes place the cauteries in the middle of the ankle, because there are four cauteries.
And if you wish, use the circle preceding the shape in the cauterization of ankle dislocation, ensuring that it is a continuous and burning circle covering the entire circumference.
And this is the method of cauterization for gout when the pain is confined to the ankle and has not spread into the joint.
However, if it has spread into the joint, then cauterize with two cauteries on the joint at the place where the patient directs the pain, and with one cautery on the heel four fingers below the calf muscle.
And if you use a knife for the cautery, then let the depth of the cautery be according to the thickness of the tendon.
And if the patient indicates that the pain is spread within the area of the feet, then cauterize that spot where they indicate with a pointed cautery for three or four points, or more if necessary.
And if the patient indicates that the pain is below the knee towards the thigh, then cauterize that spot with a knife-like cautery.
And be careful in all cautery that you do not penetrate too deeply with the cautery so that you burn the nerves or large blood vessels, and thus cause harm to the patient such as paralysis or contracture.
And I have seen one or two of those who cauterized on the ankle and penetrated too deeply in the cautery, and the swelling inflamed until the tumor reached the foot, and it was perforated and rotted the entire foot. And this happens very frequently and often leads to death.
And if the pain is in two parts at once, cauterize each one according to this method.
And the wise men said in the cautery of water, use an instrument of which this is the manner: make it similar to a circle of iron, whose circumference is half a palm; and let its orifices be according to the thickness of a finger bone or even less.
And within that circle should be another third [part]; and the space between them should be the thickness of a finger; and those circles should be open on two sides; and the length of these chains should be one finger or two fingers, and make on these margins an iron border decently placed around the circles; and this is its shape.
Then it should be heated in the fire until it becomes red and gives off sparks, and then it should be placed on the affected area of the body, with the patient lying on their back. And therefore, cauterize that part three times around in one go.
And then leave that part for three days; and then bandage it with a border and leave the wound open for too many days; and then treat it with ointments until it is healed.
Al-Zahrawi says: O my sons, of this type of cautery we have used little because of the fear of its result and because few are those who watch over it.
But from these cauteries benefit those who suffer from them, and find with them the remedy for their condition.
But cauteries with medicines should be made in two circles, having a perforated armilla [armored ring] in which the iron border is placed; the length of the walls should be two fingers or whichever one you prefer.
And if the space which is between each quantity of the thickness of the said [thing]; and they are opened below and above, and they should contain themselves between them according to this form:
Then place the patient lying on their left side over the joint, and press your hand over the joint; then take some hot water and pour it between two circles [or rings], and the quality of that [water] should be heated little by little with fire, and you keep it for the duration of one hour, until the patient endures the burning sensation and the swelling — because this remedy causes a burning like fire — until the burning stops.
Then lift your hand with the instrument and wipe away all the hot water from the joint with cold water.
Then leave it alone for three days and place a bandage on it until the blackness of the swelling has diminished, then leave it alone for some more days, after which there will be no soreness; this is done as an aid.
Then treat it with ointments until it is healed.
And if the pain extends to the hip or thigh, make a container for him that contains water in the same way as is done with the joint.
And this is the method of hot water treatment, which I have already written about in the treatise on the rectification of medicines. Recipe of alkali and fresh lime in equal parts, one from each, grind them together and place them in a new pot, of which the bottom is pierced by a small hole, according to the amount that enters into him.
And place under the bottom of the pot another pot filled with water, and pour over that alkali and lime hot water, which covers them by about an inch. After you have pressed them well with the warm hand for good compression, let the pot drain the acrid water into the lower pot.
And then adjust all that water, and pour it over renewed lime and alkali, because it will then have very strong causticity, which is used in many medical operations and for the cauterization of other limbs, because it acts like fire.
And some of the medicines with which it is used for cauterization are also tea, manna and lime mixed with soap in this way.
And Galen recounts from an ancient man the operation and treatment with which the pain of water and sciatica is cured, and he highly praised it and said that no other treatment was necessary, because it is cured once as reported, for whoever enters a bath and exits healthy.
This text appears to be a medieval medical instruction, possibly from the Iberian Peninsula given its linguistic features. Let's translate it line by line:
And let it be left for a period of three hours or for however long the patient feels relief from the adjustment.
Then place the patient in a bath and when their body is heated, move them to the floor, for the pain will cease and they will be healed.
And know that it is not necessary to use cautery with these medicines except when the body needs to expel something.
However, Escorides said that when the stretching vein is cauterized with goat fat, it will benefit the patient more; and perform the cautery as follows: take wool and soak it in old oil, then place it between the toes of the foot and between the fingers.
Then take dry goat fat and inflame it with fire until it becomes charcoal; then place it on the wool and leave it there until it is extended. Then repeat this process, and do not stop doing so until the feeling of biting reaches the ankle and relieves the pain.
And this method of cautery is called "cautery of goats".
Chapter 42.
On the cauterization of back pain.
Sure, let's translate this line by line:
And apply the cautery only in this specific case, which is caused by the overflow of cold matter.
Therefore, it is necessary to evacuate the patient with purgative pills and similar substances, which should be made on the back where the pain is located in three lines according to his size, since there will be ten cauteries in each line, or more if needed, according to the patient's tolerance and strength.
And let the cauterization be done with a pointed cautery.
If you wish, you can cauterize with three or four mid-sized nail-shaped cauteries in this manner:
Chapter .43.
On the use of cautery at the beginning of yellowing (jaundice).
This illness often afflicts small children; and the sign of its beginning in children is that it happens to them suddenly, with a high fever and restlessness.
And you will find it in the last vertebra of the back and the nape, which begins to protrude above the other vertebrae.
Therefore, when you see this and wish to prevent it, then cauterize that area with a circular cautery in this manner: That he takes the cautery over every part of the spine equally.
And if you wish, cauterize around the circumference of the spine with a pointed cautery, two or three lines. And let the points be close together.
And then care for the area so that it heals with the treatment we have described.
But beware that cautery is not administered on a swelling caused by nerve spasm.
Chapter 44.
On the Cauterization of Gout and Joint Pain
When joint pain is caused by cold humors that infiltrate each part of the body, and when pain occurs in the feet, it is customarily called gout by doctors.
And therefore, when gout caused by cold humors is cured with a method of treatment and the pain is not relieved, then cauterize again.
And it is that you should cauterize there to promote proper evacuation around the joint of the foot with many cauteries.
And let it be cauterized olive-shaped, which has this form:
And if it is necessary to make points on the surface of the foot, then do so with a pointed cautery. And if the pains rise into the teeth or other joints, and this occurs many times, then cauterize each tooth with three or four cauteries of olive oil in each session.
And if you need to apply many cauteries, then do so and do not press too hard with the cautery beforehand; it should only be slightly surrounding the tip of the needle.
And if the pain spreads to the tooth and the back, then apply the cautery as we mentioned in its chapter.
And if the pain is only in the hands and it is called "suagra", then prick along the edge of the fingernails as they turn, pricking along those two lines.
And if there remains pain in the fingers, then prick around the edges of the fingernails on each finger and at the base of the hand.
And if the pain spreads after a few days to the elbows or the muscles, then cauterize each of these areas entirely from their assistants.
And do not evacuate the patient with good diet and medicine reception, for if a good diet is followed and the inflammation is evacuated with this cautery, it will heal, God willing.
Chapter 45.
On Cauterizing Ruptures.
When a rupture occurs in the inguinal region and the intestines protrude before the hernia, and this begins to happen, then it is necessary for you to tell the patient to cease his food that day and to use lenitive remedies so that the opening of his abdomen may close.
And then follow the patient between your hands on his back, and command him to keep his breath held until he is thrown out or the hernia or intestines appear.
And then return with those words and signs, trying to locate the rupture on the pubic bone, marking the location where it is similar to half of a circle at the upper parts of the body.
And then ignite the cautery whose form is as follows:
until it becomes very hot and shoots sparks. And then return the intestine or hernia to its cavity, and place your hand over the area to prevent the intestine from coming out.
You have already opened the space between the patient's thighs, placed a cushion under them, and another servant on their legs, and another on their chest, holding their hands.
Based on the pattern you've provided, here's the translation of the given sentence:
And observe carefully the movement of the intestine during your cauterization, lest you burn that intestine and cause death or other great illness upon the patient.
And know that when using the cautery, do not touch the bones, lest you ruin your work.
It is fitting that the cautery for children be fine according to their age and size.
And carefully tend to the cauterized area for three days with bandages until the scab of the fire is removed.
And also tend to him with other ointments until he is healed.
And the patient should lie on their back for forty days, until the area and the wound are sealed.
It is fitting that you provide the patient's nourishment according to the length of time required for their healing, and that it does not cause the intestines to come out due to the effort of recovery.
And when they wish to rise after forty days, then administer a properly made poultice, and let them keep it for another forty days.
And let them be restricted from work and excessive food and drink, and from loud voices, for when they follow this complete regimen of healing, they will be healed.
And I will describe the treatment for ruptures in other parts of the abdomen. At first, and if you do not want them to break further, then cauterize the rupture with a round-pointed cautery according to its size; and let what is excreted from the codena be treated as in the third part; and then treat it as described above, if it is not suitable.
And some have already said that the rupture should be cauterized with a triangular cautery according to this shape, because it is indicated by experience.
And place a line that goes through the latitude in the back above the rupture, and another line above it; and hold your hand with a pointed cautery, but the first cautery is lighter and better.
Chapter XLVI.
About Cauterizing the Umbilicus.
When a member has pain from a blow or a fall and the pain persists for a long time and you do not cure it with medicine, then you should cauterize with a pointed cautery.
And the size of the cautery should be according to the size and smallness of the member, its strength and weakness, and the location of the navel and pain in it.
Therefore, if it is healed by the first cautery, that is good; but if not, then repeat the cautery on it; for it is customary with those pains to be punctured from one member to another near it, so you should achieve them with the cautery until the patient is healed.
Chapter XLVII.
"On the Cauterization of Leprosy.
"Lepers are sometimes treated with a cautery for great benefit, especially if the type of leprosy is caused by the putrefaction of black bile and melancholy.
"Therefore, when you want to cauterize such a person, consider if the leprosy is acute and has been treated with the water we mentioned in the division, and neither this nor that should be said about it, for fear that the corruption will spread throughout the entire body and all its complexion. Then cauterize that person on the head with five cauteries: one in the middle of the head, another below it, reaching the forehead to the hairline; and two on the temples; and one behind, either on the nape or the neck.
"Finish with your hand using the cauteries to press slightly into the bones and remove any hardness, so that the expulsion of gross vapors is relieved from him; and cauterize on the spleen as needed.
"And if the leprosy has already spread across the patient and appears prominently, then you should cauterize him with those cauteries which we have mentioned on the head; and cauterize at the tip of the nose, and with two cauteries on both cheeks, and with two cauteries on both sides of the neck, and with six cauteries on both sides of the back, and one large one near the waist, and one on the waist, and two on each elbow, and one on each arm, and two on each wrist, and one on each knee, and two on each shoulder, and two on each ankle, and two on the soles of his feet; and cauterize him over all the joints of the fingers of the hands and feet, and over each heel of his feet, and over the soles of his hands.
And be careful of the nerves that are on the heel, so that you do not burn them.
And sometimes it is cauterized with a cautery on the bone of the shin and another on the mouth of the stomach, and another on the chest.
And know that the more precisely you apply cauteries, the more beneficial and effective they are; and know that the patient does not feel pain from the cautery itself, as his body is already numb.
And it is necessary that the cauteries be large or small according to the members and joints, as previously specified in the list of instruments.
And then treat the cautery with bran mixed with honey and with the other treatment until it is healed.
Chapter .48.
On the Cauterization of Stupor (Numbness).
When a member is numb or asleep and has been treated with medicines, oils, and plasters, and it does not heal, then you should cauterize that numb member with cauteries according to the size of the member, whether large or small.
And let your cautery enter a little into the tip of the spinal cord. And then care for him with an ointment until he is healed.
And sometimes some numbness is cauterized which affects the hands and feet, and the vertebrae of the back, and where the nerves that move that member come out, and the numbness is removed.
But do not venture into this unless you are wise in the anatomy of the limbs and the exit points of the nerves that move the entire body.
Chapter .49.
Of the cauterization of hemorrhoids that are growing.
When hemorrhoids are old and you cannot cure them with any of the medicinal ointments, then you cauterize it with a cautery for a little while according to the size of the hemorrhoid until its whiteness and color disappear, and its color changes.
And then care for him with a mixture of barley flour and lentils with olive oil and leaves of the arnica plant, and pigeon blood or sparrow blood, each being one part, all mixed together, and then a cloth is oiled and placed on the area until it is healed.
Chapter .50
"On the cauterization of cancer.
"When cancer begins and you wish to remove it, then cauterize the area with a circular cautery following its outline as it turns.
"And the wise have said that it should be cauterized with the last cautery in the middle of the lesion; but I have not seen this, because I fear that it may become ulcerated, and indeed I have seen this happen on some occasions.
"And it is more appropriate that it be cauterized around the lesion with a circle as we have said, or with many cauteries.
"Chapter II.
"On the cauterization of abscesses.
"When some abscesses are delayed in maturing, which happens due to the excess that causes them, or because of the patient's condition, whether old and frail, with little blood, or due to time, and you wish to hasten the maturation of the abscess; then cauterize around it with many small punctuating cauteries; and then leave it alone so that it will hasten in maturing.
"But if you wish to perforate it with a cautery, then heat the cautery which has this shape; and place that in the middle of the abscess until the point penetrates.
And if you cauterize in that place which is lower, so that the arm's body is relieved; then care for that area to be healed.
That appears to mean "Chapter 52." However, without additional context or sentences, it's difficult to provide a more detailed translation. If you have more text from the same treatise, I can help translate it further.
Of the cauterization of ulcers.
An ulcer is a corruption that walks through the limb, which corrodes it as fire consumes dry wood.
Therefore, if you see the ulcer in a place where it can withstand cautery with fire, then heat up the cautery nails very few and large, according to what is appropriate for that place where it is ulcerated.
Then cauterize all around until you have completely eradicated the entire ulcer and left no trace of it.
Then leave it for three days, and cover the cauterized places with a mixture of olive oil, until all the scabs are removed and all corruption is eliminated.
Then treat it with flesh-generating ointments.
But if after three days you see that healthy flesh is growing in the place where there was no corruption, then it is good; but if not, then repeat the cautery on those places where there is still corruption.
And it is treated sometimes with sharp medicine, because that is used in place of a cautery. But nevertheless, the cautery with fire is a more effective remedy.
And I have already mentioned the treatment for it with sharp medicine in the division, and therefore take that when you will begin with him.
Chapter .53.
On cautery of veins and other similar things.
Many times it is seen that in the parts below the sick foot, which is called a vein, and it is large and deep, which enters the foot; and cautery in these is done in two ways, that is cautery with fire and cautery with hot water.
However, the fire cautery is that you burn the cautery concave like a vulture's beak, which should be made of iron according to the quantity that the vein contains throughout its length, and it should have fine edges.
Then place that red-hot (ignit) on the vein, and then turn your hand with the cautery around the circumference of the vein until the cautery reaches the depth of the vein. And leave it for three days until it begins to scab over. "And then apply a poultice made of crushed wild mallow and salt, and leave the poultice on for one night, because that will be effective in removing its causes.
"And then treat the area with an ointment made from the flesh of a castrated animal until it is healed.
"And if it is not effective and many such things appear on the surface of the body, mainly in the hands and feet, then you must apply cautery with water to those areas. You should take a small vessel made of bronze, iron, or a bird's quill, and place it over the nail; then pour a little hot water into the vessel, hold it in your hand, and rotate it with pressure from your hand all around, pressing the edge of the vessel onto the root of the nail. The hot water will find its way to the root of the nail; let the patient endure the heat for an hour, then remove it, because the nail with its roots will be eradicated.
"And do this for all those affected, and then move on to the others until you have done the same for all of them on their body.
And then cure those pustules whose roots are eradicated with the water of ointments that the flesh generates.
Chapter 43
On Cauterization for Tremors
When someone has tremors due to cold in the nerves or fever of a cold cause, or for any similar reason, then you should cauterize them with four cauteries or five on the spine of the back, placing one cautery between each vertebra; and one cautery on their feet, and one on their stomach, using an olive-sized cautery.
And the tremors will subside and hasten the healing of the cold illness.
Chapter 55
On Cauterization for White (Albatic) Accidents of the Body
When there are white spots on the body and pustules that are formed from thick, corrupt materials, then at the beginning of their appearance, it is necessary to cauterize over each head of the fistula with a subtle cautery made of myrtle wood, the end of which is extended with fire; or with long, root-like cauteries; or with lenticular cauteries.
And sometimes it is cauterized with an emery stone at the beginning of its expulsion in this manner; and they are not incised, and the excess causing them is dispersed, and they heal from that.
Based on the pattern you've established with the previous sentences, I would translate this line as follows:
It looks like you only provided the chapter or section title "Capitol lvi." without the actual text to be translated. Please provide the full text that you would like me to translate into English, and I'll be happy to help!
Sure, here is the translation for "De cauterizacio de fluex de sanc accident per incisio de arceria":
Based on the provided text and context, here's a line-by-line translation of the given sentence:
When something like this happens to someone, then you should quickly grab the person's hand and place it on the opening of the wound. Pause on top until the flow of blood from the wound stops, and make sure it does not come out again.
Then place in the fire the pointed and large cautery irons, by the count of nine, and blow on them until they are all glowing hot.
Then take one of the smaller or larger irons according to the location and nature of the wound where the artery has been severed. Quickly place it on that vein after removing your finger, and press the cautery until the blood is sealed and contained.
And if blood is expelled from the opening of the artery when you remove your finger and extract the cautery, then take another cautery quickly from those that have been prepared in the fire, and continue to do this until the bleeding has stopped.
And be careful not to burn the nerve here, lest more harm comes to the patient.
And know that when blood flows from an artery, it is not possible to stop the bleeding in such cases, especially when the artery is large, except by one of these four methods: either with a cautery as we have said, or with extraction if it has not yet been extracted, because when it is extracted the ends are better burned and the blood is stopped; or that it may be tied off with thread or ligature by very strong binding, or that medicines which have the power to stop the bleeding may be applied to it; and let them be strengthened with a cushion by suitable pressure. ➤
The text appears to be discussing a situation where someone is experiencing constriction or tightness due to certain causes. Here's a line-by-line translation:
Here's a line-by-line translation of the given medieval medical text:
Of incision and perforation, of wound care, phlebotomy, and plague-like conditions.
In the first chapter we have spoken of all maladies in which it is fitting to use cautery with fire or burning medicine, and their occasions and causes, and the instruments needed for this, including the forms of the cauteries; and I have arranged the chapters according to the parts of the body from the head down to the feet.
And I will proceed in this chapter in the same manner, so that the seeker may be comforted in what they have asked for.
And before I begin, son, it is important that you understand that this chapter is about the same thing as in the first chapter on cautery.
And because it is necessary to be very careful in this, for the operation which is frequently performed in this chapter, namely evacuation with blood, in which life resides, you must avoid splashing of the vein or cutting on an abscess, or opening a fistula, or cleaning a wound, or extracting an arrow, or cutting into stone, and their like. xspace And among all these [symptoms], fear and trembling are present, and in most cases, death follows.
And I advise you that nothing fall upon you in which there is doubt, for sometimes things happen to you in a way similar to many illnesses. And among them, there is some who will leave with his illness, and it will be light for him when he dies, and this because of the intensity of what he finds from his illness, and due to the length of his illness, and with the illness is fear that signifies death.
And among those, there are some who will give you their possessions and wealth; you should expect healing with them, but their illness is fatal.
Therefore, you should not consent to those who come to you with such behavior; and your caution should be greater than your desire and greed; and do not presume any reason for this unless you have certain knowledge that verifies it, and to which a praiseworthy outcome follows.
And use in the treatment of all your patients the art of prognostication and diagnosis, for in that lies your help to gain fame and memory, praise, and glory.
"O, children, may God inspire in you His understanding and never remove your direction and protection from you, for it is in His hand.
"And I have organized this chapter by dividing it into chapters following the precedent in the chapter on cauteries, concerning the care of the head to the feet, so that you may be relieved of what you ask for and of which you have need.
Chapter one.
"On the treatment of water contained in a child's head.
"Know that this illness often occurs in children due to birth and when the nurse tightly binds the child's head without leaving room.
"And sometimes it occurs for an unknown cause which is not known.
"However, I have never seen this illness except in children; and all those whom I have seen with it were killed by it, and thus it seems to me that it is left unfinished in them.
"And I have seen that a child whose head was filled with water had his head always so swollen that he could not put anything on it due to the size of his head, and moreover, the moisture caused an increase until he died.
And this moisture or fluid is accumulated between the tendon and the bone, or it is accumulated below the bone on the joint.
Because if the operation involves moisture between the tendon and bone, and the abscess is small, then you should make an incision in the middle of the head with a slit in length, and let the length of the slit be two nights long so that the moisture can drain out. This is the shape of the spatula:
And thus if the moisture is more abundant and the abscess is larger, then there are two incisions in this manner:
And if the moisture is below the bone, its sign is that you will see the fissures of the head open on all sides and the water is squeezed out when you press it with your hand from inside and nothing is hidden from you. You should make an incision in the middle of the head with three slits as follows:
And then extract all the moisture from the incision; and then strengthen the slits with cloths and compresses; and then cover it with a mixture of wine and oil for five days, and then remove the bandage and treat the wound with tenths and ointments, and strengthen the head equally; and feed the patient with dry food of little moisture until the member is comfortable and healed.
And there is another method of incision, which considers where the abscess appears and the collection of water, because sometimes it is more in the occiput, or in the frontal part, or on the right side, or on the left side; therefore, attend to the incision where the abscess and the accumulation of water appear, and do this as best you can.
And be careful not to cut the artery, lest there is a flow of blood and the patient dies from that bleeding along with the loss of fluid.
Chapter Second.
When there are cataracts or ruptures in the eyes or feet, and this is old, and you do not trust in this treatment with medicines, then the last resort in this case is the incision of these two arteries.
Therefore, it is necessary that when you want to incise those [arteries] the patient should raise their head, and then rub the area with rough cloth so that the arteries appear, and then strengthen the patient's neck with some cloth; and then consider where the vein pulses; and on both sides of each ear press down, and as long as they are not seen in some men.
Here's a line-by-line translation of the given sentence:
"And if you wish, insert the probe under the artery and break it at the points of division above.
"And let the length of the incision be two digits in extent, because when some vein is incised, the blood flows out with a pulsating flow, which jumps out frequently.
"But if the artery is not visible in the incision, then you must measure from the ear to determine the space of three digits, and then probe with a sound, and enter into the bone.
"And the amount of blood that needs to be drawn is one-sixth of a pint, and it should be let out more or less than this, and all of this depends on the strength of the patient and the fullness of his veins.
"And then consider the wound, and therefore if there remains on the bone any cause of infection, then incise it to prevent a hot abscess from forming.
"And then strengthen the wound with compresses and bandages of fine linen cloth, and then cure it with ointments until it is healed.
"Chapter III.
"About the removal of arteries that are in the temples.
When someone suffers from an ancient or sudden acute migraine due to humid bitterness and coldness in the temples, or if an old severe headache similar to these occurs, and it is not cured by the usual methods of medical treatment, then we resort to extracting venom from the temples or cauterizing them, as we have shown.
And the method of operation and extraction is that the patient shaves the hair on their temples; and recognize the apparent venom in the temple, for it is shown to you by its pulse, and it is hidden except in a few people by great coldness.
And if it is hidden, then let the patient's neck be stretched with some cloth; and then cool the area with a rough cloth or evaporate the area with hot water until the venom appears clearly to you. And then you take the spatula, the form of which is this: And then you scrape the vein with it easily until you reach the venom; and then put ointment on it and extract it in sections until you have extracted it from the vein and uncovered it from the tunics that surround it, completely.
Here's a line-by-line translation of the provided sentence:
And immediately, evacuate blood from one to three times.
And if the wound is large, then you should bind it in two places with a double-thick strap of cloth or with ropes, and do not allow it to become infected before the wound heals, and prevent blood flow.
And immediately, cut the excess skin that is between the two ligaments; do this at that time or as soon as possible.
And if you wish, cauterize it with a cautery to the bone, using a lancet until its edges are incised, and it will serve the same purpose as this procedure.
And it is a better procedure if the patient has a fever or is suffering from an inflammatory condition; because cauterization is one of those causes that help to eliminate humors, and therefore it is better for healing.
And it is necessary to immediately clean the wounds, filling them with cotton wool that has been properly prepared, and then cure them with dry medications that make the flesh grow, and bandages until they are healed.
And if while you are working, you notice another flow of blood from the wound, then you should take measures to stop the bleeding, either by cauterization or by filling the wound with cotton wool and applying pressure until the bleeding stops. And if none of these causes are present, then press your finger on the wound until the blood clots, and rinse the wound with very cold water until it loses its sharpness, and bind it as needed.
And the lighter way to extract an arrow is for you to cauterize the vein with this pointed instrument, which has two blades. After you have tested both locations with a probe and positioned each one very close to the bone until they reach the bone and split the vein in two places, so that what is between its ends can be extended, because it is not completely solidified by this cautery.
And this is the shape of the cautery:
And let the sharpness of the two blades be the same. However, if the sharpness of two blades is less effective, because if they are as sharp as two blades, it is close to each cut and does not cut the flesh quickly enough.
Therefore, with those having some thickness, heat from the fire is held within them and the flesh is cut lightly.
And this method is better in all ways and easier.
And let the space between the two blades be the width of a finger.
Chapter Four
Of the care for bodies with sharp and acidic tears of the eyes.
When the tears are acidic, and it is those veins that are on the head outside of the body, do not intervene in this matter with any cause for medical treatment. Sometimes the patient's face becomes red, and they feel as if there were ants crawling on their forehead, and the eyes become weakened to the point that their lashes are bent, and the eyelids are cut by the sharpness of the tears, the ancient doctors used this operation in the care of such cases, and they named this treatment with a blade.
And you must order the patient to shave the hairs that are on their forehead, and then cut three equally spaced incisions into the forehead according to the length of the forehead. And if the length of the incision is two fingers: let one incision be equally distant from the length of the nose in the middle of the forehead, and the second according to the length a little below the movement of the eyelids that are on the tear duct, and the third on the other side.
And beware of the beginning of the eyebrows that are on both sides, and extend your hand from the continuation of both jaws. And if the space of each incision is adjusted to be the size of three thumbs.
And if you have a sponge prepared or very dry cloth, use it to absorb the blood.
Then introduce the spatula with two pointed ends into the incision, this is how its shape should be. which starts from the temples and goes to the second incision. Peel off the entire membrane that is between the two incisions and lies on the bone, then do this from the middle of the first incision to the second incision. Then insert this spatula into the first incision again and then introduce another instrument called a lancet, which is sharp on one end and not sharp on the other.
Place the sharp edge of this lancet next to the membrane and against the bone, and insert it until it reaches the middle fissure, and use it to cut all the vessels that descend from the head to the heels.
But let the incision continue until it reaches the edge of the membrane, and then do this in the middle fissure until the other fissure.
And since a quantity of blood has flowed out, squeeze the places of the cold blood clots.
And then place in each opening a piece of old cloth, and place over those powders mixed with wine and oil and vinegar, and ensure that an abscess does not form.
And on the third day, remove the bandage and administer a large infusion of hot water or tea, and then care for it with a basilicum ointment mixed with rose oil and others until the wounds are healed.
Chapter 5
About the care of tears through catharsis and the ulcers that descend from the inner parts of the head.
When someone has acute and continuous catharsis, and sometimes the ulcers of the patient are exhausted and small, and their complexion is weakened, and the eyelids are ulcerated and from them the hairs fall out, and there is sharp pain in the forehead of the head and consequent wasting away, then know through these accidents that the matter and catharsis come only from the smaller veins of the inner parts.
And the best treatment for them is this: that you order the patient to shave their forehead, and then make an incision in it at its midpoint (and begin with the left temple and continue to the right temple; and let the incision go as far as the bone; and keep your hand away from the temples' sutures which are close to chewing), until the bone is exposed.
"Dry all the blood with a sponge or a dry cloth, and then fill the space between the two lips of the wound with old cotton or cloth. "Then press down on it with powder mixed in wine and oil to prevent it from becoming a pustule.
"And when you remove that and see that the pustule has diminished, then it is necessary to scrape the bone until new flesh begins to grow on it. Then treat it with a drying remedy that will make the flesh grow, such as if you take two parts of wheat flour and four parts of colophony and mix them together, and from them make a plaster and apply it to these wounds for the growth of new flesh.
"Chapter VI.
"On the treatment of what is caught in the ears.
"Everything that gets caught in the ears is one of four kinds: either it is a mineral stone or something similar to a stone, such as iron and glass, or it is a plant material like a seed or bean, or it is a fluid substance like water or vinegar and their likenesses, or some creature.
It seems like the text is describing a remedy for an earache or similar issue where something has gotten stuck in the ear. Let's break it down line by line: And then place around the circumference of the ear some weights made of cloth or wool, and extend the ear to the sides above, because with this method it is effectively treated with these causes.
And if it is not treated, then administer an extraction of the patient using the tool called "subtle ephemeris" (a type of thin blade or probe), whose form is as follows:
And if it was effectively treated with the instrument, then it is good; and if not, then administer an extraction of the patient using a thin lancet with little double-edging.
And therefore, if it is not effectively treated by this method, then make a small pipe of iron and insert the tip of the pipe into the ear canal and seal the area around the pipe with wax and softened oil so that only the pipe remains open. Then extract it with your own breath using strong suction, because with this method we have often achieved success.
But if it is not effectively treated in this manner, then take a well-lit or old lamp wick with which birds are caught, and place that on the tip of the ear, and then wrap around it a cleanly placed bandage. And then gently insert it into the ear canal, and then remove any moisture from the ear.
And therefore, if it is not cured with all the causes we have mentioned, then you should cut it before it becomes an abscess or spasm.
And the way to cut it is that you first bleed the patient from the saphenous vein according to his strength, and then make an incision between your fingers and turn the ear towards the divided parts above, and with a small slit in the skin of the ear, insert the grease in the most compressed part of it. And let the incision be crescent-shaped until it reaches the stone, and once the stone is found, remove it if you can with appropriate instruments; then immediately close the incision at that time, and care for it until it heals.
And if the cause of the condition in the ear is one of the fats that grows and swells, then administer the cure and removal of it; but if it does not comply with your request, then take a subtle spatula according to this form: And administer with that person the excision of that tumor which has grown in the ear.
And do not do this when you think that it has already been moistened by the vapor of the ear, and place it in some light weights, then extract those with tweezers or a fine instrument, or with incision as we have said, because its removal is facilitated.
But in the case of water that has entered the ear, it is necessary for the patient to sneeze at the beginning, and fill their ear with some old cloth, and pour water over the ear in which there is water, and if by this it is expelled, good; and if not, then take heated stones according to the length of the finger, and heat them a little in the fire, and the patient should insert one of these into the hole of their ear and jump on one foot from that side and strike with another stone over the stone which is inside the ear. Therefore, do not stop this with a stone until all the water has been expelled.
Therefore, do not stop this with a stone until all the water has been expelled. And when the water has been expelled, then take some paper or cotton, and put one end of it into the ear and extend the other end with fire until most of it is burnt off.
And then insert another sponge and do this as many times until all the water is expelled, and draw out that [water] with a cannula in the same way as mentioned above for the expelling stone.
But in the removal of a beast that enters that earhole, if it is a small body or similar, treat it as we have said in the division; but if it is of a large body which affects the sense of hearing, then administer its removal with gestures and onions, and its cause will be lighter than all the other causes that fall into the ear.
But in the removal of a worm generated in the ear, when you treat it with the water we have mentioned in the division and in the treatise on distillations, and your treatment does not succeed, then you must look at the ear towards the sun.
And therefore if there appears here any cause of the worms, then extract that with gestures or with fine onions; but if no cause appears, then take a canula which is narrow at one end and wide at the other, such as this is its form: And insert the narrow end into the ear according to the amount that the patient can tolerate; and then suck with it strongly, and do this many times until all the worms are expelled.
Here's a line-by-line translation of the given text:
"And use this tool with which you pour medicinal oils into the ear, and this is its shape: "Make it of silver or brass, narrow and with a small hole, and flat on top.
"And therefore let it be as needed to fit into the cavity of the ear canal, where it will be necessary to insert it. "And if you wish, take a reed and wrap it nicely at the end with cotton, then pour oil into the cavity of the ear opening, or juice from some herb, or water from these medicines in the ear canal — which is inside the ear —, then insert the reed with the cotton on top and squeeze gently with your hand so that the oil is expelled into the cavity of the ear and the patient feels the oil inside.
"And what is to be inserted into the ear should first be heated slightly with fire. "And take care that what you pour into the ear is not too cold, because the medicines for the ear cannot tolerate this.
"Chapter VII.
"On the treatment of earwax in ears.
Sure, let's translate the sentence line by line:
And that which occurs in his abdomen, which does not affect his vision, is among the most difficult conditions to heal.
And in that which affects the vision, you should place the ear of the patient towards the sun and observe it. And therefore, if you see an apparent swelling, open it with a subtle spatula of this form:
If the affected part is small and one end is sharp while the other is not; and if the spatula is two fingers wide, it will not damage the ear.
And therefore, if the swelling is due to flesh born in the ear or in its meat, then take it with fine scissors and cut it vigorously until all the flesh is removed.
And if the swelling is in the ear canal, then take a thin reed and warm it slightly with fire, and then insert it into the ear canal.
And therefore, if you perceive the swelling with water that the patient finds with ease, due to the heaviness of hearing, relieve his pressure gently; and be careful not to damage the nerves of the ear.
This is a fascinating text to translate! Let's break it down line by line:
If blood flows out, then submerge a sponge or cloth in cold water and place it on the ear, and use another treatment that constricts the flow of blood, which is mentioned in the treatise on distillation.
Chapter 8.
About the care for cataracts that affect the eyelids.
Cataracts that sometimes affect the eyelids of the eyes are sometimes wet and other times dry.
Therefore, you must have these with tweezers or a needle, and carefully cut them from their root with scissors, and then place them on the spots as instructed.
But if pain comes with a flow of blood, then you should cauterize these with a fine needle-shaped cautery.
And the best cauterization is near the incisions and it often returns when there remains any cause of its roots; and when they are cauterized with fire, those roots are burned and do not return.
Chapter 9.
Treatment of growths that appear on the eyelids of the eyes.
Often, something appears on the eyelids of the eyes due to some cause that resembles growth in its strength and hardness, and for this reason it is called growth.
"And it is an accumulation of thick fluid in the eyelids, below and above.
"Therefore, the operation on them is that you consider if the swelling is progressing in him and comes out from the eyelid, spreading to all parts; and the cause of it is light.
"Therefore, make an incision over it with a lancet along its length, and then explore it thoroughly from all sides until you evacuate it, and then suspend it with a thread and cut it off.
"And if the swelling is large, then you adjust it with a stitch; and care for it until it is healed.
"And if it is small, you will not have difficulty with it because the salve of it restores that [swelling] and heals it.
"And if the swelling is extending to the inside parts of the eyelid, you should explore the inner surface, then evacuate the eyelid and suspend the swelling with a thread, another one for the incision, and press on it from all sides; and if the eyelid is lengthened by the incision, this will not be noticeable in any way.
And at the beginning, wash the wound with salt water; and clean the area with water that contains herbs until it is healed.
Chapter 10
About caring for a wound on the eyelid above the eye.
A wound is something that occurs in the tissues of the upper eyelid, and it is most common in children. It severely affects their eyes and leads to excessive tearing, which prevents them from looking at the light of the sun.
Therefore, you see these children squinting all the time, and they even sleep like this. Their eyebrows are always moist, as if covered in inflammation, and there is a slight appearance of a wound on their eyes; and when you press the area with your fingers, you feel the presence of a wound.
And there is some way of operating where the patient places their head on your chest, and then you place a cloth over them and make a circle around it according to the size that contains all the inflammation, and then you place it over the wound and press with your fingers all around so that the wound is brought together in the middle of the circle, and then open the middle of that area with a lancet, making an incision along its length, and the incision should not be larger than the one made in phlebotomy.
Certainly! Let's translate the given sentence step by step:
Therefore, extract it with cloths that you have wrapped around the designated parts outside and turn between your right and left hand until it is removed.
And be careful not to push into the crack, so that with the spatula you do not reach the nostril and cause it to bleed.
But if it does not appear to you at the beginning of the crack, then insert a little in the crack with ease until it reaches there; and then extract it as we have said; and then submerge cloths in water and vinegar and place them on the area and press them firmly with poles.
And some people cut salt and place it in the cavity of the crack, so that whatever remains of that moisture.
Then care for it until it is healed.
But if an abscess forms in the area, then treat it with cold poultices until it is healed.
Chapter 11.
On ways of touching the nose.
When in the eyelids of the nose there are hairs that have grown beneath the natural hairs and have become old, then those hairs harm the nose and cause various ailments such as constant tears and softening of the eyelids, and this leads to destruction of the nose, which is called touching of the nose. And it is cured in four ways: either by cautery with fire; or with sharp medicine, as mentioned earlier in the chapter on cautery; or a touching is done by incision and suture; or by cannulas, as I will say.
Based on the similarities to Latin, Italian, Spanish, and French, I'll provide a line-by-line translation of the text:
Let's translate this line by line:
Certainly! Let's translate the provided text line by line:
"And then proceed with the spatula along the two lines that you have marked, beginning from the larger tear duct and going into the smaller one. "And if your wound is near the natural hair follicles, it will be as thick as a king's.
"Then place the scissors in one of the two corners of the anus, and then cut that entire area, and then bring together with stitching both lips with wax or a fine wool thread, and cleanse the blood, and make stick whatever excesses from the threads onto two eyebrows with some adhesive substances, if you want to do this, otherwise do not care.
"Then leave the stitches of the threads for three or four days, and then heal it.
"And if you wish, leave the wound without stitches and heal it with something that dries and constricts, for the eyelid is raised because of the healing of the wound and its adhesion; but stitching is better. Therefore, this is what the ancient physicians said about treating wounds.
"But nevertheless, be attentive to the patient, and it is a good procedure, and there is no fear.
Sure, let's attempt to translate the given text. Here's my interpretation:
If this is not possible, hold the eyelids, and if they are not equal, then take a needle with thread and insert it in the middle of the eyelid, and introduce another thread near the larger lacrimal duct, and another near the smaller lacrimal duct, and adjust these threads to equality, and then use them to lift your hand with an equal elevation, lift the entire cord above which is marked as we have recommended.
Then adjust the two lips of the wound with stitches and care for it until it heals.
But if an abscess occurs due to your incision or fistula, cauterize the abscess with caustic and similar substances, and apply ointments.
And sometimes it happens to the eyelid that its hairs change, then you should use what we have said about incision for this; but stitching each one is more skillful.
To set a dislocation with reeds is done as follows: and it is that you turn the eyelid and cut the figure inside, as I have described; and then by skill make two reeds or two fine slats, the length of which should be according to the length of the eyelid, and the width less than the width of a fingertip. Based on the pattern of the text provided, here's a translation attempt for the given sentence:
Here's a line-by-line translation of the given text:
If it is delayed, then break the fast with the toriyas, and immediately treat the wound until it is healed.
So when it is healed, the eyelid is lifted and the hairs do not sting.
And this is the way to make two rods according to this form: and let there be the exact amount of length and width, neither more nor less.
Chapter .12
Of raising stinging hairs in the eye with a needle when the hair is hard.
When the hairs are unnatural, hard, rough and stinging in the eyes, the procedure for them is that you take a fine needle and place it on a thread of fine linen silk, and then you adjust the ends of it and attach each one in a very subtle manner. And let the length of the threads be about the size of a palm.
And you compose another fine thread below it briefly, and knot the ends of that one if you want to.
And you have the patient sit in your lap, and let it be close to the light so that your work may be clearly seen, because it is a delicate and precise operation.
And quickly insert the needle into the vein that needs treatment, and make it penetrate the eyelid swiftly until you extract it from above the natural skin.
And then pull the hair over and insert that into the vein, and let there be hairs one, two, or three, but not more.
And then pull your hand with it into the vein until the hair is brought out from below the eyelid with the natural skin.
But if the vein is drawn and the hair is not pulled out, draw the vein to the parts below with the thread you have composed with it, until it is pulled out from above the hole.
And see that with the sight of the eye, because when you draw out the vein and the thread, and close each one and shut the eyes, and leave the stitches for two days or three, until the hair adheres to its place and good flesh grows over it.
And if the hair is too short, then you take a long hair from the natural ones, and raise it with that, or leave it until it has lengthened somewhat, and then raise it.
Capítulo XIII.
On the treatment of cataracts that appear on the eyelid.
When the eyelid has cataracts and there is contraction of the eyelid when it is contracted on one side or the other, due to improper healing of wounds, incisions, or burns, and it is called leprosy, this type of cataract can be either natural or accidental, and is caused by improper healing of wounds, incisions, or burns, or by resemblance to their ailments.
The manner of the operation is to split that adhesion and separate its lips, and place between them a piece of linen cloth, and bind them together until they are healed.
And it is not necessary to use any treatment for the causes that dry and constrain, because if you do this, cataracts will return worse than ever before.
Use treatments that soften, such as fenugreek, and soak it in water with lentils and linseed, or apply a liquid ointment of dyaquilon with some oil, and soak the cloth in it, and treat with it.
And the treasure of your care is that you should pierce with all skill whatever is not solid according to the form that was at the beginning.
And this operation which we have called is nothing more than a rectification of the helix which does not return to its original form as before.
Chapter XIV
Of the treatment of ehacrati, which is done on the lower eyelid.
This ehacrati which is done on the lower eyelid, which is truly called ehacrati; it can be either natural or accidental in nature.
However, the accidental type is caused by a blow, cut, or cautery, or other similar things.
And the way to perform this operation is as follows: take a needle with double thread and insert it into the flesh, passing it from the left tear duct to the right tear duct until the thread reaches both ends of the flesh.
Then extend the flesh on both sides with the needle and sew it with the needle, and cut wide with a spatula. And thus if the figure of the eyelid returns to its proper shape, that is good; but if not, take the reed and place it on the split figure, and with this turn the eyelid until both slits are in the bottom of the lower eyelid.
And let the extremities of both cuts be from two angles at the incision, which you have made to meet, and let there be an angle made between them so that when they come together, a figure is formed by them.
And this figure is Greek letter lambda (Λ).
Then cut the flesh by the amount that is the length of the sharp object beneath it, so that it becomes the eyelid.
Then adjust the separated parts and suture them with woolen thread; then treat them with one of the softening medicines and bandages until it heals.
And if the eyelid needs to be raised due to a cut, suture or cautery, then you should make a flat cut along the lashes of the eyelid as previously described. Then separate [the edges] with the bandage between the two lips as we have said.
In the end of the treatise on raising the eyelid when it is above or below, let the operation be performed according to the prepared form of the eyelid, and that is in various ways.
And wise artisans always prepare various instruments in every possible way to restore the figure to its natural form, or close to it, according to what is suitable for the patient in terms of the operation and tools in the best condition. ︎
It appears that "Capitol .xv." refers to Chapter 15. This indicates that the text is divided into sections or chapters, with this one being the fifteenth chapter. In medieval texts, such divisions were common to organize information systematically.
"De la adherencia de la palpebra am la conjunctiva o am la cornea." This sentence translates to:
When this consolidation occurs in many men such that the eyelid is solidified more above with the eye's white part, and it is inhibited from the ease of movement and its natural works, then you must introduce the tip of a ray underneath the eyelid, and lift it up with that, or extend it with ointment.
And then you should cut the adhesion with a fine spatula, which should not be sharp like incisions, but rather blunt a little so that the patient is not disturbed by the operation. Leave the spatula in place so that it does not injure the eye with its sharpness.
And let your incision be such that it gently scrapes away that adhesion with ease until the eyelid is returned to its natural shape and all of the adhesion is healed.
And then you should put salt water in the eye with which you wash it; or instill in it a solution of alum dissolved in water.
And then separate the eyelid from the eye with a cloth of them, and place over the eye wool soaked in egg white ointment, and on the third day use bandages to bind until it is healed.
**Capítulo XVI.**
Sobre la inflamación del dedo y el crecimiento de carne en los lagrimales.
Debes saber que el dedo puede ser de dos maneras, ya sea nervioso, similar a un ciprés delgado y duro; o no nervioso, similar a una humedad blanca congelada. Cuando se toca la herida, es necesario cortarlo y no colocar una aguja en él.
Y ambas especies no comienzan hasta el lagrimar mayor, entrando gradualmente hasta cubrir la visión y bloquear la luz y el movimiento del ojo.
Sin embargo, el procedimiento para tratar la inflamación es que el paciente incline su cabeza hacia atrás y abra los ojos, luego levante el párpado con tu mano, después recoja la uña con una aguja de doble filo y extiéndala en las partes anteriores. heit Luego toma una aguja y coloca en ella un pelo de caballo o de buey, o de vaca, o similar, o un hilo fuerte, o dobla el extremo de la aguja poco a poco y colócalo en el medio de la uña. Luego penetra con la aguja y ata la uña con un hilo; luego extiende la uña hacia las partes anteriores y retira el pelo del lado de la uña, que es la pupila. And thus you follow that with the penis into the back of him/her.
And thus you cut out the remaining tissue in the duct of the tear with a fine spatula or small scissors, and remove the skin of the natural tear duct so that continuous tearing does not occur due to that cut.
And sometimes the nail with the solitary onychia or filiform, as we said, and then it should be excised with a sharp spoon, of which this is the shape of it.
And be careful that with the spoon you do not touch the corneal tissue and cause a rupture, and that the pupil is not perforated.
Then place a little salt or powdered cinnamon in the eye after the cut, and leave it there until the next day; then wash it with water until it is healed.
And if the nail is not painful and you cannot insert the needle, or it is fixed in that onychia, then many times this type of nail is cured with medicine and healed as I have written and recommended in the division.
And if you want to cut it, then open the eye of the patient and take a fine spoon with sharp edges according to this form: "Am subtilitat" translates to "With subtlety." This phrase indicates that the following action or procedure should be performed with delicacy or finesse. "And if you see that it is rarefied and confined in that area, then distill from your mouth into the affected ear using cinnamon oil or warm rose oil, or salt water, and cover the ear until the next day.
"Then continue with the operation until everything has been removed from there, unless a contrary pus cyst forms in the ear, for then you should leave it alone and treat the initial infection until it heals.
"Then continue your operation on that area with reason until it is healed.
"The prominence of the tear-producing gland, if you notice it in the ear due to great harm, suspend it with a hook; and incise that from one part, but do not finish the incision so that tears do not flow out.
"Then distill warm rose oil and cinnamon oil into it until it is healed.
"Chapter XVII
"On the incision of a polyp and on that which is born from attached flesh in the ear.
"Sometimes in the ears of some people, red flesh grows and covers the pupil, or it approaches or presses on the eyelids, and strongly compresses the eyelids to the outer parts, and it resembles a row of pillars.
Sure, let's break down the text and translate it line by line:
And use your scalpel with which you cut those or with spatula that we have recommended in the section on nails, or with small forceps with which you collect wax according to what will come next in this chapter.
Therefore, once your incision is complete and all that flesh is removed, then fill the wound with powdered salt or with powder resembling corrosive medicines, and place over the wound outside a patch with egg white until it is safe from pus.
And if there remains any sign of infection and the blood is cautious, and you fear pus, then leave the wound open and treat that pus with water that will soften that pus, and then perform the operation again on it until it heals, and do likewise in the flesh near the wound of this kind.
But you must ensure that all care of the fresh wound is done naturally or accidentally, by using iron, and do not put your hand in any of these operations until you see that the member can withstand this operation.
Chapter XVIII
Of collecting pus from the wound.
Certainly! Let's break down the text and translate it line by line:
Therefore, it is necessary at the beginning to consider whether the wound in which pus is present is strong and there are no other ailments besides pus. If so, then collect that pus.
And it is necessary that you command the patient to place his head in your lap, and then suspend those veins with a thread or two, according to your judgment; and let that thread be of fine double threading, following this method:
Or use two threads gradually inserted into one body, following this method:
And then those veins should be collected with fine forces, gently, and you should wipe away the blood little by little until you see that the veins are removed from the wound and they have turned.
And be careful not to touch the wound with the extremities of the spatula; and if your operation is at midday in front of the sun, and be very firm in your operation so that you do not cut anything but those veins.
And when you have completed [the operation], then pour on the wound strong vinegar or rosewater so that with its sharpness, it can dissolve what has been removed from the pus.
But if it is not possible for you to collect all [the pus] at that time, then bandage the entire area with something that alleviates his pain, and leave it for several days until his pain has subsided and he is secure from forming a new abscess.
"Then proceed with the same method until the patient is healed.
And this is the way of the forceps:
Chapter XIX
Of reduction of hernias in the nose.
When you cure hernias with a cautery or sharp medicine according to the preceding account and it is not healed, then do not enter into it but rather make incisions on the abscess until it is matured, and extract all the moisture that is within it, the pus, until the bone is uncovered.
And when the bone is exposed and you see corruption or blackness in it, then scrape it with an instrument of this shape:
It is named "sharp head," and it must be made of iron, with a round head like this, which should be pointed by filing or finely chiseled points (as in the following figure).
And place that [instrument] on the corrupt area of the bone, and then turn it between your fingers, and press with your hand little by little until you know that the corruption is scraped away.
And this should be done several times, and then restore the area with desiccating and styptic substances.
Therefore, if the wound has healed and good flesh has grown in it, and the body is free from infection for forty days, with no recurrence or abscess formation, then you should know that it is healed.
And otherwise, the only thing to do is to reduce the cleft to the shape of the nose, and in this manner: you should expose the bone using iron or sharp medicine. Once the bone is exposed, take a trefoil in this form:
Let the tip of the iron be triangular, and the shaft of it be first narrowed into the extremity as you see here.
Then place that [trefoil] on the bone, and it should be close to the lacrimal; and extend your hand a little from the eye, and then turn your hand with the trefoil into it until it penetrates all of the bone, and let the patient feel this so that breath may exit when you hold his hand.
Therefore, at that point, restore the place with astringent medicines, as you have been taught.
Therefore, when the flesh has grown back and the place has hardened, then the matter which had flowed out to the parts outside returns to the nose, so that this is lighter on the patient.
**Translation:** Chapter 20
**Translation:** Of the reduction of the swelling of the belly.
**Translation:** When the belly swells in its entirety and no harm or diminishing occurs during the treatment, then you should let the patient fast, and then follow them, and then place fumigations on the neck without scarification and give a good drink; and then place over the belly a liniment which is made of acatra, aloe, henna, and sarsaparilla, and then strengthen the plaster on the belly with many powders.
**Translation:** And the manner of the powders is that you take many cloths of linen, and each cloth should be folded into four layers; and make many [of them].
**Translation:** And then place those one on top of the other according to the amount that the belly needs. **Translation:** And then strengthen them with a hard cloth tightly bound; and repeat the fumigations with suction without scarification; and then remove the fumigators and leave the belly bound day and night.
**Translation:** But if during this time the bandage becomes softened, then it must be very tight.
**Translation:** And then remove the bandage at night and in the morning as we have said.
And if you see that the wound has already been reduced, it is good; and if not, then repeat the application of the plaster with powder, stricture, and cupping until it is healed.
Chapter .21.
Of the incision of the front surface of the uveal tract.
When there is a rupture in the uveal tract, and it protrudes outward like a grain of raspberry and takes on the appearance of a man's face, if you want to incise this, the operation is as we have described: insert the needle into the root of the uvea from below upward, then insert another needle that has double thread from the lacrimal side, and make it penetrate and leave the first needle according to its position; then incise the place of the double thread and lift with it the part of the uvea in the circle of the needle, and strengthen it firmly.
Then remove the needle and place wool soaked in egg white on the wound, leaving it until the thread falls off with the uvea.
Then care for the wound with water that comforts it until the injury is healed.
And sometimes with a circle of cloth around the entire part, it is placed very tightly, and then it is perforated with a subtle spatula that reaches the bottom of the eye, allowing the humidity to flow out through the eyeball, and thus the eye descends and enters immediately.
And then strengthen so that it may be healed.
Chapter 22.
On the cure of alconati (possibly referring to a specific medical condition or injury).
This sickness which is called "alconati" is nothing but a sanie (humoral discharge) that has been lodged in the eye like descending water, and it is not that.
But the way to proceed with it is for you to make the patient sit on a prepared and straight saddle, then take his head in both your hands from two sides, so that you can see the sanie (humoral discharge) coming towards the lower parts, and then let it dry up and not descend, and obstruct the light, and let the patient see the causes as he sees them.
And if it does not descend downwards, know that it is water.
But if the descent of the sanie is not prepared with water as we have said, then make the patient sit between your hands and take a subtle spatula and pierce with it under the skin near the continuation of the conjunctiva with the cornea in the corner (in the place where you want), until the sanie has been expelled.
When it is forgotten (forgotten), then you distill into the nostril hot water in which you have mixed honey or water in which you have previously boiled fenugreek and honey.
Then it should be treated with other methods until it is cured.
Chapter 22.
Of the treatment of water coming out of the nostril.
We have already mentioned the types of water in the division and which ones are suitable for piercing with a needle, according to health.
Then you should make the patient sit between your hands on a chair and tie their nose tightly.
And then place your left hand near the upper eyelid of their nose, if the water is in the left nostril; or with your right hand, if it is the right nostril.
And then with your right hand take a spoonful of honey if the nostril is the left one; or with your left hand, if it is the right one.
Then place the end of the spoon near the corner of the eye closest to the inner corner of the nostril on the side where the water is coming out, and then peel off the honey with skill and roll your hand with it.
"And then penetrate into the patient's stomach and feel that the wound has already been healed due to your treatment.
"And it should be the size of the path from the wound to the lung, which is the same as the distance from the pupil to the edge of the black part, and that is the crown of the eye; for you will see with that pupil the vision of the eye through the clarity of the cornea.
"Then press the wound into the place where there is water, and then you throw it down once or twice, and if the water comes out immediately, then you can see that the patient's vision will return quickly, and the wound in their eye.
"And then wait for a moment; if the water has come out, then you should press again before the wound is closed.
"And thus, when it is dry and does not come out, then you can easily remove the wound, and roll it with your hand a little at a time, and then dissolve a small amount of clear salt from a gem in water and wash the inside of the eye with it; and then place outside the eye a piece of cloth or wool soaked in rose oil and egg white, and bind the eye closed with water.
"But we and those of our time place (or apply) on that affliction a poultice made with egg white.
And if you do not obey your nurse during the treatment of the eye due to its hardness — for it is one of those people whose eyes are very hard —, then you must take the spatula which is called an "alberid," and this is its shape:
And therefore pierce with that, through that opening, and do not push your hand into the hole; this is so you can create a delicate path for the nurse.
And then the nurse will insert it as we have said.
And you should complete the task of your work by preparing a well-ventilated bedroom in which the patient sleeps on their back in a darkened room, and all movement is forbidden.
And place on his nature that which makes his nature even; do not move his head to the right or left at all.
And let the bandage be changed according to its condition every third day.
And then uncover him in that darkened room and expose his eye to the cold light; make him look at some objects, and then cover it again after seven days.
And you should not do this during the time of treatment or immediately before an infusion. Based on the context and similarities with Romance languages, here's a line-by-line translation of the given sentence:
"But if an abscess occurs, it is necessary that you open the wound before the seventh day, and treat it with a remedy that can reduce the swelling.
"At that time, you should cover the patient's face with a cloth and place it over their mouth to control their breathing for several days, keeping them in the darkest room.
"Then gradually remove him from that dark room and return him to his usual activities.
"And know that in surgery, the student is not excused from some observations, so be prepared for the operation.
"And it has reached us that one of those who are in the Artach region did something, and some say that he made fire in the Ayrac district by piercing with a needle through which water is drawn.
"But nevertheless, I have not seen anyone in our land who has mastered this, nor is it written in any of the ancient books; and it is possible that this is something new.
"And these are the forms of needle types for which one should be aware who does not know them:
"And they are made of iron or pure steel, and their tips are pointed with this triangular delicacy, the point being sharp as in this form.
Capitol XXIV.
Of the treatment for flesh eaten away in the nose.
When in the nose diverse fleshy growths appear, which have some resemblance to the sting of a scorpion or to polyps; and this illness is called polyps because it resembles that particular fish. And if the flesh is cancerous, scaly, and of a dark color; but if it is lion's flesh, it is not of a dark color.
Therefore, for that which is in these lion's flesh, neither fraudulent nor cancerous, it is necessary to make the patient sit between your hands and place them in the sun, and open the nostrils of him, and prick with your finger in those fleshes. Then extract that which has spread to the outer parts, and then cut with a sharp, fine spatula from one part into another until you know that all the flesh is removed; for if any cause remains by which removal is possible, then you should scrape it with one of the fine instruments with ease until no cause remains. But if it bleeds or develops an abscess, then you should do what is necessary; whether it is one of the malignant abscesses, then you cauterize and cauterize it until blood is drawn and all the cavities are removed.
And then place your hand over the patient's nose near the nostrils and apply grease or oil. But if the nose is open and moisture proceeds from it into the throat, then know that it has already healed.
But if the moisture does not penetrate as it should, then know that inside there is flesh rotting in the upper parts of the nose bones, which has not been properly drained.
Therefore, it is necessary to introduce fat into the wound, and put compresses on it, placing between each compress the size of the said finger or hand, and bandage the patient and insert one end of the fat into the nose with a reed or another suitable instrument.
And after doing this, let the patient's own scent enter until it reaches the nostril channels, and let it settle on its own. For many times children in schools do something similar to this action, and it is an easy thing for one who wants to do it.
Then place the two ends of the fat, one end protruding from the nose and the other remaining inside the nose, and then apply a flesh clamp with the compresses that are on the fat, and do this until you know that the flesh is tightly secured with the compresses of the fat.
And then extract the bile, and place in the nose near the blood vessel a clove, and do this for three days or more until the ointment has completely dissolved all that is softened from the flesh.
And then at the end of the treatment, place in the nose a lead tube for several days until it is healed.
However, if you choose to pursue a different course of treatment, use this one instead.
And here is the form of the instrument for a nasal purger with which oils and medications are administered in the nose:
And make it from silver or iron, which should be like a small open lamp with a narrow opening, and the mouth similarly.
And if you wish, make a closed tube like a reed, and the tip of the nasal purger instrument should be flat and open; on the end of it there should be a handle, with which you can hold it when you pour in oil or water from the juices and suctionable causes.
Sure! Please provide the specific text from "Capitol .xxv." that you would like me to translate line by line into English.
Certainly! Here is the translation for the first line:
"Many times it is noted in the outer parts of the nose, and it is magnified and mentioned in some days, until one day it becomes a concern.
"Therefore, you should note down the beginning of its appearance and record everything. "Then place a cautery or burning medicine over the area where it was located.
"But if the recording is delayed until it becomes severe, then consider whether it has become hardened, firm, dark in color, and with little sensation. In that case, do not touch it with iron, for it is a malignant abscess; many times, those who record this abscess suffer great harm from it.
"And if the abscess is soft to the touch and not dark in color, and if recording it is possible in all ways, then evacuate the patient and record it without fear, and treat the area with something that dries and tightens until it is healed.
"Chapter XXVI
"On the Suture of the Nose and Lips, and the Ear When Continuity is Disrupted by Wound or Similar Injury
"Know that when there is a loss of continuity in any of these cartilages, you should pay little attention to this operation except in some cases.
Here's the translation for your new sentence:
And if the lips of the wound have already been separated and each one is healthy, then you should scrape off each divided part of its cord until blood comes out. Then bring the two lips together with a stitch and strengthen them, and sprinkle on them powdered dragon's blood and trissat, and place on that powder a thin layer of plaster, or any other of the consolidating plasters, and leave it in place for two days or three. Then remove it and replace the plaster, leaving it until the threads have dissolved by themselves, and then treat with ointment until it is healed.
But the manner of the stitch is that you bring together the separation of continuity either with needles as we have mentioned in the stitching of the belly, or bring together the separation of continuity with thread as has been taught to you.
Chapter XXVII.
On removing the causes that come between the two lips in the divided parts inside.
Many times it happens to many men in the divided parts inside their lips some hard lumps similar to goose fat, and some of them are smaller and some are larger.
The text appears to be discussing the treatment of some sort of hardened or thickened areas, possibly skin lesions or wounds. Here's a line-by-line translation:
Certainly! Please provide the next line or lines from the text you would like translated.
Here's the translation for that line:
Based on the pattern you've provided and my understanding of similar languages, here's a line-by-line translation:
And then place over the wound sage or other hemostatic or astringent powders.
And if that flesh returns, then incise it secondarily, and cauterize it, because the cautery will not return again.
Chapter .29.
About the reason for teeth with iron.
When on the surface of the teeth, both inside and outside the gums, sharp, jagged, blackened scraps appear, and sometimes they turn yellow or green, and the gum becomes corrupt in this way, it is clear that the teeth are loose.
Therefore, it is necessary that you make the patient sit between your hands and place their head on your lap, and scrape the teeth in which these scraps appear until no cause remains from them, and thus remove the blackness and yellowing and other things until they are cleansed.
So if this is sufficient for what was mentioned at the beginning of the reasoning, good; and if not, then you repeat the reasoning on them another day, and the second day, and the third, until it reaches the final state that you want.
And know that teeth require many different tools and various figures according to what is prepared for your operation. And because the razors with which a tooth is cut from the inside are different from those with which it is scraped between the teeth according to other shapes, and these shapes of razors must be prepared for you, which you will see shortly:
Chapter .30
Of tooth extraction.
Therefore, you should take care of the tooth in its entirety and delay its complete extraction, because there is no reason to rush its removal once it has been extracted, as it is a noble substance and an excuse for its own removal.
However, when the patient insists on having that tooth extracted, you must be firmly certain which is the painful tooth, because often the pain deceives the patient and they think it is in a healthy tooth, and you extract that one and then the pain does not cease until the diseased and painful tooth has been extracted, for we have already seen this happen through the operation of barbers.
Therefore, as you must be certain which is the painful tooth, and if you know it well, then you should scarify around the circumference of the tooth with a spatula in which there is some virtue, until it is dissolved from the gum on all sides, and then remove it with your words, or with fine forceps little by little until you have reached it.
Certainly! Here is the line-by-line translation of the provided text:
And so, if it is not forgotten, then take one of those instruments and place it under the patient in such a way that it can be easily moved as done at the beginning.
But if the tooth is loose or rotten, then it is necessary that you fill that cavity with cloth and tighten it with the end of a fine thread so that it does not break during your constriction with the forceps.
And it is necessary that you act very carefully with scarification all around the entire edge of the gum and be careful not to break it and leave a part of it, and return to the patient for the evil that may be greater than the first pain of his.
And be careful not to do what some ignorant barbers do in their presumption and audacity regarding the removal of teeth, without administering that which we have recommended; for many times they cause great evils to afflict men, which are more difficult to treat than if they were broken, and all or some of their roots are left behind, or that you extract it along with some bones of the jaw as has happened many times.
And before removing it, wash his mouth with wine or vinegar mixed with salt.
And if blood flows due to this, as many times as it happens, then sprinkle some quantity of powder on the wound and if that does not help, cauterize.
The shape of the forceps and tongs with which the tooth is first removed should have a long handle, short shaft, and be thick, so that they are not bent when you work with them.
And the handles should be of such a thickness that they are not bent when used, and the tips should be short.
And they should be made of Indian iron, with straight tips, and at the ends of these there should be teeth, some of which fit into others and hold tightly by constriction, and sometimes the tips of these should be in the shape of a stork’s beak, which is wide, and they should have great constrictive power.
Chapter 31.
About the extraction of teeth and the removal of broken jawbones.
When you need to extract a broken tooth that remains in place, you should first apply a hot compress with a border for one or two days until the area is softened; and then insert forceps or tongs with tips resembling the beak of a bird called a stork or spoonbill.
Based on the context provided, here's a line-by-line translation of the given text:
And if the patient does not obey you with these forceps or tweezers, then you should cut into the skin and remove all the flesh, and insert the instrument called atali, which is a small lever whose form is as follows:
And its end should be slightly thick, and not pointed so that it does not slip.
Therefore, if the skin is thus opened, good. And if not, help yourself with these other instruments, whose shapes are as follows: the shape of the first instrument is that of a triangular tip in which there is some thickness:
The shape of the second instrument is to have a triangular and more delicate tip.
And already helped with this instrument, which has two blades, here is its shape below: And with other instruments which I will mention later for the scraping of teeth; because it is usually done with this instrument, which resembles a large hook, and here is its shape:
With a triangular tip that is bent or curved, which should have some thickness, and not be pointed so that it does not slip.
And know that the instruments for removing teeth are similar to the other instruments mentioned.
Here's the translation for the given sentence:
Based on the provided context and similarity to Romance languages, here's my attempt at translating the given sentence into English:
And if there is any swelling in the patient, it should be reduced little by little, and held with the mouth to prevent it from bursting or escaping until the bone has been completely set; then restore the area with suitable medicine for this purpose.
But if there is a small sore on the bone, then cut away that sore and its darkness, and care for it until it is healed.
Chapter 32.
Of the care of prominent teeth over others.
When the teeth are prominent and do not follow their natural form, causing pain, especially in women, and particularly in pious elderly women; then you should consider: if the tooth is nothing but another tooth, and it is impossible to extract or straighten it, then cut away that tooth; but if it is attached to another tooth, then you should incise that tooth with this instrument, which has the following form; and it is similar to a pig's snout, and it should be made of Indian iron, with a very sharp point.
And let your incision be made over several days due to the hardness of the tooth, and that no other tooth is cut in the process.
And if it is a prominent eminence exposed to grinding, then grind that with an Indian iron file, the shape of which is as follows:
And let the entire Indian iron file be evenly edged; and let it have many small points like a file used for making needles, with which the tooth should be ground little by little over several days with gentleness, lest another nearby tooth become irritated and fall out. And then smooth that edge, and shave it with small razors.
And if it is a tooth of which part has been broken off and the tongue touches it, then you should grind that inside so that the roughness of that piece is removed and smoothed out, and filled in so that the tongue does not get cut nor the speech become corrupted.
Chapter 33.
On restoring decayed teeth with a gold or silver file.
When an injury or displacement of the teeth occurs due to a blow or fall, and the patient cannot chew food, and you have treated them with astringent medicines, but your treatment has not been effective, then for this reason, gold files should be used in those that are strengthened, not silver, because silver turns green and quickly becomes rotten after a few days, whereas gold never changes.
Based on the pattern and context clues from the previous text, here's my attempt at translating this sentence: And then you should carefully insert the needle into the area where the pain began, and strengthen your hand with skill until it is secure.
And the thread that you tighten with the needle must be strong enough to hold the teeth in place, so that they do not fall out.
And then you should cut off the excess thread with forceps or scissors, and add them to each place with skill, and turn them inward and hide them between the healthy tooth and the damaged tooth, so that they do not cause injury to the tongue. And then let it remain thus bound as a cord.
But if it becomes loose or broken, strengthen that one or those with another thread in such a manner at all times.
And this is the form of the teeth and the figure of the straightening of two healthy teeth and two damaged teeth, as you see these tied together.
And when it is done that the tooth or teeth return to their place, then you should cast each one back into its location, and let them heal as we have described, and they will recover.
And only do this if you are a skilled and knowledgeable practitioner.
And sometimes a cow's bone is used as the cause, and it is made from them in the shape of a tooth, and it is placed in the location where the tooth fails, and it is strengthened as we have said, and it remains and serves with that for a long time.
Chapter 34.
Concerning the treatment of the ailment which affects the tongue and hinders speech.
This ailment which is sometimes present in the tongue can be either congenital, meaning one is born with it, or acquired through an illness that has already healed.
The treatment for this involves opening the mouth of the patient and placing their head on your chest. Then, lift up the patient's tongue, and carefully cut the nerve that causes the tongue to be stuck in its recess until the tongue is freed.
However, if there is any hardness or knotting present, and this is due to the healing of an illness, then apply oil and cut until you have divided the knot and the hardness has been resolved.
And be careful not to create a cleft in the flesh, and that you do not cut too deep, causing blood flow.
Here's the translation of the given sentence:
Here's a line-by-line translation of the given sentence: And then that doctor should attend to other causes until he is cured.
Chapter 35
Concerning the extraction of a ranula from the tongue.
Sometimes an abscess resembling a small apple forms beneath the tongue, preventing it from functioning normally, and if it is not treated promptly, it will swell until it fills the mouth.
The procedure for this is to open the patient's mouth and position them facing the sun, then examine the abscess.
And if you see that it is black or dark in color and hard, with the patient feeling no pain, then do not touch it because it is gangrenous.
But if it has turned white and contains moisture, then you should insert a lancet into it, cutting it with a thin spatula, and cut through the entire length of it; and if blood comes out during your operation, then place over it some ground up vitriol until the bleeding stops.
Then return to your work until you have drawn out all of the pus, and then wash it with vinegar and salt; and treat that [area] with other appropriate treatments until he is cured.
It appears that the text is written in an archaic form of Catalan, which shares similarities with Latin, Italian, Spanish, and French. Here’s the line-by-line translation into English for the given sentence:
Of the extraction of an abscess from both ears and of that which is formed in the throat, as well as other abscesses.
When a swelling occurs in the throat, it is glands that are similar to cotton, which come out and are called two ears. If you treat them with water as mentioned in the division and they do not heal, then consider if the abscess is hard, of dark color, and has little feeling. Do not touch that one with iron.
And if it is of red color and the root is large, do not touch that one with iron because of the blood flow; rather, let it mature inside first, and then either you will pierce it or it will burst on its own.
And if it is of white color, tender, and the root of it is subtle, then that one is the one that ought to be incised.
And consider the operation on it before you operate, if the abscess has rested under a complete rest or if it is diminished by some reduction; and then make the patient lie down in front of the sunlight, and his head should be towards your left side, and open his mouth, and the servant taking between his hands presses the tongue below with an instrument very noble, the form of which is this:  (Note: The text seems to describe a procedure for extracting or treating an abscess in the throat.)
And it should be made of silver or iron, and it should be thin like a knife.
Therefore, when you press the patient's tongue with it and the abscess becomes visible, place your instrument over it. Then take a needle and insert it into the abscess, and draw out as much of the matter as you can. Another thing that draws some cause from the tunic, and then incise it with an instrument of this form:
Another thing that draws some cause from the tunic, and then incise it with an instrument of this form: and it is similar to forceps, but the ends of it are curved in such a way that the opening of each one faces the other, very sharp, which should be made of iron and well-tempered.
But if this instrument is not available to you, then incise it with a spoon of this form: And let it be sharp on one side and blunt on the other side.
And after you have incised one side, incise the other in the same manner and method of incision, and then the patient will heal from cold water
But if there is a flow of blood, heal with water from the decoction of pomegranate rind or myrtle leaf and similar to that of the causes for astringency until the bleeding is stopped, and then treat it until it is healed.
And sometimes it appears in the gullet or in the skin, or both, and cut them according to what I have said about two apples.
And I have already treated a woman with an abscess that had formed in her throat, which was of dark color and little feeling, which had already closed her throat, and the woman breathed with difficulty, and I had forbidden her from eating and drinking water, and she would have reached death if she had stayed like that for one day or two more.
And the abscess had grown so much that it had formed two holes before bursting through two openings.
So I cut myself a hole and inserted one of the holes into it, and drew that out, and a large piece came out with it, and then I cut around where I understood from the other opening, and then I forced her mouth open, and pressed her tongue down, and then I inserted the needle into that abscess.
And then I cut out a large part of it, and there flowed from it only a little blood. So the throat of that woman was healed, and she began to drink water immediately, and then she ate food. And I did not stop cutting from that abscess many times over a long period, and another abscess formed in place of it, which I cut until it extended as well.
This text appears to be discussing the treatment of a patient using a technique that involves cauterization and movement therapy. Here's my attempt at translating it line by line:
Chapter 37
On the treatment of a dislocated hip joint.
When heat accumulates in the hip joint and it becomes dislocated for a prolonged period, then it is called perpendicular; if it swells on one side with a large round mass, then it is called a tumor.
However, when it is treated with the water we mentioned earlier, and your treatment does not work, and sometimes even if the abscess has already been removed and is thin, then you must cut out that which is round; and if it is long, and blood-colored or black, and not contained, then you must attempt its removal, because in this case there is danger for the patient.
And when you see it according to the manner I have described by its whiteness and length, you should make the patient lie down and press their tongue with an instrument that conforms to its shape, and then place your finger in the new opening, and pull it down and cut it with one of two instruments used for the incision of two millia.
And you must not cut anything but that which is adjusted to the natural limit without addition, because if you cut more, you will damage their speech.
And after the incision, use that which we have recommended for the incision of two hemorrhoids, and care for it until it is healed.
But if the patient is frightened by his incision, it is necessary to use cunning in cauterizing him without fear. The manner of cautery on him should be only with sharp water. And you should place the head of the patient in your lap, and then press his tongue with the instrument that we have mentioned, and then take some of the said water for cauterization, and with this live cause, fill the concavity of the instrument whose form is as follows:
Let the opening of the concavity in which the medicine is placed be like the concavity of a spoon. Place the instrument with the medicine on the uvula, and have the patient jump on his back so that saliva or drool runs from his mouth due to the internal medicine, so that none of it drips onto his throat and he swallows it.
Then take your hand with the medicine and squeeze it onto the uvula for about half an hour until you see that it becomes darkened and soothed by the biting of the medicine.
And if you wish, take a piece of cloth and wrap it around the tip of the ray (or reed), then immerse the cloth in the medicine, and insert the ray with the cloth into a small tube so that the cloth adheres to the inside of the tube, and do this several times until you achieve the desired effect of cauterization, and then leave it there so that it dries out and falls off after about three or four days.
And if you need to repeat the medicine, repeat it in the same way. Then clean the cauterized area with a cloth soaked in warm water, and rinse it with the water used for the medicine. After washing with cold water, treat the outside with an ointment, and inside with healing remedies until it is healed.
And this type of treatment is safer than incision and lasts longer.
Sometimes the uvula is cured with something more subtle than cautery and incision, because it can be treated with sublimation in this manner: take calamus, hyssop, rue, rhubarb, dried arabic gum, chamomile, mallow, and similar herbs, and mix all these ingredients or some of them in a pot. Submerge them in vinegar and boil; the pot should be well sealed with clay so that it is tightly closed except for a small hole over which you place a concave silver or copper instrument like this.
And if you need to insert the extremity into the patient's mouth until the vapor reaches the uvula, then do so until the uvula is greatly obscured.
And then repeat this procedure on the other mucous membranes until they are dry, and be careful not to perform this treatment at the beginning of an abscess, because it would increase the pressure in the abscess, which you should not do unless you have obtained the consent of the patient's guardian.
But if this instrument is not available to you, then take a reed and tie it at the end with an eggshell, in order to protect the patient's mouth, for the shell of the egg prevents the vapor from burning the mouth.
And this treatment is beneficial to health.
Chapter 38
On the removal of thorns and other objects that adhere in the throat and other causes.
Mucous membranes adhere in the throat, or a fishbone, or some other cause.
Therefore, you must remove whatever is visible and apparent from these mucous membranes, on which the eye falls, since you have pressed the tongue forward with an instrument, so that what is in the throat is revealed to you.
Certainly! Let's translate the provided text line by line: And take a leech and bind it with a thread, and place it inside the mouth, and after an hour remove it; or take a pork and put it in the mouth, and after an hour take it out.
And if you are not familiar with those causes that we have mentioned, then use an instrument made of lead in this manner.
And it should be thicker than a finger, and at its end there should be a concavity into which you insert it into the mouth easily.
And let the patient have their head raised up, and be careful that the touch of the bone of the throat does not cause harm to the body or dislocate the bone or vertebrae, or that the physician with his hand may cause injury.
But indeed, that the patient who inserts this instrument is better, by his knowledge of the location of the cause attached and peels downward, and pulls his hand with the instrument upward, all this according to the quantity prepared within until it is forgotten.
Chapter 39.
Of the extraction of a bloodsucking leech attached to the throat.
When treating a bloodsucking leech with the remedies mentioned in the section on treatments with medicines and not with incisions, then look at the patient's throat in the light, after you have pressed the tongue of the patient with the instrument that we have recommended to you.
Therefore, if you see the leech, extract it with a small hook or with delicate tweezers.
And if it is not possible to extract [the leech] with that, then take a concave cannula and insert it into the patient's flesh. Then place an ignited iron in the concavity of the cannula, and do this as many times (until the leech is dead and detaches from the flesh). And make sure the patient abstains from water for the entire day.
Then take a bladder full of cold water and open the patient's mouth in it, and wash the mouth with it; and do not swallow any of it, but spit out the water after an hour or so with your hand, for the leech will quickly jump when it feels the water.
But if it was not removed with water as we recommended, then fumigate the patient with camphor or asafoetida using the instrument that we recommended for smoking the uvula.
Do this, whatever happens.
And another method of operation in fumigation is that you take a vessel filled with ignited coals and cover it with a lid on which there is a hole, and fit the end of the instrument into this hole; then let the smoke pour over [the patient]; and place the patient's mouth at the end of the cannula, and close his mouth so that the fumigation is not lost until you know that the fumigation has reached the leech, for the leech will quickly fall off.
And if not, then you should repeat the fumigation many times, and instruct the patient to refrain from drinking, and to eat salty foods and salt, and not to drink water. It is necessary that with this treatment, the illness be forgotten.
And this is the shape of the instrument with which bloodletting from the neck is performed when necessary; and it resembles forceps as you see them, except that in it there is some curvature. which should be placed on the neck, and the end of it is like the beak of a stork, which is blunt, in which there are rough edges made by a file, so that when you compress any part, it does not let go.
Chapter 40
In which is the summary of the discussion on abscesses and their incision.
Abscesses are many kinds, of many types, as will be remembered from their descriptions in this book.
And they are different in their incision and opening according to two methods, one of which depends on the type of abscess itself and on how much pressure is applied to the humors.
And the second method depends on the location in which they occur in the body, for an abscess occurring in the head is different from one occurring in the anus; and an abscess occurring in a fleshy part is different from one occurring in a joint; and each of them requires a specific treatment.
And there are some abscesses that should not be pierced until the crisis of the illness in them or their completion.
And other abscesses should be punctured when they are ripe and not yet fully developed, such as those near the joints, because an abscess that is close to a joint has its being prolonged until it can be emptied, and the ligaments or nerves of that joint are easily corrupted, causing contraction of that limb. Or if the abscess is near a main member, delaying its puncture until it matures can cause putrefaction in the main member; or if it is near the anus, then puncture it before it has matured to prevent the contents from spreading inside and forming a fistula, or for any other reason that may not heal. But you should know the time for the puncturing of the abscess, and this is when it is ripe.
And you should know that it is ripe when there is a reduction in pain and the end of fever, along with a decrease in swelling and pulse, and the sharpness of the abscess head, and other signs.
Here's a possible translation of the given text:
Here's a line-by-line translation of the given text:
Certainly! Let's break down and translate the provided text line by line:
"However, certain ulcers or abscesses need to be pierced according to the thickness of the flesh or body part, depending on what that particular limb requires.
"And it is necessary to administer a small piercing for small abscesses, and a large and wide or many incisions for larger abscesses, depending on the size of the abscess.
"And there are other abscesses in which it is necessary for the blade to be convex and sharpened when it is made like bread, and is done in such a way that it may cauterize immediately, as in cases of double boils and buboes.
"And among these are those that are incised with a triangular section; and of these is the type that is cut like the shape of a myrtle leaf, such as the abscesses of the tonsils.
"And among them are those in which a round or lunar section is administered, and similar to these.
"However, the one at which there is no head, such as superficial abscesses, you should pierce that with a superficial or flat puncture only.
"And it is necessary when the abscess is large and has already collected much pus that you pierce it and do not be afraid to extract all of the matter at once; having extracted a part, and then close the abscess until the next day, and then extract a larger part, and continue doing this many times according to the degree until it is completely drained.
And especially if the patient is a young child, or a pregnant woman, or an old person in decline, because the vital spirit often dissipates with the exit of blood, and the patient dies quickly, and you open them.
And be careful in this chapter with great caution, and then make your perforation in the place where you pierce these apostemas, it is necessary that you cleanse the wounds and consider whether the wound of the apostema is slight or a flat section, then administer some of these ointments or ancient remedies; and if the apostema is large, and the fissures of the perforation are many, then it is necessary that you place linen in each opening until they come together.
And if in the apostema a part of the cord has been cut or has become concave, then it is necessary that you fill it with old cloth or a strip of linen cloth, as when you have drawn threads or strips, without moisture; and strengthen this for three days; and then proceed to process it and cure it with the appropriate ointments until it is healed.
But if there is a flow of blood during your operation, then administer cold water and vinegar in which you have steeped a linen cloth, and place that over the location of the bleeding several times.
Sure, here's the translation of your provided sentence:
If the condition occurs during winter and the affected area is rich in nerves, then you should infuse powder in wine and oil, and place them on the affected areas.
And if it is summer and the affected areas are fleshy, then you should place powder soaked in water or oil on them, and keep them covered until the third day, as we have said. Then, you should release the abscess, clean it, and apply appropriate treatment until the patient is healed.
And this is what is necessary for the knowledge of the universal treatment of abscesses, but as I have already said according to the method of distinction, each type of abscess requires a specific treatment, which will be discussed individually by chapter.
Chapter XLI
On the incision of abscesses that occur at the back of the head.
In the back of the head, small abscesses and species of nodules that contain tunics at their tips; and the species of these are many.
And they have pustules, and among those are ones that contain a moisture resembling lime. And among those are ones that contain a moisture resembling dust, and similar to them; and there are also those that are stony and hard.
And in cutting all of them and extracting those parts, there is no fear, for the removal of those parts does not cause a reaction of the bowels.
And the operation in cutting those parts is that you should use an instrument whose shape is as follows: it is called an enterotome, knowing that it contains [the necessary features].
Because if what is contained is moisture, then cut it with a section along the length for a surface section in this way:
And begin the section from line .B. to line .G. Then, once the moisture has been evacuated, excoriate that which contains the moisture and leave no remnant of it, for if any remains, it may return and cause further problems.
And then submerge the wound in Egyptian ointment, if available, and if not, in salt water; and fill the wound with it and leave it there for another day, because with that you will dissolve everything that remains of that layer.
And then apply Egyptian ointment repeatedly and thoroughly to the wound as needed, until you are confident that there is no remaining cause of that layer; then heal the wound with ointment until it is healed.
And if an abscess contains fatty knots, then you should incise it as follows: And make a cross-shaped incision, and insert your scissors between the two lips of the incision, and draw it out from all sides, and exert your strength in extracting the bag that contains it.
But if your archery causes trouble, then do as I have previously instructed you.
And similarly perform the incision and treatment of the calcified abscess as we have told you; and the incision on a calcified abscess is lighter, because it has little blood and little moisture.
And sometimes there are abscesses of this kind that are in the head of some people with whom there is no moisture; the cause of which is that I incised an abscess on the head of an old woman and found the abscess to be like a deaf, hard, white stone, which could not be broken, and if anyone had struck it, they would have suffered.
But in other abscesses that occur in the head, other than this one, such as the abscesses that come to children's heads and the reasons for the ear drums, but the incision of these should all be a superficial incision.
"And stop the bleeding from those of the lower parts, so that the body is relieved of the sickness in the lower parts.
"Then treat him with water suitable for his treatment.
"Chapter 42.
"On the incision of scrofula that occurs in the neck.
"These growths often appear in the neck, armpits, and groin areas; sometimes they also occur in other parts of the body.
"And those that occur in the neck, and many of which are generated among them, all scrofula of these is within its own proper tunic, just as in the nodes and tumors of the head, as we have recounted.
"And the types of these scrofula are many, for some are stony, and some contain moisture, and some are malignant and do not obey treatment.
"Therefore, in the one that you see to be of good disposition when touched, whose visible color is close to the color of the codena, and which grows in all directions, and is not attached to the nerves of the neck, or to the veins, or to the arteries, and is not spreading, it is necessary for you to incise that with a superficial cut on the part above the part below the body along the line from G to B. And remove that entirely, and extend two lips of the codena with an ounce or more if you have need of those, as we have said in the tumors of the head, and extract it little by little.
And it is more cautious that no vein or nerve is cut.
And let the spatula not be too sharp, so that it does not cut you or disturb the patient; and do not cut anything that is not necessary to cut; for if you were to cut a vein or artery and prohibit yourself from your operation, then place on the wound tripartite vitriol or other powders which stop the flow of blood, and press down on the wound, and let what is repulsive about the acuity of the aposteme be soothed; and let the wound be softened and begin to suppurate. When the blood has been severed.
Therefore, return to your operation until you have completed it.
And then inquire with the patient's own words whether there is any other underlying cause of the other small scrofulous tumors; if so, cut and clean those as well.
And if it is near the scrofulous tumor there is a large vein, then you should not cut that tumor from its root. Before, it is advisable to leave that with a strong bandage and let it fall off by itself without harming it.
And then fill the wound with old cotton that you have already soaked in Egyptian ointment, and then treat it.
And if you cut out that entire scrofula, then it is necessary that you join together the two lips of the wound and stitch them up immediately so that there remains no excess skin.
But if you see that there is excess skin due to the size of the scrofula, it is necessary that you understand to cut away the root of it, and then draw out the rest and apply a stitch as mentioned before.
And for those scrofulas that contain moisture, pierce them with a superficial puncture where you see the mature part of it, and place the puncture so that the pus exits from below, as we have said before.
And then apply a poultice with ointment and similar ingredients to those mentioned earlier, so that it corrodes what remains of the corruption. And then when you see that the wound is already clean, you should treat it with a poultice of flesh-generating ointment until it is healed.
Chapter XLIII
On the incision of the head of an abscess occurring in the groin.
The text means: "The ancients said this section in the epilepsy, and we have not seen anyone in our land who has done it." Here's a line-by-line translation:
And this is the inscription of the sermon of those (people).
But in men having scrotal hernia, the extraction of the testicle must be avoided, because water does not help at all since all the veins and main vessels of the patient are located here.
But in those who have abscesses caught in the mouth or throat or both ears, when the illness is not in the neck, it is necessary to use the section of the testicle to avoid the loss which is made by infection.
Therefore, when we want to do this, we must cut off the testicle after three circles of the testicular circles, or four with a small section through the middle in that which is between two circles for quantity, so that the section be at the spermatic cord, not at the cartilage. And this place is suitable for section because it is devoid of flesh and its blood vessels are thin.
And if the doctor is timid, he should then extend the gullet with an ounce (of some substance), and immediately split the gullet until it reaches the esophagus, but avoid the blood vessels if you see any of those as a cause.
Then cut the uvula as we have recommended; and it is indicated for the section of the esophagus due to the inflammation which comes from that area with water that has been disrupted and by the absence of speech.
And let the wound remain open for some time.
So when the hour arrives that was expected for the perforation, add two lips of the coden (cord?) to the wound and sew it up with just thread (without using glue or other substances).
Then administer medicines that cause new flesh to grow until it is healed.
And Ibn Al-Zakariya (Albucasis) says that the sum of what we have discussed is this: some of these apostemes (abscesses or boils) already take away the life force of the patient, and the patient comes close to death, and his breath becomes shallow. Some people cut open the epiglottis so that the patient can breathe over the place of the wound for some breathing, and thus be saved from death.
And for this reason, it is commanded to leave the wound open until the harm of the illness is consumed; and the harm lasts for three days; and then it is commanded to sew up the wound and care for it until it is healed.
And what I have seen myself is that a maidservant took a knife and stuck it in her own throat and cut off a piece of the lung with it, and I was called to care for her, and I found the woman as she was dying, and I discovered the wound and found the blood that had come out of the wound was small.
Here's a line-by-line translation of the given text:
And do not scold the servant unless they speak in a hoarse voice, and then after some days they will return to their normal condition.
And now I say to you that there is no fear in the section of the epileptic patient.
Chapter XLIV
About the incision on an abscess that occurs in the throat outside, and is called a hernia of the throat.
This abscess, named a hernia of the throat, is a large abscess according to the body's color, and it mostly occurs in women.
And there are two types of it, for it can be either natural or accidental.
And the natural one is incurable.
And the accidental type is of two kinds: one resembles large knots, and the other resembles an abscess caused by a blockage in an artery, and in that case there is danger. And it should not be presumed to cut it with iron except in the small ones. And you should take that and examine it with the said instrument, and if you find it resembles large knots, and it is not attached to any of the veins, then you should incise it as you would with knots, and extract it with water that contains a mixture of peel and burdock; but if not, then you should explore its entire being, and afterward cure the area with healing water until it is healed.
This line means "Chapter 45" or "Book 45". The word "Capitol" is likely a misspelling of "Capitulum", which is Latin for "chapter".
"De seccione de la especies del nudus." This translates to "On the incision of the species of the node" or more naturally, "About cutting the types of knots/joints.
This sentence translates to: "There are many types of nodes/knots, and I have already mentioned all their types in the division.
This sentence translates to: "And I ought to recount thus the difference between a knot/node and an excrescence, as there may be doubt.
This sentence translates to: "Therefore, I say that an excrescence is characterized by heat and fever and intense pain until the boil of the superfluity is calmed; and it is a completed putrefaction at which point the fever, pain, and heat cease.
This sentence translates to: "But a knot/node is not characterized by heat or fever or pain, and I tell you about that certain lion who is in his own bag.
This sentence translates to: "And it is according to the color of the body, and its beginning is like a seed, and it is made thus as if empty, whether large or small, and there are two types of them, because some are fatty and contain moisture, and the colors of the moisture are many, as I said in the division.
Based on the provided translation pattern and the similarity of the text to Latin, Italian, Spanish, and French, here's my best guess at translating the given sentence into English:
This is my attempt to translate the given text:
Here's my attempt at translating the sentence:
"And if the draining moisture, of whatever color it may be, has been forgotten, then cut it with a shallow incision as I have said in other discussions.
"And if you do not find moisture from the wound's trace, know that it is a tumor.
"Dry over it with a shallow incision shaped like a cross according to this shape: "As you have been taught, suspend it with a hook, and carefully skin the membrane from all sides, and preserve the skin or bag, if possible, over that, and draw out that corruption with a needle.
"But if it breaks during the operation, it is not possible to draw out that corruption, and many times this happens; and then you must extract it by degrees until nothing remains of it.
"For if anything remains of it, too little or too much, the needle will return according to the greatest amount.
"And if you see that a small part of it remains, then fill the wound with some sharp and corrosive powders, strengthen the wound, place over it a hot cautery, and heal that with another treatment until it is healed.
"And if the needle is large, then suture the two lips of it and heal it with that which contains flesh.

Chapter Forty-Six
Of the forms of the necessary instruments in sectioning and perforation.
The forms of these instruments are of three types: one is large, one is medium-sized, and one is small.
The form of the large instrument is as follows:
The form of the small instrument is this:
They are made of iron, with sharpened edges, so that they can penetrate the wounds effectively.
And these are the forms of the probes, which are named albreds, and one of them is called berid.
And there are three types: large, medium, and small.
The form of the large probe is this:
The form of the medium probe is as follows:
The form of the small probe is as follows:
It is fitting that they are used for wounds, exits, fistulas and abscesses, in order to go through those [caused] by bones or other causes.
And they are made round, large, long, like large needles with which sails are sewn, and they are made of citron wood, or of horn, or of iron, or of silver, and the best ones are when they are made of citron wood.
Here's a line-by-line translation of the given sentence:
And thus for three types of herbs, because some are long, others medium, and others short, according to the width of the fistula and its constriction.
The shape of a large lead experiment (or tool).
The shape of a medium-sized lead experiment (or tool).
The shape of a small lead instrument.
The shapes of the hooks are made of various herbs, for some are simple, with only one curve, and there are three types: large, small, and medium.
And they are also hook-shaped, and there are three types.
And of those that are hooked, some have two curves, and there are three kinds.
And of them, some have three curves, and there are three types.
And all of these are necessary in their places.
Shape of a small simple hook, its form:
Shape of a large hook with two curves: "Forma" here likely means "shape" or "form. Based on the context provided and the similarity to Latin, Italian, Spanish, and French, here's a line-by-line translation of the given text:
Here's the translation of the first source sentence:
Form of an ointment maker having three curves:
And these are the forms of the scalpels with which nodes and abscesses are cut and scraped off, and they come in three sizes: large, medium, and small.
"Form of a large scalpel:
"Form of the medium scalpel:
"Form of the small scalpel:
"The ends of these [scalpels] with which cutting is done are sharp and the other ends are blunt, and they are not placed in this manner [i.e., without caution], but rather to avoid cutting a vein or nerve during the scraping of nodes, so that the patient may be healed and experience some relief due to the heat caused by the scraping of the abscess."  (Note: "adustio" is likely a misspelling of "adustiō", which means "heat".)
And these are the forms of forceps, and they come in three sizes: large, medium, and small, as you will see.
It seems like this text is about a medical procedure or treatment involving heat therapy. Here's a line-by-line translation:
And it is on the outer extremity that you make a puncture with a hidden spatula, and in that place you run the parts inside and outside, as you wish, like this:
The shapes of the spatulas, which are hidden among the aforementioned places for the puncture of the abscesses and not perceived by the patients, come in three kinds: large, medium, and small. And these are their shapes:
The forms of the bloodletting cups with which the flow of blood is opened are of three kinds: large, medium, and small. Their shapes are as follows:
They are made of ram's horn, round with some length, and they should be fine.
And you should have these three sizes of bloodletting cups - large, medium, and small - so that through them you can quickly open the flow of blood in an emergency, and then it will be as if you had given medicine at first.
However, do not use these to open blood flow in all parts of the body, and only use them in fleshy places, such as on the calves of the legs and thighs, on the upper arms, breasts, stomach, and shins, and similar fleshy areas.
Here's the translation of the given sentence:
And sometimes they are made round according to this shape:
Chapter 47.
Of the care of men's breasts that resemble those of women.
Sometimes the breasts of certain men swell as they begin to sleep, and then their breasts swell further, resembling the breasts of women, being more prominent and light in color.
And to the one who has this, it is necessary to incise it according to the lunar section as follows: from line B to line G. Then cut away all the grossness and fill the wound with an incarnating medicine, then join the two lips of the wound together with stitching and care for it until it heals.
But if the breast begins to hang down and is softened by its size, as it should be in women, then it should be cut into two parts along its upper edge with two lunar-shaped incisions, each of which is contained within the other at its end, so that the larger line contains the smaller one, as shown in this figure between lines B and G. Then cut away the cord that is between the two lips of the wound, remove the fat, and administer what we have said about stitching and powders, doing what is necessary for the cure until it heals.
And if you have not completed the incision of that which needs to be cut for the sake of the patient's restlessness and blood flow, then it is necessary to fill the wound with a cloth soaked in corrosive ointment and leave it there until it dissolves what is fatty, and then care for that part until it heals.
This is likely a chapter heading in Latin, similar to "Chapter XLVIII" in English. Here's how it breaks down:
Of the perforation of abscesses that come from the nipple.
These abscesses that come from the nipple are of the species of scrofula, hard, which contain a pus that is drawn out.
And of those, some contain moisture; and those that contain moisture ought to be incised with a lunar section according to this figure: from the line of .G. to the line of .B. And when all that is in the abscess has been evacuated, then you fill it with cotton wool and let the entrance remain open for another day.
And then the cotton should be removed and the area treated with an appropriate ointment until it is healed.
And if the abscess is of the species of nodes and scrofula, then you should incise it in the same way as we have said in the section on scrofula likewise.
But if the wound is extensive to the point that it may cause gangrene, then administer cautery to him as we have said before.
Chapter 49
On the incision of abscesses that occur due to an arrow or a vein.
When an arrow is broken and the tendon above it has hardened, then many swellings occur due to a postule. And the signs by which it can be known that inflammation and a postule are caused by an artery or vein: because when the postule is caused by an arrow, it is greatly elongated in the front of the body; and if you were to extract the postule with the mentioned instruments, you would feel a squeaking sound in it.
And that which is caused by a vein appears round on the surface of the body.
And incision over this postule is an error, especially in those that are below the armpits, in the groin, in the neck, and in many parts of the body; and it is very great, therefore one should avoid treating it with iron, and those that are in the extremities or in the head must be avoided.
However, if it is caused by the inflammation of the opening of an arrow wound, make an incision in the tendon along its length; and then enlarge the incision with hooks near the arrow, and deliver the tunics until they are exposed.
Then place an awl over it and make it penetrate to the other side, and strengthen the arrow with double thread in two places — which I have seen you perform skillfully in the extraction of two arrows that were in the temples.
And then punch the spot that is between two ligaments with a spatula until all the blood in it comes out and the abscess is dissolved.
And then administer treatment to the wound until the ligaments fall off; and then cure that area with appropriate ointments until it is healed.
And if the abscess is due to a dry vein, then you should hold water as close to the abscess as possible with your hand, and then insert the needle into the spot where you had your hand, making it penetrate; let there be a double thread until you draw out that from the other side, and then bind the abscess with a good ligature in the way I have told you, tying it at two parts with two ends of the thread.
But if you fear that the thread may be drawn out, then insert the thread with that needle throughout the entire abscess from the initial incision of the needle, and strengthen those threads in four places.
Then dry the abscess in the middle of it until when all that is within it has come out, then you should incise the excess skin, and let whatever is attached to it come out.
And then place on the wound the one that you have soaked in wine and oil, and then administer the treatment which is done with hot compresses and ointments until it is healed.
Chapter 1 of the abscess which occurs due to a twist in the nerves.
Thus, an abscess can occur in the bowels and veins, and similarly, an abscess can occur in the nerves when there is a blow or excessive work, and by similar causes.
And it most often affects the feet in the areas of the ankles or soles, or any place where the joints are weak.
And it is a serious abscess, similar in color to the rest of the body, and in its early stages, it feels tight with intensity, causing the patient to feel numbness.
And it is not an abscess that occurs in the front of the body, and therefore, the tendons are affected, causing pain throughout the entire area without spreading to the front or back parts.
Therefore, for those who have it in their joints, it is not advisable to be bandaged with iron, because it will quickly cause contraction.
But the one that is on the head or forehead should be treated with a spatula. "But if it is a small abscess, then take those scissors and cut it open.
"But if it is large, then suspend it with hooks, and incise it, and then remove it; and close the wound with stitches, and treat it until it is healed.
"Chapter I.
"About cutting an abscess which occurs in the place where the intestine is located in the abdomen.
"It happens to many men who are seen in their abdomens and other parts of the body, called fungus due to their similarity to mushrooms, whose roots are subtle and the head is large; and already their lips have turned outward, and it is one of those that is small and very magnified.
"And I have seen one where in his abdomen there were two growths that resembled mushrooms more, and there was no difference between those white ones with small roots.
"And already the lips of those were turned outward and split open, and moisture constantly flowed from it.
"So I cut into them and found in one about eighteen inches long, and in the other about six inches long.
Here is the translation of the given medieval medical text:
And if you see the patient is anxious and fearful, be cautious not to use iron; instead, take a freshly made lead plaster, strengthen it with that oil, in the manner we mentioned earlier; and leave it on for two days.
And then adjust the lead wire in the stricture; therefore, do not stop strengthening the large amount of lead with oil until it is dissolved and falls out on its own without effort.
But if the oil is of a strong nature, then there is some cause for concern and fear in its use, especially when it is in the abdomen.
But it is possible that you dissolve most of it, and then cauterize the area so that it does not return.
And then care for the patient until the wound is healed.
And be careful not to dissolve oil that is dark in color, has little sensation, and looks like ink, because that is also cancerous.
And I will come to mind about the crab again soon.
Chapter 52
On the treatment of prominence of the navel.
Prominence of the navel can be caused by several reasons: either by fissures in the skin that is over the abdomen, and out of it comes tissue or intestine as happens in other ruptures; or by blood that flows from a vein or artery, as mentioned earlier; or by wind trapped in it.
Here's the translation of the given sentence: And if it is due to the exit of the intestine, then place the patient in the same position we have described, with even greater urgency. As you press on that area with your hands as instructed, the intestine becomes hidden. Then return quickly; for this case, a hot bath and intense labor are greatly recommended.
But if due to moisture, it will be slippery and not hidden when you press with your hand, nor will it be constrained or held.
And if due to blood, then with these signs, the abscess appears darkening in color.
But if it is due to decayed flesh, then the abscess will be severe, large and hard, and it will feel like a fixed mass of a certain size.
But if it is due to gas, then touching it will be slippery.
And the operation in this case is that you should consider whether the protrusion of the umbilicus is due to blood from an artery or vein, or due to gas; in such a case, it is advisable for you to refrain from treating it, because in this situation there is danger and fear, as I have taught you in the chapter where I discussed abscesses caused by arteries and veins.
Here's my line-by-line translation of the given sentence:
And then carefully cut the middle of the extended abscess over the flank and insert your finger into that incision; and if you have found and secured the intestine, then extract it little by little and push the intestine back into the inner parts of the belly.
And if you have found the membrane, then take it with tweezers; and cut away its excess parts.
But if it is contrary to your intentions or a vein, then circle around that area, and then return to your operation; take two needles and put into them two strong threads, and insert the two needles into the circle that you have made around the abscess in the shape of a cross, making sure they penetrate; and then strengthen the abscess in four parts over the needles.
And if you wish, remove the needles and leave the area open until the extended flesh can fall back in place on its own; or cut away that which is thinning and rotting, and then care for it with water from the appropriate ointments until it heals.
And if the prominence of the navel is filled with nothing but flesh or due to humidity, then it is necessary that you treat the abscess as we have said and extract the blood or humidity found in it, and then care for it with water that is appropriate and helps solidify the area.
It seems that you provided only the chapter number "Capitolo .liii." without any text to translate. Could you please provide the full text for Chapter 33? I'll be happy to help with its translation.
Sure, here is a possible translation of that sentence:
Here's my attempt to translate the provided sentence into English:
And the ancients said that sometimes cancer is in a place where it is possible to eradicate it, such as in the case of breast or testicular cancer, and similarly for other parts of the body allocated to remove all of it, especially when it begins small.
But when it is advanced and large, one should not approach it, for I cannot heal anyone from that, nor have I seen another who could, nor has it been successful for me.
And the operation on it is when it is allocated as we have said, that you precede and leave the patient and purge some of the black bile from him, and then bleed it if an obvious swelling is found.
And then prepare the patient with the preparation in which he is located for surgery, and then promise on the cut that is necessary for him; and then drain thoroughly from all sides with a good sharp curette until there is no longer any cause of his roots remaining. And let the blood flow, and do not cut it lightly, and squeeze the places, and wash away all the thick blood with your hand or with an instrument with which you can among the instruments.
"But if you encounter resistance due to thick blood clotting in a vein or artery, then cauterize it until the blood flow ceases, and afterward treat it with another remedy until it is healed.
"Chapter 40.
"On the treatment of dropsy (edema).
"We have already recounted, in the division, the types of dropsy from water, and the signs of each type, as well as its treatment with medicines.
"And that which is cured with iron is only the type of althitas, and it should not be treated with iron if it is the type of tympanitis or hydrops, for this is fatal.
"And when you have treated this type of dropsy, tympanites, with medicines and your medicine does not work, then consider that if the patient has already reached debility, or suffers from another type of dropsy along with it, such as tuberculosis or abdominal pain similar to these, then be careful not to treat him with iron, for fear of this.
"But if you see the patient is in good health and only has dropsy, and there is no other illness besides it, and he is not a child or an old man, then the manner of treating him is that you raise the patient between your hands, and you should press his abdomen with your hand until the water is evacuated through the navel. Then take a thorny spatula like this:
Certainly! Let's break down and translate the sentence line by line:
And then consider if the generation of dropsy is due to the intestines, because at that time you should use incision away from the navel for the length of three fingers towards the right, on the pubic bone.
But if the generation of dropsy is due to an illness of the liver, then your incision should be on the left side of the navel for three fingers.
And if the generation [of dropsy] is due to the spleen, then your incision should be on the right side.
And it is not necessary that your incision be on the side where the patient wishes to have the ailment, so that the superfluities do not run to that dangerous place.
And then perforate with the instrument the entire intestine, and then insert it into that incision, and lift your hand with the spatula between the intestine and the spleen, and you will excise it; and if [the superfluities] are of the size of a nail or around.
And then you should pierce the spleen until the spatula reaches the empty space, which is the place of water [superfluities]. And then extract that [superfluous fluid] and insert an instrument of this form: And it is similar to a fine silver tube; it is made of silver or iron or bronze. At the lowest point of it there is a small hole, and on its sides there are three holes: two on one side and one on the other side. The tip of it is carved in the manner of a feather, as you see.
And at the uppermost end of it there is a ring, because when the instrument reaches the water, then they immediately place that over the instrument, so that it evacuates in an hour's time the greatest quantity of water possible, for if you evacuate from it more than necessary in an hour, the patient will die suddenly by resolution of his vital spirit, or you may cause him to fall into a coma which is very close to death.
But evacuate from it according to the quantity of its power, and according to what the patient's pulse indicates about their strength and their condition.
And after extracting the instrument, immediately pull out the water that is causing it, because as soon as it is held back by the chain that pulls the hole above the cup through which you have been counting to yourself that you should pierce it in this manner.
And then repeat the treatment with the instrument on the other side if the patient can tolerate it, and extract a small amount of water, and do this for several days until fear subsides, and be careful not to leave any water residue except a little bit.
But if you fear for the patient and leave a large amount of water, then treat it with burial in hot sand, move under a bath, and wait for a long time in the sun; and treat it with drying medicines until it is healed.
And cauterize on the stomach and the spleen near where the water was extracted, as I have already mentioned in what precedes this.
Chapter 55
On the treatment of children who are born with unpierced urinary passages.
Sometimes one of the children comes out of its mother's womb and its head is not pierced, or it is narrowed or displaced.  It seems like you might be translating a medieval text on pediatric surgery!
Therefore, it is necessary to pierce [the infant] immediately after birth with a very fine probe in this manner:
And then insert a thin lead weight through the opening and tie it off, and leave it there for three days or four.
And when the patient wants to urinate, raise him up and let him urinate; then return him to his previous position.
And if you do not place the lead (plaster) on it, it is possible that the urine which passes over this area will not heal this sore.
But if the opening through which it passes is narrow, let it be treated with a lead plaster for many days until it is healed.
But those in which the opening is not in its proper place are said to be caused by this: that from those, that which is natural in the opening is turned towards the tip of the penis, so that it cannot urinate in the usual way inside until one lifts the penis with his hand above; and it does not cause generation, because the semen cannot reach the mother according to right, and it is a very bad illness.
And the manner of the operation on him is that the patient be placed on his back, and then extend the head of his penis with your left hand with strong force, and incise the tip of the head of the penis from the place of the foreskin with a sharp spatula, just like the cutting of a quill pen, or whatever you may cut in some part, so that the middle of it comes out similar to the head of the penis and that the opening falls into the middle place as is necessary.
And be careful during your operation of blood flow, because this often happens; and pause to stop the bleeding, and care for the wound until it is healed.
This seems to be a chapter or section heading in the text, likely indicating that we are starting a new topic or discussion. The number "lvi" suggests that this is the 56th section of the treatise.
About the white spot that occurs on the foreskin at the tip of the penis, and about corruption and blackening and adhesion of the foreskin to the tip of the penis.
Many times this white spot occurs on the penis and it is a growth of flesh.
And one [type] is malignant, and the other is not malignant.
Non-malignant [type], you should suspend it with a subtle hook and cut it off until it is all removed; then place on that spot a piece of Egyptian ointment submerged in wax; then treat it with the ointment called Diafinicon until it is healed.
And if the spot is malignant, with a dark color, then you should apply a cautery near its border and its root.
But if the spot is on the foreskin of an uncircumcised penis, and one part of the spot is inside the foreskin and the other part is outside, then you should first remove the spot that is inside at the beginning until it is consolidated; and then you should treat the one that is outside, because when you treat both the foreskin and the spot together, it is not certain that [the spot] will not return.
Here's my attempt at translating the given text into English:
And then treat that person with another treatment until they are healthy.
But if there is a flow of blood, then administer a lunar cautery in the following manner:
For a cautery is beneficial for two purposes at once: it is for blood flow and for the wound when it is infected.
And if the head of the penis is rotten and completely destroyed at that time, then you should insert a lead tube into the opening of the foreskin so that the patient can urinate through it.
In the case of adhesion of the foreskin to the head of the penis (and this adhesion occurs only in those whose foreskin is healthy and for whom circumcision is not required; and when adhesion occurs due to a wound or abscess) it is necessary to gently scrape with a blunt spatula until the bond is dissolved and the head of the penis is completely freed.
And if it is difficult to carefully peel them off, then you should scrape some part of the head of the penis and the foreskin with a spatula, and this is because the foreskin, being thin, is easily perforated due to its thinness.
And then carefully separate the foreskin from the head of the penis using a fine thread, which has already been soaked in cold water to prevent sticking again.
And then it should be treated with six styptic powders until it is healed.
Chapter 57.
About the cleansing of infants and the care for those who have undergone circumcision.
Circumcision is not the cure for any other diseases like other afflictions; however, since it depends on our actions and will, and especially because infants are subject to it, it is necessary that we establish the best practice and the easiest way to preserve their health.
Therefore, I say that the ancients did not mention circumcision in any of their books because they do not use it in their laws. And this is only because we have acquired it through experience. This is why I found most craftsmen and barbers using a razor and scissors for circumcision and cleansing, and they use bandages with honey and incisions with the fingernail.
And I have tried all these methods and found that the best cleansing is done with scissors, and bandaging with honey instead of using the fingernail because many times the frenulum escapes above, because the foreskin has two layers, and the layer below remains, and it is easily torn again causing more pain. And with cleansing, which is done by alphecati and is digital, used by shoemakers, the incision of the end of the male member is not guaranteed because it enters very quickly into its hole.
But in surgery with a nail, it will enter too fast and ruin your work. And the child's penis is short by nature, and many times I have seen it in such a way that there is no need for cleansing, and I myself have seen this.
But of the cleansing that is done with scissors and ligatures with thread, its goodness and effectiveness have been discovered by my experience, because the scissors are of proportional incision, for which reason the sharpness on top is just like the sharpness below; and so when you press your hand in such a proportionate manner between the two sharp edges, and cut this way at one time, it makes a compressive figure containing the penis from all sides, with which there can be no error at all.  />
And the manner of the first operation is that you make the child lie down as much as possible if he is one of those who understands a little, so that you only tie the thread around his penis and leave it like this until the next day.
And then proceed with the cheerful approach in every possible way so that they may receive this understanding. And then have someone who is skilled at positioning prepare themselves and not be anxious; and hide the scissors in your hand or under your foot, so that the child does not see those or any other of the instruments.
And then insert your hand into his throat and blow into the windpipe, and pull it out until the head of the penis is visible, and then clean that which has accumulated in it due to filth.
The form of the forceps for modification is as follows:
Let one pair of the forceps be blunt-edged and the other pair be sharp, so that the edge of the nail is not cut, and let the length of both handles be such that they are equal in length to two thumb widths.
However, the mistake in modification is if you excessively cut the internal cord, whether all of it or part of it, then you must make an incision.
Therefore, you should extend that at the appropriate time with your nail before the affected area and cut it according to its length.
And if you cannot hold it with your nail, then extract it with a hook and cut it.
However, if three days have passed and there is still inflammation under the affected area, then you should let it be until the swelling has subsided. Then cautiously remove the scab, cut it as prepared, and incise it according to your preparation.
And be careful of the head of the vein, for it will not be there.
Therefore, treat it with something that solidifies the wound, using the powders we have recommended in the treatise on powders.
And if it is cut from the intestine by too much, and obeys the instructions above, it will not harm him/her.
And continue to care for them with what we have said until they are healed.
Chapter 58.
On the treatment of retained urine in the bladder.
Retention of urine in the bladder is caused by obstruction from a stone or congealed blood clot, or from pus or tissue, and it should be treated similarly to what we have said about the various methods of treatment in the section on [manias/madness].
And if it is not dissolved with what we have said and the cause has become strong in the patient, then it is necessary to administer extraction from them with an instrument called a syringe, which looks like this: It should be made of silver and have a hollow cone, similar to a quill pen with a length of about one and a half palms, at the end of which there should be a fine cannula.
Certainly! Let's translate the given sentence line by line:
And make a cut on the patient over the bladder, and puncture his bladder and penis with moist oils, olive oil, and vinegar.
And then introduce the catheter with ease until it reaches the tip of the penis; then bend the penis downwards towards the navel; and then push the catheter into that; and then push it until it reaches the bladder, and this is done so that the patient becomes void of urine, and this is not done according to this order, but rather the meat in which there is a blockage.
And then slowly remove the wool with a small amount of oil, because the urine soaks the wool.
Then remove it and do so as a treatment with urine, and use the catheter, do not stop doing this and use the catheter until the bladder is emptied and the patient finds relief.
Chapter 59.
About the method of enema for the bladder using clamps and similar instruments that are suitable for this purpose.
When there is an ulcer or abscess in the bladder, or frozen blood, or constricting heat, and you wish to distill water and medicine into it, then do so with an instrument called a clampcedra, and this is its form:
"Unless it is numb at the end of the limb, it is closed. "And in that there are three openings: two from one side, thus you see.
"At the beginning there is a hollow place where this thing is covered and it enters according to how much of that liquid is pulled out until, when some cause draws out the humidities from it, it is drawn out, and when it is expelled, it is drawn out with it, and when it is expelled far, it makes a 'clampcedra' like that which is put in sea battles.
"Therefore, when you want to prohibit the urine in the bladder, insert the tip of the 'clampcedra' into the urine, and draw out with it the water that is covered on the parts above, for the urine is drawn into the hollow of the 'clampcedra'.
"And then insert the tip of the 'clampcedra' into the penis as we have recommended in the bladder; and then cover the urine with what you cover it, for that urine goes to the bladder immediately, and the patient feels that.
"Form of the subtle 'cristeri' with which the bladder is catheterized, and this is its form:
And it should be made of silver or bronze, and its tip should resemble a small feather, and then insert it gently inside.
And then take the bladder of an animal, and place inside it the moisture you wish to crystallize in the bladder, and then tie it tightly between two strong ligatures with double thread, and heat that moisture over the fire.
And then insert the pointed end of the crystal into the urethra.
And then press your hand firmly over the bladder with the moisture until the patient feels that the moisture has reached the bladder.
But if no bladder is available to you, then take a sheep's bladder and make it into a bag; and perforate it all around its circumference; and then insert strong thread through those holes, so that they are tied shut; and then add the bag in the same way as described above, because you place inside it any of the moisture, oils, or waters.
And then you tie it to the instrument and use it as you have used with the bladder, pressing with your hand until the moisture reaches the bladder.
Chapter 60
On the extraction of stones.
We have already mentioned in the division the types of stones and their treatment with medicines, as well as the difference between stones generated in the kidneys and those generated in the bladder, along with the signs of the latter.
And we have discussed the stone in which surgery with the hand and incision are performed.
And the stone generated in the bladder is specifically the one that is placed in the bladder.
And I will now describe it with a clear and concise explanation.
Therefore, I say that the stone generated in the bladder mainly occurs in children. Its signs include urine excreted from the bladder being similar to water in its subtlety, and sand appearing in it; the patient frequently urinates small amounts, and often there are forcible discharges of flatus.
And the cure for children with this condition is easier until they reach fourteen years old, while it is difficult to treat in the elderly. However, among young people, it can be managed with this method:
And in the case where the stone is larger and the treatment is easier; if it is small, it is contrary to that. ︎
Certainly! Let's translate the provided text step by step:
And then the patient should be taken by their feet and shaken vigorously so that the stone descends into the bladder or exits from its place sometimes.
Then make that incision between your hands prepared, and let his hands be placed under his body parts, so that the entire bladder is made to descend towards the lower regions.
And then seek out all of it and take it all out completely.
So if you feel the stone in the space, then you should cut immediately with a scalpel on it.
And if you do not catch all of it with your touch, then you should anoint your index finger of the left hand with oil, if the patient is a child, or the little finger if he is a young man, and insert it into his anus. And seek the stone inside until you find it under your finger. And turn it little by little into the neck of the bladder.
Then press on it with your finger and expel it towards the outside parts near the place where you made the incision.
And command the assistant to press the bladder with his hand; and command another assistant with his right hand to extend the testicles upwards, and with his other hand to hold back the penis that is under the testicles, in the place where the incision is made.
And then introduce spatula, which is incidentally shaped like this: And then cut in it what is between the buttocks and the genitals, not exactly in the middle, but rather lower on the left side of the thigh; and make the incision over that stone, and your finger should be in the anus, and make a transverse incision so that the outer part of the incision is wide and the inner part is narrow according to the amount of stone that can be extracted, not more, because if you press too hard with the finger that is in the anus, the stone will be pushed out without difficulty.
And know that there are some stones with angles and edges, which makes their removal difficult.
And of those, the kind that resembles a bean is easy to remove, as it is round.
Therefore, if it has angles and edges, fit it into the slit.
And if it is not easily removed this way, then you should create an opening on top of it, or press down on it with a suitable implement whose end is like a file, which you use to press against the stone, and do not rush; or introduce beneath it a fine instrument with a curved tip.
If you cannot stop the flow, then widen the opening a little bit. And if you see blood flowing out, immediately cut off that area with strong vinegar.
But if the stone is more than one, then first press your hand against the opening of the bladder, and then cut it open; and then press a little bit thereafter; and act similarly if there are more than two stones.
And if the stone is very large, it is ignorant to cut it with a large incision, because you cause one of two things to happen to the patient: either death or continuous dripping of urine, because the area is not completely healed.
But induce the expulsion of it until it is removed, or devise a fracture of it with forceps until it is extracted in pieces.
Therefore, when you have completed your operation, then fill the wound with aloe leaves and dragon's blood, and strengthen it. And place a cloth soaked in oil and wine, or in rosemary oil and cold water, on it to prevent pus from forming.
And then have the patient lie down on their side, and do not remove the bandage until the third day.
And when that abscess has been lanced, wash the area with water and much oil, and then treat it with an ointment of definicion and an ointment of diabasilicon until it is healed.
But if an apostema (abscess) occurs in the wound, which is harsh and corrosive, and it appears as though the blood is congealed in the bladder, preventing urination (and this is known by the discharge of blood with the urine), then you should insert your finger into the wound and extract that blood. Because if it remains, it will provoke the bladder to rot and cause putrefaction in the patient.
Then wash the wound with vinegar, water, and salt, and apply every type of poultice that is suitable for the patient's healing until it is healed.
And it is necessary during all the time of the treatment that you lie on both sides and adjust the medicines that are placed on the wound.
And if the stone is small and is in the bladder, and it is fixed there, and urination is obstructed, then treat it with water that I have recommended before it becomes dry, because too much treatment by this method has been accused of causing dryness; and I have tested this, which is that you take an iron awl of this kind:
"Of a triangular extremity, sharp, placed in wood.
Then take a needle and bind it to the rod under the stone so that it does not return to the bladder.
Then introduce the needle into the rod, piercing with ease until the perforator reaches that stone. And turn the perforator with your hand in that stone little by little, and you pierce its opening until you make it penetrate through to the other side; because the urine is immediately released.
Then press your hand on what is smooth of the stone outside the rod, because that is blocked and filled with urine, and the patient is healed.
But if this treatment is not suitable for you for any reason that prevents it, then bind a thread under the stone, and another thread on top of the stone. Then knot it on the stone in that rod between the two ligatures. Then remove that. Then unbind the ligature and cleanse the congealed blood that is formed in the wound.
And it is not necessary to bind a thread under the stone, except so that it does not return to the bladder, and the other thread on top, because when the thread is untied near the edge of the stone, the chain returns to its place and covers the wound.
And for this reason it is necessary for you to lift the flap above so that you can raise the chain above the parts or return your compliment and collect the disease as we have said.
Chapter 61
On the removal of stones from women.
Stones in women are rarely formed.
But if any woman has stones, then the cure is difficult and it is forbidden by many means.
One of them is that the woman should be very strong and pure.
And the second is that you will not find a woman who knows herself well enough to tell the doctor when she is chaste or if she has had a husband.
The third is that you will not find a woman who knows this art well, especially the operation with the hand.
And the fourth is that the place of incision for stones in women is far from the place of the stone, so that you need to use deep incisions, and therein lies fear.
But if necessity compels you to this, then you must take a woman doctor who is very skilled, and she is rarely found.
But if you are deprived of such a woman doctor, then seek out a skilled and subtle doctor, or present a well-educated midwife who is experienced with women's affairs, or a woman who has some knowledge of this art.
Therefore, present this object to him and command him to perform all that you ask of him, from the investigation on the stone to its beginning; the reason for which is to check if the woman is a virgin, in which case he should insert his finger into her anus and search for the stone.
Therefore, if it is found, cut it off with your finger, then command him to press on that area.
But if she is not a virgin, then command the midwife to insert her finger into the patient's vagina and search for the stone, while placing her left hand on the bladder and press it with good force.
Therefore, if it is found, it is necessary to gradually extract it from the bladder opening towards the outside until it reaches the vaginal opening.
And then press on the upper part of the vagina at its opening, wherever it may be in relation to the patient's body, and keep the stone there until the finger is removed from the stone while cutting it out.
The initial cut should be small; then insert the reed into that incision, and if you feel the stone, widen the incision according to the size of the stone so that it can come out.
"And know that the species of stones are numerous, for they vary in size and shape, some being large and smooth, others rough and sharp, with certain ones being long and round, and having ridges.
"Therefore you should know that there are many types of him for this reason: he indicates what you want with signs.
"And if you see blood flowing, place powdered vitriol on the area and keep it there for an hour until the bleeding stops. Then return to your procedure until the stone is expelled.
"And prepare with you the instruments that are listed for the extraction of stones in men, so that you may be assisted by them during your procedure.
"And if you see blood flowing and know that the bleeding is from a severed artery, then place powder on the area and compress it firmly with bandages and stricture until it stops; do not attempt to remove the stone, for the patient will quickly die. "Then treat the wound.
"Therefore, once the bleeding has stopped after several days and the area has healed, you may resume your procedure until the stone is expelled.
This is not a full sentence but rather a chapter heading or title. "Capitol" seems to be derived from the Latin word "capitulum," which means "chapter." Therefore, "Capitol lxii" likely translates to "Chapter 62.
This sentence can be translated as:
Hernia aquosa is nothing more than an accumulation of moisture in the white pouch, which is below the testicles containing the semen, and it is called the pouch.
Sometimes it is in the proper scrotum that nature has prepared for him to hold the semen until another semen comes; and it is the testicle between the white pouch which we have mentioned, and it is not this but late.
And the cause of this hernia is weakness that occurs in the testicles, because to them this material is infused, and sometimes it happens due to a blow on the testicles.
And this moisture has many colors, because its color can be yellowish or bloody red, or rusty, or black and foul-smelling, or white and watery, and it is the latter that is most common.
And the signs by which one knows this accumulation of water are these: because if it is in the white pouch which we have mentioned, then the swelling is round and slightly elongated like a figure of an egg, and the testicle appears, because the humidity surrounds that from all sides.
And if the moisture is in the proper adipose tissue, then the abscess is round with a central cavity, and for this reason it is considered to be another form of egg.
And if the moisture is between the kidneys and the white matter, then it should be left alone to heal on its own.
And if you want to know the color of the moisture, then examine the color of the moisture in the abscess with a glass test tube; and according to what appears in the residue of the test tube, judge what is inside it.
Therefore, when it comes to treating the patient with iron, it is necessary to order the patient to be bled if possible for you, and then purge their body.
And then let the patient lie on their back with their feet raised somewhat, and place under them soft cloths.
And then sit on the patient's left side, and instruct the assistant to stand on the right side of the patient, who will extend their hand to one of two sides at the kidneys and the midline of the abdomen.
And then take a flat spatula and split the kidney's skin down the middle, as far as the navel.
And let the section be made according to rightness and equally distant from the line that should extend along the pubic area until it reaches the white circle encompassing it.
And scrape it off, and observe, and be cautious not to cut into it; and your scraping with which you scrape should continue until it is suspended by the most subtle scrutiny of the scraping according to the amount possible for you.
And then puncture the circle full of water with a wide puncture, and extract all the water.
And then separate between the two lips of the section with scissors, and extend the circle toward the divided parts above; and do not touch the cord surrounding the genitals, and cut the circle in such a way that it is possible for you. And cut it entirely or in pieces, and especially its subtle side, for if you do not scrutinize the cutting of it carefully, it is not certain that the water will not return.
But if the cord protrudes from its sheath at the time of your operation, then after you have completed the section of the circle, return it inside, and then suture the two lips of the genital cord, and then heal that as well as the other wounds, until it is healed.
And if you find the egg corrupted by another illness, then it is necessary that you cut the vessels that are on the membrane, and extract the egg, and then cure it with the water that we have mentioned.
But if the water is divided into two parts equally, then you know that there are two hernias; therefore, cut that part just as you did the other one; and if it seems to be one operation to you, then do it.
Then you clean away the blood, and between the sections place wool soaked in oil or hot oil. And place another piece of wool that has been soaked in wine and oil outside; and spread it over two cushions and the navel of the abdomen; and cover it with folded cloths and pillows, and tie those together with a bandage in this manner:
And then two pieces of cloth should be taken and soaked in wool as follows: and the ends should be made with which it is pressed against the flesh or wet wool, and they should be added with tightness to the groin of the underwear, and one end takes from the buttocks inside to the back, and the second takes to the place of the scrotum, and two ends below on two cushions and two other ends on two bolsters, and all the pressure is adjusted in the groin of the underwear.
It seems like the text is describing a procedure for treating a hernia with cauterization instead of surgery. Let's break it down line by line: It appears to be Greek letters.
Then perforate it with that instrument, and let it burn until all the humidity is expelled.
Then extend the instrument with tongs, and scrape it with tongs, and scrape it with a fine burning cautery; and cut that according to what is possible for you until you eradicate all of it; and beware of the fire so that it does not touch you.
And know that this operation is safer and longer lasting against blood flow, and better than the operation with cutting.
But if you encounter an abscess during the time of cutting or burning, or blood flow, then it is necessary for you to treat whatever opposition arises in this way, with the care that is appropriate for it as it has been said.
But if the patient is weak and does not expect to survive the second operation due to its horribleness, then administer a perforation as I recommend this; and it is when you are certain, by what we have said about the signs, that that hernia is watery.
Then it is necessary for you to make the patient sit on some high cushion, then perforate the abscess in its lowest part with a wide spatula, and leave the perforation according to the length of the body.
And it should be opened wide so that all the water can flow out.
And then place something over the area to absorb and remove any remaining water. And then care for it until the wound is healed.
But if there is resistance to the exit of water at that time, you should puncture it: and this is done only because the white membrane in the orifice of the wound hinders and prevents the exit of water. Therefore, you must insert into the wound a pen or instrument with which water is extracted from drops, as described earlier; or adjust a small tube in the opening of the wound.  (Note: "le pannicol blanc" likely refers to what we now call fascia, a thin white membrane that covers muscles and organs.)
And know that the water may return, and it can be accumulated for about six months or a year; and when it is accumulated, then it should be punctured in the same manner, because the patient will thus extend their life.
Chapter 63.
On incision for a flesh-covered hernia and its treatment.
Know that in the incision of this type of hernia, there is great danger in the major structures; therefore, I have seen its removal and being saved by this method.
And I am recalling the procedure for that and the types of aposteme.
Therefore, I say that apostemes are born in the bodies of those whose humors are corrupted, and this happens for many reasons: either due to an acute bitter superfluity, which is poured into the humors, or due to trauma.
And its color corresponds to that of the body, and it does not cause pain, indicating a serious aposteme.
A strong and light one is called a lithified aposteme, whose color is dark, and it is insensitive.
And sometimes it is caused by the swelling of the arteries, and by the inflammation of those so that its memory is already perceived, or by the inflammation of veins.
But what is caused by the inflammation of the arteries is known by the dispersion of the aposteme when you press it with your fingers; and it should not be touched.
But that which is caused by the inflammation of veins does not disperse at all due to any pressure with your fingers.
And it is possible to perform a section on this type and on other tissues; and that you incise the sheath of the humors, and then extend the hole to the parts above, and extract that which is white, and deliver the suspensory ligaments of the vessels, and tie them, and incise the ligaments after you have delivered it from all parts of the egg.
If the flesh has already hardened with those meats, then it is necessary for you to remove the meat and inject it again.
If there is an adhesion due to any cause of the hernia, or between the parts that are between the muscles, then it is necessary for you to remove all that adhesion and inject it with a round injection.
But if there is a growth of flesh in the place of the adhesion which is behind, then it is necessary for you to inject all that is from it, and remove the meat as we have said.
Therefore, when your operation is completed, then fill the wound with lanolin infused in rose oil and wine; and afterwards care for it with another treatment until it is healed.
Chapter LXIV.
About the treatment of a hernia caused by wind.
Wind is an abscess wrapped in some wrapping similar to a sprout with the softening of the testicles, and it makes difficult movements and walking for the patient.
And in the treatment of this illness, one should be mindful of what comes before it.
Nevertheless, we must say operation on that according to what was done by the first [doctors].
And I say that it is necessary to seat the patient on an elevated chair; and then unfasten the suspenders of the testicles from the lower parts; and then take the girdle of the genitals with your words, which have been proven in the penis; and let those other ministers that you have extend them with great extension.
And then make an incision with a sharp, thin blade through the right side of the vessels until the vessels are exposed.
And then scrape off all parts in the same way as we have said in the extraction of arrows which are in the temples.
And then place a needle in it, which has a double thread, and tie the first one at the beginning of the places where the injury occurred, and tie another time at the end of them. And then make a straight incision in the middle of those places according to the length of the body, and extract what is added from the foul and corrupt humors.
And then treat the wound with the treatment of other wounds in which you want health to be generated, so that the vessels that connect one of two genitals may fall away, for it is not a bad thing for this.
If it happens to all the vessels, then the testicles must be extracted or tied with the vessels, so that he is deprived of all nourishment due to the cutting of the vessels, and thus they will shrink, or tied for this reason, so that he cannot have intercourse with those.
Capítulo LXV
On the care of intestinal hernias.
The occurrence of this hernia is due to a section that extends in the abdomen from the lower parts of the intestines, because some of the intestines descend from that rupture and fall into the scrotum or the labia majora.
And this rupture occurs either in the abdomen or in its extension, and these two types occur for various reasons: by blows, jumps, shouts, lifting of some heavy object, or similar things.
And the sign of this, when it is by extension of the abdomen, is that it occurs gradually over a long time, and does not occur suddenly, and it is a swelling that is inside the peritoneum because the abdomen presses on the intestine.
And the sign of it is when it is by rupture of the abdomen, because at the beginning it causes sudden and severe pain; and it is a swelling that appears below the navel, and this is due to the protrusion of the intestine, and its body is outside the abdomen.
And sometimes the tunic is also protruded with the intestine, and this type of intestinal hernia is called scrotal.
And sometimes it is caused by flatulence, and sometimes the intestine may rupture, causing great harm to the patient, and sometimes it leads to severe pain, especially when pressed.
And in the treatment of this type of illness with iron, there is fear, because it is necessary to avoid the blow in that area.
And the way to operate is to instruct the patient to return the intestine with their hand to its inner parts if they comply with the retraction, and then place yourself over their neck between your hands, and lift their legs.
Then stretch the spermatic cord, which is the cord of the testicles above, and cut through the entire length of the spermatic cord; then insert two needles into the lips of the incision according to how much you need to open the incision with them.
And if, according to the quantity that you can manage, from there the wound is enlarged.
Then scrape away that tissue which is below the spermatic cord, until the hard white tissue from each part is revealed.
The given sentence appears to describe a medical procedure involving the testicle (testicol) and surrounding areas. Let's break it down line by line:
And then, with your left hand, take the cord of the testicles outside to the divided part, and with this, extend the white cloth in your left hand, and lift the egg with the cloth to the sectioned part; and command the assistant to extend the egg further, and you dissolve the adhesion that is behind it with a complete solution.
And be sure to tell them that there should be no reason for the intestine to be wrapped in the white cloth. But if you find any such cause, then peel it off from the belly immediately.
And then incise in the area below the neck of the testicles so that blood and pus flow out, as we have recommended in what has been said.
And then apply wool soaked in oil to the wound and place it there; and administer the blanket we have recommended (and sometimes the white cloth is cauterized, which we said after the incision to prevent bleeding, because often this happens) and leave the blanket until it falls off by itself.
But if the falling off is delayed, then dip it in hot water and place it on there until it falls off as we have said.
And then treat the wound with the other wound treatment until it is healed.
Chapter LXVI.
Of a hernia with a cavity or pouch.
In this type of hernia, it is not advisable to attempt treatment with iron.
And the first ones said that it is done like this as we have recounted in the case of a hernia with six; which is that you lift the vessels near the incision with ease for him; and then cut in the middle place around the abscess with water that opens it, until the vessels fall.
And cure the wound as we have said until it is healed.
Chapter 67.
About the dislocation that occurs in the elbows.
Sometimes there is a rupture in the elbows as we have said, and you should elevate the area.
And do not allow the genitals any cause of concern for the intestines; and if they do, it is little; and it returns in all cases.
But if the time is prolonged with this, there will be a narrow split in the intestine until the intestine descends into the intestine; and this happens due to the extension of the intestine which is in the elbows as we have said, which causes the intestine to be extended, and then it becomes softened and the area becomes inflamed and elevated.
And its cure is with a cautery as was previously stated in this account.
And sometimes it is cured with iron according to this method: and it is that the patient lies on their back between your hands, and then dry the area of the rupture of the prominent aposteme by section with a lancet according to the quantity of three words.
And then strengthen the white bandage that is under the collar until it is revealed.
Then take the cloth and place it over the prominent part of the bandage, and press it against the patient's belly.
Then sew the two prominent points at the end of the bandage together with stitches.
Then remove the end of the cloth, and do not cut all the bandage, nor extend it, nor for any other cause as I will make you understand in the treatment of intestinal hernia.
Then treat it with the treatment for wounds, and when you cut the threads, clean it and restore the wound until it is healed; because the bandage is tightened and the prominence of the rupture is not adjusted.
Cauterization is better in this case, as it is closer to recovery.
Chapter 68.
About softening the scrotum of the testicles.
Many times the scrotum of the testicles in some men is softened because the flesh that is between them is softened, and it is said to be healed.
Therefore, it is necessary for the one who is in charge of his cure to make the patient lie down according to their constitution, and raise all the softened part above the natural scrotum; then he should join the two lips with stitches.
And if you wish, in the beginning you can cauterize the superfluity of the softened scrotum with three or four cautions and a firm stitching.
Then raise between the stitches, and then treat with cures for other diseases until it is healed and the threads fall out.
Chapter 69
About castration.
Know that castration in our law is forbidden, but I have heard of it for reasons that I remember here in this book; and the remembrance of it is not necessary except in two ways. One way is so that this is in the knowledge of the doctor when he is asked about it, that he knows the cure for those to whom it happens; and the other way is that we have often had need of castration of other animals for our benefit from them, such as mules, and goats, and pigs, and similar animals.
And so I say that castration is done in two ways: either by traction or by incision and amputation.
But in the case done by traction, the procedure is that we castrate the animal in hot water until its testicles are softened and loosened and hang down. Then take those with your hand until they are resolved and do not appear below the touch.
But in castration done by incision and amputation, it is necessary that you hold the animal and press its tail with your left hand.
Then tie off the suspensory ligaments, and make an incision on each testicle with a scissor until two testicles are processed.
Then cut those afterwards that you will have skinned each one. And do not leave on those any scab, except a subtle one which is over the vessels.
And this method of castration is better which is done by traction, because traction leaves little or no cause for the testicles to cause the animal to desire heat [i.e., it reduces the risk of infection and inflammation].
Then heal the wound until it is healed.
**Capítulo 70** (or Chapter 70)
Of the treatment of hermaphrodites.
Hermaphroditism in men occurs in two ways: one is when a scrotum appears between the testicles, which resembles a woman's vulva and contains pubic hair.
And sometimes, from that area, urine is excreted into the space between the testicles.
In women, however, it takes on another form: the woman's vulva appears as two male testicles, slightly smaller than the average size, with an exterior appearance similar to a man's foreskin and two testicles.
And the treatment is of three kinds: two for men and one for women. And it is necessary that you cut off those attached tissues until the swelling subsides, and then treat them as you would for other diseases.
And in the second type of men, where urine exits into the space between the testicles, there is no cure or operation for him.
**Chapter 21**
Of lumps and swellings caused by women.
Here's a line-by-line translation of the given text:
This is an intriguing text! Based on the given lines, I will make an educated guess at the translation for the provided sentence:
And do not stop at the incision, especially in the region of the vein, to prevent blood from flowing out.
Then treat it with treatment for wounds until it is healed.
However, flesh born is flesh that does not originate from the horror of the mother until it fills that, and it exits easily through the openings outside according to its own appearance (and for this reason some call it "tail sickness"); therefore we must cut it in the same way as we cut the lens, and treat it until it is healed.
Chapter 72
On the treatment of arthritis.
Arthritis is when the vagina of a woman is not pierced, or has a small opening. And it can be either natural or accidental.
Accidental is due to an illness that has occurred beforehand, and this can be caused by flesh that is not well-adjusted or by a subtle or thick membrane.
And it can occur in the region of the mother, or in the ribs, or in the upper part of the uterus, or in the lower part of the uterus, and it prevents intercourse and conception and childbirth, and it strongly prevents menstruation.
And the recognition of that is done by examining the womb, if the swelling is apparent, then it's likely; but if not, then you should search for it with your words or with the ray.
But if the swelling is slight and close to both lips, then you cut and break it open.
And it is that you place over the two lips a powder, and then place your index fingers on both at once.
And the woman should be on her back, with her legs spread apart, and then you spread both lips with force until that subtle swelling is broken open and the swelling is exposed.
And then you take wool and dip it in oil and place it on the area, and have a man guard it during the day so that the cut does not become infected.
But if the swelling is large and thick, then you should cut it with a lancet or with a myrtle leaf.
But if the swelling is due to an abscess, then suspend it with a hook, and cut it open.
And with you should be the medicines that stop bleeding without causing pain, such as aloes, dragon's blood, and sumac, mixed with egg white.
And then administer a wide lead tube so that the wound is not lightly healed.
And keep it there for some days and apply linen bandages to it dryly.
And then be cured with the other remedy of healing until it is healed.
And sometimes it happens during childbirth with other flesh, and then you should proceed according to this manner. But if it is due to cancerous apostemes, the cancerous aposteme that is in the mother should not be treated in any way with iron.
Chapter 73.
On the treatment of hemorrhoids and tail, and red inflammation that occurs in women's vagina.
Hemorrhoids are appreciated from the openings of many veins, through which flows much continuous blood; and as old hemorrhoids become inflamed they form piles.
And I have already said in the division the species of those and their signs, and I will say which ones receive treatment and which do not. 》
Therefore I say that hemorrhoids and inflammations when they are in the womb of the mother and do not appear to the touch, then no treatment with iron should be done on them.
Here's a line-by-line translation of the given text:
Here's the translation of the given sentence:
And then sprinkle on those wounds the powder from one of the pouches without biting, such as cassia and similar ones.
Then unwrap your feet for an hour, and then place them in cold water.
And if the flow of blood persists, then make that person sit in a decoction of sumac, pomegranate peels, walnuts, and similar things.
Then take barley flour and mix it with honey and vinegar, and make a poultice with water on the patient's back.
And if the blood is stopped, that is good; and if not, apply two cupping glasses to the breasts without scarification.
Then take wool and soak it in coriander juice, or in orange juice, or in rosemary juice with vinegar, and apply it to the area; then treat the area with ointment until it is healed.
And treat it until it is healed.
Chapter 74.
About the perforation of the intestines occurred in the mother.
Many types of boils occurred in the mother, such as carbuncles and abscesses that are livid, ulcerous, abscessed, herpetiform, fistulous, hemorrhoidal, gouty, and other kinds of boils. And I have already mentioned these diseases and the types of them and their signs, and their treatments in the division.
And it is fitting that I say in this treatise about the boil called carbuncle which occurs in the mother when it is one of the types of boils that collect pus, and if you want to know how its operation is done with iron.
Therefore it is necessary that you consider if the pain of the boil in its beginning is acute with pulsation and phlegm and fever, and sometimes reddening appears on it, and if pressing on it causes pain, then do not attempt to perforate it, and heal it with a remedy that helps in maturation until the acuity of the accidents ceases.
And then it is necessary that you make the woman sit on two cushions; and lean her back and align her legs below her stomach, with her thighs spread apart, and place her arms under her knees, and bind each [arm] with a suitable bandage.
And then the midwife should follow the straight and left path, and with the instrument with which she opened the mother's orifice, whose form will come from those that are done now.
And you should place the ray (tip) of this instrument into the womb of the woman, and ensure that what enters from the instrument into the womb is not more than the womb's capacity, and leave the patient like that. But if the instrument is larger than the womb's capacity, then you should place a cloth or pad over the surface of the womb to prevent the entry of any instrument into the womb.
And it is necessary that you place the thread that runs along the left side of the instrument and that the practitioner holds the instrument and turns the thread until the mother's orifice is opened.
And when the protrusion appears and is touched by hand and is soft and wet, then you should dry it with a Latin spatula (a type of surgical instrument).
And when the blood has been evacuated, then you should place a cloth soaked in rose oil or green oil, which contains some styptic properties, on the wound; and place a compress in the cavity of the womb.
And place outside the door and on the pillow clean wool soaked in water, in which there are boiled mallows.
And then it should be treated for about two days with an ointment that needs to be applied until it is healed.
And sometimes the wound and the place are washed with water and honey until they are cleansed, and then with water in which there is boiled root of iris or long-tailed sparrowwort, and then return to using the ointment.
And if the wound is deep in the flesh, then it is necessary that you be forbidden from treating him with iron, having care with water as we said in the division.
Chapter 75
To teach midwives how to treat difficult births when the baby is in a breech position according to the unnatural figure.
It is necessary that the midwife know at the beginning the natural figure of childbirth by its signs, and it is that when you see the woman pushing with her legs and desires to smell the air, and over this she is relieved because of what is happening to her during labor, and hastens the exit of the baby, then you should know that this birth is in a natural figure, and it is the exit of the baby by its head, and the second part hanging or dangling from the navel.
When you see these signs, it is necessary to compress the stomach so that the embryo descends gently because when they come over its head, give it the second blow and cleanse it of those excesses with a good purgative.
But what comes out of this part is unnatural and inauspicious, because when the embryo comes out feet first and the body follows the head and feet, or one hand is at the foot or the head comes out with the hand at the belly, it has quickly turned onto its neck, and the figure resembles that of an inauspicious birth.
It is therefore necessary for the midwife to be wise and knowledgeable in all these causes, and to guard against mistakes and deception.
And I am showing you all the figures of these, and what their meaning is so that they can be indicated by this and have been written about this.
When the child comes out head first by natural progression, and it is difficult for the woman and the child's strength is already weakened, then do this: have the women hold the child, and evaporate its head with a mixture of fenugreek and moistened oil.
And then insert the midwife's hand between the patient's thighs, using her little spatula to open and separate the lips. If necessary, use your nail to push until the fluid inside is released. And press on the woman's belly until she delivers the child.
But if she does not deliver, then the woman must be anointed with a mixture of little chickpeas and fenugreek seeds, ground together.
And then order her, and immediately anoint her, to be compressed and make her sneeze with this mixture; and hold her mouth and nose closed for one hour, because the child will be expelled soon after.
And if both hands of the child have been delivered first, then you should reduce them gently little by little. But if the child does not obey the treatment, then place the woman on a stool and lift her feet up, and then drop the stool onto the ground; and ensure that the woman is held so that she does not fall due to the shock.
And if the hands are not turned back and the child dies, then cut them off and extract the fetus or tie its body to its hand with a cloth and pull it out evenly, because it will be expelled that way.
"When the blood appears on its feet, then you should prick those (feet) and make the blood flow out, and then bandage it, and then take one of its feet and stretch it little by little.
"But when it (the blood) has gone into its tissues, then you should command it to expel (the blood), and make it sneeze with conditions, because it will be forgotten if God wills.
"And if it is not forgotten with the above remedies, then you should return the blood little by little until you place it according to its natural shape, because it will be forgotten at that point with a light flow.
"And if it is forbidden by all that we have mentioned, then take of the musk mallow and dissolved gum, and crush them together in the mortar with good pounding, and then apply it to the woman's vulva, below the man's belly. "And then make her sit in warm water until she reaches the hypochondriac region.
"And when you see that the affected areas have softened, then give him a fumigation of myrtle and place it under his feet. And when you have performed the sublimation for an hour, then make them sit on a stool, and promptly make them sneeze and clear their mouth, and lift them up, and press the lowest part of their belly with gentle compression, because this makes the wind pass immediately.
Here is the translation of the given sentence: Here's my attempt at translating the given sentence:
And if he cannot walk, then make him lie down on the bed, and strike his body firmly with blows, and immediately administer liniments that are recommended for inflammations.
If labor has begun, then make her sit on the chair, and promptly observe the progress of the hand (or birth), and guide the child according to its natural position, and make the woman sneeze, and command that she bear down upon herself until it is delivered.
As soon as the child emerges from the womb, spread its hands and place his face on the back of his mother. The midwife should take the child's hand and gently turn it little by little, until it comes out easily.
And when the child is born and guided, then place on its head that which we have recommended of oil and liniments (or ointments). ⇒ And when the child has been born and guided, then place on its head the oil and ointment mixture that has been recommended.
Then command her to push little by little, and when you have done this, then make her sit on a chair and command her to lean over the right side, and immediately command her to bear down; and make her sneeze with conditions (or under certain circumstances). Based on the context of medieval medical treatises and the similarity to Latin, Italian, Spanish, and French, here's a line-by-line translation of the given text:
When they appear to be terrified of the mother according to this method, consider, and then you should cut the newborn's nails with your fingernail until it is drained of moisture.
And if the baby is hanging over its face and neck, then you should cut the navel cord to prevent it from being strangled and dying.
Then quickly wrap the baby in blankets to keep it warm, and instruct the woman to drink some water. The father should then lightly blow air onto the baby, if God wills it.
The birth of twins or multiple fetuses. Know that twins are born after many waters, and sometimes three or four may be born, but this is strange and late; there are five causes for this, both natural and unnatural.
Here are those causes, whether they are multiplied, a second umbilical cord, and are separated by membranes, distinguishing them by the ligament in each of their navels. And sometimes they come out like one baby through natural birth, and sometimes they come out through an unpraiseworthy birth, as we have mentioned.  />
And if there are difficulties during childbirth and it results in what we have said about unnatural figures, then you should care for them in the way that we have related.
And if the midwife is skillful and performs her task with ease and subtlety, and patience, and is skilled according to every figure as it is prepared by the skill of nature leading to health.
Recollection of that which forms in the womb from embryos and are aborted.
Sometimes formations in the mother are one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, even ten or more. I have verified that a woman has aborted and given birth to six, and another ten all formed, which was caused by the measurement of the glorious wise men.
And all this should be in the knowledge of the midwife because she quickly recognizes that appearance and therefore prepares herself for it as is necessary.
Chapter 76
On extracting the dead fetus.
When you treat the dead fetus as we have said in the division of treatment and it has not yet come out, and you are forced to use manual operation, then you should consider if the woman is of sound constitution and is not subject to any of the conditions by which loss is feared for her.
Here's a line-by-line translation of the given sentence:
And the attendant should hold it in two places or bind it with a rope to prevent his body from spreading before the removal of the object.
And then you should moisten the mother's mouth with oils, mulled wine, althea, fenugreek and linseed.
And then the midwife should anoint her hand with those oils and wines, and then she should gently insert her hand into the mother, and then search with her hand for the place where the fingernails are on the fetus.
In these cases: then you should consider if the fetus is prepared to come out head first, and in that case, you should place your fingernails on its heels, or neck, or mouth, or palate, or under the chin, or on the breastbone, or near the ribs, or below the hypochondrium.
But if it is coming out feet first, then in the heel or the middle of the back.
And it is necessary to hold the nails with the right hand and place the curvature of it in that place which is between the fingers of the left hand, and gently insert the hand until the fingernails are placed in one of those places that we have mentioned, until it reaches the cause of obstruction.
And then place and remain in the position of the patient another cushion, or a third if necessary, so that it is an attraction equal to both sides, and not an extension according to its straightness only.
And let it be raised on all sides, so that the removal of it is eased as is done in a tooth when it is extracted from him/her.
And it is necessary in him/her that what is between them (the parts) be softened; and if any part of him/her is retained, then the midwife should anoint some of her fingers with oil and introduce them gently and turn with those waters that are retained.
Therefore, if the part of the child is forgotten (left behind), then the fingers should be changed with one that is more suitable; and do this until all of the child is forgotten (delivered).
However, if the hand is protruded before the other and it is not possible to reduce it because of its thickness, then a cloth should be wrapped around that (hand); and then draw it out until all is delivered, and afterwards cut it either in the joint of the hand or in the elbow.
And so you must do with the other hand and with both feet.
Sure, I'd be happy to help translate that passage for you. Here it goes:
"And likewise if the condition is caused by natural greatness of the head: then it's necessary to make an incision with a trephine, or take out some bone with forceps as we've said.
"And if the head is swollen and constricted, you should use a trephine to make an incision until the liquid in the feet has been released.
"But if it is not complicated and does not respond to swelling, then you should make an incision in the head as soon as possible.
"And if the sides of the abdomen are swollen or have dropsy, then you should pierce them until the liquid drains out.
"But if the condition is on its feet, then the attraction of it is light and the direction towards the mother's mouth is light.
"But if the abdomen and feet are swollen, then you should extract it with a cloth wrapped around your hand, and cut open the abdomen and feet until the liquid comes out.
"But if the other members are absent and the head returns, then the midwife should insert her left hand; but if the mother's mouth is open, then she should insert her hand into the baby's chest, search for the head with it, pull it towards the mother's mouth with those words, and then insert one or two fingers into the baby, pulling it out with them.
Here's my translation of the sentence: And apply plasters; and follow the patient with waters that soften and moisturize.
And if it is on the side of the body, if possible, let it be punctured; and administer the water we mentioned for living wounds.
And if it is not possible to do so, then cut it into pieces and remove it.
And it is important that you leave no cause behind in the second intestine.
And when you have completed your entire operation, then administer the water that we mentioned for the care of the abscesses that occur from the mother [wound].
And if there is a flow of blood, then immerse in astringent waters and administer the other treatment.
And I have already seen a woman in whose womb there was a dead child, and then above that fire another one entangled, and then the other child is also dead. It happened to him that he had a long-standing abscess in his navel; and it swelled inside until the fire burst out, and he began to throw arms.
And I was called for his care, and treated him for a long time, but the wound did not heal.
It seems the text is discussing a medical procedure related to removing bones or foreign objects from a patient's body. Here’s a line-by-line translation:
And then I thought that they belonged to the bones of the dead man.
Therefore, I investigated the wound and extracted some bones from him, the woman being in his same condition, and they had lived together in this manner for a long time; I cut off one of his arms.
And I did not find this to be strange, for in this there is science and help for what the doctor accomplishes with his hands in administering care.
About the shapes of the instruments that are necessary for extracting the fetus.
The shape of the hook used to open the mother's cervix:
This is the shape of a stretcher on which the books are tied, and at the ends of these two feet there are two hooks. However, this hook should be more delicate than strict, and it should be made of either ebony or boxwood.
And the thickness of each piece should be two fingers, and the margin of each one should be two fingers wide; the length of each one is a hand and a half; and in the middle of these two pieces there are two fittings of the same wood which are already fixed, whose length is half a palm or more, and the thickness of each is about two fingers or slightly more.
And these two additional elements should be inserted into the mother's mouth so that she is open with them when you turn the two prescribed screws.
Another similar form, but more subtle and lighter.
It should be made from ebony or boxwood, according to the likeness of forceps. However, at the end of it are two elements as you see, and the length of these elements is about one hand span, and the width of each is two fingers.
And when you want to open the mother with them, then make the woman lie on her back with her feet hanging off the bed, opening what is between her thighs. And then open your hand with the instrument in the same way as you do with forceps, according to the amount you want of the opening of the mother's mouth until the midwife does what she wants.
The form of a screw which they used to call:
A pushing form with which the feat is pushed out.
A pushing form, with which the large head is pushed out.  This translation assumes "amisidat" is a misspelling of "empellent", and "cap gran" refers to the baby's head. If you have more context or specific translations for these words, please let me know!
This sentence seems to describe a tool or instrument that is compared to forceps. Let's break it down: "Form of a small amount" or "Small quantity form.
"The shape of a finger having a thorn." This could be interpreted as "The shape of a finger that has a thorn" or "The shape resembling a finger with a thorn.
"Form of two fingers having two thorns." This could mean the form or shape of something similar to two fingers each with one thorn. Alternatively, it might refer to a shape that is like two fingers back-to-back and with a single thorn on each side.
"Form of a spatula with two ends, with which the head is cut off." This describes a shape similar to a spatula with two ends, used for cutting off the head. ›
"Form of two wide spatulas." This describes a shape that resembles two broad or wide spatulas.
"All of these instruments are practiced, and the more varieties there are of them and the better they are prepared by craftsmen, the easier it is for their operation and the more useful they are to men due to their quantity.
"And do not lack these instruments wherever you may be, for the need of them cannot be excused." This means that it is essential to always have these instruments available, as they are indispensable.
"About extracting the placenta." This likely refers to a medical procedure or method used to deliver the placenta after childbirth.
"When the placenta is retained after birth, then you must command the patient to hold her breath, and then make her sneeze with conditions, and strengthen your hand over her mouth and nose, and if by this it comes out, good." This describes a method for helping a woman expel the retained placenta by making her hold her breath and sneeze.
And otherwise, then you take a cloth and pierce in the cover a hole and place in that [hole] burning herbs such as calament, rue, anise, chamomile, dried Arabian grapes, cassia wood, and centaury. All of these herbs or some of them should be immersed in water in the bowl, and place that [bowl] over the fire.
Then place a reed tube in the mouth of the patient, and hold it there until the vapor reaches the cavity of the patient.
And then make them sneeze as we have said, and on the second night it will be expelled quickly.
But if this treatment continues and the second night has not been expelled, then you should order the midwife to submerge her left hand in sesame oil or mullein infusion, and then insert that [hand] into the vulva, searching for the second night with it. And when you have found it, then take hold of it and extract it little by little. But if it is attached inside the patient's womb, then insert your hand as we have recommended, and when you find the second night, draw it out slowly according to rectitude so that the patient does not suffer a violent contraction. Before it is necessary that the right and left ribs are moved with ease.
And if the mother's mouth is closed, we have already counted the cure with suction and with a remedy of oil with herbs.
But if it is not removed with all the causes that we have counted, then be careful not to work on it in repetition of abstraction, but rather let what comes out of him into the mother's mouth lie on the woman's thigh, and then anoint it with ointment and tetrapharmacon; for this will cause it to dry up within a few days and will be dissolved and removed.
But when it dries up, there is a very bad influence on the head and stomach, and this harms the patient; therefore, at that point, it is necessary to administer fumigations and appropriate things for this.
But some of the Ancients have already proven the use of fumigation with nard and dried figs.
The form of the instrument with which the woman is fumigated should be for the retention of menstruation and of the afterbirth:
"It should be made of glass or silver.
And let the delicate end be placed in the bowl and the wide end over the fire, and the sublimation flask should be placed on the coals of the fire.
And hold that until this sublimate is consumed and then repeat with another.
"About the treatment of a child's non-perforated anus.
If an infant is born and his anus is not perforated, which is a subtle and closed issue. Then the midwife should perforate this closure with her finger; and if not, she can use a sharp stick to perforate it, taking care not to touch the intestine.
And then place wool soaked in wine and oil on that area; and then treat it with an ointment until it is healed.
But if you fear that it will close again, then place a catheter in the opening for many days, and remove it when the child wants to defecate.
And if the closure of the anus is caused by scar tissue or an abscess, then that scar tissue must be cut open, and then it should be treated as we have said before about healing and lead.
About the treatment of fistulas that occur below.
The fistulas that occur in the lower part are nodes and growths which occur near the anus outside or in the space of one part.
And it is a fistula or fleshy growths.
And when that node becomes chronic and produces a thin, white watery moisture or fine pus, and sometimes some of these fistulas penetrate into each other.
And those penetrations are known by what comes out of them through the exit and due to flatulence; and sometimes the patient uses that opening, and easily worms come out of it.
And sometimes these fistulas in the space penetrate into the bladder and into the hole of the penis; and sometimes those penetrations enter the joint of the thigh and into the sack of the testicle.
And how a penetrating fistula into the anus and non-penetrating is known is that you put your finger inside the anus, and introduce a thin probe of iron or silver into the fistula when it is not swollen.
But if it is swollen, then insert a thin probe of lead or horsehair into it until you feel the probe or the hair in your finger.
Based on the provided text and context, here's my attempt to translate the given sentence:
And when the fistula penetrates into the bladder or into the root of the member, then its significance is the discharge of urine from there and the prohibition against applying medicine to that place.
But if it penetrates into the joint of the hip or into the bone and causes pain in the surrounding area, then the sign is that the tent will enter here if there is no fracture in the bone, and there is pain in the surrounding part; and that from it there is always pus; and that no medicine works in this case, nor is it treated with ointment.
And in all these penetrating fistulas there is no cure for everything, and the cure of these is labor and vanity of the foolish doctors who are stubborn about them.
But in those that do not penetrate and are not ancient, healing with iron is expected, as I will tell you, and this which I have already proved.
And have the patient lie between your hands on their back and raise their legs into yours, let the thighs be inclined towards their belly, and then insert a lead probe, or iron if there is fracture in the fistula, until you know the place where the probe enters.
And if that makes the patient feel around the neck, then you should insert your finger into the neck.
And if you feel in your finger that the tent has already become exposed and penetrated on its own, or if you feel something between your finger and that, know for certain that it is penetrating; then do not work on that, because there is no healing in that, as we have said.
However, some may say that in some men it heals late.
And for the medicine by which help is hoped for him, it is that you heat up a fine cautery according to the width of the fistula, as mentioned before, and insert that heated cautery into the fistula until it reaches around the neck; then repeat this two or three times until you know that all those fleshy tissues resembling a quill are now attached.
Then wrap that in clean cloths until all the attached tissues are dry, and then treat it with medicines that promote the growth and hardening of the flesh. If it heals, good; if not, then it will never heal through any other treatment.
Based on the provided translation style and the text, here's a line-by-line translation of the given sentence:
And immediately clean those fistulated flesh parts which resemble the feather of a bird's quill, and do not leave any of them behind for any reason.
But if there is a flow of blood between you and your operation when you insert those parts of the flesh, then it is appropriate to cauterize with a pointed instrument using fire or a sharp medicine, because cautery with fire has two good habits: it tightens those parts of the flesh that are loose, and it causes the blood to dry out, eliminating moisture.
And then treat the wound by wrapping it in soft linen or cloth until it reaches the arm, and then treat the injury with ointments that promote healing and hardening of the flesh.
And such are the medicines which have astringent and drying properties; when it is restored, it is already healed and there is no fear of recurrence.
But if the fistula has already penetrated into the perineum of the anus and is prolonged on the surface of the body, then insert your finger into the anus and search with it.
And thus, if you feel the tip and there is a thin layer of tissue or flesh between it and the perineum, then do not operate on it immediately, but rather wait for the time of trust and hope.
Here's a line-by-line translation of the given text: And sometimes the fistula is finished in this manner: when you insert the probe into the fistula, and it extends from the buttocks around the surface of the body with the cord and to the margin of the anus, then take a perforated tip probe, which is like a needle used for preparing hearts in this way.
And then insert it, wrapped in five threads or around them; and then insert the probe with thread into the fistula until it reaches its cavity.
But if it penetrates deep into the anus, then you extract the thread from that hole by inserting your finger into the anus; and pull out the end of the thread and tie both ends together, tightening each one, and leave it like this for a day or two. And when the thread is more deeply embedded in the flesh, tighten it well until the flesh between the two ends of the thread is embedded and closes.
Then treat the wound until it is healed and cured.
But if the orifice of the fistula is not penetrated, then make it penetrate, in whatever way you are prepared to do so, until it is in the flesh, for it is not your task to do this so that you do not cut the skin; and then treat it with that until it is healed.
Based on the pattern and similarities to Latin, Spanish, Italian, and French, let's translate the sentence line by line:
"About stitching hemorrhoids that bleed at their onset.
"Hemorrhoids are of two kinds: those that appear in the anus like lumps of coal or those that are like raw fat. "And of these there are small and large ones, and blood always flows from them, sometimes alone, sometimes in drops, sometimes outside the anus, and at the extremities.
"However, those that are outside the anus are of three types: with little moisture, from which flows yellowish water or a little blood mixed with pus, and they differ by the color of the flesh.
"And the treatment for those that are inside the anus is to instruct the patient to sit and press until the anus comes out and the hemorrhoids appear to you. "Then take hold and suspend them with the nail of your finger, and then proceed to cut them off at their roots.
"But if the nails cannot hold them due to their moisture and softness, then take them with a rough cloth or a towel or a piece of wool, extract them with these tools, and then cut them off and sprinkle some hot powders near the incision, so that they act as a cautery; or cauterize them as previously mentioned in the chapter on cauterization. And promptly care for those with the other treatment until they are healed.
And if the anus does not obey evacuation, then cauterize the patient with a cautery that has a small bite, and wash them with the water that is in the intestines and that slightly promotes easy evacuation when the patient is pressed.
But if the hemorrhoids are outside the anus, then their cause is slight, and it is that you take them with your nail or that you take them with tweezers, and insert them, and then care for them with the water we mentioned until they are healed.
And he who has inserted, should administer suture of them in this manner: take thread wrapped and insert it into the needle and then extract the hemorrhoids from their places above, and make that penetrate with the needle into the root of the other part, and wrap the two ends of the thread around the place below the needle, and in a circular manner; and strengthen the hemorrhoid with a strong tie, and then knot the thread and extract the needle.  (This passage describes how to suture prolapsed hemorrhoids.)
And do this for all [the points], and leave one of them open and not closed, so that the excess blood can flow out from there.
And then place over the wound a cloth soaked in rose oil or wax; and place this over the wound and instruct the patient to rest. And then leave it open until it heals; and when it is healed, cure that [area] with ointment or another remedy until it is healed.
And when they are old and this remedy does not work, then it is necessary that you scrape them with the point of a spatula or with your fingernail until they become moist, and place a poultice of fresh pus over them, which prevents them from healing; and then cure them until they are healed.
Then you should remove them with a strong poultice of rotten pus as soon as they begin to heal and become raw again; and then cure them until they are healed.
Here's the translation of the given sentence:
And then it is necessary to cut away what is around the nail, and hold it with pincers or tongs, and remove it from its root; and then cure that area.
And if you wish, cauterize the surrounding area as previously mentioned in this chapter.
But a wart is a small, rough, rounded protuberance on the surface of the body, and many are seen on the hands of children.
And its treatment is to cut it open or to burn it with a hot iron or a hair inside that fits. And if you wish, cauterize it as we have said, using fire or sharp medicine.
But a mole is a small, hairy or large, rounded protuberance on the surface of the body, often on the face, and when cold affects it, it feels like a mosquito bite, occurring around the body.
And its treatment is to take a quill of an owl's feather or a vulture's feather, and it should be strong, and place it on the mole within the circle of the quill from its edges; then revolve your hand with the quill until you cut away what is around the mole, and press that into the flesh of the face, and remove the mole from its root.
"And if you wish, perform this with an iron or bronze needle according to this method:
"Ensure that the area above the needle is thin, blunt (i.e., not sharp), wrapped in such a way that the patient's grip on it is softened and its rotation facilitated.
"And if you wish, cauterize the patient as previously described in the chapter on cautery.
"Concerning the types of instruments used to administer treatment.
"At times, treatment is administered with silver, bronze, or cast iron instruments; and at other times, these instruments come in various sizes depending on their use. Those used for the care of small children should be small, and those used for patients with hemorrhoids or painful areas should also be small.
"The form of large and few treatments:
"The tip of the needle, at which the bag is attached, should be wide according to this manner; and there should be a distinction where the bag is tied as seen here.
"And the end further below, which is inserted into the anus, should be blunt (i.e., not sharp) and rather long, thinning towards the end; and on one side of the tube there should be two holes, and on the other side one hole, and the size of the hole should correspond to the thickness of the rays, a little thicker.
And let there be a pouch in which the medications of animal bladder or sheepskin are placed, and its length should be one palm.
And let it be pierced by thin tubes in the same way as they are wound; and if the space which is between the tubes, the thickness of a finger.
And then insert into those tubes a strong thread of raw silk which is from those threads, or wind around them; and fasten the pouch with it; and when the pouch is placed in it, bind its opening tightly between two sticks with a strong band, and also bind each tube with it. However, the method of binding is that you fill the pouch with the medication, which should be heated according to the tolerance of the patient; and take care that it is not too hot nor too cold.
Then let the patient lie on their back, and raise their legs above them, placing under them a board that men usually lie on, or a ladder; and then anoint the tip of the cautery with oil or egg white or fenugreek mucilage or similar; and then gently insert it into the anus; and then let the attendant take the pouch and press it with both hands and vigorously squeeze until all that is in the pouch is evacuated into the intestine; and then remove the pouch, and have the patient lift their legs to the wall.
E si la medicina forsa aquel a eyssiment,
Sure, let's break down the sentence into smaller parts and translate them:
And if in the buttocks there are hemorrhoids or infected boils, then use a very fine and thin cautery from the set of cauteries with which children are cauterized.
Of the treatment of plagues.
I have already mentioned in the division of the treatment of plagues what is suitable for this book, and now I say that the treatment should be done with the hand and with medicines according to the temperament.
Therefore, I say that plagues are classified according to their cause and the location where they occur.
And the causes by which plagues are often made are such as: a blow from a stone, or an incision with a knife or sword, or a strike with a lance, or with a stick, or with an arrow, or similar to these many causes.
But the plagues that are in specific locations of the body are such as: a plague that strikes the head, or the neck, or the foot, or the belly, or the chest, and similar to these in the limbs.
And I am describing the treatment of some plagues so that you may apply this reasoning and rule to other plagues.
E yo comenzaré con los dolores simples de la cabeza, porque el recuerdo de los dolores compuestos vendrá al principio del tercer capítulo.
I say that when a simple headache occurs and it is not a fracture, consider: if it is due to a stone or something similar, and the scalp has only been cut slightly but the pain is severe and you fear an abscess may form on that patient, then you should act quickly and perform a bloodletting of the cephalic vein immediately, without delay; and draw from him according to his strength, unless there is some reason preventing bloodletting, especially if the blood that comes out of the wound is little.
And let the bloodletting be done on the opposite side of where the head is aching; and take care that the patient avoids heaviness, fatigue, and heavy meals.
But if any cause prevents the bloodletting, then let it be reduced in food and not approach meat or wine.
And place over the wound, if an abscess forms there, a piece of linen dipped in warm oil or in wine which has been steeped.
But if it is certain that an abscess will form, then place over the wound, if it is fresh and its blood has not changed color yet, a small amount of the powder which I will mention soon.
And if the air has already changed in that region, then place some ointment on it until it is healed.
But if the wound is large or appears to be from a cut and the lips of it are not properly closed, then close them with stitches as I will describe for you.
However, if the wound is exposed to bone and marrow and there is no retention, but only a small bridge of skin, then cut that part away and cure the wound with medicines, and restore the flesh in its place as best you can. And order the patient to be fed with foods that are nourishing: meat and poultry and similar things, until it heals.
And if you find putrefaction in the flesh and it does not adhere to the bone, then cut away all that is rotten and cleanse it thoroughly, and then cure it.
But if there is an artery or vein in these wounds from which blood may flow, and it has not been severed by medicines, then you should investigate the vessel. And if you find it unsevered, then you should cut it with a spatula, or tie it off; and if necessary, you should cauterize until the bleeding stops.
And if these plagues are simple and small, then their cause is light; thus you should sprinkle this powder over them, because when it solidifies before the air changes them.
And the manner of making the powder is this: take one part of olive oil, two parts of dragon's blood, and three parts of burnt cork; let everything be well ground and sieved, and with it fill the wound, and constrict it well until it coagulates with the blood.
And then bind it on top with bandages and leave it alone, and do not remove it until it is healed, because the medicine will not have been removed from it until it has healed.
And sometimes this alone helps, when there is no olive oil or dragon's blood available.
And perform the same operation on large wounds when it is necessary to cover them and bind them tightly, and on recent wounds with their blood, which the air has not yet altered.
And if the air has altered them, especially in the summer, then it is not appropriate to use this powder. Instead, treat those wounds with the water we have mentioned, placing on them cooked cloths or a paste of wheat flour with water and honey until they form pus; and then treat them with the other treatment until they are healed.
"But if you encounter a small bone fracture with the wound, then extract it with forceps.
"And I will tell you how to treat skull fractures when they occur.
"For wounds of the neck.
"But if the wound occurs on the neck, there is no difference in treatment compared to a simple skull wound.
"But if the nerves or arteries of the neck are cut, then if it is the nerves, there is no hope unless the treatment is with something that causes strong coagulation, such as zeniur and zegei, which are vitriol, to prevent harm to the nerves and constrict them. "And do not place anything on the wound to stop the bleeding, because the substance of the nerves is thin and its continuation is with the brain, which is the most important of all the members.
"And if it is treated with light medications, such as being washed with warm water, sometimes infused with rose or non-rose oil, and cauterized when washed with warm water and other stones reducing according to this method, and moistening ointments.
If the wound is large, then administer sutures or cut the lips of it, and then cure it with powders until it is healed.
But if the wound is deep or occurs in the lower part of the body where gangrene may set in, then pierce it in the most depressed area.
But if an artery has already been cut in the wound and blood flow has occurred, then separate or dry it, or bind it, or cauterize it if necessity requires it.
But if the spondyls of the throat or all have already been cut, and the veins of the neck are saved, then adjust the lips of the wound with sutures on the edge of the throat and do not touch it; first equalize it and return it to its natural shape, and then strengthen it with a decent bandage, and leave it for some days; and then cure it with ointments that have hemostatic and stimulating properties until it is healed.
But if the wound has already been made in the bone, then perforate it; and if there are bone fragments in it, remove all that you can of them; and what is not apparent to you, leave it until the wound is suppurated, and separated, and the swelling is relieved.
And if the wound is recent, then sprinkle upon it the recommended powder. But if in the wound there is an ulcer, then treat it with water, of which the memory will come to you soon in its chapter.
If it is a stab wound from a spear or knife, and if you see its depth, then consider also if there is bleeding when the patient inhales; then you know that the wound is mortal.
And if there is no depth and the wound is recent with its blood, then in the first hour you should put on it powder, and not bind it so that the blood is not held in its depth and does not return to the heart and poison the patient; but put on it an attractive ointment, and wash it twice a day.
And if the ointment is not available, then put on the wound's orifice old cloth so that it absorbs water from moisture; and make the patient sleep on the wound so that the water in it flows out.
Here's the translation of the given sentence:
If the patient's healing is delayed and it has been open for a long time, then know that it has become a fistula; treat it accordingly with its respective remedy.
And if the wound is caused by a cut from a sword or a knife, and it is simple on the surface of the foot or back, then treat it with water that has been prepared for stitching if it is large, or with powder if it is small.
But if it has already entered the bone and there are pieces of bone cut off, then you should turn the wound and try to extract those pieces, if they are separate. But if they are not separated, then leave them inside, as the wound will heal better, making their removal easier.
And for other wounds that occur in other parts of the body, the treatment is the same as we have said above.
Of the wounds of the abdomen.
The disorder that occurs in the abdomen is either great, small, or moderate.
E disruption is difficult to perform by another method, and I know that their reduction is more difficult if you do not cut the introduction of them into their place immediately, because it swells and thickens, making the introduction of it difficult.
Therefore, the best disruption is milder, because in it the reduction of the intestine is not difficult, as it is difficult in the two aforementioned types.
And know that the stitching of the abdomen is done in four ways, but two stitches are common and suitable for the stitching of other ailments of the body.
And two other stitches are also appropriate for other ailments, but nevertheless they are more specific to the stitching of the abdomen.
And I recommend to you each one with an explanation and description.
Therefore I say that when the wound is small and there is some cause of intestine through it, and it is difficult to reduce it, then this happens in one of two ways: either because of the smallness of the disruption as we have said, or when the intestine has become inflamed due to the coldness of the air.
When it is thus, then it is necessary that you scrape that area so that you submerge a sponge or damp cloth in warm water alone, or take in hot water, cinnamon, pepper, and cloves with that budel until the swelling is resolved.
And sometimes it happens that there is an astringent quality in which water alone is better for the resolution of the swelling.
Therefore, when you see the swelling has been resolved, then wet the area with water in which there is thyme and mallow, because this will relieve his suffering with little cause.
But if the patient's suffering is not relieved with this treatment, then make a small incision with an instrument used for cutting hemorrhoids.
And the first treatment is better when it is appropriate and does not cause cutting or excessive weakness and debilitation.
As for the instrument, see what its form is:
The one end of it is sharp and the other not sharp, and the tip is fine, but not as fine as a needle, rather it should be slightly blunt.
And therefore, when the wound is enlarged and the intestines have come out, then it is necessary to return them to their natural form and proper place, if possible, because that is better.
But when the disruption is large and in the lower part of the abdomen, then you should make the patient lie on their back, and raise their legs higher than their head; and if it is in the upper part of the abdomen, then place the patient's head and feet higher than the affected area.
Similarly, if the disruption is in one of the two sides of the abdomen, then direct your attention and consideration always towards this, so that the side with the wound is higher than the other.
And thus it is necessary to administer this for both large and small wounds.
And for small wounds, place what is prepared under it, and then ensure that the person administering it is between your hands, holding the entire wound with their hand and aligning its edges, and then discover if there is any other reason for this.
Here's the translation of the given text:
Here's my best attempt at translating the given text into English, line by line:
And the needles should be moderate in size between thickness and fineness, for fine needles cut the flesh very lightly; thick ones are difficult to insert into the vein, so they must be of moderate thickness and fineness.
And it is not appropriate for the needle to be placed at the two ends of the vein, lest the flesh be lightly cut and the wound break open before healing properly.
And do not let the sutures be prolonged, so that the wound may not be prevented from healing.
And then cut off the ends of the needles so that they do not prick the patient during their sleep; and place on the suture, spread throughout, cotton balls with needle ends; and leave them there until you know that the wound has already healed.
And this type of suture with needles is most suitable for small wounds, because it can be done with one needle or two, or around that number.
However, the second type of suture is common: and it is that you administer with sutures the four ends at once, of the vein and two ends of the thread, in one go, with a needle on which wire is wrapped, both in fineness and thickness.
It seems like the text is describing a procedure involving an needle and possibly drainage of pus from a wound. Here's a line-by-line translation:
And place between each stitch the amount equivalent to the thickness of the little finger.
And this is how men sew.
And with such a stitch I sutured the wound that had been inflicted on a man in his belly, which was struck by a sword, and the opening of the wound was more than a palm's width, and it protruded around two palms of the midpoint of the intestine, and the opening was in the middle of the member; and then I returned that after the intestine had been out of the wound for twenty-four hours.
And the wound was healed in the space of fifteen days or thereabouts, and I cured him, and he is well; and afterward he lived for many years, and has been healthy in his actions.
And the other doctors had judged that he would not be cured; and it was by a miracle, for I did not cure him with ointment, because it was in a place where ointment or any medicine could not be applied, but I placed cotton wool on the wound twice a day and washed it continuously with honey water until it was healed.
But I will describe two types of stitches according to the account of Paraula.
"And it is that you begin with stitching the skin, and insert the needle from outside to inside.
"And so with the needle, penetrate the skin and insert a knot according to what is right and appropriate for the entire body, leaving the tip of the thread in which you have inserted the needle; and make the needle pass from inside to outside on the other end of the thread.
"And then, when you have made that penetration, do it again in the same thread from outside to inside; and leave the end of the thread that is on this side, and make the needle penetrate in the other end from inside to outside.
"And make that penetration with the same penetration that you use to penetrate the thread at its end which is on the inside, so that all of it penetrates.
"And then begin from this same side and sew that with the end of the thread on the other side, and remove the needle from the skin which was penetrated, and then return that to the same skin and sew the end of the thread which is on the other side with this end of the thread; and remove that from the skin which is on the far side.
And do this once and another time, and do it once again before you close everything that is outside according to that example.
And the summary of this suturing method is that you sew with a subcutaneous suture with which you sew the hairs, so that you sew one time from the end of the thread, and leave the other end until you have completed it.
But the second type of suture, which is also called Gaulish, and this is its name and it is recommended for it, is that you sew according to the half-circle stitch with which some doctors sew, so that they add every separate part to its corresponding part as nature requires; and they apply the end of one thread and the end of the needle to the other end of the thread, and this is done as I have recommended to you.
So you put the needle in the end of the thread to your right, towards the part outside, and make that penetrate into the inside part in the same way, leaving two ends of the thread; and then turn the needle and do that from outside to inside in two ends of the thread.
And then carefully turn those little ones, and make each of them penetrate from the inside part to the outside part in two opposite extremities of the mentioned area, except for those that are on the contrary side.
And this method of suturing is better than the common slight suture, and it is the suture of which the memory has been described.
This is the treatise from Gaul
And some may say that the stitching of the belly is done with two needles, so you insert a thread into each one, and begin by piercing the needle where it should be inserted, and make it penetrate to the other side according to the stitching method which sews the hearts equally.
And know that when there is a rupture in the middle of the belly, then its stitching is more difficult than in other parts of the belly.
But the judgment of wound treatment is the same as for other wounds.
Because when you find the wound still fresh with its blood before the air alters it, and return the intestines and stitch it up properly, then place powder for flesh growth on it.
Here's my attempt at translating the given sentence into English:
Here's the line-by-line translation of the given sentence:
Certainly! Let's translate the given sentence:
And if the patient feels pain or putrefaction in their intestines, because this happens often, then treat it with six drops of black hellebore tincture, especially if the putrefaction has penetrated into the intestine and a perforating exitus has been made.
And know that the one who has it in the large intestine will have a lighter cure than the one who has it in the subtle intestines.
And it is difficult to cure because the intestine which is called "jejunum" does not accept a cure for any wound that falls upon it; and this is due to the great number of veins in it, and due to their magnitude, and due to the subtlety of its body, and due to its proximity to the nature of nerves.
But if what proceeds from the wound is tissue, and you find it fresh, reduce it according to your practice in the same way that you reduce the intestines similarly.
But if it has passed into the space and is already turned green or black, then you should strengthen that place with oil on the darkened spot, so that blood flow will come out, because in the tissue there are veins and arteries.
Sure, here is the translation of the given sentence:
"Remembrance of the plagues when they occur in the intestines.
"When there is a disruption in the intestines and it is small, then in some men it is possible for it to be restored. This is because I saw that man who had been struck in his stomach with a lance and the wound was on the right side of the stomach, and the wound was old and made a fistula, from which came out pus and flatulence.
"Then I followed the care of him, not that he was cured, but I continued to carefully probe within until it was healed and the place was consolidated.
"And I told the patient to expect that some harm would come to him due to his stomach injury; and no one perceived any ill effect from this, but he was strong in all his limbs by eating and drinking, and afterwards he entered a bath and was exercised in these things.
"And some experienced ones said that when there is a wound in the intestines and it is small, then it should be tied off in this manner: and it is that you take large-headed ants; and then adjust the two lips of the wound and place one of those ants with its mouth open over the two lips of the wound; so that when it takes hold of them and closes its mouth, cut off its head, because it adheres and does not dissolve.
Here's my translation for the given text:
And immediately reduce that and close the wound; and let those attached heads remain in the intestine until the intestine is healed; and do not cause any harm to the patient.
And it is possible to tie the intestine with thin thread made from the gut of an animal attached to it, because it is more like a needle; and you should take the end of this thread, make sure it is very thin, then tie the end of it with thread around it, insert that thread into needles and sew up the intestine, and thus reduce it in the break.
And this method of suturing with ants is only as a second way of confidence and hope.
But if the wound is large and wide, especially if it is in one of the thin intestines, because then it is not a mere scratch but a serious injury, and it will not heal completely.
About the treatment of ulcers and fistulas.
Know that every wound and abscess when it becomes old and is not healed, and turns into an ulcer, and does not consolidate and heal properly at all times, then in whatever member it may be, it is generally called a fistula, and we call that an azukem.
Certainly! Here's the translation of the sentence:
And in some men, it is moist, which causes arm swelling; and soon after the moisture is absorbed, within a few hours. And sometimes this moisture is thick and viscous, and other times it is thin and delicate.
All of those causes and their signs, along with their treatment using medicines, have been shown in the division.
And it is fitting that I inform you of the treatment for a fistula caused by an operation with the hand.
And you should know that fistulas can occur in all parts of the body, for some of these fistulas affect large veins and arteries, or nerves, or the bladder, or the bowel, or the bladder, or one of the ribs, or one of the vertebrae of the spine, or one of the joints composed similarly to that of the hand and foot; and among these are those which are close to the main organ and have a similar appearance.
Therefore, that fistula which is of this kind is among the most difficult diseases to heal, and it does not receive treatment, and dealing with it is laborious and ignorant.
And if there is any fistula whose depth does not reach these places that have been mentioned, and you hope for and prepare for its treatment, and you want to examine it, then take a probe of iron or steel, and if the fistula runs straight, explore it with it.
But if the fistula is tortuous, then examine it with a fine lead probe, for lead, due to its malleability, bends easily according to the tortuosity.
And if the fistula has terrifying words, it is not possible for you to interpret them with a tent.
Therefore, irrigate the anus with an enema, for the moisture used in the enema will drive out the others and run from them.
And therefore inquire diligently, according to the best of your ability, whether you recognize bones or nerves here, and whether it is a distant or nearby cavity, or a fistula with terrifying words, which is entirely under your strength, skill, and the manner in which you explore the patient, and the invention of the pain should be your compression with your hand on that place, and similar to the significance and accidental causes of the abscess.
And when you have determined all these causes with certainty, then proceed to the treatment with confidence: and it is that you consider whether the apparent fistula is near or in a salty place, distant from the joint, or of nerve, artery, vein, or one of the places that I mentioned to you.
Then you dry out the fistula as mentioned before in its description, and remove what is in that cavity and of corrupt flesh, and what has been born in the orifice of the flesh, or of skin and similar things, and treat it until it is healed.
Based on the pattern of the previous translations, here's my attempt at translating the given text:
And do this with some caution, until the sharp medicine erodes everything that is soft inside the cavity of the fistula of the corruption.
And then restore it with ointments that generate healthy flesh until it is healed.
But if it does not heal from this, then you should cauterize it according to what we have recommended.
But if the cause of the fistula is bone and you are certain of this, then you should inquire into it and dry it up according to what we have recommended, unless there is any obstruction of a vein or nerve or main member as we have said.
But if the bone is exposed and there is any corruption or blackness in it, then you should scrape it until all the corruption is removed; and then heal it with something that will make flesh grow over it until it is healed.
And if it does not heal and continues to discharge as before, then know that you have not reached the complete eradication of the corruption; and therefore, explore it further and more thoroughly scrape and clean it with the sharpest instrument you have, and then restore it.
And therefore, if it is healed, that is good; and if not, then know that this corruption is in the deepest part of the body, which has not been reached, and thus your duty there is not to cure but to treat it.
And if the bone that has become corrupt is small or within your ability to remove it, then use fine forceps suitable for this purpose.
And if there are many bones, then carefully extract all of them, and do not leave any trace with your strength.
But if you encounter any resistance due to the humidity, and there is no fear or error in their incision, then cut through those ligaments or flesh, if they are present, and release the bones.
But if you do not have the preparation to remove the bones at that time, then place something over the wound that will cause it to suppurate, and leave it until those bones are surrounded by flesh and ligaments, and guard the wound so that it does not heal, and keep the incision tight that you made during your operation.
Furthermore, if you fear [that the wound will heal], place over it a cloth soaked in oil or a cloth soaked in Egyptian ointment or any of the green ointments, for when those ligaments putrefy and the bones are separated from them by abscess, their attraction is relieved.
Certainly! Let's translate the sentence line by line:
Sure, let's translate the given medieval medical text line by line into English:
It appears that you are recommending something to me that I should find in the patient's space for help and support during my operation.
I encountered a young man around xxx years of age who experienced pain in his chest, and it was noted that the swelling on the inside part of his body had entered the chest until the matter reached the chest, and it is a matter of an abscess with a large abscess, and there was no external cause for it.
Therefore, the time was extended with that error of the physicians until the abscess burst, and dark materials came out of it. His treatment was then stopped until the thigh was fistulized, and two large orifices were made in him, through which all the pus and bodily humors flowed.
And thus a multitude of physicians treated him for about two years, but none of them were more knowledgeable in the art than I was, until I was called.
And I saw his thigh and the materials that flowed from those orifices in great quantity; and already the body of that man was entirely bloated, and his color was yellow.
And then I inserted a probe into one of those orifices, and the probe reached the bone.
And then I and others examined all the orifices and found that they led to every part of the leg.
And then I cut and inserted into one of the orifices until I discovered a bone cavity, which I found to be rotten and darkened; and I also found that a part of the leg had become corrupted where it had penetrated into the marrow.
And then I sawed off what had been discovered and prepared from the exposed bone.
And I thought that it was not in the bone itself, but rather the corruption which I had cut away and sawed off, and I had already scraped it clean.
And then I applied restorative medicine to the wound for a long time, but it did not heal.
And then I dug and discovered on the bone what had been found initially, and I found that there was continuous corruption with the bone.
And I sawed off what appeared to be part of that corruption, and then I was determined to perform the cure and restoration on him, but it did not restore.
And then I exposed it again and did not stop cutting the bone bit by bit specifically and persistently sought his restoration, but it did not restore until I cut around him about a palm's width, and that I extracted with its marrow. And then I restored that with medicines, and it became somewhat healed and healthy. 》
And it is not necessary to repeat the operation on him and section of him except due to the weakness of him and the lack of his tolerance and fear of death in him, because lethargy befalls him at all times due to excessive evacuation causing a bad faint.
Therefore, he is healed by the complete healing process, and there is nothing in the place of hard flesh; and the arrangement of him in his body has been well made and his strength returned; and he has changed in his arrangements and does not oppose him in walking or harm him in any way.
But if the bone protrudes from the previously broken place, then it is necessary that you cut it according to this manner: and it is that you take a bandage and tighten that on the tip of that protruding bone, and order someone to extend it; and place that woolen bandage thicker than the first one; and then bind it over the flesh that is under the bone, and stretch the extremity for pulling the flesh into the separated parts, and you uncover the flesh in the place where you want to saw so that the saw does not touch the flesh.
And place a stick or board under the bone properly, because when you do this, it is not allowed that the saw cuts the corrupt flesh.
And it is necessary that the compression be applied gradually to the affected area, because if it is in the cavity of the bone and does not appear on its surface, it will require another compression at another time.
And if the bone is affected and not protruding, before one part is connected to another, and the corruption is in the middle or part of it, then you should uncover all the flesh from every side; and place a stick underneath, and then press that of the first part where the corruption is until it becomes continuous with the compression of the other part.
And let the compression be according to the location of the corruption, a little, as we have said.
And if the corruption is in the joint, cut open that corrupt joint and press the bone where it continues to the other part.
And if the corruption is in the continuation of two joints, then it is not reasonable but absurd.
And if the corruption is in the palm of the hand or the sole of the foot, it is very difficult; however, you should seek to understand the manner in which the corruption appears to you, and cut away that part, and cleanse it according to each disposition that is possible for you, and correct each absurdity as it does not contradict a vein or nerve.
And know that the incision and saws used to cut these bones are determined according to the position of the bones, their preparation, their thickness, their subtlety, their size, their smallness, their hardness, and their rarity; therefore, you must prepare a suitable instrument for each type of operation.
And know that this operation requires you to choose the appropriate instrument for your needs; with your great study, experience, and knowledge of this art's methods, as well as your witnessing of various illnesses, you will know how to apply the suitable instrument for each ailment.
And I will list at the end of this chapter the number of instruments that you will use as simples, with which you will proceed to your practice, and which you will test on others. Type/form of saw:
Other form of saw:
Other large-type saw:
Type of file: The head of this file should be in the shape of a star-headed nail, and its teeth should resemble the shape of an awl's points.
And it is not advisable to do anything other than gently rub the joints with a pointed instrument when they are severely inflamed or the opening is very large.
A smaller form of razor
Latin type razor
Another well-made saw should be made in an arc shape, with the iron part above being sharper and the wooden handle decently made. Shape of it
A form of razor that has a concave shape
Another subtle form of razor
Another form of a razor with a curved tip
A small razor resembling a fishhook
Another smaller form of bone-cutting instrument
The shape of another type of bone-cutting instrument; this one resembles a sawfish, with its tip like a saw, and it is used in many places on the bones.
The shape of a reamer that is suitable for use when boring into bones
And its tip is triangular with a sharp point.
It is made of Indian steel, and similarly, it should possess all the qualities that we have mentioned for razors, bone-cutting instruments, and saws.
"About the joints and the locking of the bones.
"The extremities are affected either by intrinsic causes or extrinsic ones. When you have treated that corruption with those medicines and the treatment does not work, sometimes the corruption goes away from the member without any cause, then it is necessary for you to incise that member into which the corruption has entered, so that the patient avoids death or a major impairment of the member.
"And the sign of this happening is that the member turns black, as if fire has burned it, or you might see the blackness spreading until it reaches the heart and takes over the entire body; therefore, beware, for this requires incision.
"Similarly, if the corruption is caused by some venomous things such as a sea scorpion, a viper, or a weasel.
"And if the corruption or venom is in the extremity of the finger, then you should incise the finger and not allow the corruption to spread into the hand.
"Similarly, if it occurs in the hand, then you should incise it from the root of the thumb, and do not allow the corruption to spread into the root of the arm.
And if you expel it, then cut the arm into the elbow at the joint.
And if the corruption and the vexation attack the elbow, then in that case it is the death of the patient; and to administer another cause or remedy for this condition, a quantity of virtue is necessary.
Similarly, do the same with the foot when corruption attacks the said part of the foot; then you should cut into one of the toes.
And if it affects the arch of the foot, then you should cut off the entire foot. But if it goes up to the knee, then you should cut the leg into the joint of the knee.
And if the corruption has already reached the knee, then in that case there is nothing to be done but to dismiss the patient and let him die.
And the manner of cutting or sawing the limb is that you place a ligature above the part where you want to cut, and place another ligature below it. The assistant should extend a ligature towards the parts below, and the assistant should place another ligature on top. Then you separate the flesh which is between the two ligatures with a spatula until all the flesh is exposed; then it can be cut or sawed. ⟩
And it is necessary that a clean cloth be placed on all sides of the area, so that it does not touch the healthy skin, and it will come to the patient as an appropriate and cautious wound.
But if there is bleeding when you operate, then cauterize the area lightly, or place some powder that restricts blood flow on it; and return to your treatment until it is completed.
And then bind the affected member with a bandage in a suitable manner, and care for it until it is healed.
And I recommend to you what happens to a person in their foot, this same accident which I and you are recommending, which is that darkness appears in his foot with a burning that resembles the fire of combustion.
And that corruption first occurs in the toe until it extends to the whole foot.
And then that man prepares for himself some pus, which goes to the cure of the member with great intensity, because he suffers from pain and burning, and he cuts off that foot up to the joint, and it becomes healed.
For a long time, the same corruption occurs in his big toe on his right hand.
And then the patient came to me, and I was prompted to remove that excess fluid with water that was placed on the hand of medicines, near the cleansing of the body; and the excess did not return, but it began to flow out until it entered my hand.
And I was called to cut the hand of the patient, and I did not want to do this because I hoped for the return of that excess fluid, and moreover, I feared the death of the patient, because the strength of the patient was in decline.
And after he left me, he returned to his land and came back to me saying that this man had prepared himself and completely cut off his hand, and he was cured.
And I have recounted this story only so that it may be of help regarding this illness and serve as an example by which to understand it and according to which to act.
About the care of the sinews and the quality of the enema with medicines.
When an abscess occurs in some fleshy members and the space of the abscess is prolonged until it forms a cavity, and then it breaks and perforates, and the pus comes out from it, leaving the place empty as if it were a vessel, and the skin that is above it is also thin like a fine cloth, and no deeper corruption has reached, and does not affect bone or nerve or ligament, it is called a sinew, and not a fistula.
However, if the space is extended to the point where corruption begins in any part of the body, it is called a fistula and not an ulcer.
And the treatment for it is that you should cut that string completely as it is rolled up, especially when it is thin and made of cloth. Make sure it does not stick to the place due to its corruption.
However, if you hope that the string will stick and that corruption has not yet reached the end result, and on the string there are signs of pus, then treat it with a clyster.
And consider the sinus, and if it is large and the arm that is in it smells bad, then treat it with an Egyptian medicine, which consists of oil, vinegar, and cinnamon, each taking equal parts by mouth, and they should be placed in a vessel and cooked over the fire until the medicine becomes thick and reaches the consistency of honey.
Then take from it as much water as is necessary and dissolve it in water and honey; and use this to perform a clyster on the sinus, and strengthen its opening, and let the medicine stay inside for two hours.
And then remove it with disdain; do this for so many days until the armpit is cleansed and the stench is removed.
And sometimes he is given an enema with water mixed with ashes when this medicine is not available to you; and it is that you take the ashes of vinegar, mix them with water, and then use this mixture to give him an enema until you are sure that the armpit is clean.
And if the patient cannot tolerate the Egyptian medicine or the water mixed with ashes, then give him an enema with water and honey, well mixed together, and afterwards give him another enema with wine and honey mixed together. For it is a property of honey that it cleanses and washes, and the wine makes the armpit adhere more firmly, especially when the wine has an excess of astringency and dryness.
And when you have done this several times and are sure that the stench has been removed, then give him an enema with water that promotes the growth of flesh in him.
And take some ointment of diafinicon and dissolve it with rose oil and astringent wine, or give him an enema with some other medicines and ointments that have the properties which I have already written about in the treatise on ointments.
And if the opening of the cavity is too narrow to admit the nozzle of the enema, then you should gradually widen it using a small iron instrument, and place in it a piece of cloth wrapped in Egyptian or Basilic ointment until it is sufficiently widened.
And similarly, if the opening is too wide, then you should bring its lips together with a stitch and leave it in such a state that the enema can enter without addition.
And if the opening of that from which the arm is raised to the upper parts is dry, then moisten it with pus in its lowest place so that the arm runs below, because when the arm is constricted by the depth of the cavity, flesh will be generated in it.
And if it is not possible for you to moisten the cavity within the desired extent of pus, then you should bore through with a prepared instrument that the member be prepared in such a way that the arm runs lightly and is not detained by any cause within it.
And as for that which is above the opening of the sinus, you should keep it constantly warm so that what is constricted in his arm can be relieved. And to know whether the flow from his arm is too much or too little, whether it is digested or undigested.
And also consider the location of that sinus, whether the patient feels pain there or not, and whether there is an abscess there.
And when you have prolonged your treatment in this manner, and you see the matter that has been placed on the opening of the sinus has adhered or is about to adhere, then on the second day, or third at most, you should unbind the wound, and when you unbind it, change the cloth for another one and renew the ointment.
But if from the sinus there is only a small space filled with subtle pus, do not despair of its adherence, because his healing is near, for some people heal slowly in their wounds, and others heal quickly.
And if after many days the arm remains undigested, know that the sinus has not adhered; and if the adhesion of the sinus is delayed and the cause prolonged, then make use of dry medicines, and if the medicines are moist in substance and virtue, they should be made dry like the ointment of diaphanicon, with the addition of gum.
And the most important thing to do for healing is to take some of the ointment called Diafincion and dissolve it in rose oil. Then place this mixture on the old wound, wrap it with a clean cloth, and use it.
And if there is no hand available for that action, take some Diafincion ointment and mix it with honey until it becomes thick, and use it; or take myrrh, aloe, and sesame seeds, grind them all together into a powder and sprinkle it over the honey when it is on the fire, then line it with cloth and place it on the wound; and line that with the honey you have mixed until it becomes thick, and also sprinkle it on the cloth and place it.
And sometimes it is administered with long aristolochia and celestial lily roots (and this is the celestial lily), as well as erysimum flour and centaury, and use these simple or compound ingredients. Grind them, sift them, and sprinkle the powder over the honey you have mixed; and use it.
And if the wound is prolonged and does not heal with this treatment, then know that the corruption is in the flesh of the patient, and immediately investigate the bones or other hard members or ligaments; then treat them with a fistula cure as mentioned above.
Here's a line-by-line translation of your given text:
Based on the provided text and pattern, here's my attempt at translating the given sentence:
And therefore, when you have the patient with the condition we mentioned in the division, and if you do not perform your treatment, then it is necessary that you cut away all the remaining superfluity from the nail and then cauterize the wound nearby, because cautery is very beneficial in this case.
But if the bone is sound and the nail is healthy, and the additions of the nail already compress the flesh at the divided parts inside, and begin to prick and irritate that area, then it is necessary that you place a thin thread under the edge of the nail that is pricking the flesh, pull it up, and cut off that piece of flesh with ease. Then apply corrosive and burning medicines on what remains of the flesh until it has all been removed; and afterwards, cure the patient with ointments until they are healed.
But if the corruption has already reached the bone, then it is necessary that you cut away that part of the bone and extract it, because it will never heal as long as the bone remains corrupt.
And if you see the rot and corruption spreading to the fingers, then you should cut [the affected part] at one of the joints according to where your memory guides you, and afterwards cure it until it is healed.
If the nail needs percussion or abrasion and intense pain occurs, then at the beginning you should bloodlet the patient, and then immediately dry the nail with a sharp spatula with a transverse cut from top to bottom, and be careful that the cut does not reach the flesh beneath the nail, for you will cause intense pain to the patient, and it will be the cause of an excessive growth of attached flesh in that place; and then cure that place with water that relieves pain.
However, if the affected nail, which is common in the hands of some men, is very fleshy all around, or very fleshy at its base, or very fleshy on its surface,
and some of them are born from the root of the joint, or their growth is in some of the aforementioned nuts. But that which is born in the nuts of the finger does not hurt, and this which is born in the joints is very painful.
And of those that are born fleshy, the cut should be light, and it is that you should cut them along their root with a broad spatula.
But of that which is born at the root of the joint, the cure is difficult; and therefore beware of the infection of it.
In the case of one who is born with this condition, you must cut the flesh at the beginning with a round incision to the bone, and then saw with one of those appropriate saws for that purpose, and then take care that it heals properly inside.
However, consolidation that happens between the teeth, whether by nature or due to injury or burning by fire, or something similar, then it is necessary to cut away this consolidation until the teeth return to their natural shape.
Then place between their teeth thin pieces of cloth soaked in oil, so that they are not easily consolidated, and separate them with these or place a thin sheet of lead between them until it is consolidated as needed.
Similarly, if consolidation occurs between some teeth and the palate, then cut away that consolidation according to how it is prepared and suited to the shape of the member.
About the cutting of veins, they are varicose.
Veins are varicose and they are large, swollen veins filled with melancholic excess that come in bunches on the members of the body, and most commonly on the legs, especially on the legs of travelers, workers and bearers.
Sure, let's break down and translate the text:
Here's the translation of the given sentence into English:
Here is the translation of the given text:
And then tie it, and command the patient to abstain from foods that generate black bile.
And repeat the treatment with phlebotomy when the veins are full and this is known to the patient.
However, the elevation of it is according to this manner: you who raise the patient's leg, if there are hairs on it, then immediately wash and soak the leg in hot water until it becomes red and the veins are prominent; or if it is a strong exercise, if a bath is not available, continue until the member is scalded.
And then dry the cord in the right place on the vein, either in the length or at the back of it, or lower down you will find the heel.
And then open the cord with scissors and cut the vein from all sides until it is felt, and this perception is what you ask for, seeking to darken it.
And so when you have evacuated and you see the white cord coming out, know that it is the vein.
And then you place the reed under it so that it is raised and separated from the cord, and suspend it with a golden hook.
Sure, let's break down the translation of this sentence:
Based on the pattern of the previous translations and the similarity to Latin, Spanish, Italian, and French, here's my best attempt at translating the given sentence:
And do this so that you extract the one which is most superior or highest of all sections until it is completely removed; and then incise it.
And if it does not obey being extracted and elevated, then insert a strong double-edged needle and tie it off, or insert a rod beneath it and turn your hand in all directions until it is expelled. And be careful that it is not cut; for if it breaks, it will be very difficult for you to lift that part and the harm has come upon the patient because of this error.
And when all of that has been expelled, then place on the wound site wool soaked in vinegar and both refined and unrefined oil, and cure it until it is healed.
And if the intestine is constricted and twisted in such a way that it cannot be straightened as we have said, then you must make incisions all along its twists and at the points of constriction, and then suspend it with hooks until you lift it out completely.
And be careful with your incision that you do not cut the vein and that it does not injure it, for it will be difficult for you to lift it; and use your skill in this matter.
Form of the incident with which life is dried out:
"It is not to the skin like for ointments and does not have a sharp edge because it should not harm the vein, and it is of thick flexibility, for if it were fine, it would cut the vein due to its fineness; therefore, there is an excess of thickness as we have said.
"On the extraction of a leg vein.
"This vein is produced in the thighs, in hot lands such as those of Al-Andalus in Arabic territory and in hot, dry lands of India with little fertility where there is neither grass nor tree.
"And it can also be produced in other parts of the body besides the thighs.
"And its formation is due to putrefaction that comes from the intestines, just as poisons are generated inside the body by snakes and worms and scorpions and serpents spawning between the intestines and the flesh.
"And the sign of its onset is that this vein causes a severe inflammation in the thigh, and then the place becomes blistered; and then the vein begins to come out from that blister as if it were a root of a plant.
And then when the extremity appears from him, at that moment it is necessary for you to wrap around it a lead weight which weighs between one and two dragmas, and tie it securely, leaving the lead hanging from the leg.
And as often as you see any cause of it being expelled outwards, wrap this in lead and tie it securely. And if the protrusion is prolonged, then you should cut off a part of it and wrap the remainder; and do not cut it straight away until it has been pushed out, for if you cut it while it is constricted it will enter into the flesh and cause an abscess and putrefaction in that place and a bad ulcer.
Therefore, it is necessary that it be treated gently and be extracted little by little, until it is completely expelled from him and nothing remains in his body.
And this vein comes out in some men to a length of five hands and ten fingers, and it has already come to my attention that one came out of twenty hands long.
And if it is cut during the time of its treatment, then insert a reed into its cavity and make a long incision with the body, until everything that is in the matter is evacuated, and administer putrefaction of the place for several days with medicines; and then treat it according to the treatment of abscesses.
"And this vein sometimes has large branches, and mainly when it appears at the joint of the foot or in the foot, and comes to it with many openings, and each opening has its own branch.
"And so cure it as we have said in the division, and with what has been mentioned above.
"On the section of worms generated under the skin, which is called bovine illness.
"This illness is called in some regions 'bovine illness' because often it happens to cows, and a few worms are born between the hide and flesh, which travel throughout the body ascending and descending, and show their movement from member to member until they break through the hide and come out.
"And its generation is due to the putrefaction of certain humors, just like what happens with worms, snakes, earthworms, and roundworms in the stomach.
"And it is feared for its malice, because when it goes into the body and rises to the head, and reaches the eye, then it quickly pierces through it and enters and destroys the eye, and this happens often.
"And so when you want to cure that and remove it, then it is not done except by feeling its movement and appearance, and then you must hold what is above it and what is below it tightly and firmly, and quickly dry it out and extract it.
And if it is penetrated in the flesh and you do not find it, then place a cautery with fire on the spot until death occurs, and the most feared cause of this corruption is the corruption of the spot as we have said.
And if you see that thing approaching the eye near the eyelid, then strengthen the eyelid with a strong bandage and place a cloth over it, and remove that thing; and it is necessary for the patient to use a purgative for their body with medicines that evacuate bad putrid humors, and they should avoid foods that cause putrefaction.
For the treatment of nasal inflammation.
This illness is called "naphir" in our land, and it is a pain that comes to certain members, and then changes from member to member.
And I have seen this as I will tell you now. I was called to a sick woman in a village, and I uncovered her arm and saw a small inflammation in the vein of the arm, and after it was broken for an hour, I saw that inflammation go as if it were a worm ascending towards this place, but more lightly than being a worm, as if it were quicksilver when it runs from one place to another.
And then go away from that painful spot and place yourself in the muscle, and stay there for an hour.
And then run to the other body part until you reach the other arm.
And then report back to me that you have rotated yourself through the entire body as I see fit; and I was greatly amazed at the exchange between you and the speed from member to member. And I had already seen this before in my own hands, but I have not seen many things that cause pain being exchanged from member to member. But I did not see it with the hands as I did in the woman.
And I did not think it was because of that, but rather because the woman was old, and therefore her body was dry and her veins exposed, and in this state, that windiness appeared to the senses.
And it is necessary that this does not appear according to this treatment in those who are delicate and with moist bodies and veins.
And when you wish to treat the patient and they feel that pain, then it is not apparent to your hand as we have said; therefore, press strongly on that spot until it subsides slightly and the constriction is released, and then cauterize the area.
It seems like the text is discussing a medical procedure or treatment for a specific condition. Here's a line-by-line translation of the given sentence:
"On the removal of arrows.
"Arrows are classified by their types and the parts of the body they strike, as their diversity lies in those with large tips, small ones, concave, blunt, solid; and those with three angles; and those with tongues; and those with barbs.
"And the signs of danger are when an arrow strikes and passes through bone, particularly if it exits from the fontanelle on the head, for this causes severe dizziness, blindness, vertigo, heat in the eyes, swelling and heat of the tongue, spasms, and confusion of mind, along with bile vomiting. It is also indicated by difficulty in speaking and loss of voice, as well as a white, powdery discharge from the wound site, and the flesh appearing watery.
And so if these signs appear to you, then you should abstain from the treatment and removal of the arrow, unless it is necessary.
But the signs of an arrow wound to the heart are that it is near the left nipple, and one feels as if something hard has been inserted, and it is not a soft cause; and the movement of the arrow is similar to the pulse's movement, and dark blood flows from the wound, and there is coldness in the extremities, and sweating, and fainting; and therefore you know that death will come suddenly.
And the signs when an arrow has struck the lung are foamy blood coming from the wound, and the veins near the neck are swollen, and the patient's color changes, and they exhale a great amount of air, and they crave cold air.
And if the arrow strikes the membrane that is in the feet, then the pain is near the small ribs, and a great cry is made with intense pain and sighing, and all the limbs' muscles are not functioning well.
And if the arrow strikes the stomach, then food that has not been digested will come out of the wound very quickly.
And if the arrow hits the abdomen and is embedded in it, there should be some opening of the wound, or the cloth, or the intestine which has been torn, and there is no hope for the cure through the extraction of the arrow.
And if the arrow hits the bladder and urine comes out, or if there is swelling around the wound, and there is severe pain in the patient, then you should know that it is fatal.
But the other members, such as the face, neck, gullet, shoulders and joints, shoulder blades of the back, collarbone, pelvis, thigh, and their similar parts of the body are saved according to the greatest care when the arrow does not find a vein or artery and is not poisonous.  (This passage is about treating injuries from arrow wounds in various parts of the body.)
And I will tell you this about the nature of these arrows, so that you may know for the cure.
The reason is that in a man an arrow hit him in the lacrimal duct of his eye and I extracted it from the other side, leaving the gray hairs of his ear, and he was cured, and nothing happened to his eye.
And you extract another arrow from a Jew, which fell into his eye socket beneath the eyelid, and the arrow was hidden and only its small tip could be seen, which was attached to its shaft, and it was a large arrow of the sharp Turkish arrows, with a lion's head in which there were no feathers.
And the Jew is seated, and he did not suffer any harm to his eye.
And you extract another arrow from a Christian man, which had fallen into his throat, and it was an Arabic arrow, one with feathers; and then I cut along that between two veins, and it was already submerged in his throat; and then I carefully removed it with that, and then I extracted that, and the Christian was healed.
And you extract another arrow from a man which had fallen into his belly, and I thought he would die because of it; and therefore, after thirty days had passed and none of his vital signs had changed, I cut along the arrow and removed it, and he was healed, and no harm came to him.
And I saw another man in whom an arrow had fallen into his back, and the wound had healed over it, and after almost seven years, the arrow emerged from the flesh of the body.
And I saw a woman to whom an arrow had pierced her belly, and the wound had healed inside her, and she did not change in any of her habits, and the woman did not suffer any injury in any of her natural functions.
And I saw another man to whom an arrow had pierced his face, and the wound had healed, and the arrow had broken off inside him, not finding any pain here, and similar to this case.
And the arrow was extracted from the king's main man, which had struck in the middle of his nose and had already inclined slightly to the right side, and the entire arrow was hidden.
And I was called to treat him almost immediately after the arrow incident, within three days.
And then I found the arrow wound very narrow; and then I probed it with a fine probe, but I did not feel anything; however, he felt a prick below his right ear, and then I suspected that this prick was caused by the tip of the arrow.
And I applied an ointment to the area that has attracting and digestive properties, making sure that the area swells so that the location of the arrow becomes apparent to me, for it will dry out over that.
And no incident occurred in the place where the arrow hit; and I continued with the poultice on him for several days, and no incident happened; and the wound was healing meanwhile, and after some time the patient recovered from the arrow's extraction until one day he felt the arrow inside his nose and told me this.
And then I applied a sharp, corrosive medicine to the wound for several days until an opening formed; with a probe I explored it and found the end of the subtle arrowhead, which was attached to the shaft.
And I adjusted the sharp medicine into the wound's opening until the arrowhead's end became visible to me; and time passed with this for four months.
And since the wound had widened and it was possible for me to insert the forceps into it, I left them there and they did not fall out. Then I did not cease trying and inventing with various devices until one day I succeeded in removing it with a pair of small forceps, as will be described later in this chapter. After that, I healed the wound.
"And some doctors believed that the cartilage of the nose could not be restored, but I have restored it, and the wound has healed, and the patient has been cured entirely, and there is no further cause for concern about them.
"And I will explain to you the method of extracting some arrows so that you may follow this rule and understanding for what has not been said, because the divisions of this art and its definitions cannot be grasped through narrative or learned from books alone.
"The wise craftsman compares few words; and what is present to what is absent; and discovers new operations and new instruments for the understanding of the foreign causes of the art when it occurs.
"Therefore, I say that arrows are not removed from the members in which they are stuck except in two ways: either by drawing out the point from where it entered, or by the opposite of the other part.
"And that which is thrust through the point of entry, either it is a fleshy arrow and is pulled out and extracted.
"And if it does not obey immediate extraction at the time of capture, then you should leave it for some days until the flesh around it becomes softer, and thus its removal will be easier.
And similarly, if there is an incision in the bone and it does not obey you with healing, then leave that alone for some days and irrigate it with traction and motion every day, and it will heal properly.
And if it does not obey the treatment after some days, then you should bore around the arrow in that bone from all sides with a thin awl until the place is enlarged by the arrow, and then remove it.
Based on the given context and similarities with Latin, Italian, Spanish, and French, here's my attempt to translate the sentence:
And if you cannot reach the patient due to the constriction of the wound and the length of the arrow, and there are no bones, nerves, or veins in the way, then you should cut into the wound until it is sufficiently enlarged and it becomes possible to extract the arrow.
And if there are ears by which it is held, then you should free the flesh in which it is embedded from all sides with all the strength you can muster; and devise a way to extract it, if you cannot do so through the removal of the flesh due to the fracture of the ears or their twisting, until you achieve this.
And when you proceed with the extraction of the arrow in whatever location it is, then you should use a twisting motion with your hand and forceps from all sides until it submits; and be careful with great care that the arrow is not broken and that this extraction is done skillfully and with difficulty for both the patient and the extraction.
And if you cannot extract it at that time, then you should leave it for some days until the surrounding parts are softened, and then attempt the extraction again when the wound has eased. But if there is bleeding in response to your efforts, then you should administer what we have said about healing in its own chapter.
Based on the provided text, here's my best guess at translating the given sentence:
Here's the line-by-line translation of the given sentence: Here's my guess at translating this line:
Certainly! Here's the translation of the provided text:
Sure, let's translate the given sentence into English:
Certainly! Let's attempt to translate that line by line:
If the arrow's shaft is still in [the wound], then you should remove it with it.
But if the shaft has fallen out and you wish to administer an incision, then you should insert [a tool] into it, and if it is narrow, use a convex instrument so that it enters the concavity of the shaft's end and then remove it along with the arrow.
However, if the arrow is hollow (concave), then you should remove it using a strong instrument that enters deeply into [the wound], because the arrow has alleviated [the pain].
And if the arrow is poisoned, then you must cut away all the flesh in which [the poison] resides, if it is possible for you to do so, and then treat [the wound] with what is appropriate.
And if the arrow strikes the feet, or the stomach, or the bladder, or the side, and it is close enough that you can touch it with your fingers, and it is possible to cut over it, then cut over it while avoiding incision of a vein or nerve, extract the arrow, and then sew up the wound if necessary, and treat [the wound] until it heals.
The shape of forceps with which arrows are drawn out:
It seems like you're trying to translate a text from an old Romance language, possibly Occitan or another medieval language similar to Latin, Italian, Spanish, and French. Let's break down the sentence:
And from those, several spices are made, large, few, and small ones, depending on the size of the arrow and its thinness, as well as the width of the wound and the constriction caused by it.
Like a tooth, so that its penetration into the hollow arrow is relieved and it is expelled with it.
About bloodletting of the veins.
The veins for bloodletting, of which there are xxx, in the head there are sixteen. These include two pulsating veins near the ears, known as alhasain; two veins on each temple; and two veins located at the tear ducts of both eyes called aspicientz; a prepared vein in the middle of the forehead, and one at the tip of the nose; two veins at the throat; two veins on the upper lip; two veins on the lower lip — these are known as algelic — and there are two veins beneath the tongue. Here's a line-by-line translation of the given text:
And in the foot and leg there are three veins: one of which is located below the curve of the wild boar's back; and the second is called saphenous, and its place is below the domestic pig's leg; and the sciatic vein, and its place is below the wild boar's leg; and in the leg there are other similar veins.
The remedy for the veins near the ears is for ancient catarrhs, migraines, headaches, and old sores of the head.
And the manner of bleeding those [veins] is as I tell you: it is that [the patient's] head be shaved, and [their] head be rubbed in the occipital region in the place of both veins with a wide cloth and good friction; then tightly bind the patient's neck with a bandage until both [veins] and their places appear near the ears in two depressed areas of the head; and seek that with your finger, and if you feel the pulse of those [veins] with your finger, here is the sign.
Then you take the scalpel, and it is that which is sharpened, and then you introduce [the tip] under the vein in the hollow of the neck until the blood vessel comes to the bone. Here's my attempt at translating this line: And let the length of the incision be the amount of two fingers' width or around that; and make as much blood come out as you wish.
Then strengthen with poultices and leave it until it is healed.
And already at the beginning of this book, the incisions and their cauterization have been discussed.
But of the two arteries that are in the temples, the assistance of phlebotomy is for severe chronic headache and stubborn migraine and frequent inflammation and acute superficial ulcers on the heels.
And the manner of bleeding those is as I have recommended to you: constrict the patient's neck with your hand until the two veins are felt clearly and distinctly, and then demonstrate their pulse beneath your thumb; and then you may proceed with the lancet.
Then you raise the scalpel over the vein at its divisions above with your index finger, and introduce the lance carefully beneath it, and lift the vein upward; and incise it in the same way as you have done with the other two veins; and allow the blood to flow according to your necessity.
And then release the constriction of the patient, and place your finger on the vein for an hour, and then press on that knot and sprinkle it with powder, and strengthen it from above with a strong compression, and leave it until it is healed.
And already has been mentioned their memory, as well as the incision and attraction at the beginning of this book.
And thus the bleeding of the frontal vein is similar to the bleeding of the temporal vein for old facial diseases, migraines, burning, and foul-smelling ulcers.
And the nature of the bleeding is as I have told you; thus, the patient should strengthen their neck with a bandage until the vein appears. Then take the instrument called the trephine, which has this form:
Press the pointed tip of the trephine firmly onto that vein and strike it with a hammer or another instrument in this manner, allowing the blood to flow as much as you want; then release the perforation of the patient and strengthen it until it is healed.
And sometimes it is opened with a wide-tipped trephine, but it is not necessary that the trephine be very sharp like other trephines; instead, it should have a blunt tip, and it should be used in a transverse direction, because the bone is thin and weak and would break if the trephine is too fine.
Here's the translation of the given sentence:
And the nature of phlebotomy is that the patient should be holding their head with a bandage, and then you perform phlebotomy, standing above their head.
And the phlebotomy should be performed according to the length of the transverse, a little more with less phlebotomies, because there is not much flesh in that place; and if the phlebotomy is subtle, it breaks the end of it.
Then let the blood run as much as is necessary for you, and place a cloth over it, and hold it there for one night, and then unbind it.
But phlebotomy of the nasal vein is appropriate for acute fever and severe cold, and for diseases of the face, including migraines and facial redness, especially when it is chronic.
And the method of this phlebotomy is that the patient should hold their head and then you take the patient's nose with your left hand, take a fine long fleam and place it in the middle of the top of the nose along the straight line, because the vein does not appear to be felt here, and because the blood begins to flow immediately.
Be careful to remove your hand with the phlebotomy little by little and let the blood flow according to your need; and then tie it for one night, because that place is easily healed.
Here's the translation of your sentence:
And the characteristic of phlebotomy from those [methods] is that the patient should be leaning forward with each incision in his neck; and the practitioners should stand on the head of the patient, and the patient should be sitting on a stool.
Then perform phlebotomy by opening the vein with a small incision, gradually; and extract blood according to the appropriate quantity or according to what is necessary in that case; and then do the same for the other vein.
Then untie the ligature and tightly bind both veins so that the patient is not in danger of bleeding out, and let them rest until morning when the wound has healed.
And the benefit of phlebotomy from the large veins is to cure small pustules and blisters in the mouth, gum disease, bad ulcers and cracks, and also bad ulcers that are in the nose and around it.
And the characteristic of phlebotomy from these veins is that you should have the patient sit in front of you, and hold their neck with a bandage, and then turn back their lips and look at the two veins, one of which is on the right side of the lip and the other on the left; and the indication of each is by their darkness compared to both, and this is more so because around these [veins] are small dark veins; and then incise each with a cutting incision.
If there is doubt about which to choose and you do not know which one it is, then you should proceed with an incision on the larger and most obvious of them.
And make an incision similar to that of the two veins that are in the lips above.
But for the two veins that are below the tongue, the appropriate phlebotomy is to open the cephalic vein, which is in front of the clavicle, for diseases of the uvula and other mouth diseases.
And the way to perform phlebotomy on these veins is to have the patient sit between your hands in front of you, lift up his tongue, look under the tongue, and from one side you will see a vein and from the other side another vein, both of which have a color tending towards blackness.
And then phlebotomize each one; and be careful not to go too deep with your hand when phlebotomizing those veins, because there are arteries below them.
And the veins that are phlebotomized in the elbow are those which are customary for all men. The phlebotomy of them is done in two ways: either by applying the mirtilat or olive oil to subtly thin the skin, or by using a fleam with a sharp knife, and this is its form:
Here's the translation of the given sentence:
And this veinotomy is of smaller size and more subtle extremity, suitable for the veinotomy of subtle veins that contain fine citrus-colored blood.
But the veinotomy of the basilic vein, which is one of three veins, extracts blood from illnesses below the neck and collarbone, and also from that which affects the feet and abdomen.
It is necessary for the veinotomist, when performing this veinotomy, to be very careful and cautious, because below it there is an artery, and if he errs and pierces the veinotomy puncture, he will cut that artery and cause blood flow, so it is important not to perform this with a pointed veinotomy, but rather first with a scalpel.
And if the basilic vein does not appear clearly visible, then it is necessary for you to leave that [area] and move to another, or look for some branch of it; or perform the veinotomy at the end of the arm, because that one is clearly visible; and proceed with a scalpel as we have said.
Based on the given text and context, here's a line-by-line translation:
"And when you see, as you tighten the bandage, swelling in the area that you have sealed with a needle, then that swelling is swelling of the artery, so avoid it.
"And if you see blood flowing in the phlebotomy as if it were a child's urine, and the blood is thin, then know that it is from the artery; and then cut and place your finger over it for a long time; and immediately remove your finger, and if the blood has been cut off, because it often gets cut off, then tighten the arm and let it go.
"And protect the patient from their own urine, and be constantly worried about them, and do not move them for several days until they are healed.
"But if the blood does not stop, and you see that there is no medicine present for that, then you must cut the artery if it appears to you; because the extremity of it is contracted and the blood is cut off; or take a scourge made of figs, and make that, and take one half and tighten it over the vein with a binding and with powder until the next day.
And then, if the blood is cut, it is good; and if not, then cure it with the water that was previously mentioned, at the memory of the place where the powder caused the flow of blood.
And the incision of his blood is difficult in many cases due to the small size of the wound and the possibility of tearing the arm.
But from the dark vein, phlebotomy is performed to extract blood from the upper part of the head and the lower part of the body; because it is composed of branches of the basilic and cephalic veins, as we have said.
And it is important for the person performing phlebotomy to be careful not to puncture a nerve during the procedure; because if the needle hits a nerve, the patient will experience shock and recovery will be difficult. Some people are highly sensitive and may not feel the nerve at all, but in such cases, it is best to perform phlebotomy with great precision and skill, avoiding the nerves entirely.
And if the vein is between two nerves, then you should incise the vein lengthwise.
The remedy for phlebotomy of the cephalic vein is to draw blood from the head and apply it to the ailments of the eyes.
And this is particularly important: if you want the phlebotomy to be effective, use the olive tree or myrtle for phlebotomy; because it is the safest of all veins, as there are no large arteries or nerves nearby.
However, it is important to note that in some men, when the first percussion is not performed for phlebotomy, the swelling does not appear.
The first is that you should know that phlebotomy is administered only for the preservation of health and hope for recovery, and as a precaution against future illnesses. Phlebotomy should be performed on one of the veins in the arm, namely: cephalic, obscure, and basilic; and it should be done at the beginning of spring, after fasting in spring or autumn, and in winter around mealtime, when there are signs of fullness.
And let a bloodletting be performed on the third day or in the morning after three hours have passed since midnight.
But bloodletting that is administered should be done only when it is convenient and necessary, either at night or during the day, at any hour and time.
And children should not be bled until they are fourteen years old, and pregnant women should only be bled between the fourth and seventh month, and the elderly who have already passed sixty years should not be bled.
And before someone wants to be bled in any way, it is necessary that they cleanse their intestines with a lemon clyster if there is a lot of retained feces, so that the veins do not draw the impurities from the intestines, which are corrupt and harmful to the main members.
And patients should not be bled if they are suffering from seasickness or hangover, nor should they be bled during recovery from illness or drunkenness until these conditions have passed, nor those who suffer from dropsy. Bloodletting should also be avoided in cases of colic, vomiting, abdominal pain, frequent urination and bowel movements, fasting, vigils, or any cause that weakens the vital force, whether bodily or animal.
And now consider in subtlety the humors before this, if the blood is thick, with foods and drinks, and with medicines if it is suitable for them.
And then enter into a bath if nothing prevents you from doing so, or exercise in some way so that the blood may be made subtle.
And perform phlebotomy on them at the foot of the bed in the morning, around the third hour, as we have said.
And ensure that the patient's feet are protected from all bad animal accidents on that day, such as distress, anger, fear, and from all bodily accidents, such as work and unnecessary suffering, sex, and similar things.
And at his bedside, let there be present the causes of which run in the custom of men with fragrant things and pleasant smells, and with balms and similar things according to their ability.
And let the phlebotomist sit on a cushion that is higher than the cushion of the one who needs to be bled.
And then withdraw your arm and rub it with your hand two or three times, the phlebotomist; and then tighten the ligature with a cord and wrap it around twice.
And if the stricture is mild, because the stricture when it is not equal or the stricture is with superfluity, then avoid blood flow; or it is with softening, and then avoid the body's emission of blood.
And for the stricture, it is necessary that he who must be phlebotomized rub his hands together until the veins are swollen and clearly felt.
And for the phlebotomist to anoint his phlebotomy needle with a little antiseptic oil properly; and then place the index finger of his left hand on that vein, below the location where he wants to perform the phlebotomy, so that the vein moves slightly, and the percussion is stopped because from the veins it is the one that flees like a rope you should perform the phlebotomy, and those are full of airiness and when you place the phlebotomy needle on it, it contracts, the phlebotomist is discovered; and the phlebotomy needle does not open the vein, and if it opens, that one is narrow.
Therefore, for this reason, the phlebotomist must be skilled and attentive to all these causes.
And then you should remove the flebotomy instrument, but if the vein has been opened once, that is good; otherwise, you should repeat this in another area a bit away from that place, or on it with speed, if the place is not swollen.
And if the place is swollen or the patient becomes weak, then you should leave it for a day or two and not tighten the bandage, because it will strongly draw out the swelling, nor should they enter a bath.
And then repeat the flebotomy if necessary.
And if the opening is small and blood flows subtly, and you fear that not enough blood will come out, then repeat the flebotomy in that spot according to correctness and adjust the opening a bit, and do this with speed before the place becomes swollen, because many men need only a little opening.
But if you see that it is already swollen, then do not repeat [the flebotomy] there, because no reason excuses you from this; and place on it some bandage with a little olive oil, because it soothes the body of blood. And it is better in this case to use olive oil than any other oil.
And similarly, apply an oil incision in all venipuncture, with which you should prohibit the flow of blood from the body's veins. This is done by Al-Fadl and Sagzanea when one of these is placed on the area, because the blood is subtilized and revolved when it is thick.
And if in the place of venipuncture a large abscess has formed, which occurs often and especially for those who have not been bled except that one time, or when there is little opening in the vein, then you cut [the abscess] and place on the area a sponge soaked in water and salt, slightly squeezed, and press it for an hour until it dissolves.
It is appropriate to do this near the issuing of blood from that vein, either at the completion of its flow or of another vein.
And if there remains in the area for some days any blackness or greenish color, do not worry about it; and if you wish, place on that some aloe and myrrh dissolved in something, or some juice of mint or calamus, or similar to them.
And often such abscesses and swellings occur from venipuncture of the basilica [vein].
Here's a line-by-line translation of the given sentence:
And make a plaster with water that has been boiled down to a syrup, so that the area becomes hardened, and then treat it with another treatment until it is healed.
And you should extract blood from every person according to the quantity of their virtue and according to the dominant color appearing on the blood.
Because if the blood is black, then you let it bleed until it becomes red; and likewise if it seems thick, then you let it bleed until it becomes thin; and likewise if it is sharp, until its sharpness is removed.
And for those who are full and strong and have a need to extract blood in one session, the phlebotomy of the vein should be increased and the incisions should be wide.
And in those who are weak, the opposite should be done, and it is necessary to extract blood from them in many sessions, and the incision should be narrow.
And the best thing about phlebotomy of a vein is that it should be a transverse cut, not a puncture.
And this method of phlebotomy is safe from blood flow and injury to nerves, and it is more praiseworthy and safer than phlebotomy according to width and length.
And for which it is customary to experience syncope, you must perform phlebotomy, and it is necessary that before the phlebotomy you treat him with a small piece of bread soaked in mead or simple oxymel; and draw blood from him three or four times.
And if it is a cold of the complexion, then before phlebotomy take bread soaked in myrrh syrup or honey syrup scented with spices such as pepper, cinnamon, ginger, and similar ones, or in very fragrant scented syrup.
And if you experience syncope during phlebotomy and it is due to the loss of a lot of blood, then it is necessary to drink meat water and very fragrant subtle syrup; use aromaticity with alkanet, and anoint your feet with it.
And use the other causes that we mentioned in the division of the chapter on syncope for evacuation.
And if one wants to raise their arm and dissolve their blood according to the second way, it is necessary for someone from whom phlebotomy is done for much evacuation, and whose strength is weak, to bleed a little at a time, in accordance with the amount of strength on consecutive days.
Here's my translation of the given sentence:
"But whoever wants to draw blood from the body, whether in the opposite direction of where it tends or not, must do so on the second or third day.
"But in the case where there is much blood already spilled and the body is weakened to the point of causing fever, it is necessary to remove blood from it all at once and in a large quantity, and the incision should be widened until a fainting spell occurs; because you will have preserved all the conditions for phlebotomy; and you must place your hand over the pulse of the patient while drawing the blood, so that death does not occur instead of a fainting spell, because multiple times this happens when the phlebotomist is ignorant and negligent.
"And it is not necessary, when you want to unbind the arm and remove blood a second time, with the orifices of the vein already closed and the flow of blood made difficult, that you press on it forcefully and that it be extended slightly; because this is too harmful.
"Keep the ligature until the second phlebotomy; or leave it with the acuity of the phlebotomist who has coagulated the blood in the vein's orifices; or place over it a piece of theriac aloes, or sage, and compress it lightly until the blood has stopped flowing.
And if the vein is inflamed, then let it be and do not touch it until the inflammation has subsided.
And if the necessity compels you to let out blood from that place, and there is no excuse, then bleed from that same spot or from another vein in the other arm.
And the vein called "funis del bras" (cord of the arm) is phlebotomized in place of the cephalic or basilic veins, when they are not found or are hidden, because it is composed of these.
And the quality of its phlebotomy is that the patient places their hand in hot water until the vein appears prominently and reddens.
Then it should be tightly bound with a bandage of medium strength; and then it should be phlebotomized according to the small transverse vein, not longitudinally or along its length.
And let the incision be wide, and your phlebotomy with which you phlebotomize that vein should be a small one on the hand joint.
And if the blood flow is obstructed, then you should immerse your hand in hot water and let the blood run into the water until you achieve your necessity.
"However, if it is during the summer days, then you are exempt from repeating the hand in hot water, and instead the body of the patient is placed in hot water during winter.
"And the phlebotomy of this vein is safer than that of all other veins, because after it there is no pulsating vein or nerve.
"And the phlebotomy of the little finger on the right hand is beneficial for liver diseases.
"And the quality of the phlebotomy is that you strengthen the hand with a ligature or with your own hand, once it has been placed in hot water, until the vein is inflated and clearly visible; then you perform the phlebotomy transversely; and if any portion remains uncut, this will not cause harm.
"And be careful not to end the phlebotomy with your hand, because afterwards the nerves of the aforementioned are bare and exposed.
"And then repeat the hand in hot water and allow the blood to flow into it, because if you do not repeat this in hot water, the blood will coagulate at the opening of the vein, and its flow will be prevented.
And when the blood is extracted according to the necessary quantity, then place oil and salt on the vein so that it does not become clotted immediately; similarly, you should do this in all narrow veins.
However, the benefit of phlebotomy on the left hand is that it is suitable for treating diseases of the spleen.
Do the same in the phlebotomy of this one as you have done in the other.
And the benefit of phlebotomy on the saphenous vein is for diseases that are in the lower part of the body, such as diseases of the womb, and retained menstruation, and diseases of the ankles and old ulcers of the thighs and their resemblances.
And the method of this phlebotomy is that the patient submerges their foot in hot water and makes friction on it until the veins appear; and binds the ankle with a bandage; and where the vein appears, you should prick with your finger, and from there, many small branches spread out on the surface of the foot.
Therefore, you should phlebotomize the largest vein or one of the veins below the thigh near the ankle, because it is better and safer.
And if you perform phlebotomy on the surface of the foot, then be careful not to cut through the nerves that lie beneath the skin on the surface of the foot. Perform your phlebotomy with the instrument that you use for cutting, as if you were trying to make an incision.
It appears that the text is in Occitan, an ancient Romance language once spoken in southern France. Let's translate this line:
If the emission of blood is forbidden, then you should immerse his foot in hot water and allow the blood to flow until it is evacuated.
And if the phlebotomist errs in the first attempt, then try again with the phlebotomy a little bit more, because the area is healed; and do not fear the patient's malice, but be careful of the nerves as we have said.
Similarly, do the same with the saphenous vein of the other foot.
And for the sciatic vein, the location is likewise beneath the heel near the wild junction.
The remedy for his phlebotomy is to apply cupping at the hip when it is filled with blood.
The quality of his phlebotomy is that the patient should enter a bath, and hurry and strengthen the bandage on his thigh from the hip down to the heel in four words in a long, subtle bandage, so that it appears only as water.
And therefore, when it appears, then you should phlebotomize that according to each method possible and according to the transverse vein, which is better; or you can incise it by incision or dry it by drying, because the area of him is healed.
It looks like you've provided a sentence in an old Romance language that is somewhat similar to Latin and other modern Romance languages. Let’s break it down line by line:
And be careful of the nerves, and let as much blood flow out as you want.
Then immediately loosen the constriction and place a cloth over the phlebotomy site and strengthen the area, for it heals easily.
On venesection and on the qualities of using these methods.
There are three types of venesections: by horns, by iron, or by glass.
And venesection is done in two ways: one is with scarification and bloodletting, and the other is venesection without scarification.
And this type of venesection without scarification is done in two ways, either with fire or without fire.
And in the parts of the body where venesections are administered with scarification and bloodletting there are fourteen locations, one of which is called alnocrati, and it is at the back of the head; another location is halfway between the two sides of the neck; another is a venesection of the chin below the jawbone and below the mouth; another is a venesection of the two scapulae; another is a venesection of the alohoster, which is at the end of the ribcage; another is a venesection of the two fingers; another is a venesection of the two elbows; another is a venesection of the two ankles; and another is a venesection of the two thighs.
Based on the pattern and context, here's a line-by-line translation of the given text:
Based on the context and the pattern of the previous translations, here's my guess at the translation for this sentence:
And therefore, when experiencing these causes, especially if it is in the third or middle of the month, then it is commanded that bloodletting be performed because those hours have passed during the day for two or three hours.
And the benefit of bloodletting from the neck is that when you direct it toward the head, it relieves pressure in the head and drains into the veins; but it is better for this to be an evacuation of the entire body.
And this bloodletting should be done in the area for phlebotomy of the cephalic vein.
And it is not appropriate to perform this on someone who has a complete fracture or who has catarrh, because it causes great harm to that person.
And therefore, it is not appropriate to use this on the elderly, whose heads are broken by illness.
But if someone continues to experience this, then forgetfulness is done to him; and because of this, it is necessary for you to command the bloodletter to pause his hand with the bloodletting cup slightly before leaving, fearing the occurrence of forgetfulness.
But bloodletting from the arm is in the area for phlebotomy of the dark vein and the basilic vein: and by doing this, you address asthma, constriction of the airways, cutting of the lung tissue, coughing, and fullness.
And it is necessary that the fart is released a little, because if it is held back, it generates weakness in the body and the stomach.
And the fart of alhagdahan relieves headaches and eye problems, migraines, fever, and toothache; and it is used instead of bloodletting from the basilica vein.
And it is necessary that you command the fart collector not to press with his hand as if he were cutting, so that he does not cut an artery and cause bleeding.
And holding back the fart relieves alcohol in the mouth, and gum corruption, and similar conditions that affect the mouth, and it is used instead of bloodletting from the ala of the nostril.
But the fart that is made on both soles relieves headache, which is caused by an excess of heat.
And the fart made at the inner part of both feet relieves the need for bloodletting from three veins: the basilic, cephalic, and ulnar, because it draws blood from all the smaller veins in the flesh that feed into those larger veins until the blood is drawn to all three veins.
"And instruct the person performing the bloodletting not to cut too deeply during the incision, because the area is devoid of flesh, and only nerves and arteries remain.
"And it is a cupping glass with which one is cupped over the buttocks and it serves for the hemorrhoids of the anus and for the ulcers that are present there.
"And you should instruct the person performing the bloodletting to use a large cupping glass and one made of horn, because the area requires strong suction; and let the thin cupping glasses be removed, and let it be incised with an incision.
"But cupping glasses from the thighs should be reduced by half, for they draw blood from all over the body, and this serves to treat old pains of the hips, back, bladder; and it induces menstruation, and this serves to treat gout and jaundice; and they are used as a substitute for phlebotomy of two veins, under the arm, and from two fingers.
"However, they weaken the entire body and cause syncope in many men.
"And for cupping under the arm, the youth is similar to the youth of the cupping glasses from two thighs.
And the quality of the placement of the cupping glasses is that you should place the glass at the beginning empty and then suck with moderate suction, and do not prolong the position of the cupping glasses, but rather place them lightly, and leave them for a short time, so that the humors come to the place by natural process. And do not cease repeating this and continuing until you see the area already reddened and swollen, and the redness of the blood appears.
And then you should scarify (make small incisions) and repeat the suction little by little, and then consider the disposition of the body.
Because that person who has tender skin with few pores, it is necessary for you to scarify only once and no more, so that the area does not become ulcerated.
And command the cupping practitioner to widen the scarification and probe a little, and always suck with ease.
And if the blood is thick, then you should scarify twice, because in the first time the way of subtilization to the blood and its wateriness is opened. But in the second [time], it is for the thorough examination and extraction of the thick blood.
And if the blood is very thick, then a scarification should be done a third time in order to achieve clarity.
And recently, when we want to extract the blood little by little or a small amount, one scarification is sufficient for us.
And if we want to extract a lot of blood, we scarify with many scarifications; and if we know that the blood is thick, then it is necessary to scarify with a preceding scarification.
And the term "scarification" refers only to the depth of the knife's blade.
And if the person whose vein is thick, hard, dark, and whose pores are narrow, it is necessary that the places for cupping be treated with gentler, more open, and resolving substances; in summer, such as oil of aloe or oil of violet, or oil of sweet almonds, or oil of cumin seed; and in winter, then oil of narcissus, or oil of lily, or oil of chamomile, or of hemlock, and similar ones.
And if the excess is thick and harsh, then let the oil be of amaranth, or oil of basil, or oil of aloe, or oil of anise, and similar to these.
Here's the translation of the given text:
And that one whose blood is of much humidity, wash its veins with vinegar or with water of myrtle and sumac, similar to those (methods).
And of that one whose superfluities are large, wash its veins with old vinegar or with water of sage, which is savory, or with a decoction of dill, or chamomile, and similar to those (methods).
And it is necessary that the bleeding be done before bathing; and it is necessary that it be administered immediately after bathing for one or two hours, and it is necessary to sleep near where the bleeding was done.
What is the need for a bloodletting person to be purged before venesection?
It is necessary to consider at the beginning: if the venesectionist or the person to be bled is choleric and has hot and inflamed blood, then it is necessary for them to take refrigerating foods, such as sour apples, endive with vinegar, lettuce, dried grapes, syrup of roses, and similar things.
And let them eat foods such as polenta, and meat of roasted birds, and foods seasoned with sour things, and similar to these.
And of that person whose complexion is cold, it is fitting that they drink an electuary made from almonds, or an electuary of sweet clover seeds, sumac, and a small amount of fragrant wine between Vespers and Nocturn; and it should be advised to them to use moderation in drinking and eating, and avoid foods such as cabbage, onions, leeks, small birds, and pigeons.
And it is fitting that during the day of venesection and phlebotomy, the drink should be more than the food.
And it is fitting that some men be given in drink at certain hours during venesection or phlebotomy, either theriac of alpharac, or musk medicine, which is mace, or achillea, so that the main members are comforted and the blood is subtilized; and it is not fitting that they take that scalding.
However, the bloodletting that is done without scarification should be performed on the liver, and above the spleen, and for gout, and above the navel, in the joint areas, and the armpit, because these members do not tolerate scarification on them.
This sentence discusses the treatment of blood flow issues by applying cupping to specific areas of the body. Here's a line-by-line translation:
And now it has been placed on the kidneys when there is swelling or inflammation, because by virtue of attraction it strongly draws out swelling and removes inflammation from its place.
And similarly, it does when placed on the liver and spleen to remove flatulence from those organs.
And these cupping treatments are sometimes administered only with suction, while other times they are administered with heat.
And at other times they are administered filled with warm water in diseases of the spleen.
And this is why the cup should be filled and be larger when it contains only hot water or water in which suitable herbs have been infused.
Form of cupping administered with heat: the diameter of the hole should be two fingers wide, as we have shaped it; and the amount of fluid should be half a palmful; and it should be placed on the back, in the area of the ribs, so that half of it is covered by clothing, and the opening should be small enough to allow the insertion of a needle.
It should be made of red copper or brass, with wide, smooth, and flat edges so that it does not disturb the member due to its position on it.
And place a bar of iron or steel in the middle of the stake, where a candle with fire is placed.
And let this enema be larger than the one we have previously mentioned; and the smaller one is according to the patient's condition and the state of the person using it.
And the enemas for children and weak individuals are different from those for young people and large bodies.
And the method of placing this enema with fire on a limb is to spread pitch with a decent amount of woodfire in front of a few beeswax candles, and place it in the middle of the crossbar in the midpoint of the enema, so that the fire is lit around the bottom part to prevent the patient's body from being burned.  (This translation assumes "extenda" means "spread" and "denant" means "in front of")
And then it should be placed on the patient's limb, and the finger should be positioned as we have said before. When the enema is in place and the smoke begins to rise from that opening, then the enema will quickly dissolve.
And prepare the pitch according to its own method, and redo it if necessary.
Based on the pattern from the previous text, here's a line-by-line translation of the given sentence:
And this is its shape: The larger this bladder, the better it is, because it can hold more water.
Chapter .97
Sanguijuelas (leeches) are not applied to every member, but only to those in which the position of cupping glasses is not possible due to their smallness, such as the sole of the foot and the gums; or in members that have lost flesh, such as the tip of the tongue and the nose.
And the quality of using them is that you should look for leeches in clean, running waters, such as springs or rivers.
And then they should be left in water day and night until they are hungry, and there is no waste in their stomachs. Then the body should be evacuated at the beginning with phlebotomy and cupping glasses, and then the patient's limbs should be rubbed until they turn red, and then the leeches should be placed on them.
And when they are full and fall off.
If it is possible to suck the area with a cupping glass afterwards, it will be more effective in healing.
And if not, then wash the area with vinegar and warm water; and rub it and squeeze it out.
And if the flow of blood is prolonged near the bite of the leeches and it bleeds, then you should dip a cloth in cold water, and place that on top until the bleeding stops.
And if the blood is abundant, then sprinkle on it powdered vitriol or similar stiptic agents, until the blood is stopped; or place cooked broad beans over the area and let them sit until they stick to the area and the bleeding stops.
And it is necessary, when possible, to replace the leeches, doing so by iteration [repeating the process].
And if the leeches are prohibited from sucking, then moisten the area with fresh blood or place a needle in the spot until blood comes out; and afterwards they should be placed [back on], because as soon as they sense some blood, they will attach themselves again.
And when you want them to fall off, sprinkle a little powdered aloe, salt, or ashes on them and they will quickly fall off.
Here begins the prologue of the third part: on restoration. This chapter is very often necessary in the art of medicine, and it deals with the restoration of bone fractures and joint dislocations that occur accidentally.
Oh, son, know that many foolish doctors and common people boast about this chapter, those who never look at the ancient books nor read a single letter from them.
And because of this, the way of the wise in our land has been neglected; and I have not forgotten it at any time but completely; and I have not added anything to what follows, except from the lengthy study of the ancient books and reflection on their meaning, until I extracted the science from them.
And I directed my efforts and studies throughout my life.
And I have already described in this chapter all that my science contains and on which my experience has passed; because here I have abbreviated it for you others and delivered you from the length of speech; and I have abbreviated it at the end of abbreviation; and I have shown it at the end of explanation; and I have formed in it many forms of the instruments that are used in it, as is done by addition of explanation, as I have done in two preceding chapters.
It looks like we might be missing some text from the passage you provided, as "Capitol primier" means "First chapter" or "Chapter one." This phrase is typically used to indicate the beginning of a new section in a treatise. If there's more context or additional sentences following this, please provide them so I can assist you further with the translation.
This text appears to be the beginning of a section on bone fractures in a medieval medical treatise. Let's break it down line by line: Certainly! Let's break down the sentence and translate it line by line:
And so I say that when a fracture, dislocation, twisting, or fall occurs, it is necessary for you to begin with phlebotomy or leeching, or both at once, unless there is some hindrance, such as weakness of the patient's strength, if it happens to a child, or an old person in decrepitude, or if it is very hot weather, or very cold.
Therefore, be content with a diet of tender herbs and the meat of birds and crabs; avoid heavy meats and filling yourself with all foods that clog the veins with blood, until you are sure of the formation of an abscess, and if you do not fear an outpouring of matter into the limb.
And then return the patient to their previous diet with which they were accustomed to living.
And so when the broken bone begins to be restored, it is necessary for the patient to be nourished with nutritious foods that are rich and heavy in substance, such as food made from boiled wheat, rice, cabbage, peas, cow stomachs, beans, fresh fish, fatty meats similar to these, and with this diet, the fracture heals more gently and better.
And you should know that brittle bones are found in men who are in their first youth and in the elderly, it is not possible for them to be continued and healed according to their nature due to the dryness of their members.
However, nature adjusts and connects the broken bone from all directions with a similar material called glue, which is thick and adheres strongly to it until they are fully joined and bound together, until they reach the end of strength and firmness, just like fire at its beginning, unless some cause prevents it from doing its work.
And for this reason, it is necessary to place food in front of the patient, food that contains heaviness, stickiness, and thickness, as we have said.
And you should know that the types of fractures are different according to the diversity of the members, for a fracture of the shinbone is different from a fracture of the skull bone; and a fracture of the foot bone is different from a fracture of the back bone; and similarly, all the other members are diverse among themselves.
And I come with a reminder of all types of fractures, separately explained in their own chapter.
There are various types of fractures within themselves. And the types of bone fractures are diverse among themselves; for there is one type called an arch fracture, which occurs in the tibia; and sometimes a fracture is made according to the length of the bone: these are the fractures of the patella, shinbone and metatarsals, both proceeding and non-proceeding, as it happens with a feather when it is prepared for writing. There is also a fracture with contusion and disruption in the head, and there is a small fissure fracture.
And each type has its own particular remedy or treatment for restoration, which will be remembered and explained separately in their respective places.
A sign of bone fracture. And by this it is known that there is a bone fracture: it is the twisted condition of it, and the protuberance and appearance of it to the touch, and also when you press on it with your hand.
And therefore if there is no visible twisting or pain upon your touch when you move the bone and the patient does not experience great pain, then it is not a fracture in this case.
Based on the provided style and context, here's a line-by-line translation of the given sentence:
And know that the area when it is bent and not split into two or anything else that does not happen to it quickly, as all parts of its counterpart are removed, then it is necessary for you to begin from your hour to correct the person to whom the abscess happens.
And if an abscess occurs to the person, then leave them for some days until the abscess stops; and then heal them according to whatever manner you can of lightness and skill.
And know that the restoration and healing of the person is lighter than that of the bone in which this abscess occurs.
And then strengthen them according to what their memory will be like.
But if the abscess is in the bone, then it is necessary to extend this broken member into two parts, whether it is the hand or the foot; or with your hand if the member is small; or with two cords or with one cord and the hand.
And place yourself in the position with which you hold the member in its natural shape, while the parts of the broken member are extended, then be careful to make those additions return with skill and in whatever manner you can in their places.
And be careful according to your strength that no pain or injury occurs to the patient due to your operation; and endeavor according to your ability to apply one bone with its neighboring bone in their best forms.
It is fitting that in that hour you touch it with your hand, and if you find any differing cause here, correct it and equalize it according to the amount of your virtue.
And avoid excessive extension and compression, as many foolish doctors do, who cause pus-filled abscesses to form due to their operation, or cause contractions in the limbs, as we have seen this happen due to the operation of their excessive caution.
Based on the provided context and similarities to Latin, Italian, Spanish, and French, here's a line-by-line translation of the given sentence:
And for those that are small, such as the arms, fingers, and toes, it is necessary that the bandage be made of fine cloth.
But for those that are large, such as the thigh or leg, it is necessary that the bandage be made of thick and hard cloth, because a thick and hard binding will connect and strengthen the large limb from all parts with strict compression, so that in it no bruise may enter.
And then begin, and according to your evacuation of excrement, place bandages conveniently on that location, over the place of the fracture with three or four bindings according to what the limb may need; and strengthen your hand a little with the bandage.
And then come to that at the highest part of the place of the fracture, and strengthen less so that your compression does not cause harm to the place of the fracture with which you have strengthened it. And then lengthen the bandage from the place of the fracture a bit, and gradually loosen the compression little by little, until you take from the place a large portion.
And then take another bandage and wrap it again over the broken place with bandages, and then come to the bindings at the lower part of the fracture; and let your operation be in the compression of the binding and in the loosening of that according to what we have said in the first binding above.
"And then place between the padding of wool or cloth, which should be large enough to accommodate the irregularity of the fracture if there is one; and if not, do not place anything on it for any reason.
"And then place another bandage on top, and then wrap around these bandages thin strips of cloth that are well-made immediately, if there is no swelling or abscess in the area, and then place on it whatever absorbs the pus and removes the swelling; leave this for several days; and then reinforce with more strips of cloth.
"And let the strips be made of hemp rope, well-formed and wisely, or they may be made of pine wood, or palm leaves; and let the width of each strip be according to this shape and this design:
"However, the strip placed over that fracture should be thicker and wider than the other strips by a little, and the length of the strip according to how it fits the limb in size and smallness; and then reinforce with another bandage on top according to your first binding, and then tie it decently on top as we have said about binding, and it is that your binding should be tighter closer to the fracture, and the further away from the fracture, the less tight the binding.
And it is necessary that the threads be moderate in thickness and fineness, and they should be of linen; and if the threads are thick, as I have seen done by some foolish people using their threads of twisted rope, this is a great mistake, because the tightness must be balanced.
And also, very fine threads are not suitable, because with them you will not achieve the tightness that you want, and it is not good for there to be more than a finger's width between needle and needle.
And if the patient is irritated by the ends of the needles near the tightness in their places, then place under those a piece of wool or cushioned cloth until it does not cause them harm.
Sometimes a fracture occurs with a wound, and there is a rupture in the cord; I will return to this subject in that chapter according to its particularity.
And know that no member is ever made narrow with needles on the first day; the reason for this is that if the member is large, it is not good to place needles over it except after about five or seven days, or more, depending on your certainty of preventing an abscess.
And this is the manner of plasters with which the Ancients restored [patients], which are placed over fractures, dislocations, and sprains.
Method of emplastrum like a poultice for the restoration of fractures, suitable for many complex cases and especially for women and children, because it does not cause heat or cold: and it is that you take powder from a mill, which is the bran of flour that sticks to the sides of the mill.
And prepare it thus as it is, except that you sieve it with egg white, and make the mixture not too thick nor too thin; and then use it.
Another method of emplastrum for the restoration of fractures, dislocations and sprains: take asafetida, laudanum, acacia, elecampane, and milfoil, which is wild yarrow, of each one drachm ten; of myrrh and aloe one drachm five; garlic one drachm twenty; let all be pounded and sieved and mixed with cold water or with egg white if the complexity of the patient is deep; and then use this emplastrum, for it is of good composition and restores broken bones lightly, and gives relief to many men.
Another method of emplastrum which you will use for fractures and sprains: take milfoil and half a measure of white heliotrope, ten drachms each; of myrrh and aloe five drachms each; of acacia six drachms; of Armenian bole twenty drachms.  (Note: "bol armenic" refers to a type of clay used in ancient medicine)
Certainly! Here's a translation of the given sentence into English:
Method for plaster on separated joints and bones from their places, and when there is pain in those areas, including cracks and breaks: take clean wool and soak it in vinegar and hot oil, then place it on the area.
But in this plaster, there is no virtue of restoration, it only stops pus and alleviates pain.
Another method of plaster for restoring broken bones: take fresh leaves of wild fig and wild poppy, crush them all together and make a plaster from them.
Method of brief plaster used for the restoration of bone fractures and when you want resolution of remaining pus: take equal parts of mallow root, chamomile flowers, violet flowers, and barley flour; crush them all together and mix with wine, if the limb is not cut.
But if it is cut, then make that mixture with water from moistened coriander or with water and apply it to the wound.
Another method of plaster stronger in resolution than the previous one, used when a hard pus occurs for the restoration of the limb: take equal parts of mallow root, lily seeds, mullein, melilot, marjoram, violet flowers, and chamomile; crush them all together and mix with willow water or sweet water or wine, whichever is suitable for the limb and according to its rest color.
Here is the translation of the sentence:
"However, it has been observed in Gaul that they are placed on the broken limb before its restoration and the causes of which there is dryness with a little heat, such as myrrh, mugwort, and similar to those causes we have recommended.
"A way to make a poultice for wounds and pain: Take an equal amount of myrrh, cypress, human hair shavings or feathers from a bird, althea, and salt; crush them together, sift and mix well, and make a poultice.
"However, the duration for which the bandage should remain and then be removed depends on whether there is pain or swelling, or if the bone is broken or has moved from its place; in such cases, do not remove it for several days. "But if there is severe pain or swelling or inflammation at the site, then you should cut or remove it immediately and take off the poultice from it.
"And take a piece of cloth and a marine sponge soaked in warm water, and immerse it in tepid water, and with that wash the site until the swelling ceases and the pain is relieved; and then let the limb rest for an hour; and then place on it wool soaked in vinegar and oil or rosemary oil, and bind it overnight to ensure that the abscess is cautious, and that the inflammation of the limb subsides, and the pain from it is removed.
And now apply a subtle and small plaster and do not make it too tight with your first constriction, and be subtle with the entrance that is healing.
And if you see that the abscess and redness and pain and swelling and all other symptoms have been entirely removed, and you wish to stop using the plaster and constriction, then you should apply it in the same way as you did at the beginning equally.
And if no cause of those mentioned occurs in the limb, then do not release it except after three days or four or five or seven; and sometimes all this is left for twenty days according to what you see fit for the release of the limb, as we have said, until the fracture adheres and approaches the coagulation of the flesh on that.
Then tighten the constriction more than your first constriction completely, and adjust according to the thickness of the patient's bandage, as is customary for them.
But if you see the place of the fracture has dried out and shrunk more than necessary, know that the nourishment is prohibited from reaching it; therefore, soak it in lukewarm water completely every time you release it; and do this for three days; and ease the constriction a little, and through this operation, the nourishment flows to the limb, and it heals slightly.
Here is the translation of the given text:
And I have not seen anyone do this, which is why it seems reasonable that it should not be done.
Second Chapter: On Fractures That Occur in the Head.
There are many types of fractures, and their forms vary, as do their causes. Some fractures are caused by blunt trauma, which shatters the entire bone and leaves a fragment, just like splitting a stick; this type is called comminuted. Or the blunt object cuts through part of the bone but does not penetrate all the way through it; this type of fracture is called a greenstick fracture.
The wound from these two types of fractures can be either large or small. Fractures caused by crushing or tearing forces are due to blunt trauma or falling onto a rock, and they have similar appearances.
And this type of fracture can be either penetrating, approaching the skin that lies beneath the bone; or it can be on the surface of the bone, and the wound from these two types of fractures can be either large or small.
And there is another type of fracture that occurs within the bone itself, in the subtlety of its fibers; for this reason, this type of fracture is called hairline.
And it is a fracture that is caused either by falling or by the impact of stone or similar objects, which makes some splinter of bone enter into the divided depths, and it is made in the concave place as happens to clay pots when they are hit and their entrance is divided into the divided depths.
And this is most commonly found in the bones of humans, such as children's skulls.
And for all these types of bone fractures, they are painful like scattered stars. And I come to mind about all this in its place.
And we recognize all these types of fractures by detection on the skin and by probing them with tests and removal of rotten flesh that is on them.
And the type called "capillary" is recognized by this: it is exposed on the bone, and washed, and lined with a probe, because the fracture appears black.
But in the treatment of fractures, first consider the accidents of the patient, and if by these accidents it signifies by clear indication fear, such as vomiting of bile, extension (of limbs), loss of consciousness, hoarseness of voice, syncope, acute fever, discharge from eyes and heat in them, and similar symptoms in serious cases, without a doubt, it will not heal.
And if unforeseen events occur, you hope for healing, then you begin the treatment of him/her.
The cause of which is that if the disease has begun at the start as it began and this happens in the winter days, then you should study the bones' ossification before the fourteenth day according to all regulations.
And if it is in the summer days, then you should wait to ossify the bones until the seventh day, having that which is below the bone be corrupted by the membrane, and that the aforementioned accidents occur.
And if the fracture has already reached the membrane covering the brain, and it is with small splinters and fragments, then you should incise the comminuted and fragmented part as I will explain to you.
And it is that you shave the head of the afflicted patient and uncover the bone according to custom and your ability possible according to the appearance of the wound, and let it be light on the patient.
And if it happens to you that you must detect the bone, flow of blood or pus cautiously, then you should bandage him with what is necessary, and that you fill the place with cloths soaked in wine and oil, and make the wound rest until the pus is subsided, and be sure of the flow of the blood; and then begin to circumcise the bone and remove it.
This means "And this should be done in one of two ways during the operation.
And the first way is to insert the bones with a narrow chisel like this. And then administer another chisel, slightly wider than the previous one; and this is its shape.
And then administer an even wider chisel than the second one.
And it is necessary that you have a diverse number of chisels, some wider than others and some shorter, and they should be very sharp at their tips, and they should be made of iron or steel.
And use them with ease by striking the chisels so that the head does not hit and injure you.
And if the bone is hard and strong, then it is necessary to bore a hole around it before you administer the chisels with the drills, which are called non-piercing drills.
And they are not called this way only because those [drills] do not pierce through the bone to its other end, but also because the drill has a rounded tip or edge near its point, which is similar to a small margin or circle, preventing it from being submerged and passing through the thickness of the bone.
And it is convenient that you take from these tools a large number of those which are suitable for the tip of each bone, until all of them are present to you in your head, with the extremity being sharp and the quantity in length and breadth being according to the quantity of tips of these bones.
And this is the way to use three types of tools: The quality of perforating in the circumference of the broken bone is that you place the tool on the bone and revolve it with your words until you know that the bone has already penetrated; and then remove the tool from that place, and put it where all through it takes the quantity of the thickness of the ray or surrounds it.
And then you incise with scissors that which is between each opening of the bone, and make it as subtle as possible on it in the end of lightness, as we have said, until you remove the bone, either by hand or by some other means using instruments that you will have prepared for this purpose, such as tweezers and fine forceps.
And it is necessary that you take care that the scissors do not touch any part of the brain.
And thus, when you have circumferentially perforated the bone and separated it from the brain if it is attached to it, and you have extracted it, it is necessary that you scrape and clean it with something rough from the inside of the bone using another instrument similar to scissors, but thinner and more subtle than other scissors.
And if there remains any fragment of the small bones and splinters, then take that out with ease using one of the instruments available to you; and then treat the wound with leeches and ointments as we have mentioned.
And another way of operating is light and far from fear, which they call Gaul's method and praise it greatly; and this is what he says: "It is necessary for you at the beginning to begin uncovering the broken part of the bone in the place where the fracture is most severe and obvious. Once you have discovered that part and placed beneath it the end of this sharp and swift instrument, whose shape is as follows:
And the lenticular part is like a lion's tongue and does not cut anything at all, while the sharp part protrudes from it on two sides, as you can see; so that the lenticular part should be fitted to the bone with the sharp face of the cutting edge facing inwards.
And then you should strike the instrument with a small hammer until it has cut through all the bone easily as it turns, and you should be sure of the skin that no accident happens to it which you might fear in any way, and if the patient is the most foolish of all men and the most ignorant of them; certainly, even if he was asleep.
The first source sentence means:
Here's a line-by-line translation of the given text:
And it is necessary for you to administer with your own hand using the hand with which you first placed the pus, and then approach him closely with a finer instrument, and do not stop doing this continuously until you have administered all the pus and the finest of it from all those parts.
But in each of the other small capillary fractures and subtle fractures, it is necessary to administer care according to what you have determined for their correction.
And it is because it is not uniform across all those who have studied this art. And we will now discuss what we have written about large fractures.  (In this case, "stec" is an archaic form of "parlar", which means "to speak".)
And if the skin is cut when you extract the bone, then it is necessary to take a cloth according to the size of the wound, and soak it in rose oil, and place it on the opening of the wound; and then take another cloth folded or tripled and soak it in wine and rose oil and place it over the first cloth, and apply that lightly with the pus, as much as you can without burdening the flesh; and then administer a thin bandage, and do not tighten it more than the wound itself.
And leave that person with this care for one day or two until you are sure of the abscess caut; then unbind him and administer medicines which are superfluous dryness, such as linseed oil and barley flour, and powder of violets and of aristolochia, and similar to those.
And it is that you make from these medicines a powder which is sprinkled over the wound, as they are dry; and generally, administer to him every medicine of the property of which it is that it should absorb and not sting.
And be careful according to your skill that the wound in your care is clean; and there should not be any putrefaction or other in it; nor let you allow any virulence to increase in it; for when it is attached to the panniculus of the brain, it corrupts that and poisons that, and it happens to the patient something malignant.
And it happens in the cavity of the head, as its bone is denuded and especially when its care is neglected, and there is blackness on its surface; and therefore consider if such accidents happen to the patient as we have said, know that it is pernicious without any doubt.
And if there is no blackness except from the medicine that is placed on it, and it is by the virtue of that medicine that such blackness occurs, then you should take one part honey and three parts rose oil, and with these anoint a cloth, and then place that on the cavity; and then cure it with the appropriate healing spices until it is healed.
Based on the context provided in the previous translations, this appears to be the title or heading of the third chapter of the medical treatise. Therefore, a possible translation could be:
"On the restoration of the nose when it is broken.
"Know that the nose is not broken but rather split into two superior parts at once, or one of those parts is injured, because within it there are two bones. The lower part is cartilaginous and does not break; what happens to it is only bruising, twisting, and swelling.
"But if one of the two parts is broken, then you should insert your little finger into the patient's nose and press together the fracture from inside with your index finger, and from outside with your thumb, until the nose returns to its natural shape. "And this should be done by you with care, and ensure that through your operation, you do not cause pain to the patient.
"And if the fracture is in the more superior part of the nose and your finger cannot reach it, then it should be adjusted with the tip of a small reed.
"And if the fracture is in both parts, you should do the same thing.
"And strive to restore the nose on the first day of the fracture, if possible; and if not, then around the seventh or tenth day you should remove the clot with caution.
And immediately insert into the tip of the nose a wick of linen cloth. If the fracture is in one place, put in two wicks, if the fracture is in two places, and let it be thick enough to fill the nostril hole.
And thus say some of the ancient restorers that the wicks should be wrapped in wool and changed every day, but I have not seen this happen; it is necessary for the wick to be wrapped in an egg white mixture with powdered mullein; and then leave the wick in until the bone has healed and the cartilage has hardened.
And sometimes it may be inserted into the nose instead of a wick, a small piece of cloth wrapped in linen, especially if the patient has a more severe nasal fracture and is having difficulty breathing.
And for this reason it is not necessary for you to do so; and if you wish, you can do this, or if you prefer, you can use wicks.
And if another abscess forms, apply a plaster to the nose with wax or cotton soaked in vinegar and rose oil, or with dichloracetophenone.
But if an abscess does not form, then you should plaster the area with a mixture of sesame flour and powdered iris, mixed with egg white; and then place a wool cloth over it, and do not touch the nose for any reason.
Here's a line-by-line translation of the given sentence:
And if a wound occurs inside the nose, then it is necessary to cure that with tongs and administer lead cannulas until it is completely healed.
Chapter IV
On the restoration of the jaw when it has been broken.
When the jaw has been broken and the fracture is not caused by a wound, consider whether the fracture is only on the outside and not split into two parts, curving inward. In this case, its cure is easy.
Therefore, if the fracture is on the right side, you should insert your left index finger into the patient's mouth; similarly, if the fracture is on the left jaw, then insert the index finger of your right hand; and with this, push inward the swelling of the fracture to the outer parts with facility, with your other hand from the outside of the bone; with this, you should decentralize it.
And if the jaw fracture is already separated into two parts, then it is necessary to apply extension to both parts according to what is straight until their union is possible.
And if there is a dislocation of the teeth, then strengthen those which you expect to remain with a thread of gold or silver or linen; and then place on the broken jaw a piece of wax, and then place on it a double cloth, and place on the large cloth a star-shaped bandage well made, or a sole of leather equal in length to the jaw; and then tie it above according to how you are accustomed to the tying of it and as is suitable for the application, so that it is not displaced.
And command the patient to rest and be calm, and provide his food in small portions.
And if you think that the shape has already been altered in some way, then take care of it and remove it on the third day; and then correct what has been altered from him and apply a plaster to him with powder of mills, with egg white, or with cumin flour, after you have removed his bandage, and place wool over the plaster.
And when this plaster is applied and attached to him, and the position of the bone is not altered, leave it there, do not remove it until he is healed, and strengthen the fracture; for many times this fracture is healed in three weeks.
And if another time an abscess appears, then administer the same things that we said many times in his healing until he is healed and the abscess is removed.
And if the fracture is with a wound, then consider whether it is a piece of bone separated or splinters, then be careful to remove those splinters with the same water that you use for removing those from instruments.
"And if the opening of the wound is narrow, then you should widen it with a fleam (surgical instrument) according to your need.
"And when you have removed those splinters and nothing remains, then you should cover the opening of the wound if it is large; and if not, place one of the appropriate plasters over it to encourage healing until it is healed.
"Chapter 5
"On the restoration of the collarbone when it is broken.
"Very often, the collarbone breaks from its front end near the muscle, and this fracture can occur in one of three ways.
"Because it is either broken, separated, or split into two parts without splinters present; and it is easy to restore in this case; or it occurs with splinters present, making restoration difficult; or the break is accompanied by a wound.
"And the operation in such a case, when the fracture is without a wound, is that you have two assistants present so that one holds and follows the broken collarbone, and the other stretches the neck towards that end.
And now approach to bandage the fracture with the above-mentioned splints so that it is molded according to its proper shape and has neither a prominent area nor a hollow.
And if you need more extension, then place a pillow or wool pad under the patient's head, and let its size be according to your necessity; and stretch and raise the furculum, and shorten the pillow with your hand until you bandage the fracture as needed.
And if you cannot pull the end of the furculum to the sides outside, because it has come to the throat, then it is necessary that the patient be placed supine on his back, and place a medium-sized cushion on his chest muscles.
And the assistant presses the patient's chest muscles to the sides until the bone of the furculum is raised and comes out of the throat, and then you correct the fracture and bandage it with the above-mentioned splints.
But if you feel splinters of the furculum and they are unpleasant, then it is necessary to cut into that area and remove those splinters with ease.
And if it is retained in the bone, then you should make an incision with one of the scalpels that you have prepared for this purpose, since you had placed under the furculum the instrument that serves as a knife; and this tool is made of wood or iron, and its shape is like this:
And it should be similar to the hollow of which this is the convexity; and its size should be according to your need for it, whether the bone is large or small.
But the length of it should be according to what is possible for you during the operation; that it has two ends like this, and one end should be wide and the other narrow.
And if the rupture of the wound that you have cut when you have extracted the arrow from the bone is wide and you are sure there is no abscess, then join the two lips of the wound with stitches.
And if the rupture is small or you fear an abscess, then fill the wound with cloths and dressings according to the size of the wound's cut.
And if you detect an abscess, then infuse cloth in vinegar, rose oil, and wine, and place it over the area.
And the entire time, make sure that the bandage is not too tight over the broken bone; for this reason, you should check on the patient every day. When the wound has softened or you see the bandage already loosening, then you adjust it and strengthen the binding.
Then place the patient's pillow under their neck, and place a small cushion underneath their head at night; so that with this, the patient's shoulder on the side of the fracture is raised, and thus the fractured clavicle is also raised by the muscle's elevation; or bind the patient's arm to their back.
And do not unbind the bandage unless you notice in the place pus or an abscess within twelve days.
Then renew the plaster if you see that it has adhered to it, and adjust it in the constriction and restore it, and leave it until the clavicle fracture is healed and coagulated.
And it is strengthened and comforted according to the month in twenty-eight days, and sometimes for some men it is done within that time.
Chapter VI
On the restoration of a shoulder fracture.
"The spatula has been broken in the left side of him, and it is not broken from him except at the edges.
"And so when it is broken in the place of him — and it is broken in the middle part of him — and it is not known except by touch, then according to the shape of the fracture, force it with his preparation and reduce that according to the natural shape in every way you can possibly manage.
"And then place powder of ground eggshells mixed with white of egg on the spot; and then place a doubled cloth cushion; and then place on him a thin board according to the size of the whole spatula or slightly larger.
"But if the board is concave in any of the places of the spatula, then fill that concavity with cotton wool, and then raise the board to make it even.
"And then strengthen on top with long strips of bandage wrapped tightly and firmly attached to the board, so that it will not be moved from its place.
"And examine the bandage every day; and whenever it is found to be loose, bind it again and strengthen and re-even the board if it has been moved from its place.
Based on the context provided and the similarity to Latin and other Romance languages, "jagua" seems to be related to the word "aqua" (water) in Latin. Therefore, it could be interpreted as a term for a water-based treatment or remedy. The phrase "sobre le sieu latz sa" likely means "on their back." So, the translation would be:
And the spoon is restored in twenty days or in twenty-five.
And when this number is completed, then you dissolve the ligament, and know that it is safe because this belongs to the bones of which neither the beginning nor the dissolution is feared.
And if you proceed from the bone place and put it under the rope, then cut over it, remove it, and act as we said in the case of a furuncle or an abscess if it happens here.
Chapter VII.
On the restoration of a foot fracture.
The foot sometimes breaks in the middle of it and that delays; but the ends of it move because they are twisted and crushed.
And of its symptoms when it is broken in the middle, it swells towards the inside and a great pain occurs, and there is difficulty in breathing, coughing, a strong fever, and vomiting blood; and it is evident in the cavity of the broken bone and is not hidden from feeling.
And its restoration is that the patient be placed on their back, and a cushion be put between their shoulders; and then press on the muscles of the patient, and adjust the ribs of the patient with the hands of two assistants, and be careful in the operation of it and in the setting as much as possible according to what is convenient for that, until the shape of the bone returns as needed.
Sure, let's translate the text line by line:
Here's the line-by-line translation of your provided text:
**Translation**: Chapter VIII
**Translation**: On the restoration of the ribs when they are broken.
**Translation**: Know that the fracture of the ribs occurs only in large areas such as the back, and at their ends on the front side, this condition does not occur except due to the fact that they are cartilaginous. **Translation**: And its identification is not hidden from sensation; you should recognize it through the following signs:
**Translation**: And the restoration should be done in such a way that you reduce the fracture with the aforementioned methods, as is possible, until it is healed according to what is needed, and then apply and strengthen the broken bones with a bandage, if necessary.
**Translation**: And if the fracture of the ribs protrudes towards their ends inside, then a severe pain and puncture occur in the patient, like the puncture that occurs to someone with pleurisy, and this happens because the bone pierces the membrane; and difficulty in breathing, coughing, and vomiting blood also occur; and this is difficult to cure.
**Translation**: And the ancients have ingeniously addressed this with many ingenious methods.
**Translation**: And of these, they said: it is necessary to give the patient foods that produce flatulence and bloating, so that the belly becomes distended and extended, and the fracture is pushed outwards towards its ends.
"But we avoid this so that it is not an easy cause to generate a post-cautery abscess; and if it does happen, then it already helps with that.
"And some say that it should be placed on a cupping glass and sucked with great strength; and this seems reasonable, but there is fear that the cupping will draw superfluities to the area due to weakness.
"And some say that the area should be covered with wool that has been soaked in oil, and pillows should be placed between the ribs until it is filled, ensuring the bandage is equal in width as you wrap it around according to its roundness; and then treat the patient with a diet of pleuresia and medicine.
"And if the patient experiences severe constriction that cannot be endured, and the bones puncture the membrane with a tooth, then fear for the patient; at this point it is necessary to cut open the area, reveal the broken rib, and place an instrument over it to preserve the breath, as was mentioned before. Then we should saw through the bone easily and remove it.
"And then we join the two lips of the wound with stitches if it is large, and treat it with dressings until it heals.
And if an abscess occurs inside, then cut and press powder into rose oil and place it on the area, and let the patient be cured with water that suits the internal abscess.
And let him lie on his back on the side where he sleeps until he is healed.
Chapter IX
Of the restoration of a fracture in the spine of the back and of the neck.
Sometimes it happens that there is a fracture in the bones of the neck, and later their attrition, and similarly in the spine of the back. And if it happens to someone and you want to know if he will be healed or not, then consider this: that if you see his hands already softened and stupefied and dead, and he cannot move those nor extend them nor strengthen those; and when you press those with your fingers or prick those with a needle and he feels no pain in those, then know that it is not healed, and such disposition is mortal.
And if he moves those and feels constriction with the fingers and pricking, then know that the bone of the neck is saved and that the patient will heal with treatment.
And if you see on the vertebrae of the neck something that appears like this and you want to know whether it will heal or not, then consider his feet.
Then if you see that they are already softened, do to him what has been done on the hands, and next when he lies down on his back, there is windiness and diarrhea without his will, and sometimes he rolls onto his back wanting to urinate but cannot, then know that it is fatal, and at that point do not attempt a cure for him.
But if none of those causes occur, the cause is better and lighter.
And the cure for it is that you pierce the abscess carefully and place over the injured vertebra a cloth soaked in warm olive oil, or with mullein flowers boiled; place this on it several times during the day until the abscess is subsided.
Then place one of the strengthening and soothing poultices, and bind it tightly; and command the patient to rest and be still, and not to sleep on the side where he feels pain until he is healed.
And if it happens that there is fracture of the bone or some other cause already separated from him, then it is necessary to cauterize over the wound and extract that bone; and next approximate the two lips of the wound, with sutures if it is large; and next cure it with some healing ointment until it is healed.
If the last bone of the toe is broken and it is the tip of the toe, then you should insert the said finger of your left hand into the anus, and hold the broken bone with the other hand as possible according to the balance; and then place over it a plaster and a splint if you have those, and then strengthen that.
If you feel broken bones in him, then cut (open) over that area, remove the shattered pieces, and treat the wound with the prescribed treatment until it is healed.
Chapter 10
About restoring the soul.
The bones of the hips are often broken, and if they break, the fracture is only communicated to their ends, and they are included in the length and inclined to the inside parts; and it happens to the patient that there is pain in the place and puncture, and the thigh becomes stunned when it breaks.
And the restoration of it is that you extend your hand over it until it is on the fracture, which resembles its shape.
And if the fracture is only in its end, then you should hold it according to how it seems appropriate by balance until it resembles its natural shape.
Here's the translation of the given sentence: Certainly! Let's translate the given sentence:
And fill the cavity with water until it reaches the narrow part according to equality, and command the patient to sleep on their back or on their side.
But if an abscess forms, then cease the extension and the restoration of it until the abscess is sedated. Place water on it to sedate as previously mentioned; then return to the restoration of it and strengthen it accordingly.
And if this happens in the shinbones or if they are broken, then you should treat them.
Chapter XI.
On the restoration of a fractured finger.
A finger is what is between the elbow and the shoulder joint.
And if it is broken, then its restoration is done in one of two ways. One way is to take a wooden splint of medium thickness like this:
And there are ligaments attached to both ends, and then it is suspended from an elevated place.
And the patient should sit on a stool; and then he should throw his broken arm over the splint until it reaches the middle of the splint, where the curvature of the splint is attached.
E immediately suspend the patient over something heavy or let the assistant extend the patient's limbs outward; and then the physician should grasp the fracture with his hands together until the fracture is set back in place as needed.
E another method is to place the patient supine on their back and suspend the arm with a ligament; then command two assistants, one of whom should hold what is above the fracture with his hands, while the other holds the lower part of it, each extending to their respective sides.
And if you wish for the extension to be stronger, then strengthen with a ligament on the fracture and with another ligament on that, and each of the two assistants should extend to both their respective sides.
Therefore, if the fracture is near the end of the muscle, then half of the ligament should be placed above the knee and the other half below the fracture towards the elbow.
Similarly, if the fracture is near the elbow, then place the ligament on that spot and on that elbow.
Engulf it with ease and without effort, and then when it is well enclosed as needed and applied by good application, strengthen it if an abscess does not form.
Here's the line-by-line translation of the given sentence:
And the way to strengthen it is to place a poultice on the fracture, and then wrap a linen cloth around the poultice; then align the arm with that support, and place your open hand over its muscle.
And place the cloth and strengthen the arm on the support so that the arm is in its proper place; unless there is some reason preventing it due to the broken bone.
And then use splints.
And it is that you should place on the fracture the splint that is wider and stronger than the other splints; and place between each splint the width of a finger, and let the length of the splints be according to the fracture with an addition of three fingers from both ends.
And then strengthen the splints with the strap that was mentioned at the beginning of the chapter.
And let your strap be tighter in the area of the fracture. And the longer the fracture is, the narrower the strap should be.
And thus if you see the position of the splints and the strap as we have said at the time when you restore the limb to its proper position, then you do it.
And if you fear an abscess forming, then leave the constriction and the swelling for seven days as we have said.
And then consider the binding in all parts for three days to prevent inflammation or swelling at the site; or it is prohibited for food to reach the member due to the disposition of excessive stricture; and therefore, correct everything as we have said.
But if you are confident that nothing will happen, then do not remove the bandage until after three days or more.
And let the patient's sleep be on their back, and their hands should be on their stomach.
And place on the aids full of wool equally, and always consider during the night or day that the figure of the broken member is not loosened or dissolved, or that the bandage is softened, therefore correct everything with your skill.
And provide the patient's food according to the order that we mentioned before, so that the food is light at first until the strength begins; and then it is necessary to make their food more substantial.
Because it is customary for the aid and the leg to be strong in forty days, and then it is necessary that they be removed and a bath be administered, and that it be treated with ointments which correct it.
And if the fracture is fresh, then do not move or remove the bandages and splints from it for one day or two months.
Chapter XII.
Of the repair of a broken arm.
The arm is composed of two bones which are called two forks; one of them is small and it is that which is said to be the thumb, and the other is large and it is placed below the small bone from the side closer to the bottom.
And very often only the larger fork breaks or the smaller one, and very often they break together.
And when the small fork breaks above, then its repair is easy and its healing is even easier.
And when it breaks below, the fracture of it is bad and its healing is difficult.
And even worse than that is when both bones break together.
Therefore, if the bone that is broken is the small fork above, then it is fitting for the physician to make a slight extension with ease until that bone is equalized.
But if it is the large fork that is broken, then it is necessary to make a more vigorous extension.
If both tongs are clamped together, then you must press the cautery much stronger.
It is necessary to place the patient in the recovery position with their arm extended on a pillow, and have their hand resting above [their head], because all the other things mentioned, and the auricular [ear] should be lower than the others, and the patient should be sitting on a low chair.
And there should be a pillow in front of the patient at their height or level, so that the patient does not encounter difficulty.
And then the assistant should extend the arm of the higher part with their hand or with a bandage, and another assistant should do the same on top.
And then the physician should envelop the bones within until they reduce them in the best possible way.
And if there are splinters in the bone fracture, then you should remove all of them from their place with your skill.
And if it appears that the splinter has separated and is puncturing the spinal cord and you are not hopeful for the patient's recovery, then you should operate on them and remove it according to the manner we have said above.
But if the fracture is with a wound, I have already dealt with that in another chapter, so take care of it accordingly.
And if an abscess occurs at the beginning of your treatment, then you should line a cloth with a plaster made of rose oil and white wax, which is midway between thickness and thinness, and place a strong cloth over it with a subtle tightness until the abscess has subsided; then remove the plaster and apply a prepared poultice made from powdered mustard and egg whites, and then place linen bandages; and let the bandage that is placed on that fracture be laid more smoothly and more strongly.
And know that the number of bandages for the arm can be in major configurations, whether the fracture is in one place or in two places at once.
Then apply your bandage over the site of the fracture more strongly and more firmly, and when the bandage extends to the upper or lower parts of it, make the bandage a little moister according to what was mentioned at the beginning of the chapter.
And the cloths that are wrapped around the fracture should be soft and moist, not hard or rough, and the thread with which it is tightened should be made of linen, midway between thin and thick, as we have recommended.
And consider the member and the binding nearby for some days. And if any cause occurs for which rectification is necessary, just as the cause that affects the member, then you should plunge the member into hot water until that burning sensation ceases.
And let the member not be constricted until it relaxes, and then the stricture will return.
And if the stricture has been softened and the bone has been moved to resemble its original state, then rectify all of it with your skill.
And consider whether the nourishment is prevented from reaching the member due to excessive stricture, for then you should soften it slightly and let it be for some days until the nourishment reaches it, and then strengthen it.
But if the patient does not experience any of the causes mentioned above, then it is not necessary to release them until about 20 days or thereabouts have passed.
And then the patient's hand should be suspended by their skill in moving it about, and make them sleep on their back.
And know that this fracture is restored in 30 days or in 32 days, or very rarely in 28 days, and all of this depends on the condition of the humors and the skill of the practitioner.
Chapter XIII
About the restoration of a broken finger and toes.
Know that in the fingers of the hand and the nails of the toes, there is rarely a breakage, and it only occurs after many beatings.
And when there is a breakage or injury to the hand, it is necessary that the patient remain seated and in front of him place a cushion according to its size, and then place his hand on the extended one.
And then the assistant should extend the broken bones, and the doctor should bandage them together until they are well united.
And then it is necessary to place a poultice and wool on it, if an abscess does not occur, be careful; and then place a tile over it according to the size of the area, and you have already wrapped that in linen cloth.
But if the break is in the middle of the fingers, towards the palm, then make it resemble a sphere of cloth, and command the patient to hold that with their broken hand; then it should be wrapped tightly with long cloth.
And let the tile of leather with cloth in which there is stuffing be applied to the palm, so that the leather is applied to the palm; and hold it as necessary. )))
Sure, let's translate the given text line by line:
And if a fracture occurs in one of the said toes, then if the toe is swollen, it should be wrapped according to necessity and strengthened with the palm. If you wish, place a small straight board underneath so that the fracture is elevated and not worsened.
But if the fracture is in the other toes, such as the middle toe, or the ring finger, or the little finger, or the pinky, then it should be wrapped and bound with its corresponding toe; or all of them can be bound continuously, which is better; or a small board can be placed on top, as we have said in the case of swelling.
And consider, in your restoration and also then, the disposition of a cautious abscess, oppose it with the appropriate operation, with what is necessary when one of those causes occurs, as the story is told about him.
Chapter XIV.
On the restoration of a broken pelvic bone.
The pelvic bone, which is usually observed, is broken and revealed by sensation as it turns to the front section and the upper part.
And its restoration is done thus: a bandage is strengthened over the fracture and another bandage below the fracture, and the patient is laid flat on their stomach and face.
And then have the assistant extend all the ligaments towards their proper position according to their quality when the fracture is in the middle of the bone.
But if the fracture is in the ribs, then the ligaments should be pushed towards the navel and the ribs, so that the extension remains below them, and leave the other ligaments beside the fracture.
Similarly, if the break is in the navel, then the ligaments should be moved towards the navel and the extension should be on the parts below it.
And then the doctor should join the bones together with both hands until they are properly aligned according to their natural shape and the bone is connected by a good union; in that case, it is necessary to place a plaster and bandage on it, lest an abscess form on the limb. But if an abscess occurs on it, then leave it for some days until the abscess has healed enough, and then return to your treatment. 😊
The bandage for it should be made as follows: wrap a hard cloth around the fracture, folding it two or three times, and remove any excess; then wrap the leg until it reaches the ankle and the base of the ribs.
And then introduce a long needle between the thigh and the hip near the pain in the divided parts below, and let the ends of the needle come out from the higher part of the two parts, and then revolve on the thigh and the hip what exceeds from the bandage.
Then place on the hip in the location of that broken bone, some splints, and place one end of the splint on the leg's bone.
Then fill the empty spaces between the thigh and hip with soft cloths, so that the constriction may be consolidated.
Then begin with a strong bandage in the middle on the location of the fracture with three or four turns, and as you move away from the location of the fracture, let your bandage be less and lighter and moister.
Then extend the two ends of the needle to the lower parts until they reach the ankle bone, and strengthen both ends of the splints on the other part so that the bandage is not moved from its place.
Then let the bandage rest on that (the splints), so that no corrosion or abscess or swelling or anything similar happens to the member; and if any of those things happen, then account for it with a reduction in its tightness, and correct what has happened as soon as possible, as we have said many times.
Here's my attempt to translate the given sentence into English:
And sometimes this fracture of the thigh is strengthened with splints attached to it, as we have said in the assistant and in the arm.
However, in the restoration of the patient in such a manner, limping does not occur; and if it is restored alone, or if the other leg is applied to it, then it is necessary for the one who has always limped to do so.
And know that the thigh is strengthened in 40 days or a little more or less, and all this depends on the diversity of complexions and other dispositions.
Chapter 15.
On the restoration of the fracture of the patella of the knee.
Know that the fracture of the patella of the knee often delays healing, but it happens quite frequently in elderly people.
But if the fracture occurs, it is only a fissure or hole in its parts, and this happens with pain or without pain, and all this depends on the sensation.
And its restoration is such that what is broken from its parts should be made equal with the aforementioned, until it is joined and conjoined as much as possible by equality and facility of craftsmanship.
And then place a plaster and press it onto that round area, if you need to; and strengthen it on top with a bandage as appropriate.
And consider all the measures that are recommended for other fractures, such as treating the swelling and similar conditions, so that you can prevent any accident from happening to the patient until they are healed.
Chapter XVI.
The restoration of a thigh fracture.
Know that in the thigh there are two bones: one is large and is called the femur; the other is thin and is called the fibula.
And it may happen to either of the two types of fractures that occur in both bones of the arm, and its restoration is done in the same way as the restoration of the arm, with one operation for both.
And if two bones are broken at once, the thigh becomes completely useless.
And if the thinner bone is broken, the thigh becomes partially paralyzed in front.
And if the larger bone is broken, it is found behind, and this is one of the causes that are not familiar to you.
Then apply extension, reduction, and fixation of the splints in the same way.
Certainly! Let's break down the text line by line:
Here's the translation of the given sentence:
Here's a line-by-line translation of the given text:
And then place the two bandages in three places: at the two ends and in the middle, for with this structure the leg is prevented from moving to the right or left, and it stays in good position.
And then a splint of wood is applied according to the length of the leg; and it is placed on it, so that it conserves that lack of movement.
And especially this should be done in a case of fracture, when there is proper pain with it.
And then examine the leg each day and study it carefully with the patient, so that you guard against abscess or swelling or other similar causes; and if any of those causes occur, then apply appropriate treatment to the patient until he is healed.
Chapter XVII
Of the fracture of the ankle and the bones of the foot and toes.
The ankle does not always break completely; but the bones of the foot sometimes do break; and the toes of the foot rarely break, and are not prone to it except in cases of dislocation.
And if the bones of the foot are to be broken and you see those bones raised above one another, then the patient should place his foot on the ground prepared as though he were walking.
And then place one foot on what is raised by those bones, and then press and squeeze until they return to their proper places.
And then place a plaster and cloth on top, and underneath the foot's sole, put a small board with two flat surfaces.
And then strengthen it with the foot using a descending traction, after you have wrapped it with cloths and other necessary materials.
And after three or four days have passed for him, then you shall unbind the bandage, because you will find that the bones have either reunited, or been crushed, or dislocated; and the procedure in these cases is as you know it.
But if some bones are crushed, then restore them and reunite them as I have taught you in the restoration of broken fingers. And then place on the crushed finger a needle according to its length, and let it be a little wider than the finger; and under the foot place this board that I have recommended to you, and strengthen it with proper traction.
But if what is crushed of the bones are two or three or more, then you shall place on each finger a needle of its size, wrapped in linen cloth, and strengthen the board at the sole of the foot, and it should be standing on one of the flat surfaces of the board under the sole of the foot so that it has good retention.
And it is appropriate for you not to forget to consider all the causes that were mentioned to you in other discussions about accidents; and approach each accident with what is necessary.
Chapter 18.
Of the fracture of the woman's pelvis and the man's penis bone and shaft.
When the woman's pelvis is broken, then make her lie in a supine position, and then incline her slightly towards the side of the back, and hold her behind.
And then the midwife should fill the pelvis with cotton, and it should be done in the pelvis as if one is pouring; and then the woman should be shaken gently, and her back should be raised little by little, because all this is forgotten until the pelvis returns to its natural position and the broken bone is restored.
And then place pillows under her back, and when she wants to urinate, remove the cotton with ease and then urinate, and return everything and bring it back according to the manner in which you used it at the beginning, and then return to her first pillow.
And do this for seven days or around that time, because by then it will be restored.
And if you wish, take a bladder of a sheep and stretch over the opening of it a reed; then introduce all of the bladder into the wound, and then inflate in the reed with air until the bladder is inflated within the wound, because the fracture returns.
And let it be filled with cotton and remain for some days as we have recommended, until it is healed.
And when the bone of a man or woman is broken, then administer in its setting and mending what we have recommended for the bone of the hip.
And that which is right is not hidden in these close fractures and happens rarely, especially to one who has some study and experience and understands this my book well; for that fracture indicates to you the greatest dispositions of a righteous path in its setting and stricture, so understand it well.
But in the man's penis when it is broken, take an eggplant skin, and put the penis in that; and then place over it a wrap of cloth, and let it be wrapped, and then let it lie for three days or around those, and let it be healed.
It seems like you're asking for help with translating a text that is somewhat similar to Latin, Italian, Spanish, and French. I can try to assist you with that. Please provide me with the text you would like me to translate into English, line by line.
"On the restoration of bone fractures when there is an injury.
"It is appropriate for the one to whom a fracture occurs with an injury, and especially if the bone is large, such as the thigh bone or shinbone, or similar, that you cauterize and fleabotomize it immediately if the conditions of fleabotomy permit, as we have said above.
"And if the injury causes bleeding, then it is necessary that you cauterize the area to stop the blood flow, sprinkling powdered white hellebore on it, unless there is another cause.
"Then begin to restore the fracture on that same day and do not delay, unless an abscess occurs.
"However, if an abscess occurs, then you should wait to restore it until the ninth day, until the abscess has subsided. Do not approach it on the third or fourth days, because you will cause worse accidents.
"However, if the broken bone is prominent and exposed on the wound, then it is necessary that you perforate to reduce it and make it even with your hands, easily and with little effort.
Here's a line-by-line translation of the provided text:
And it is returned (to its place), and there should be little roughness on him for fear of being doubled; you must consider this during the operation.
And let it be of sharp extremity which has margins in its extremities; and let it be above him, tending to thickness, and from the majority of him into the parts.
And this is its form:
And it is named in Greek "λαβρὴ βολήντες ἑλαρέμ" (which translates to "take the arrow from the wound"), and it is a small spatula.
Therefore, it is necessary that its sharp tip be placed elevated above the prominent bone's extremity.
And press it once until the bone returns and it is swallowed with some equation.
And so strive to swallow the extremities of the fracture between them, and if the broken tip is delicate, and does not take that instrument well, then it is necessary that you insert the end of that bone until the instrument has power over it.
But if you cannot reduce the bone completely with what we have mentioned, then insert it with what is suitable for it from among the inserters that we have named; or saw it with one of the saws in whatever manner is possible for you.
And then rub that which remains on the bones with roughness and small scratches.
And when the bone is reduced, and then the patient finds severe toothache-like pain, know that the bone has not returned to its natural place; and then do this, for you will confer great benefit upon the patient.
After completing the bone restoration that you perform, then submerge a cloth in black astringent wine, especially if it is summer, and do not place wax or any other substance containing oil on the wound, so that it does not cause inflammation or corruption.
And then administer steel needles at the time of completing your bone restoration, and leave the wound uncovered so that you can easily cut out the slack with scissors and use bandages according to the size of the wound.
And be very careful not to strain the wound with the fracture, for many times foolhardy physicians have done this and caused death or severe illness in their patients, which is unhealthy. And if the narrowing is slight, soften it, as it differs from the narrowing of other fractures.
And if the wound is large or it's a severe wound, and you fear bad consequences that we have mentioned, and you find pain in the area, then you should not place anything on those cushions, but instead make an envelope of hard cloth in the place of cushions and strengthen it with them.
And when after one or two days the wound begins to form pus, you should remove the cloth that was placed on it with honey and then apply poultices, ointments which are commonly used to treat wounds, such as ointment of tetrafarmacon and similar substances.
And it is necessary for you to loosen the bandage and examine the wound every day in the morning and evening until it is healed and consolidated, and it is important that the limb be prepared in such a way that the pus runs off it to the surrounding parts with ease.
if many days have passed and the wound is not healed nor has the pus separated from it, then know that here are the signs of the smallpox for which you should explore the wound with a probe. And of those signs that are separated and removed, those that are not separated and cause the member to swell and cause pain, force yourself to cut them out as much as possible for you.
This sentence seems to be describing a situation where there is some sort of corruption or putrefaction in a wound, and the appropriate action to take would be to apply a specific remedy that was previously mentioned in the relevant chapter or section of the text. Here's a possible line-by-line translation:
Here's my attempt to translate the given sentence into English:
It looks like you've provided the chapter heading "Capitol .xx." without further text. If you provide a full sentence from the medieval medical treatise, I can help translate it line by line into English as demonstrated in your initial example. Please share the complete sentence or passage for translation.
Here's the translation of "De la curacio de nodacio que accideys en le vestigi de alcuna fractura":
Motas veguadas accideys aquesta nodacio en le vestigi de sanacio de fractura, e majorment que es prop de las juncturas, e es orrasada per lu la figura del membre; e fort leu prohibeys le membre de la sua operacio natural.
Based on the given text and its translation pattern, here's a line-by-line translation of the provided sentence:
And let the constriction not be released for several days; and then release it and apply another, until the swelling is reduced; or strengthen that band with a lead sheet, because lead has the property of reducing all inflammation in the limbs.
But if the swelling has already turned into stone and is tight and necessitates being removed immediately, then cut it off at its highest part, and remove the excess skin, or rasp it with sharp tools until it is reduced; and cure it until it is healed.
Chapter 21.
On the restoration of a fracture, when it has been restored and then something remains subtle and frail according to its own nature.
When a bone fracture has been restored, and then something remains subtle and frail, it is not done except for several reasons: one of which is the excessive separation of the ligaments and their bonding, which was not done as needed; or by excess tightness of the ligaments until nutrients are prevented from reaching the member; or by excessive superfluous embedding; or by unnecessary movement at the wrong time; or by insufficient blood in the body of the patient and by their weakness.
And the treatment for this is to give food to the patient and make their heart tender until the blood is increased in them; administer a bath; and introduce joy and happiness to them.
And then place a plaster on the member, so that the plaster draws out the harmful substance, or continue to moisten it with warm water until the nourishment flows and returns to its natural form.
Chapter .22.
Of the treatment of bones that have been twisted and restored crookedly, and you should forbid the operation of them in this way.
When it happens to the member already restored near the healing of its twisting and prominence in the twisted bone and knot, and it is by this means that the form of the member is improved; nevertheless, the member is not prohibited from its natural operation, then you should not accept the word of anyone who thinks that this member has been newly twisted.  />
However, there have been many foolish doctors and restorers who have done this in our land; and this operation is most blameworthy, leading to great fear, the sign of which is deadly.
But if the limping and knotting are recent, then they should be moistened with warm water in which softening herbs have been cooked, such as leaves of mallow and roots of marshmallow, melilot, and similar herbs; and a plaster should be made for him with a softening plaster, such as well-made diaculium. Or let it be mixed with mucilage of marshmallow root and ground with egg white or oil of cinnamon, and make a plaster with that. Or let fats be taken and mixed with columbine leaves, and similar to those of the medicines which are called for softening and consolidation.  />  />
And at other times it is resolved with persistent light friction using the hands, and movement of the limb should be administered in all directions throughout all hours.
But if the curvature has already advanced and is made strong and converted into stone and necessitates a cure with iron, then it is necessary that the pus be drawn out first and the continuation of the bone be dissolved; and what superfluous from the knotting of that same joint should be cut away with subtle scissors. And facilitation should be administered in that area with solicitude and study.
Chapter 23.
About speech and dislocation.
A dislocation is the displacement of one of its joints from its original position, preventing movement, distorting the figure of the limb, and causing severe pain and injury to the patient.
Therefore, when a dislocation occurs, it is necessary to immediately attempt to reduce it and not delay the reduction, for if it is delayed, the place swells up and becomes difficult to reduce due to water.
And for this reason, it should not be moved or stretched at the time of swelling, because many times it causes spasm and severe pain.
When this occurs, it is necessary for you to be skilled in the art of bleeding the patient. Then, let it lie within until the abscess softens; and then wrap the limb with hot water and oil; and then reduce it gently.
And let every member be treated with the water from which the memory will return to its place.
And I have already ordered the chapters on dislocation according to what has been said about fracture, from the highest part of the body down to the lowest part.
Chapter 24
On the treatment of a lower jaw dislocation.
So if both jaws are dislocated; and the dislocation of both is done in one of two ways: either they are slightly displaced from their places by little movement, and they are softened a little; or they are completely dislocated until they are softened at the joint, to the point that the patient drools and cannot hold it or close his mouth, and his tongue is wrapped in its place.
But when the displacement is slight, then in most cases it returns by itself with little effort.
"But if the dislocation is complete and total, then it is necessary to administer a reduction to him gently, and not delay in doing so.
"And let the assistant hold the head of the patient, and let the doctor insert his fingers into the mouth on either side of the dislocated jaw, one finger if the dislocation is one-sided, or both fingers together if it is two-sided, while the other hand holds the patient's chin from outside. And command the patient to relax their jaw and let it go in whatever direction it wants; and the doctor guides the jaw and helps it slide back into place.
"And if the reduction is difficult, especially if both jaws are dislocated at the same time, then administer irrigation with hot water and oil until a gentle reduction of both is achieved, and do not delay the reduction of both entirely, as we have said.
"And when they have returned and are properly guided, and the patient's mouth is closed and not softened, then place a poultice of cloth with wax on it, made of beeswax and rose oil; and bind it lightly with soft bandages.
And let the patient sleep on their back, with their head resting between two pillows to prevent it from turning to either side; and do not force them to eat anything. If they have their own food, it should be cut into small pieces until the pain subsides and the jaws are no longer stiff; then let them eat whatever they want.
And let this be administered gently, and do not work on the opening of the mouth for eating, drinking, or speaking until the jaw is unstiffened and healed.
And if it is difficult to reduce two dislocated jaws that have not returned to their proper places, then many fevers and persistent sweating occur, the patient's stomach becomes greatly enlarged, and pure bile is vomited.
And when you see this, then know that it is fatal; and many times the one to whom this happens dies within ten days.
Chapter 25
On the reduction of the dislocation of the clavicle and the end of the arm muscle.
The clavicle is not dislocated from within due to its connection with the feet; and sometimes it is dislocated on the outside, which is evident by touch.
And the healing of him is that the patient should lie on his back and extend his arms. Then you should press firmly on the area with your palm, for it will return (to its normal state).
And then place over that plaster some powder and strengthen it.
But if the extremity of the shoulder and arm are continuous (i.e., not separated), it is not dislocated in any way; therefore, it should be reduced and immobilized as we have said, according to your ability.
Then place over that plaster some powder, string (or bandage), and command the patient to remain calm and at rest until healed.
And with this same treatment, the extremity of the muscle is reduced when it is separated from its place.
Chapter 26.
On reducing the dislocation of the muscle.
Know that the muscle is not dislocated except in three ways. One way is that it is dislocated from the attachment to the tendon to the lower part.
The second way is that it is dislocated from the upper attachment of the muscle, and this is done rarely. It is not dislocated at the attachments behind the shoulder nor at the attachments in front near the nerves.
This sentence appears to describe the situation where a joint has become dislocated and pushed out of its normal position. The difficulty in reducing (relocating) the joint depends on the amount of surrounding tissue or fat. Here's a line-by-line translation:
When a severe blow or fall occurs to certain men, and their muscle becomes swollen with an acute inflammation, it is suspected that the joint may be dislocated.
Therefore, you should probe this area until you are certain about it, and then proceed with the treatment of him.
And the dislocation of him is known when you tickle at the lower part; so that you may distinguish between the dislocated muscle and the healthy one, for you will find clear differences among them; and you will find in the head of the muscle a concavity, and after tickling you should touch the head of the muscle like an egg, and the patient cannot bring his hand to his ear, nor move it at all.
If it is dislocated, you should feel the foot or ankle, and then you will find a clear sensation, not hidden.
And from this dislocation, a slight reduction is made when it is recent and the patient is a child.
And the reduction of him is that the attendant raises his hand to the upper part; and then places his fingers below the tickling area, and raises the joint with strength back to its place, and the attendant raises his hand, and extends it forward; and then places it below because it returns lightly.
Let's translate the given sentence line by line:
And approximately the patient should be laid back on their own back and placed under the pillow of wool that is balanced between softness and firmness, and then the doctor places his heel on the pillow, and raises the head of the patient with all his strength, and pulls the hand of the patient so that it is not moved towards the sides, and another servant holds the head of the patient, so that it is not moved towards the sides, because that returns to its place immediately.
And if you wish, you can do it in this manner: have present a man who is taller than the patient and stands on the same side as him; he should insert his muscle under the pillow of the patient and lift the pillow until the patient is suspended in the air, and another servant pulls the hand of the patient away from their belly. But if the patient is light, then another cause should be suspended with them, in order to make them heavier, because the dislocation returns immediately.
And it can also be done in another way: place a long stick on the ground with a round head, like a pestle, not too thick or thin, and then place the patient on top; then place cloths under the patient's head; and let the patient stand according to the length of the stick; and then extend his hand to one side; and stretch out his body to the other side with strength, because the joint returns to its place quickly.
And if it is difficult to reduce due to all the reasons we have mentioned, then use this remedy: Take a stick whose length is two arms long, and its width should be four fingers wide. The thickness of the stick should be tapered at both ends like this:
And immediately place some soft cloths on top to prevent the stick from hurting the patient.
Then place the stick under the patient's thighs, and stretch out the arms or legs along the length of the stick between the supports, binding the stick to the supports, the arms, and the tips of the fingers.
Now place the arms on a ladder rung according to their width, and extend the hands to the supports below, while the rest of the body hangs down from the other side, because the joint is about to give way.
And when the treatment is completed according to whatever method you have used, then place a woolen pad of appropriate size under the thighs; next, apply a plaster made from powdered poppy seeds and egg white over all the muscles, wrapping it around as needed. Then bind the thigh tightly with a decent bandage; wrap the bandage over the plaster, and tie the patient's hand to their neck, leaving it undisturbed for seven days, without moving the hand.
And it is advisable that the patient's food be taken in small amounts until the limb is comforted, because it is easier for their healing.
And the food should be given more often, around seven or five times, and exercise should be done; if it is firm and not softened, then it is healed.
But if the joint is dislocated many times due to humidity that affects it or for another reason, then in that case a cautery with three holes should be applied, as was said before in the chapter on cauteries.
And if all this is done and after seven days the bandage is removed and the joint is not firm, and the plaster and constriction are applied to it several times, and it is still not firm and does not allow the arm to be raised above, then know that the nerves of the patient, which are at the top of the muscle, are already cut or stretched or softened, and know that the joint will never again be put in its place.
Regarding the dislocation that occurs in the feet and the breasts or the back parts, the reduction is done with traction and extension by hand, until it returns.
And administer it in that other constriction, and care for it until it is healed.
And if it so happens that the healing causes heaviness in the limb and slowness in its movement, then the patient should use warm baths until that heaviness is alleviated and the limb returns to its original state.
Chapter 27
On the treatment of shoulder dislocation.
Know that the shoulder joint is dislocated with difficulty and likewise returns with difficulty; it can be dislocated in all directions, but most commonly forward or backward. The dislocation of the joint is not hidden from you because it changes the appearance or sensation according to which direction it was dislocated. When you reduce the dislocated shoulder with a needle, this is clearly indicated to you, for the joint is concave and cannot bend the arm or touch its own muscle.
And it is necessary that you cut and reduce the dislocation as soon as possible, before it reaches the stage of a hard swelling, because if it reaches the stage of a hard swelling, the reduction will be difficult, and even if it does heal, it will not be completely cured; this is especially true when the dislocation is posterior, for it is the most severe of all types of dislocation, causing great pain, and many people die from it.
Here's a line-by-line translation of the provided sentence:
If the dislocation is at the front of the body, then return (the limb) in such a way that you fold the hand with its own hand, until it strikes the elbow with the back of the palm.
And if the dislocation does not obey the reduction, then apply very strong extension and a lot of force.
And it is that two assistants should extend the arm, and hold it in this manner with two assistants, so that it is not moved away from the extension.
Then the arm should be turned in all directions, since it is wrapped with a long folded cloth around the patient's hand or bandage.
And when the physician touches the joint with his hand, anoint that with some oil so that it may have those properties which help in the lubrication of the joint with ease; and then press the joint strongly until it returns (to its original position).
Then the reduction of it requires that it be placed on a plaster which has been made with adstringent and astringent properties, using egg white, and it should be drawn tight with strict pressure, and the arm should be suspended from the neck, and left for several days.
Then it should be unwrapped; and if the joint is formed in its proper place, then you can unwrap the bandage from the patient and leave it thus.
And if the joint is not strengthened, then you should apply another plaster and bandage, and leave it for several days until it is strengthened; then remove it.
And if something serious happens near the reduction of the joint and his condition is restless, then administer moistening in baths and subtle friction, and compressions until he is relieved; or place on the joint poultices, which are large cloths; and then bind it, and leave it on the bone day and night. And then remove that, and put him in a bath; and when he gets out, then rub the joint with cool friction, and then apply on it poultices, which are round cloths, once, and again, and a third time. in the mixture of bath, until it is softened.
And if you wish, place on it a wet and scraped cowhide bandage and bind it tightly; and do this several times, because that is moist and returns to its condition.
Chapter 28.
About the treatment of dislocation of the shoulder, which is the joint between the arm and the hand.
Certainly! Let's translate the given text line by line:
And the reduction of the dislocation is that you place the joint of the patient's hand on a table and make him extend his hand, and the doctor places his hand or palm on the prominence of the joint, and pushes it until it returns to its place.
However, it must be considered whether the palm is already torn away from the hand. If that's the case, then the patient should place the back of his hand on a table facing upwards for extension and reduction; and if the dislocation is towards the back of the hand, then the position of the patient's hand should be intrinsically on the table, so that the doctor's hand falls on that prominence of the joint.
And thus, if it returns immediately, that's good; and if not, then strengthen it with a poultice to soften the swelling and leave it; and do not repeat this, for otherwise, neither will you tolerate nor be able to bear the reduction of pus that follows on the next day.
However, the joint remains according to its twisted state; and do not attribute any cause to the patient, except that his hand is softened and cannot strengthen any cause; then know that the nerves are pinched or torn, and it will not be useful for him unless it is strengthened with a cautery near the site of the injury, and strongly you will give him some cause.
Based on the provided lines and the similarities to Latin, Italian, Spanish, and French, I'll attempt to translate this sentence:
But if the patient's movement is obstructed and they suffer some gravity, then apply hot water and friction to that area several times until relief is achieved.
Chapter 29
On the treatment of dislocations of said parts.
Sometimes these parts are completely dislocated.
And when one of these fingers is dislocated on the back of the hand or palm, then straighten the finger and push the dislocation with your thumbs until it returns to its proper position.
And then support the tip of the finger and suspend it above the area where it was dislocated for two days.
Then suspend it and extend it until it is straightened in its own day.
And at night, bandage it according to the aforementioned method, and do not stop unwrapping it during the day and moving it about, and then rebandage it at night; continue this process for several days until it is healed.
And do the same with water if it is dislocated on the back of the hand, and bandage it to that area and do with water the first operation mentioned above until it is healed.
And similarly, apply water when it is dislocated in other parts of the body.
Chapter .xxx.
Of the treatment for the dislocation of the spine of the back.
When it happens to any of the vertebrae in the back or neck that they are completely dislocated and have moved from their places, then there is no cure for this, because death approaches the patient.
And the sign of this is that the patient's bowel movement is involuntary and cannot be held; and many times some members of him are paralyzed, or both legs or both arms, or one of them; or a vertebra has been moved from its place, because sometimes it is moved and sometimes the movement of those [vertebrae] occurs in four directions.
Therefore, when it has already moved to the back parts, it is called scoliosis.
But the cure for it is that one should consider if the scoliosis occurs in childhood, because then there is no cure and it will not heal completely.
But for those that come from a fall or a blow or something similar to these, the ancients have already spoken of the manners of cure with long discourses, from which the most profitable returns; but I have already abbreviated it, because the little [that] escapes from the excess [of the text], for my closeness to my own understanding, with which I have explained and formed this from different instruments than those with which I will show and explain it.
And those are not cured except for the one that occurs in the back specifically with what I recommend.
And the patient should be extended on their back near a wall, and under them should be placed a moist instrument to prevent their feet from moving.
And then place a straight stick in the ground at the head of the patient, and another stick under their feet at the opposite end of the bed.
And one assistant should hold the stick and it should not be fixed in a hole; and another assistant should hold the other stick in the same manner.
And then wrap around the head of the patient and under their chin tie a strong ligature; extend the end of the ligature to the stick that is behind the head, and tie it there; and then pull the other ligature over the shoulders of the patient towards the back of them, and towards their legs; and then adjust all the ligatures and tie those in the other stick which is under their feet.
And immediately the attendant should extend each bandage to the base of the leg, and the two legs and their bandages should not be moved from their places where they are inserted, but nevertheless they are not fixed in this way as we have said.
And the doctor should place his palms on the spine with strength until it returns, or he can place a board on it, and then adjust his feet on the board until it returns.
But if it does not return in this way, then take a board whose length or width is about three spans, and make a hole in the wall next to where the patient lies so that the end of the board can fit through. Then place the majority of the board on the spine, and the doctor should place his feet on the other end of the board, and pull firmly until the spine is straightened and returns to its proper place.
And if you wish, turn the patient over on their side; and it is that you should place under the head of the patient two boards at the end of which there are two holes, the length of each board being one span, and place the head of the patient between the two holes; and let the distance between each board be one palm, and already in each board there is a hole through which to turn the patient, and each should be very firmly fixed on the ground so that it does not move.
And let a round stick be placed in which there is the turn, and it should be rotated in the two holes of the two sticks.
And at the end of it there is a hole in which the stick is made, with a length of about a hand's breadth when it is turned; and in the other two sticks there is something similar to that.
Then strengthen the ligaments that you have tightened on the patient's feet in the hole where his head should be placed, and the ligaments that you have tightened on their thighs around the turn where their legs should be placed.
Then there must be a minister by each turn who rotates the turn with his hand, and the physician should check the spine according to what we have said.
Then, after the spine has been turned back and the place checked, it is necessary to apply a desiccating poultice with egg white, and then wool; and then place on the poultice a board whose width is three fingers or about that, and whose length is sufficient to cover the swollen area, and it should be placed over the affected part of the spine.
Then it should be bound with the ligature we mentioned, and the patient should be fed a fine diet until they are healed.
And if there remains any swelling in the area at the end of the healing process, then it is necessary to administer medicines that soften and cleanse with the administration of the board for a long time, which we have recommended; and already in that place a lead plate has been administered.
And sometimes swelling occurs at the end of the spine, and it is believed to be caused by that dislocation; and it is that bone which has already become inflamed, so it is not advisable to make an incision in it with this medicine, because it will cause you to die suddenly.
Chapter .31
On the treatment of a dislocated hip.
Know that the hip joint and the thigh muscle joint should only suffer dislocation, and this does not happen as it does with other small joints and concavities.
And the hip joint can be dislocated in four ways, because it is dislocated towards the inside parts, or towards the outside parts, or towards the front parts, or towards the back parts.
And most often it is dislocated inward, and rarely forward or backward.
Here's the translation of the given sentence:
And the sign of someone who has experienced dislocation is in the parts that protrude outward, indicating that their symptoms are contrary to this condition.
And the sign of someone who experiences dislocation in the anterior parts is that they extend their affected leg according to its nature, but without bending it without pain in that part, and if they try to walk and cannot do so on those anterior parts; and their urine is retained and their groin is swollen, and you should make them walk on their heel.
And the sign of someone who experiences dislocation in the posterior parts is that they do not extend their groin, nor can they bend the part forward as much as they can bend their groin; and their leg is shorter than the other, and their groin is softened, and the head of the thigh bone should be moved to its proper place.
However, the reduction of this type of dislocation should be considered: if the dislocation is old and chronic, you should not administer reduction to them immediately, as it may not be fully curative; therefore, it is not necessary to rush into treatment.
Here's my attempt at translating the given sentence:
Based on the provided text and context, here's a line-by-line translation of the given sentence:
And if it is an extension of him or the parting from within to the point of the elbow to the parting of the collarbone, or from the parting behind to the parting of the back.
And let it be that all of them in one movement enter so that the patient is lifted with his body off the ground and remains hanging.
And this kind of extension is common to all four [extremities].
And therefore, if the dislocation returns with what we have said, it will be good; and if not, then all kinds of care that we will say about the proper treatment are necessary.
In the reduction of his own, when it is dislocated and the dislocation is on the inner parts, it is necessary for the patient to be supine on his back; and then place the ligaments over the joint in that place which is between the head of the shoulder and the place below the elbow; and then extend the ligament above the part of the elbow to the highest part of the collarbone.  (This sentence describes a method for reducing a dislocated shoulder by pulling on a rope or bandage attached to the affected arm.)
And then another strong minister take the arms of him, and grip the thickest part of the affected joint, and pull strongly towards the outside parts for a vigorous extension, because that returns it to its place.
And this species is of lighter cure with which this member is reduced than other species.
But if it has not been done properly and you do not obey the entry with this type of cure completely, then it is necessary to bind both feet of the patient together firmly, lightly, over both heels and both soles.
And let the length of each be four palms, and let the sick leg be extended more than the other by two palms.
And then the patient should be suspended from the top of the post, and he should be head down; and his distance from the ground should be two arm lengths.
And then command a strong young man to lower the end of the rope, and have another young man suspended with the patient, and the other young man pull the rope strongly and suddenly, because the joint returns to its place quickly.
But in the proper reduction, when it is a dislocation that has exited the body, the patient should lie on his stomach as we have recommended in having him kneel; and the bandage should be tightened strongly over the sick leg itself and over his feet.
And then two posts should be placed, one under his feet and the other under his head; and then posts should be placed in the middle of his back, on which wet cloths should be wrapped, so that the patient is not harmed because the post is between his thighs, for you must extend to the parts below, it should not be drawn up.
And immediately each assistant stretches out on his side, and the doctor with his hand guides the reduction according to the art.
And when the dislocation is at the front parts, then it is necessary that the thigh be slightly extended, and it is according to this same account on the buttocks; and the doctor places the palm of his right hand on the patient's knee, and immediately presses down on it with the other hand, and with that pressure he extends it backwards towards the back part.
And if the dislocation is at the back parts, then it is not necessary that the patient be extended backwards, and he should be raised off the ground; however, it is necessary that he be placed on a hard surface, just as it is necessary for the lifting if his ankle is dislocated outwards, as we have said about placing him on two thighs; and let him lie on his back with his limbs extended, as we have said, there is not much more to say.
And it is necessary that a compress with a board be placed on the area where the joint is.
Therefore, when the reduction is completed as required — and the sign of the reduction of him is not hidden from you, and it is that you extend both legs of the patient, and when you see those nails and the patient extends his leg and expands it without excuse, then know that the limb has returned as required — and at that point, place two cushions, apply a poultice and bind with a bandage so that the width is not increased in any part; and keep the patient at rest for three days or four.
And then remove the binding and the poultice, and compare one leg with the other.
Then, if you see those nails in their proper place, then know that the dislocation has already healed, and at that point allow the patient to go.
And if you see any sign of inflammation, then return and apply a poultice to that area, and bind it as before, and leave it for three days.
And then remove that, and make the patient delay walking on each leg for some days, until it is healed.
"Chapter 32.
"On the treatment of shoulder dislocation.
"The shoulder can be dislocated in three ways: it can be dislocated to the outer parts, to the inner parts, and more often to the rear parts; it cannot be dislocated to the front parts.
"And the sign of its dislocation is that you command the patient to apply their thigh to their shoulder; then you will know that the shoulder is dislocated.
"And the restoration for all its forms is that you make the patient lie on their back, so that they can extend their thigh if possible; press your hand against their face, and place their foot between your feet; then press the patient's shoulder with your palms, and draw them strongly towards the patient's shoulder, and another assistant extends their foot until the shoulder returns to its place.
"And the sign of reduction is that the thigh adheres to the shoulder with effortless ease.
"And then apply a poultice to it and make the thigh adhere to the shoulder, and then bind them together with a bandage for three or four days, and then unbind them.
And do not allow the patient to walk for a few days until they are healed and comforted.
But if the reduction of him to you is difficult, then apply strong extension with bandages, as was previously described in the treatment of the hip.
Chapter .xxxiii.
Of the treatment of talus dislocation.
The talus is sometimes removed by slight displacement, and at other times it is dislocated according to the direction, and its dislocation occurs either towards the inside parts or towards the outside parts.
And the sign of its dislocation is that you see the swollen talus protruding in the direction to which it has been dislocated.
But the treatment of its removal is easy reduction, and it should be stretched gently with the hands until it returns to its place.
But in the treatment of it when it is dislocated according to direction, it is necessary that you make the patient lie flat on their back, and let there be a strong and vigorous servant behind the patient's back in the middle part of him.
And then you take with your right hand the foot from the upper part, and with your left hand the lower part of the foot in the place of the ankle.
Based on the pattern and context from the provided lines, here's a translation of the given sentence:
And do this twice according to what we have agreed upon.
Then press the foot towards the thigh for the third time, and you are at the ankle.
Therefore, if it returns in one time or two according to this manner, and you see the foot swell, that is good; and if not, then upon him iterate the operation, for that returns.
But if to you is forbidden the reduction of him with what we have recommended, then make the patient lie on his back on the ground, and strongly fasten a heavy weight to the ground, which falls between his thighs, and you have already wrapped a cloth around him so that the patient does not burn.
Then let the servant of him hold his thighs, and then another servant extend the foot with his hands or with a bandage that lies on the neck of the foot; and then let each servant stretch against the extension of their partner, and the weight be extending between the thighs of the patient holding that, so that the body of him is not drawn to the parts below beyond its extension.
Then the physician swells the dislocation with his hands, and another servant holds the healthy thigh below, because the dislocation returns easily.
And so when the dislocation returns and its healing is declared to you, then place a poultice and secure it firmly with strong bandages, and bind the foot to the leg with a bandage.
And you should be careful or protect against the nerves located behind the ankle, so that the bandage over it is not too tight and does not press too hard on them.
And then leave it for two days or three; and if the bandage becomes softened, remove it.
And then unwrap it on the third day or the fourth, and forbid the patient from walking for forty days. But if he is forced to walk before that time, there is no certainty that the dislocation will not be reabsorbed and corrupted, and so it may not receive healing.
And if an abscess happens to him, then you should administer what was previously mentioned in the beginning of this treatise, in another section on treatment and application, until it is removed.
Chapter XXXIV.
On the Treatment of Dislocation of the Toes.
It is advisable that he who is dislocated be anointed with a little oil without difficulty; and this should not be difficult, but rather easy.
"However, if the dislocation is in any of the toes on the bottom of the foot, then it is necessary to make the patient sit with their foot on a level surface on the ground or on a table, and let them remain thus as if they were walking.
"And then you stand on your feet, and place your foot on something soft, like the junctures, and then press down with your foot with all your might until it returns to its original position, and you see that it is level and there is no protrusion.
"And then place under the sole of their foot a board that supports the entire foot, which has two handles, and then secure it with decent and firm bindings for three days; and then remove it and let them rest from walking for many days, until it is healed and the healing is assured.
"Chapter XXXV
"Of the types of dislocation that are made with a blow or with a fracture, or with both together.
"When any of these causes occur and you attempt to treat it and restore the patient, many times death occurs.
"And for this reason, one should not presume to treat it unless he is wise in the art, with long experience, merciful and compassionate, cautious, not rash or presumptuous; and at the beginning use medicines that restrain inflammation only slightly, and leave the patient to divine judgment, except for those whom you hope will be saved from destruction, with relief from illness, and in which you perceive some hope. And then immediately strive to make a reduction from him at the beginning of the cause, before an abscess is formed.
And then if the member returns as we wish, administer a regimen that will prevent an abscess and treat the wound with water from the desiccating ointments.
And if the dislocation is with a fracture and happens in the small bones, then you should pierce their surface, and do what we have said previously in simple illnesses concerning water in those places.
And guard and avoid, according to your ability, those things that lead to fear in the pathways, as I have previously instructed you; for this is better for you and more pleasing to your Creator, and it will bring greater glory and health to your body in your time. Thus ends the words of Al-Bukhari, may God bless him. Amen.
