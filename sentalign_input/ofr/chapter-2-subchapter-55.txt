On the blockage of the penis/membrum
Sometimes children are born without an opening in the penis, or the opening is small, or it is not in the right place.
So it is necessary to pierce it immediately with a very fine spatula according to this form/method:
Then put in the opening a fine nail of lead, and tie it and keep it thus for three or four days and when he needs to urinate, the nail should be removed, and let him urinate, and then replace it;
and perhaps it is not necessary, because the urine that comes out will not let it close.
He whose opening is small, is treated with the lead nail, as we have said, so it will widen.
Those who do not have the opening in its proper place are injured, for some are born with the opening at the tip of the penis, so they cannot urinate forward unless they raise their penis up;
and cannot procreate because the semen cannot reach the vagina, and this is a bad condition.
And the method of the procedure is that the patient lies on his back, then you extend the tip of the penis and cut it like the width of a quill, so that the opening falls in the middle, as it should;
and beware of bleeding which often occurs there, and if it happens, staunch it with something that stops blood, and treat the wound until it is healed.
