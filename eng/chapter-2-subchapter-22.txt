 CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO.
On the treatment of hypopyon.
 This disease which is called 'hypopyon' is a collection of pus in the eye which resembles cataract but is not so.
The method of operating in this disease is to make the patient sit upright on a chair before you.
Take his head on either side with your hands and shake it about till you can see the pus come down; then it will be fixed and not move; and the light will pass and the patient will see things as he was before.
But if it does not come down, we know it is cataract.
But if the pus is not ready to be brought down by this method, then seat the patient in front of you; then take a fine scalpel and cut a little above the corneal tunic near the coronal junction of conjunctiva and cornea, till the pus comes out.
When it comes out, instil warm water mixed with honey, or water boiled with fenugreek and honey.
Then treat as usual till healed.
