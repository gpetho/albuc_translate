of the flesh on the nose
Often a disease arises at the tip of the nose which is called "telul," and it grows and becomes increasingly large, until it is an unsightly thing to look at; and therefore you must cut it at the beginning, and remove it all away, then put the cautery or burning medicine on the spot; and if one delays cutting it until it is large, then take note if it is hard, dark-colored, with little sensation: do not touch it with iron for it is a cancerous growth, because when it is sometimes cut, great harm comes to the patient; and if the growth is soft to the touch, not dark-colored, and you see that it can all be cut out, then have the patient fast and cut it without fear, and treat the area with drying and astringent things.
