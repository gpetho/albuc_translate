Postquam compleui uobis o Filii, librum hunc, qui est postremus scientiae in medicina cum complemento ipsius, et consecutus sum finem in eo, ex expositionibus eius, et ipsius declarationibus, uisum est mihi, ut compleam ipsum uobis cum hoc Tractatu qui est pars operationis, id est, chirurgiae cum manu.	Introduction.
Quoniam operatio cum manu prostrata est in regione nostra, et tempore nostro priuata omnino: donec fortasse periit scientia eius, et abscissum est uestigium eius: et non remanserunt ex ea, nisi descriptiones paruae in libris antiquorum, quas mutauerunt manus: et accidit eis error et haesitatio, donec clausae sunt intentiones eius, et elongata est uis ipsius: Visum est mihi, ut uiuificem eam cum ordinatione huius Tractatus in ea secundum uiam ex positionis, et declarationis, et abbreuiationis: et ut ueniam cum formis ferramentorum Cauterii, et reliquorum instrumentorum operis: cum fit ex declarationis additione, et ex properatione eius quod est necesse.	Preamble.
Caussa autem propter quam non inuenitur bonus artifex eius cum manu sua in hoc nostro tempore, est: quia ars medicinae est longa, et oportet auctorem eius exercitari ante illud in scientia anatomiae, quam narrauit Galenus, donec sciat iuuamenta membrorum, et ipsorum formas, et eorum coniunctionem, et separationem, et habeat cognitionem ossium, et neruorum, et lacertorum, et numerum ipsorum, et eorum egressionem, et uenarum pulsatilium, et quietarum, et locorum exitus earum.	Since there is a lack of good masters of this art in our time, it is because medicine is a long field of study, and the author needs to practice dissection before his art with his own hands on the anatomy taught by Galen, until he knows the movements of the members, and their forms, and their connections, and their separations, and has knowledge of bones, nerves, and veins, and their numbers, and their exit, and their palpitations, and quietus, and places of origin.
Et propter illud dixit Hippocrates, quod nomen cum nomine est multum, et cum opere est paucum, et praecipue in arte manus.	And for this reason Hippocrates said, 'A name by itself is much, and a work by itself is little, especially in the art of the hand.'
Nos uero iam diximus de illo in introitu huius libri.	However, we have already spoken about it at the beginning of this book.
Quoniam qui non est sciens, quod diximus de anatomia, non euacuatur, quin iam cadat in errorem, quo interficiuntur homines: sicut ego uidi multos ex illis, qui formantur de hac scientia, et iactant se de ea absque scientia, et sine experimento.	Since he who does not know what we have said about anatomy will certainly fall into error, leading to the destruction of humans: as I saw many of them forming a science from it, and boasting about it without knowledge or experience.
Quod est, quia uidi medicum stolidum secuisse apostema scrophulosum in collo mulieris, et incidit quasdam arterias in collo: quare fluxit sanguis mulieris, donec cecidit mortua inter manus eius.	That is, because I saw a dull doctor cut the apostema scrofulous wound on the woman's neck, and hit some blood vessels in her throat: why did the woman's blood flow until she died between his hands.
Et uidi medicum alium, qui praesumpsit ut extraheret lapidem uiro, qui processerat in aetate, et lapis erat magnus.	And I saw another doctor who assumed that he would remove a large stone from a man who had been walking for a long time, and the stone was big.
Peruenit ergo ad eum, et extraxit ipsum cum frusto uesicae.	So he approached him and removed the vein with a wisp of hair.
Quare mortuus est uir in tertio die.	Why did the man die on the third day?
Et ego quidem iam uocatus fueram ad extrahendum ipsum: et uidi ex magnitudine lapidis, et dispositione infirmi, quod moriretur.	And I too had been called to extract it; and I saw from a great stone, and from the arrangement of the nurses, that he would die.
Et uidi medicum alium, qui accipiebat stipem apud quendam Ducum terrae nostrae propter medicinam: et accidit eunucho nigro, qui erat apud ipsum, fractura in crure eius prope calcaneum: et properauit medicus cum ignorantia sua, et strinxit fracturam super uulnus cum puluinaribus, et astellis strictura forti, et non dimisit uulneri expirationem.	And I saw another physician, who was taking a fee from our King for medicine: and it happened that a black eunuch, who was with him, broke his thigh near the heel; and the doctor persued with his ignorance, and bound the fracture together with thin splints and strong bindings, and did not stop the course of the wound's inflammation.
Deinde absoluit eum secundum desyderia sua.	Then he let him go according to his desires.
Postea dimisit eum diebus aliquot, et praecepit ei, ne solueret ligamentum: et stetit sic donec apostematum est crus eius, et ipsius pes, et peruenit ad perditionem.	Then after a few days he sent him away and commanded him not to loosen the bindings; and so he remained until his leg and foot had healed properly, but then he came to ruin.
Vocatus sum ergo ad eum: et properaui ad soluendum ligamentum: et consecuta est tranquillitas, et euasit a doloribus suis.	So I was called to loosen the bindings; and what followed was peace, and he was freed from his pain.
Verumtamen corruptio iam confirmata erat in membro: et non potui refraenare ipsam.	But the corruption had already taken hold in the limb; and I could not prevent it.
Pon ergo cessauit corruptio perambulare in membro, donec periit.	Then the corruption ceased to spread in the limb until he died.
Et uidi medicum alium, qui perforauit apostema cancerosum: et ulceratum est post dies, donec magnificata est malicia eius cum domino ipsius.	And I saw another physician who opened a cancerous boil; and it became ulcery after a few days, until the malignancy spread to his lord.
Quod est, quia quando est cancer purus ex humore melancholico, tunc non oportet ut perueniatur ad eum cum ferro omnino, nisi sit in membro quod toleret, ut abscindatur totum eius.	That is, for when it is cancerous from the melancholic humor, then one should not approach it with iron at all unless it is present in a member that can bear it, so that it may be cut off entirely.
Et propter illud o Filii, necesse est uobis, ut sciatis, quod operatio cum manu diuiditur in duas diuisiones: scilicet, operationem cui associatur salus: et operationem, cum qua est periculum in pluribus dispositionibus.	And for that reason, O sons, you must know that the art of surgery is divided into two parts: that which is associated with health, and that which is associated with danger in many arrangements.
Et ego iam excitaui in omni loco huius libri, in quo uenit operatio, in qua est terror et timor.	And I too have already set forth in every part of this book wherever surgery has come up, where there is terror and fear.
Quare necesse est uobis, ut caueatis illud, et dimitatis ipsum: ut non inueniant stolidi uiam ad loquendum, et dehonestandum.	Why do you need to tell him that, and to decrease it? So that the dumb fool doesn't offend me with his words and dishonors me.
Accipite ergo mensuram cum sollicitudine et protectione, et infirmos uestros cum facilitate et firmitudine, et utimini uia meliore perducente gratia Dei ad salutem et successionem laudabilem: et dimittite aegritudines terribiles difficilis sanationis: et tollite animas uestras ab eo quod facit uos timere, ut ingrediatur super uos haesitatio in fide uestra et commodo uestro.	Therefore, receive with care and protection, and bring our sick with ease and strength, and use a better path, led by the grace of God to salvation and worthy succession: and remove from us that which makes us fear, so that it may enter upon us hesitation in our faith and our comfort.
Est enim magis remanens ad gloriam uestram, et sublimius in mundo isto, et postremo ad quantitates uestras.	For it remains more to remain in our glory, and higher in the world, and at last to the quantities of us.
Galenus enim iam dixit in quibusdam suis admonitionibus.	Because Galen has already said in some of his adages.
Non medicetis aegritudinem malam: ne nominemini medici mali.	Do not cure disease with medicine: do not name a doctor to disease.
Iam autem diuisi hunc Tractatum secundum tria Capitula. ¶	But I have already divided this treatise into three chapters.
Capitulum primum.	Chapter one.
De Cauterio cum igne, et Cauterio cum medicina acuta, capitulatum, et ordinatum a capite usque ad pedes, et formis instrumentorum, et ferramentis Cauterii: et omni quod necessarium est in operatione. ¶	Chapter on cauterization with fire and medication, on acute medication, on medicine that is hot or cold, on the shape of instruments and tools for cauterization, and on everything else needed in the operation.
Capitulum secundum.	Chapter two.
De sectione et perforatione, phlebotomia et uentosis, et uulneribus: et extractione sagittarum, et similibus illius: et totum capitulatum, ordinatum formis instrumentorum. ¶	On cutting and piercing, phlebotomy and wound-cleaning, and extracts of arrows, and similar things: and the whole chapter on the shape of instruments.
Capitulum tertium.	Chapter three.
De restauratione, et dislocatione, et curatione torsionis, et similibus illius: capitulatum, ordinatum a capite usque ad pedes, et formis instrumentorum.	On restoration, dislocation, and cure for torsion, and similar things: the whole chapter, ordered from head to foot, and with the shapes of instruments.
Soli Deo Gloria.	To God alone be glory.
Liber Chirurgici Albucasis.	The Book of Surgery of Al-Bhaks
Pars I.	Part I.
¶ De Iuuamento, et Nocumento Cauterii: et quibus complexionibus conueniat, et quo tempore: et si cum ferro, uel auro.	On cauterization and non-cauterization: with which colors the surgeon should be dressed, and at what time; and if with iron or gold.
Caput I.	Chapter I.
Sed Ante Quidem Quam rememorer operationis cum eo, oportet ut dicam qualitatem Iuuamentorum eius, et Nocumentorum ipsius: et in qua complexione exhibeatur.	But before I remember the operation with him, it is necessary that I should tell you the quality of his cauterization and non-cauterization: and in which complexion he shows it.
Dico ergo, quod sermo de qualitate iuuamenti Cauterii, et nocumenti eius, est sermo prolixus, et subtilis, scientia, et secretum occultum.	I therefore say that the speech on the quality of cauterization and its harm is long, subtle, scientific, and secret.
Etiam locuta fuit in eo multitudo sapientum, et dissenserunt in eo: et mihi quidem sufficit parum ex sermonibus eorum, timens prolongationem.	Also spoken was a great number of wise men, and they disagreed with each other; but for me, little of their words is sufficient, fearing the lengthiness of their speech.
Dico ergo, quod Cauterium confert uniuersaliter omni complexioni, quae est cum materia, et absque materia: excaeptis duabus complexionibus, quae sunt complexio calida absque materia, et complexio sicca absque materia.	I therefore say that cauterization is universal to all complexions, whether with or without substance; excepting two complexions, which are a hot, substance-less complexity and a dry, substance-less complexity.
In complexione autem calida et sicca cum materia dissenserunt.	In complexity, however, hot and dry with substance, they disagreed.
Quidam enim dixerunt, quod Cauterium iuuatiuum est in ea.	Some, indeed, have said that cauterization is useful in that.
Et dixerunt alii contrarium illius, scilicet quod Cauterium non est conueniens in aegritudine, quae est ex caliditate et siccitate: quoniam natura ignis est caliditas: et inconueniens est, ut sanetur ex agritudine calida et sicca, cum calido et sicco.	And others said the opposite of that, namely that cauterization is not suitable for an illness which is hot and dry: for fire's nature is hot; and it is unsuitable, as it heals a hot and dry illness with hot and dry.
Et dixit ille qui dicit contrarium illius: quod per Cauterium fit iuuamentum in omni aegritudine calida et sicca, quae accidit in corporibus hominum: quoniam quando tu comparas corpus hominis, et humiditates eius, ad complexionem ignis, inuenis corpus hominis frigidum.	And he who says the opposite of that said: That by cauterization healing is done in any hot and dry illness which occurs in human bodies; for when you compare a human body, and its moisture, to the complexity of fire, the body's coldness disappears.
Et ego quidem dico per sermonem eius: quia ex perimentum iam detexit mihi illud aliquotiens.	And I myself say by that speech: for by experiment I have discovered that at times.
Verumtamen non oportet, ut ueniat super illud, nisi qui iam probatus est, et exercitatus in capitulo Cauterii exercitio ultimo, et cognouit diuersitatem complexionum hominum, et dispositionem aegritudinum in se ipsis, et caussas earum, et accidentia ipsarum, et spacium temporis earum.	However, it is not necessary that you make that point, except those who have already been tested and exercised in the last exercise of the chapter on cauterization, and have recognized the diversity of human complexions, and the nature of illnesses within them, and their causes, and their accidents, and the time period of their existence.
Ex reliquis autem complexionibus non est super uos timor: et praecipue in aegritudinibus frigidis et humidis.	From the other complexities there is no fear for you; and especially in cold and moist illnesses.
Iam enim conuenerunt omnes medici super eas: et non dissenserunt in iuuamento cum Cauterio in eis.	For all doctors have already agreed upon them; and they did not disagree on cauterization in them.
Et scitote filii, quod ex secreto curationis per Cauterium cum igne, et bonitate eius super Cauterium cum medicina comburente est: quoniam ignis est simplex, cuius actio non peruenit, nisi ad membrum quod cauterisatur: et non nocet membro alio coniuncto cum eo, nisi nocumento paruo.	And know ye sons, that the secret of cure by cauterization with fire, and the goodness thereof, is when the medicine is burned with the fire upon the cautery: for fire is simple, whose action does not reach, unless to the member which is cauterized; and does not hurt the other member joined therewith, unless with a little injury.
Medicinae uero comburentis actio peruenit ad illud quod elongatur ex membris: et fortasse facit accidere in membro aegritudinem difficilis sanationis, et fortasse interficit.	But the action of medicine when it is burned and increased by fire reaches that which extends from the members: and perhaps makes it happen to a member that it has difficulty in being cured, and perhaps destroys it.
Ignis autem propter subtilitatem suam et bonitatem substantiae suae, non facit illud, nisi superfluat.	But fire because of its subtlety and goodness of its substance does not do that, unless it overflows.
Iam uero innotuit nobis illud per experimentum, propter longitudinem seruitutis et studii cum arte, et stationem super ueritatem rerum: et propter illud excusor a longitudine sermonis.	Now this has already become known to us by trial, because of the length of practice and study with art and standing on the veracity of things: and because of this excuse from the length of speech.
Et si non esset, quia non licet huic libro meo, afferrem uobis secretum occultum in igne, et qualitatem operationis eius in corporibus expulsionis suae, qua expellit aegritudines sermone philosophico demonstratiuo, qui acueretur a mentibus uestris.	And if it were not, because it is not allowed to this my book, I would give you the secret hidden in fire, and the quality of its action on the bodies by means of its expulsion: which expels diseases with a philosophical demonstration-phrase, which was added by the minds of your ancestors.
Et scitote filii, quod ipsi dissentiunt in tempore, in quo conuenit fieri cauterium, et ponunt melius tempus ueris.	And know ye sons, that yourselves differ in the time when it is to be made to happen cautery, and put a better time of medicine:
Et ego dico, quod cauterium conuenit in omni tempore: propterea, quod nocumentum accidens propter tempus submergitur in iuuamento, quod attrahitur cum cauterio.	And I say that cautery is suitable at all times: for the injury which happens because of time is hidden in a good will, which is attracted with the cautery.
Et praecipue si cauterium est propter dolores ex doloribus necessariis, fortibus, festinis, qui non tolerant tarditatem: propterea quod timetur ex eis, quod accidat malicia quae est maior, quam paruum nocumentum intrans propter tempus.	And especially if the cautery is for pains from necessary pains, firming, banquets which do not tolerate delay: for they are afraid of them, that a bad will happen which is greater than a little injury is to blame for the lack of time.
Et non cadat in mentibus uestris o filii illud, quod non extimant, nisi uulgus et stolidi medici, scilicet quod illi aegritudini quae sanatur per cauterium, non est reditio semper: et ponunt illud consequens, et res non est sicut putant: propterea quod cauterium non est, nisi loco medicinae, quae alterat complexionem, et exiccat humiditates quae sunt caussae, quare accidunt dolores.	And do not fall into the minds of your sons that they should not judge, except for common and stupid doctors, namely that he who is cured of a disease by cautery does not always recover: and they put its consequence, and it is not like what they think: for cautery is not, unless in place of medicine, which changes the complexion, and dries up humidities which are the causes, wherefore pains happen.
Verumtamen cauterium superfluit super medicinam per uelocitatem ualetudinis suae, et uirtutem suae operationis, et uehementiam dominii sui: et possibile est, ut redeat aegritudo hora aliqua temporis secundum complexionem infirmi, et locationem aegritudinis suae, et uirtutem eius: et quod praeparatur in corpore eius ex aggregatione superfluitatum in eo: et quod peruenit ad ipsum in acquisitione sua ex cibis, et similibus illis ex caussis, nisi fit aegritudo, in qua administratur cauterium.	Indeed, the cautery is superfluous on top of the medicine due to its velocity, vigor, and power, and because it belongs to the Lord: and it is possible that the sickness be restored at some time during the course of nursing, and location of sickness, and strength; and that it is prepared in his body from an excess that has accumulated in him: and that it comes to him in its acquisition from food, and similar things from causes, unless there is sickness, in which cauterization is administered.
Aegritudo subtilis in membro paucarum superfluitatum, et humiditatum, sicut cauterium dentis, propter dolorem, et similia illi, possibile est enim, ut non redeat in eo ille dolor.	Indeed, a slight sickness in a small member is superfluous due to excess dryness and humidity, like the pain of a tooth, for its own pleasure, and other similar things; because it is possible that this pain does not return to him.
Sed illud fit in paucis.	But that is true only in a few cases.
At uero sermo uulgi iterum, quod cauterium est postremum medicinae, est sermo rectus: non ad illud quod ipsi intendunt in illo: quoniam ipsi credunt, quod non est curatio quae conferat cum medicina, neque cum alio post occasum cauterii.	But the word of the cure is again true; that the cautery is last of all medicine, it is a straight word: not to that which they intend in him; for they believe that there is no healing with medication, nor with anything else after the occasion of the cautery.
Res autem est econtrario illius, et intentio, quod cauterium est postremum medicinae, non est, nisi quod quando nos administramus modos curationis in aliqua aegritudinum, et non conferunt illae medicinae: deinde administramus in fine rei cauterium, et confert: tunc inde cadit, quod cauterium est postremum mediciuae, non secundum intentionem quam intelligunt uulgus et multistolidorum medicorum.	But the case is just the opposite, and the intention, that the cautery is last of all medicine, is not true; unless when we administer methods of cure in some diseases, and do not give them medicine: then we administer at the end of the matter a cautery, and it comes to pass. Then it falls, that the cautery is last of all medicine, not according to the intention which the common people and many medical doctors understand.
Antiqui autem dixerunt, quod cauterium cum auro est melius, quam cauterium cum ferro: et non dixerunt illud, nisi propter aequalitatem auri, et sublimitatem substantiae suae: et dixerunt, quod non facit pus locus cauterii.	But the ancient ones have said that a gold cautery is better than an iron one: and they did not say that, except for the equality of gold, and the limitation of its substance; and they have said that it does not make a wound in the cauterizing place.
Verum non est illud absolute: quoniam ego iam probaui illud, et inueni, quod ipsum non facit illud in quibusdam corporibus absque aliis.	But that is not absolutely so; for I have tested that, and found that it does not make those wounds in certain bodies without others.
Et cauterium cum ipso est bonum, et melius quam cum ferro, sicut dixerunt.	It is good to use the cautery with it, and better than using iron, as they say.
Verumtamen quando tu ignis cauterium in igne ex auro, non declaratur tibi, quando ignitur secundum quantitatem quam uis, propter rubedinem auri: et quando properat ad ipsum frigus, et si addis super ipsum ignitionem, liquescit in igne, et uertitur in laminas.	Indeed, when you use the fire cautery on gold, it does not show you, when lit according to the quantity you use, due to the redness of the gold: and when it is proper for it to be cold, and if you add ignition on top of it, it melts in the fire and turns into leaves.
Quare cadit artifex ex illo in occupationem: et propter illud fit Cauterium cum ferro apud nos uelocius et propinquius, ex rectitudine ad operationem.	Why does the craftsman fall from that [practice]: and for that reason we prefer the cautery with iron among us, and more quickly and closer to the work, from truth to operation.
Et ego quidem iam ordinaui hoc Capitulum in Cauterio, secundum capitula: et ordinaui ea a capite usque ad pedes: ut alleuient quaerenti illud quod uult ex eo.	And I have already arranged this chapter on the cautery, according to the chapters: and I have arranged it from the head until the feet: so that you may find what you want from it.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Caput in commissura coronali.	About the way of cauterizing the top of the nose.
Caput II.	Chapter II.
Confert hic cauterizatio ad dominium humiditatis et frigiditatis super cerebrum: quae duae sunt caussae sodae, et multitudinis fluxus humorum ex capite ad partes oculorum et aurium, et multitudinis somni, et doloris dentium, et doloris gutturis: et uniuersaliter omnis aegritudinis, quae accidit ex frigiditate, sicut paralisis, et sodae, epilepsiae, et apoplexiae, et similia illis ex aegritudinibus.	Confirm here the cauterization to the domain of humidity and coldness on the brain: which are two causes of salt, and a multitude of flow of humors from the head to the parts of the eyes and ears, and a multitude of sleep, and pain of teeth, and pain of throat: and generally all sickness that happens from coldness, such as paralysis, and salting, and epilepsies, and apoplexies, and similar things from those illnesses.
Modus cauterizationis est, ut praecipias infirmo: ut euacuetur in primis cum medicina solutiua mundificante caput tribus noctibus, aut quatuor, secundum quod exigit uirtus infirmi, et eius aetas, et consuetudo eius.	The way of cauterization is, so that you prescribe to the sick: that it be drained in the first place with a solute and purifying medicine, washing the head three nights, or four, according to what the power of the sickness, and its age, and custom, demand.
Deinde praecipe ei, ut radi faciat caput suum cum nouacula.	Then prescribe to him that he should wash his head with a soft cloth.
Deinde fac eum sedere inter manus tuas quadratum, ita quod iam posuit manus suas super pectus suum.	Then make him sit between your hands, so that he has already placed his hands on his chest.
Deinde pone radicem palmae tuae super radicem nasi sui inter oculos suos.	Then place the root of your palm on the root of his nose between his eyes.
Vbicumque ergo peruenerit digitus tuus medius, signa locum illum cum incausto.	So whenever your middle finger has come up to that point with uneasiness, mark that spot with an unclean mark.
Deinde igni Cauterium Oliuare: cuius haec est forma.	Then fire cautery: this is its shape.
Deinde pone ipsum super locum signatum cum incausto, descensione, qua constringatur manus tua paulatim, et tu reuolues ipsum.	Then put the flesh on the marked spot with your fingers, and squeeze it gently, and then remove it.
Deinde leua manum tuam uelociter, et aspicias locum.	Then quickly wipe your hand, and examine the spot.
Quod si uides iam detegi ex osse quantitatem capitis alkiel, aut quantitatem zeuherbi, tunc eleua manum tuam.	If you see now a little quantity of salt on the bone, or a little quantity of licorice, then quickly wipe your hand.
Et si non, itera manum tuam ferro ipso, aut cum alio ab ipso si infrigidatur: donec uideantur ossa, quae dixi tibi.	And if not, repeat the motion with the iron, or with another one when it is chilled: until you see the bones, which I told you.
Deinde sume aliquid ex sale, et solue illud in aqua, et imbibe in ipso cotum, et pone super locum: et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus.	Then take some salt and dissolve it in water, and immerse the cloth in it, and put it on the spot: and leave it for three days.
Deinde pone super ipsum cotum imbibitum in butyro, et dimitte illum super locum, donec destruatur eschara ignis.	Then put on the spot the cloth immersed in butter, and leave it until the fire is completely extinguished.
Deinde cura illud cum unguento tetrapharmacon, usquequo sanetur.	Then take care of that with the four-fold ointment until it heals.
Iam dixerunt, quod quanto uulnus plus remanet apertum, emittit pus: quare est melius et magis iuuatiuum.	They have already said that since the wound remains open for so long, pus is emitted: why is it better and more helpful?
Et dixerunt quidam eorum, ut cauterizetur cutis usque ad os: et teneatur Cauterium, donec aduratur quiddam spissitudinis ossis.	And some of them said, to cauterize the skin all the way down to the bone: and hold the cautery until a certain hardness is achieved.
Deinde radatur post illud quod adustum est ex osse, deinde curetur.	Then clean after that what has been burned, then cauterize it.
Et dicunt alii, quod oportet ut cum cauterio perueniatur ad ultimum, donec imprimat in os impressionem for tem, ita quod cadat os, quod fit sicut forma kirate: aut instrumentum quod mulieres ponunt infuso alphabeti parui: et extimant, quod exspirantur ex hoc loco uapores capitis, et dimittatur uulnus apertum tempore longo.	And others say that it is necessary to do with the cautery what I have just described, so that an impression of a knot is made on the bone: or the instrument which women put in their hair with a little letter: and they cut off, that vapours of the head's essence may be emitted from this place, and the wound may heal after a long time.
Deinde curetur, donec consolidetur.	Then cauterize it until it hardens.
Mihi autem non uidentur hae duae species Cauterii omnino nisi in quibusdam hominibus secundum uiam timoris.	But these two species of cautery do not seem to exist among all men, except for certain people from second-hand knowledge out of fear.
Et dimittere ipsum, apud me est melius cum salute ipsius.	And leave it: as far as I am concerned, it is better with the health of that person.
Debilitatur enim caput ex solutione continuitatis ipsius naturalis: sicut testificati sumus in reliquis membris: et praecipue quando caput infirmi debile est natura: et species quidem Cauterii prima est magis salua et melior apud me, et ea utor: operare ergo cum ea in salute.	For the head is weakened by the resolution of its natural continuity; as we have testified in the other members; and above all when the head is weak, by nature: and the species of cautery is more sound and better with me, and I use it; so let us operate on it while it is healthy.
¶ De modo cauterizandi capitis in dolore totius capitis.	For the mode of cauterizing the head when it has pain throughout the whole head.
Caput III.	Chapter III: On the Mode of Causing a Head W
Quando in toto Capite accidit dolor chronicus: et prolongatur illud in infirmo, et utitur hyeris, et cochiis, et caputpurgiis, et oleis, et empleumatis.	When in the whole head there is a chronic pain; and when it is prolonged in an invalid, and if he uses hypos, hot baths, head rinsings, oils, and applications: then operate.
Et praecipue si iam cauterizatum est cauterio uno, quod narrauimus, et non confert ei aliquid ex illis: tunc considera.	And especially if already cauterized with one kind of cautery which we have described, and gives it no benefit: then consider.
Nam si caput infirmi est fortis creationis natura, et non est debile, et inuenit frigus uehemens: tunc cauteriza cum cauterio alio sub illo parum.	For if the head is weak by nature's creation, and is not weak, and cold is keen: then cauterize with another kind of cautery a little below it.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum super omne cornu capitis sui cauterio, do nec pertranseat cutis, et discooperiatur ex osse quantitas, quam narrauimus.	Then cauterize itself on all the horns of its head with its own cautery, and do not let the skin be burned, and uncover a quantity from the bone, which we have described.
Et cauteriza ipsum cauterio uno in occipitio capitis sui, in loco qui nominatur uas: et est locus in quo ponitur uentosa: et eleua matum tuam in hoc, et non discooperias os.	And cauterize itself with one kind of cautery at the back of its head, in the place which is called the vein; and this is a place where there is a flowing wind: and moisten your palm well in this, and do not uncover the bone.
Infirmus enim inuenit propter illud dolorem uehementem, et diuersum a dolore reliquorum cauteriorum capitis omnium.	For an invalid will have keen pain because of this, and is far removed from the pain of the other parts of the head's cauterization.
Et ego dicam hoc Cauterium in loco suo: et oportet quod sit cauterium, quo cauterizantur cornua capitis, et occiput eius subtilius cauterio, quo cauterizatur medium capitis.	And I will call this cautery in its place; and it should be that by which the horns of the head are cauterized, and the back of the head by a finer cautery, by which the middle of the head is cauterized.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in hemicrania, tam cum medicina adustiua, quam cum ferro.	On the mode of cauterizing when it has a headache, just as if it were a medicine adjusted, as if with an iron.
Caput IIII.	Chapter IV: On Causing a Head to Bleed When it has
Quando accidit in parte capitis dolor et soda, aut extenditur dolor usque ad oculum, et euacuatur cum medicinis mundificantibus caput, et administratur reliqua curatio, quam dixi in diuisionibus aegritudinum, et non confert illud totum: tunc cauterizatio in eo est secundum duos modos: aut cauterizatio cum medicina acuta comburente: aut cum ferro.	When pain and swelling occurs in part of the head, or when the pain extends to the eye, and if the head is washed with medicinal solutions, and the remaining treatment is given, as I have described in the divisions of diseases, and this does not benefit him entirely: then cauterization must be done in two ways: either cauterization with a sharp medicine that burns; or with iron.
Cauterium autem cum medicina acuta comburente, est, ut accipias dentem unum allii, et excortices ipsum, et abscindas extremitates eius ex duobus lateribus.	But if cauterization is to be done with a sharp medicine that burns, i.e., take one of the teeth of another, and cut it out, and cut off its ends from the two sides.
Deinde scinde locum doloris in tempore cum phlebotomo lato, donec fiat in eo locus sub cute, in quo dens capitur.	Then cut the place of pain at the time with a phlebotome on the side, until it is made into a place under the skin, in which a lump is captured.
Intromitte ergo eum in ipso sub cute, donec occultetur: deinde stringe super ipsum cum puluillo constrictione decenti, et dimitte ipsum quantitate quindecim horarum deinde solue eum, et extrahe allium, et dimitteuulnus duobus diebus, aut tribus: postea pone super ipsum cotum submersum in butyro, donec locus efficiat pus: deinde cura ipsum cum unguento usquequo sanetur.	Then introduce it into him under the skin, until it is hidden: then tie it over it with a knot of constrictive yarn, and leave it for fifteen hours, and then dissolve it, and pull out one, and leave it for two days, or three: then put a cloth over the spot immersed in butter, until a pus place forms: then care for the wound with ointment until it heals.
Et si uis fac illud cum quibusdam medicinis comburentibus, quas ego scripsi in tractatu duodecimo, de Medieinis adurentibus.	And if you want to make it with some sharp medicines that burn, which I have written about in the second book, On Burning Medications.
Cauterizatio uero eius cum ferro, est secundum hunc modum.	But cauterization with iron is according to this method.
Igni Cauterium, cuius forma haec est.	Fire Cauterization, whose form is this:
Et nominatur Clauilis: quoniam forma capitis eius est sicut forma claui, in quo est quiddam curuitatis, et in medio eius est quaedam eminentia parua.	And it is called a Clavicle: because the form of the head is like the form of a clavicle, in which there is some curvature, and in the middle of it is a small eminence.
Deinde pone ipsum super locum, et retine manum tuam: et tu reuolue ferrum paulatim cum uelocitate: et sit quantitas quae aduritur ex spissitudine cutis, sicut medietas eius.	Then place the iron on the spot, and hold your hand: and you will turn the iron gradually with speed: and let the amount that burns be of the thickness of the skin, such as half of it.
Et eleua manum tuam, ut non aduratur arteria, quae est inferius, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	And raise your hand so that the artery below does not burn, and an outflow of blood does not occur.
Deinde imbibe cotum in aqua salis, et pone super locum, et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus: deinde pone cotum cum butyro: postea cura cum unguento usquequo sanetur.	Then dip the wound in saline water and put it on the place and leave it for three days; then put the wound with butter: later care with ointment until healed.
Et si uis, cauteriza hanc hemicraniam cum extremitate cultellari secunda Cauterii.	And if you see, cauterize this headache with an edge of scalpel second cautery.
Et caue ab incisione arteriae in hac hemicrania, non antiqua proprie.	And do not cut the artery in this half-headache, but old one his own.
¶ De modo cauteriezandi in hemicrania antiqua.	The mode of cauterizing in an old headache.
Caput V.	Head
Quando curas hemicraniam, cum eo quod diximus ex curatione praecedente, et quod diximus in diuisionibus aegritudinum, et non confert curatio: et uides ex aegritudine, quod non sufficit ei quod diximus ex cauterio primo cum medicina, aut cum cauterio cum igne, tunc oportet ut ignias Cauterium cultellare, donec albificetur postquam signas super locum doloris cum linea, cuius longitudo sit medietas digiti, aut quasi illud: et depone manum tuam uice una, et stringe eam donec incidas arteriam, et peruenias usque ad os.	When you treat a headache, with what we have said before in the preceding cure, and that which we have said in the divisions of diseases, and there is no cure: and you see from the disease that it does not suffice to him what we have said from the first cauterization with medicine, or with cauterization with fire, then it must be that you bring the fires of Cauterie, until it becomes white after the signs on the place of pain with a line, whose length is half a finger, or almost like it: and put your hand out one way, and squeeze it until you touch the artery, and reach as far as the mouth.
Verumtamen necesse est tibi, ut caueas a continuatione mandibulae, quae mouetur apud masticationem, ne aduratur latus, aut neruus qui mouet ipsam, unde accidat spasmus.	However, it is necessary for you, so that you cauterize the continuation of the jaw, which moves when chewing, does not burn on the side, or nerve that moves it, from which happens a spasm.
Et esto super custotiam, et cautelam de fluxu sanguinis arteriae, quae abscisa est.	And be on guard, and beware of the flow of blood of the artery, which is cut off.
In abscisione enim eius est timor, et praecipue ei qui ignorat illud quod facit, et non est studiosus, nec expertus: et dimittit operationem cum eo in primis.	For there is a fear in the cutting off of it, and especially to him who does not know what he does, and is not learned, nor expert: and dismisses the operation with it at first.
Et ego ueniam cum rememoratione regiminis fluxus sanguinis accidentis ex arteria secundum modum suum, et in loco suo huius libri.	And I come with a reminder of the regime of the flow of blood from an artery according to its own way, and in its place in this book.
Quod si uides ex aegritudine, quod non sufficit ei hoc Cauterium, et uides corpus infirmi tolerans cauterium in medio capitis, sicut narrauimus, cura uulnus, donec sanetur.	That if you see from the disease that this cauterization is not sufficient for him, and you see the body bearing the cauterization in the middle of the head, as we have told, care about the sore, until it heals.
Et si uis, administra Cauterium, quod diximus in capitulo extractionis arteriae cum Cauterio habente duos cultellos.	And if you see, administer cautery, which we have said in the chapter on arteriotomy with a cautery having two scalpels.
Est enim cauterizatio melior hac et magis conferens.	For cauterization is better and more effective in this way.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in dolore Aurium.	§ On the method of cauterizing in ear pain.
Caput VI.	Chapter VI.
Quando accidit in Aure dolor a frigore, et curatur cum solutiuis, et reliqua curatione quam diximus in diuisione, et non remouetur dolor, tunc igni Cauterium: et est illud quod nominatur Punctum, cuius forma est haec.	When it happens that there is pain in the ear from cold, and cauterize with water, and the rest of the cure as we have said in the division, and the pain does not disappear, then fire Cautery: and that is what is called a point, whose form is this.
Deinde puncta cum eo post eius ignitionem in circumitu auris totius, sicut reuoluitur: aut in circumitu utriusque, si simul dolor est in utrisque.	Then the points with it after its ignition around the whole ear, as it swells: or in the circumference of each, if at the same time pain is in both.
Et elonga te cum Cauterio a radice auris parumper, postquam signaueris loca cum encaustro: et sit cauterii quantitas decem punctorum in omni aure, et quasi illa.	And stretch it with the cautery from the root of the ear slightly, after you have marked the places with wax: and let the quantity of cauterium be ten points all over the ear, and almost the same.
Deinde cura loca, donec sanentur.	Then care for the place, until they are healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Tortura.	§ On the method of cauterizing in torture.
Caput VII.	Chapter VII.In cumque cauterium ignis fac
Tortura quae curatur cum cauterizatione, non est nisi ex speciebus, quae accidunt ex phlegmate, secundum quod diximus in diuisionibus aegritudinum.	For the torture which is cured with cauterization, is not except for the kinds that happen from phlegm, according to what we have said in divisions of diseases.
Et deuita cauterizationem speciei, quae accidit ex exiccatione, et spasmo nerui.	And prolonged cauterization of a species that happens from drying up, and the spasm of a nerve.
Quando curas hanc speciem torturae cum hyeris, et caputpurgiis, et gargarismis, et non confert curatio tua, tunc oportet ut cauterizes infirmum tribus Cauteriis: uno apud radicem auris, et secundo parum inferius a timpore suo, et tertio apud coniunctionem duorum labiorum.	When you treat this species of torture with hyoscyamus, and caputpurums, and gargarisms, and your cure does not bring about a result, then you should cauterize the sick three times: one near the root of the ear, and a second slightly below its place, and a third at the meeting of the two lips.
Et pone Cauterium tuum ex contrario partis infirmae.	And put your cautery on the opposite side of the weak part.
Quoniam mollificatio non accidit, nisi in parte quae apparet sana.	For softening does not happen except in the part that appears to be healthy.
Et forma cauterizationis est, ut cauterizes ipsum Cauterio in directo extremitatis auris superioris sub cornu capitis parum: et alio in timpore: cuius longitudo sit secundum longitudinem pollicis.	And the form of cauterizing is so that it cauterizes itself with the cautery in the direct extremity of the upper ear near the hairline slightly: and another in the time: whose length is according to the length of the finger.
Et depone manum tuam cum cauterio, donec comburatur quantitas medietatis spissitudinis cutis.	And lay your hand with the cautery, until the amount of half the thickness of the skin is burned.
Et haec est forma Cauterii, et est species ex cultellari, cuius forma praemissa est: uerumtamen non est subtilior ea parum, sicut uides: et oportet ut sit cultellus in eo superfluae grossitudinis parum.	And this is the form of the cautery; and it has a kind of blade whose form is as follows: indeed, it is not too fine, as you see; and it is necessary that the blade should be somewhat thin, because of its thickness.
Deinde cura loca, cum eo quod praecessit: donec sanetur.	Then take care of the wound with this; until such time as it heals: unless you want to suffer a great deal of pain and loss.

When apoplexia is old, and you take care of it with that which I have said, and your medicine does not avail, and the patient has no fever, then cauterize him with four cauteries on every corner of his head, and with one in the middle of his head, as we have said, and with one at the back of his head, according to what preceded: and let the mode of the cautery be according to what preceded.

Ipsum namque est modus Cauterii: et fac illud secundum ordinem eundem, quem dixi illic.	This is the way to make a poultice: and do it according to the order which I have mentioned there.
Si ergo sanatur per illud, bonum est.	If then he recovers by means of it, it is good.

Therefore, to begin with, he should wash out his brain with water and with the other remedies which we have mentioned in the section on general treatment; for a sick man is great or tolerant of medicine.
Si autem est puer, qui non tolerat medicinas, tunc administratur gargarisma, et masticationes mundificantes cerebrum, ante illud diebus multis cum bonificatione ciborum.	But if he is a boy who does not tolerate medicines, then let him be given gargles and mouthwashes to wash out the brain; before many days of good diet.

And let him guard against the flow of blood.

Cauterium in eo est secundum duos modos: aut cauterium cum igne: aut cauterium cum medicina comburente.	is fire: or is with medicine-burning.
In cauterio autem cum igne, praecipe infirmo ante illud, ut dimittat pilos suos, si est ex illis qui mundant eos, donec prolongentur et aequentur.	In the cauterium but with fire: however, before that, recommend that he stops his hairs from coming off, if he is of those who wash them, until they grow out and become even.
Si autem pungunt eum apud ortum suum: tunc constringe oculos eius cum uitta, ut non moueantur, donec nascantur.	If I puncture him near his eye: then constrict his eyes with putty, so that they do not move until they have healed.
Cum ergo nascuntur et aequantur, tunc pone caput infirmi in sinu tuo: deinde signa super Palpebram oculorum eius cum encaustro, signo quod sit secundum figuram folii myrti: et sit principium signi prope pilos.	When they have healed and been brought to a steady state, then place the head of the patient in your lap: afterwards mark the eyelids of his eyes with caustice, a mark that is shaped like a leaf of myrrh: and let the mark begin from near the hair.
Deinde pone cotum imbibitum in albumine oui: aut in mucilagine psilii super oculum.	Then place a damp cloth soaked in albumen, or in a slippery substance made from the mucilage of psyllum, on the eye.

Then cauterize over the mark, slowly and repeatedly, until the surface of the skin is completely burnt away, leaving a shape that resembles the leaf of myrrh, all by itself.
Et signum sanitatis operis tui est: ut si uideas Palpebram oculi iam contrahi, et pilos eleuari apud puncturam oculi.	And the mark of your work is this: so that if you press the eyelids of his eyes together, and feel the hair near the mark of the wound, you will know that the patient's eye has been healed.
Eleua ergo manum tuam tunc: et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus.	So then let go of your hand, and send him away for a few days.
Deinde pone super ipsum Cotum cum butyro, donec eradicetur eschara.	Then place on the patient's skin a cloth soaked in butter, until the scar is removed.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then tend to the patient with ointment, until he is healed.
Quod si redeat aliquod ex pilis post horam, et mollificetur palpebra: tunc itera Cauterium super illum locum, sicut fecisti in primis.	If any of his hair falls out an hour later and the eyelid becomes soft, then apply fire to the same place as before, as you did in the beginning.
Si autem pili sunt in inferiori: tunc cauteriza ipsam, donec eleuetur ad locum suum naturalem: et aequetur ut non pungant pili oculum.	If, however, the hair has fallen out at the lower eyelid, then cauterize that place until it has returned to its natural position: and make sure that the eyes do not tickle after.

Et cauteriza cum eo cauterium unum, donec comburatur cutis tota, et perueniat ad siphac, donec egrediatur sanies tota: deinde cura ipsum curatione exiturarum, donec sanetur.	And cauterize it with one cauterizing fire until the skin throughout is burned, and reaches the siphum, until the pus comes out entirely: then take care of the cure for the healing of ulcers, until it heals.
Et non oportet ut hac cauterii specie utatur, nisi cuius studium in arte medicinae prolongatur: et per cuius manus concurrunt aegritudines istae cum experimento aliquotiens: tunc enim audeat super huiusmodi operationem.	And it is not appropriate that this cauterization be done with the appearance of someone who has been studying medicine for a long time: and because, at times, some diseases come to those who carry out such an operation: in fact, let one dare to perform such an operation.
At uero dimittere ipsam, apud me est melius.	But I think it is better to leave it alone.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Pleuresi.	To cauterize in pleurisy.
Caput XXXI.	Chapter 31.
Dixerunt antiqui, cauterium cum radicibus aristolochiae ad Pleuresim frigidam secundum hunc modum.	The ancients said that the cauterization with the roots of aristochoea is applied to cold pleurisy in this way.
Et est, ut recipias ex radicibus aristolochiae siccae longae, radicem unam longiorem, quae ex ea inuenitur, et sit sicut grossitudo digiti.	And it is as follows: you shall receive from the dry roots of aristochoea a long root, which is found in it, and make it as large as the thickness of a finger.
Deinde submerge eam in oleo: et accende ipsam in igne.	Then immerse it in oil: and light it on fire.
Deinde cauteriza cauterio uno in eo quod est inter continuationem furculae cum collo, et duobus cauteriis paruis sub guidezi parum decliuibus ad partem, quae est sub barba.	Then cauterize with a long cautery in that which is between the rib and the collarbone, and two small cauteries under the guide a little inclined on either side, which are under the beard.
Et duobus cauteriis etiam in eo, quod est inter costam quintam et sextam decliuibus ad posteriora parumper: et cauterio alio in medio pectoris, et alio supra stomachum.	And two cauteries also in that which is between the fifth and sixth ribs inclined towards the back a little: and a long cautery in the middle of the chest, and another above the stomach.
Et tribus cauteriis a posterioribus: uno in eo quod est inter duas spatulas: et duobus cauteriis a duobus lateribus pectoris, inferius cauterio quod est inter duas spatulas.	And three cauteries from the back: one in that which is between two spatulas; and two cauteries from the sides of the chest, the lower cautery being in that which is between two spatulas.
Et non oportet ut comprimas manum tuam cum cauterio, imo sit in manifesto cutis odorando.	And it is not necessary that you should squeeze your hand with the cautery, but let it be held out in front of your skin smelling.
Et iam dixerunt quidam antiqui, quod ex hominibus sunt qui utuntur cauterio ex ferro simili radio: et igniunt, et intus mittunt ipsum in eo quod est inter costas, donec perueniatur cum eo ad ipsum apostema, et egrediatur sanies: sicut diximus in apostemate Epatis.	And some ancient men said that they who use a cautery of iron similar to a radium: and light it up, and put it in that which is between the ribs until it reaches the pus, and the pus comes out: as we have said in the pustule of the liver.
Sed in hac perforatione cum cauterio est ex timore, quod aut moritur infirmus statim, aut accidit in loco fistula, cui non est sanatio.	But in this piercing with the cautery there is a fear, that either the sick man dies immediately, or a fistula happens to the place which does not heal.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Splenem Caput XXXII.	Chapter 32.
Quando tu curas aegritudinem splenis, cum eo quod diximus ex curatione in diuisione aegritudinum, et non confert curatio tua, tunc cauterium in ea est secundum tres modos, qui omnes sunt recti.	When you are curing a disease of the spleen, with that which we have said about dividing the diseases, and your cure does not bring forth its effect, then cauterize it in three ways, all of which are straight.
Quorum unus est, ut facias tria cauteria, aut quatuor lineando secundum longitudinem splenis secundum figuram cauteriorum Epatis, quorum praecessit figura.	One is enough to make three wounds or four by tracing along the length of the splenic section according to the figure of the smaller liver, which preceded in form.
Et sit inter omne cauterium quantitas grossitudinis digiti, aut plus parum.	And between each wound there should be a quantity of thickness of the finger, or more or less.
Et sit modus cauterii, quem diximus in cauterio epatis aequaliter.	And let the distance between the wounds be equal to that which we mentioned in the cauterization of the liver.
Et non comprimas manum tuam cum cauterio: et sit infirmus resupinus super dorsum suum.	And do not compress your hand when you cauterize; and let him lie on his back.
Et modus alius de cauterizatione est: ut ignias cauterium habens duo uerua, quod diximus in capitulo dislocationis humeri: et eleua cutem, quae est in directo splenis, ubi peruenit cubitus infirmi sinister: et sit eleuatio tua qua eleuas cutem secundum latitudinem corporis, ut cadant cauteria secundum longitudinem corporis.	And another mode of cauterization is that which we mentioned in the chapter on shoulder dislocations: and dry up the skin, which lies directly in front of the spleen where it reaches the bed of the left side; and let your hand rise while you dry up the skin according to the width of the body, so that the wounds may reach according to the length of the body.
Deinde intromitte duo uerua ignita ualde, donec cum eis penetres cutem a parte altera: deinde extrahe cauterium: fiunt ergo cauteria quatuor.	Then introduce two hot knives deeply, until you penetrate through with them the skin on the opposite side; then remove the cautery; so there will be four wounds.
Et si uis cauteriza cum cauterio alio habente tria uerua.	And if you wish to cauterize with a knife having three knives.
Deinde cura cauterium postquam dimittis ipsum emittere pus diebus multis: est enim magis conferens quamque reliqua quae praecesserunt ex curatione.	Then take care of the cautery after you have removed it, if it should emit pus for many days: for it is more healing than each that has preceded in the cure.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Hydropisi.	The mode of cauterization in the Hydropsys.
Caput XXXIII.	Chapter 33.
Cauterium non cadit in Hydropisi, nisi ascliti proprie.	The cautery does not fall into the Hydropsis if it is properly raised up.
Quando tu curas Hydropicum cum modis curationis, quos diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio, tunc oportet ut cauterizes ipsum quatuor cauteriis in circumitu umbilici, et cauterio uno super stomachum, et cauterio alio super epar, et cauterio super splenem, et cauteriis duobus post dorsum inter spondiles, et uno in directo pectoris, et alio in directo stomachi: et sit quantitas profunditatis cauterii propinqua spissitudini cutis.	When you cure the Hydropsis with the modes of cure which we mentioned in the division, and there is no cure, then you should cauterize four times around the navel, and once over the stomach, and once over the liver, and once behind each spine, and one in front of the chest, and another in front of the stomach: and let the distance between each cautery be close to the thickness of the skin.
Deinde dimitte cauterium apertum, ut emittat pus tempore longo.	Then remove the cautery so that it opens up, to emit pus after a long time.
Et non euacues infirmum a curatione post cauterium cum eo: quod oportet ut aggregentur ei duae intentiones: et festinabit ad ipsum sanatio cum auxilio Dei.	And do not let the patient depart from you after the cauterization, for he should gather up two purposes, and the healing will be quick to him with the help of God.
Forma uero cauterii cum quo cauterizatur uenter, sit clauilis: secundum quod praecessit forma eius: et illius cum quo cauterizatur dorsum, sit oliuaris secundum quod praecessit eius forma.	Indeed, the form of the cautery with which the abdomen is cauterized, should be a closure: second because it precedes its form: and its back, with which he is cauterized, should be an olive, because it precedes its form.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Pedes, et Crura.	The mode of cauterizing the feet and the legs.
Caput XXXIIII.	Chapter XXXIV. The Head.
Quando apostemantur in Hydropico, et replentur aqua citrina: oportet ut cauterizes super dorsum Pedis in nocrati, quae est inter auricularem et anularem: et eleua manum tuam cum cauterio, et non torqueas ipsum: deinde eleua manum tuam: et non iteres ipsum omnino.	When they are put out into the Hydroptic, and are filled with yellow water: you should cauterize on the back of the foot in the noccere, which is between the auricular and the ring finger: and wash your hand with the cautery, and do not twist it: then wash your hand: and do not touch it at all.
Resudet enim aqua citrina, et sit cauterium secundum hanc formam.	For the yellow water will make a mark, and the cautery will be made according to this form.
Deinde fac super duo crura duo cauteria in omni crure, et fiat cauterium cum extremitate cultellari cauterii: et fiat cauterium secundum longitudinem cruris, unum sub genu, et alterum inferius eo, circiter medium cruris: et super omnem coxam cauteria duo: et dimitte cauterium apertum absque curatione tempore longo: ut resudet ex eo aliquod aquae: deinde cura ipsum cum reliquis quae diximus.	Then make two cauteries on the two legs, and let the cautery be made with the tip of a knife-edge cautery: and let the cautery be made according to the length of the leg, one under the knee, and the other below it, about in the middle of the leg: and let there be two cauteries on the whole loin, and do not let the cautery be closed for a long time: so that it will come out from it some water: then care for him with the rest that we have said.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in solutione Ventris.	The mode of cauterizing in the abdominal solution.
Caput XXXV.	Chapter XXXV. The Abdominal Solution.
Quando est solutio uentris ex frigore et humiditatibus, donec debilitet uirtutes retentiuam et digestiuam, quae sunt in stomacho et intestinis: et curatur illud cum modis curationis, et non sanatur: et uides infirmum tolerantem cauterium exuberantis uirtutis, tunc cauteriza ipsum cauterio magno super stomachum suum, secundum quod praecessit in cauterizatione stomachi cum cauterio circuli, et quatuor cauteriis in circumitu umbilici subtilibus, cum cauterio clauili subtili: et cauterio super alcatin supra alhosos magno, aut duobus cauteriis.	When the solution of the stomach is loosened by cold and moisture, until the retaining virtue and digesting power, which are in the stomach and intestines, has weakened: and care for it with the methods of care, and does not heal: and you will see a sick person who tolerates an exuberant virtue, then cauterize him with a great cautery on his stomach, second because it precedes in the cauterization of the stomach with a circular cautery, and four small cauteries around the navel, with a small tip-shaped cautery: and a cautery over the alcatine above the loins, or two cauteries.
Et si uides humiditates exuberantes, et infirmum tolerantem illud, tunc cauteriza ipsum cauterio super pectinem, et cauterio super omne ilium: et fortasse addes duo cauteria parua super stomachum prope magnum.	And if you see moistures that are abundant, and the sickly one bearing it, then cauterize him with cautery over the ribcage, and cautery over the entire ileum: and perhaps you added two small cauteries near the great stomach.
Est enim curatio proficiens, cuius iuuamentum non errat.	For cure is accomplished by a surgeon whose skill is not in error.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Hemorroidas.	On the mode of cauterizing Hemorrhoids.
Caput XXXVI.	Chapter 36. On the Mode of Cauterizing Hemorr
Quando in ano sunt Hemorroides antiquae multae, aut una, et sunt ex humoribus grossis, frigidis, aut humiditatibus corruptis, et curantur cum eo, quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio: tunc cauteriza tribus cauteriis super inferiorem spondilem dorsi sub almeidati parumper triangulatim, et cauterio sub umbilico quasi duobus digitis.	When there are many ancient Hemorrhoids, or one, and they are of gross humors, cold, or corrupt moistures, and so cure them along with what we have said in the division, and there is no cure: then cauterize three cauteries on the lower part of the spine behind a slightly triangular almighty, and a cautery under the navel almost like two fingers.
Et si cogitas, quod stomachus eius infrigidatus sit, et cibus eius non digeratur, et faciem eius uides apostemari, tunc cauteriza eum super stomachum cauterio magno, secundum quod praecessit: et cauterio super Epar eius, et alio super Splenem ipsius, cum cauterio clauili: et dimitte cauterium apertum tempore aliquo: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	And if you think that his stomach is cold, and his food is not digested, and you see his face turn pale, then cauterize him over the stomach with a large cautery, according to what preceded it: and cauterize on his Epopeus, and with another on his Splenium, with a clavicle cautery: and leave the cautery open for some time: and then cure him, until he is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi althelul post abscisionem eorum.	On the mode of cauterizing athel after their division.
Caput XXXVII.	Chapter 37. On the Mode of Cauterizing Athel
Quando tu abscindis althelul, tunc ignias cauterium quod assimilatur radio.	When you cut off the athel, then you light a cautery which is radiated with fire.
Deinde intromittite ipsum ignitum in ipsum althelul abscisum: et ultima manum tuam, donec perueniat cauterium ad orificium uenae, ex qua currit sanguis: fac illud semel, aut bis.	Then introduce the lit athel into the cut athel: and with your hand, until the cautery reaches the opening of the anus, from which runs blood: do this once, or twice.
Si ergo althelul fuerint multa, tunc cauteriza unumquodque cauterio secundum quod narrauimus.	If there are many athel, then cauterize each one according to what we have described.
Deinde cura ea, cum eo quod confert eis ex unguentis, donec sanentur.	Then cure them with the ointment, along with what is appropriate for them, until they are healed.
Et si cauterizas eum cauterio magno super alcatin, est magis ultimum in iuuamento.	And if you cauterize him with a large cautery over the sacrum, it is more final in its effect.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Fistulam in ano.	To cauterize the fistula in the anus.
Caput XXXVIII.	Chapter 38 on Head.
Quando non obedit infirmus sectioni et operi quod narrauimus in loco suo, et terretur ab illo, fortasse sanatur cum cauterio.	When the patient does not submit to cutting and the operation that we have described in its place, and trembles at it, perhaps he will be healed with cauterization.
Cum ergo accidit alicui Fistula, et antiquatur, currit pus ex ea, et humiditates corruptae.	When then happens to someone a fistula, and it is old, pus runs out of it, and corrupt moisture.
Dignius ergo quod oportet est, ut probes eam cum tenta subtili.	It is fitting that you should test it with a subtle touch.
Deinde cognosce quantitatem profunditatis eius cum tenta.	Then know the depth of its quantity by testing.
Deinde ignias cauterium, quod est simile radio.	Then light a cautery fire, which is like a ray.
Deinde intromit te ipsum ignitum in ipsam Fistulam et quantitatem in qua intrauit clauus.	Then insert yourself with the lit cautery into the fistula and measure how much it enters.
Et itera super eam cauterium, donec comburantur illa omnia corpora corrupta, semel, aut bis, aut ter, secundum quantitatem necessitatis tuae.	And repeatedly pass the cautery over it until all corrupt bodies are burned up, once, or twice, or three times, depending on the need.
Et custodi te ab adustione nerui, si est illic, aut uenae magnae: aut si Fistula uadit ad corpus uesicae, aut ad corpus intestini, tunc custodi te ab istis locis omnibus.	And guard yourself from burning of the nerve, if there is one, or a large vein: or if the fistula opens into the body of the uterus, or the body of the intestine, then guard yourself from all such places.
Et non facias illud, nisi quando fistula est in loco carnoso: et cogitas, quia non est penetrans.	And do not do this unless the fistula is in a fleshy place: and consider that it does not penetrate.
Deinde cura locum usquequo sanetur.	Then take care of the place until it is healed.
Si autem sigillatur locus, et abscinduntur ab eo materiae, et remanet sic tempore longo: tunc scias, quia iam sanatus est integre.	But if the place seals itself and no more material is shed from it for a long time: then know that it has been completely healed.
Et si non abscindunt ab eo materiae, tunc scias quia est penetrans, aut in profundo eius est os corruptum, aut quasi illud ex illis: quorum rememoratio ueniet in loco suo.	And if no material is shed from it, then know that it is penetrating, or has an opening into its depth, or almost like it: of which remember the place.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Renes.	The way to cauterize the kidneys.
Caput XXXIX.	Chapter 39 on Head.
Quando accidit in Renibus dolor ex frigore, aut ex uentositate grossa, et minuitur propter illud coius infirmi, tunc oportet ut cauterizes ipsum super almethenem super ipsos renes, cauterio super omnem renem cum cauterio clauili, cuius praecessit rememoratio.	When pain from cold or a gross wind afflicts the kidneys and they are aching because of it, then you should cauterize each kidney individually from above, with a cautery on all the kidneys with a nail, whose reminder was this.
Et fortasse cauterizamus ipsum secundo in ipso almeidatu.	And perhaps we cauterized him himself second by himself almeidatu.
Quare uenient tria lineata.	Why are there three lined.
Ergo erunt magis ultima in iuuamento.	Therefore will be the last in iuuamento.
¶ De modo cauteritzandi Vesicam.	§ On the way to cauterize the Vesica.
Caput XL.	Head 40.
Quando accidunt in Vesica debilitas, et mollificatio a frigo re et humiditatibus, donec non retineat infirmus urinam, tunc cauteriza ipsum in inferiori parte suminis super Vesicam, ubi incipiunt pili pectinis, et cauterio a dextra suminis, et alio a sinistra illius: et sit longitudo illius cauterizationis lateris secundum quantitatem nodi pollicis: et cauteriza ipsum cauterio inferiori dorsi, aut duobus cauteriis, si indiges illo: et sit secundum quod praecessit cauterium clauile.	When it happens in Vesica weakness, and softening from cold re and moisture, until he does not retain weak urinarv, then cauterize him himself at the bottom of the supply over Vesica, where begin the hair of the comb, and cautery from the right supply, and another from his left: and sit length of his cauterization later side according to quantity of knuckle pollicis: and cauterize him himself cauterio lower back, or two cauteries if you tolerate that: and sit according to what came before cauterium claw.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Matricem.	§ On the way to cauterize the Matrix.
Caput XLI.	Head 41.
Quando accidunt in Matrice frigus et humiditates, et prohibetur per illud ab impregnatione, et corrumpuntur menstrua eius, et tardatur prouocatio eorum, et accidit ei apud aduentum eorum dolor, tunc oportet ut cauterizetur tribus cauteriis in circumitu umbilici, sicut diximus in cauterizatione uesicae, et cauterio super alcatim inferius dorso, aut duobus cauteriis: et sit cauterium clauile.	When it happens in Matrix cold and moisture, and it is forbidden by him from impregnation, and his menstrua corrupt, and is delayed their provocation, and happens to him at the aduentum of them a pain, then it should be ut cauterizetur tribus cauteriis in circumitu umbilici, sicut diximus in cauterizatione uesicae, and cautery on alcatim lower back, or two cauteries: and sit cautery claw.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Ancham in dislocatione.	§ On the way to cauterize the Anus in dislocation.
Caput XLII.	Head 42.
Quando effunduntur humiditates mucosae ad pixidem Anchae, et fiunt caussa exitus eius a loco suo: et signum illius est, quod prolongatur crus super alterum, quando comparantur adinuicem: et inuenitur locus dislocationis in eo uacuus.	When are poured out humidities of the mucous Anus to the faeces, and is a cause of exit from its place: and the sign of it is that he prolongs his crus over another, when they face one to another: and is found the location of dislocation in that vacuus.
Oportet ergo ut cauterizes infirmum super pixidem Anchae ipsius cauterio simili circulo: postquam tu signas cum encaustro in circumitu pixidis, sicut reuoluitur: et ut cadat ipsa pixis in medio circuli.	Therefore it should be that cauterizes the weak on the Anus of himself similar circle: after which you have the signs with the caustice in circumitu pixidis, like a refolded: and let fall itself pixis in the middle of the circle.
Et sit cauterium cuius forma praecessit in cauterizatione stomachi.	And set the cautery whose form preceded in the cauterization of the stomach.
Quod si tibi non est praesens hoc cauterium, tunc cauteriza ipsum tribus cauteriis, cum cauterio oliuari magno: et fiat cauterio profunditas secundum quantitatem spissitudinis cutis totius.	That if you do not have this cautery present, then cauterize it with three cauteries, with a large olive oil cautery: and let the depth of the cautery be according to the thickness of the skin of all.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then take care of the wound, until it heals.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Sciatica.	The mode of cauterizing in sciatica.
Caput XLIII.	Chapter LIII.
Quando accidit dolor in pixide anchae, et sunt caussa illius frigus et humiditates: et curatur infirmus cum eo, quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio, et antiquatur illud: tunc oportet ut soluas infirmum ab humoribus grossis cum pillulis foetidis, aut cum pillulis artificialibus, et similibus.	When it happens that there is pain in the sciatic nerve, and there is a cause for this pain, cold and wetness: and the sick person is treated with it as we have said in the division, and there is no cure, and it becomes stale: then it is necessary that you should separate the sick person from gross humors with fetid pills, or with artificial pills, and others.
Deinde cauteriza eum.	Then cauterize it.
Et modus cauterii in ea est secundum duos modos: aut cauterium cum medicinis adurentibus, aut cauterium cum igne.	And the mode of the cautery in her is according to two ways: either the cautery with burning medicines, or the cautery with fire.
Cauterium cum igne, est secundum multos modos.	The cautery with fire is according to many ways.
Quorum unus est, ut cauterizes super pixidem anchae ipsius tribus cauteriis triangulatis, secundum hanc formam.	One of these is, that you cauterize over the sciatic plexus with three triangular cauteries, according to this form.
Et fac eis profunditatem bonam, uel malam.	And let them be of good depth, or bad.
Et sit spacium quod est inter omne cauterium quantitatis grossitudinis digiti: sitque cauterium oliuare.	And there is a space which is according to the thickness of the finger between every cautery; and let there be an olive oil cautery.
Quandoque autem fit cauterium in medio super caput anchae ipsius.	When however it happens that the cautery is made in the middle on top of the sciatic plexus itself.
Quare sunt quatuor cauteria.	Why are there four cauteries?
Et si uis cauteriza cum circulo, cuius praecessit forma in cauterizatione dislocationis anchae, uno: ut sit circulus continens ancham totam.	And if you wish to cauterize with a circle, whose form preceded in the cauterization of the sciatic dislocation, one: that it is a circle containing all the sciatica.
Et combure spissitudinem cutis totius.	And burn up the thickness of the skin of all.
Iste est modus cauterii in Sciatica, quando dolor est adhaerens anchae ipsi, et non extenditur usque ad coxam et crus.	This is the mode of cauterizing in sciatica, when there is a painful adherence to the sciatic itself, and does not extend until the pelvis and legs.
Si autem extenditur usque ad coxam et crus, tunc cauteriza ipsum duobus cauteriis super coxam, super locum ad quem innuit illic infirmus, in quo est dolor, et cauterio tuo super cauillam quatuor digitis ad partem syluestrem parumper: et sit cauterium cultellare.	But if it extends until the pelvis and legs, then cauterize it with two cauteries on top of the pelvis, on the place where the pain is, and with your cautery on the four fingers slightly towards the outside: and let there be a scalpel-like cautery.
Et sit profunditas cauterii secundum profunditatem spissitudinis cutis.	And let the depth of the incision correspond to the thickness of the skin.
Quod si infirmus innuit quod dolor extenditur usque prope digitos pedis, tunc cauteriza ipsum illic ubi innuit cum cauterio puncti, tribus, aut quatuor, aut pluribus, si indiget illo.	If the patient complains that the pain extends up to the toes, then cauterize him at that place with a single, double, triple or multiple punctures, depending on his tolerance.
Et si innuit dolorem esse sub genu uersus crus, tunc cauteriza ipsum illic cauterio uno cultellari.	And if the patient complains of pain under the knee towards the leg, then cauterize him there with a single knife cut.
Et caue tibi in omni cauterizatione tua, ut non ultimes cum cauterio ad hoc ut comburas neruum, aut arteriam magnam, et attrahas per illud super infirmum nocumentum malum, aut contractionem.	And make sure that with all your cauterizations, you do not end up with the knife burning nerves, or a large artery, and do not cause harm to any bad disease or contraction on it.
Et ego quidem iam uidi unum et alium, ex eis qui cauterizauerunt supra cauillam, et ultimauerunt in cauterizatione, et inflatum est crus, donec tumor consecutus est pedem, et perforatus est totus, et corruptus est totus pes: deinde accidit solutio uentris, et mors post illud.	And I have seen one and another who cauterized on top of the thigh, and were finished with the cauterization, and their leg became swollen, until a tumor was formed, and it was perforate all over, and corrupted all over: then there happened a solution of the blood, and death after that.
Quod si dolor est in duabus partibus simul, cauteriza utramque secundum hunc modum.	If the pain is on both sides at the same time, cauterize one side according to this method:
Et sapientes quidam dixerunt in cauterizatione anchae, cuius cauterii iste est modus.	And some wise people have said about the cauterization of the anchal, whose cauterization is this way:
Fac simile samio ex ferro, cuius diametrus sit medietas palmi: et sit apud orificium suum secundum grossitudinem nuclei dactyli, aut minus parumper: et intra illud samium sit samium tertium.	Make a similar shape out of iron, whose diameter is half the size of the palm, and let it be placed at the opening according to the thickness of the finger nail or less, and let there be another one inside that third.
Et sit spacium quod est inter omne samium per quantitatem nodi pollicis: et sint samia aperta a duabus partibus: et sit altitudo eorum quasi nodus, aut duo nodi: et fac eis manubrium ex ferro decenter aptatum in samiis.	And let there be a space between each anchal that is the quantity of the thumb nail: and let there be openings on both sides: and make their height almost like a knot, or two knots: and make them handle-like by bending them in the anchae.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its shape.
Deinde igniatur in igne, donec rubeat, et proiiciat scintillas: deinde ponatur super pixidem anchae infirmo accubitato super latus sanum.	Then let it be heated in fire until it turns red, and let sparks come off: then place it on a plate of the anchal lying down on the healthy side.
Cauteriza ergo eum tribus cauteriis rotundis in uice una.	So cauterize it with three round cuts in one direction.
Deinde dimitte ipsum tribus diebus.	Then let him leave the wound to the tribes for three days.
Postea emplastra cum butyro: et dimitte uulnus apertum diebus multis.	Then bind it with butter: and let the open wound stand many days.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then take care of the wound with ointment, until it is healed.
Inquit Albucasis, hac specie cauterii o filii, parum usi sumus, propter terrorem aspectus eius: et propterea, quod paucos inuenimus qui expectent super ipsum.	Says Al-Bu-Kaas, with this kind of burn, we use very little because of the fearsome appearance of it: and therefore, because there are few who wait over it.
Verumtamen est ex bonis cauteriis ei qui suffert, et inuenit cum eo locum eius.	However, it is from good cauterization that he suffers, and remains with him the place of his wound.
Cauterium autem cum medicinis adurentibus est, ut tu facias duo samia habentia perforatam armillam, in quam descendit cardo portae eius ex aere, aut ferro, longitudo parietis: quorum in altitudinem eorum sint duo nodi, aut quasi ipsi.	But the cauterium with doctors who attend him is, so that you make two knots with a loop that comes down with the bar of his door from iron, or from brass, its length to their height: and there are two knots on them, or almost like themselves.
Et sit spacium quod est inter utraque quantitas grossitudinis digiti, et sint aperta inferius et superius: et sit quod contineant se adinuicem, secundum hanc formam.	And there should be a space that is between the two equal amounts of thickness of the finger, and they are open upper and lower: and there should be one that holds itself in the opposite direction, according to this form.
Deinde depone eam super pixidem anchae, infirmo iacente super latus sanum.	Then place it on ash-paste, the sick man lying on the healthy side.
Et comprime manum tuam super pixidem anchae multum.	And press your hand hard on the ash-paste.
Deinde funde inter duos circulos ex aqua calida, quae sit calefacta cum igne parumper, et tene eam quantitate horae temporalis: et toleret infirmus mordicationem eius, et ipsius adustionem, nam ipse inuenit mordicationem sicut ignis, donec quiescat mordicatio.	Then pour between the two circles of hot water, which is warmed with fire slightly, and hold it for a quantity of time: and let the sick man feel the tingling of it, and his own burning, for he finds the tingling like fire, until he sleeps from it.
Deinde eleua manum tuam cum instrumento, et absterge aquam calidam ab ancha tota cum aqua dulci: deinde dimitte illud tribus diebus.	Then wash your hand with an instrument, and rinse all the ash completely with sweet water: then let it stand for three days.
Et pone super illud butyrum, donec remoueatur nigredo adustionis: et dimitte illud diebus aliquot, et curret ex eo pus.	And put butter on it, until it removes the blackness of burning: and let it stand for a few days, and let the pus run out from it.
Est enim ultimum in iuuamento.	For it is the latest in healing.
Deinde cura illud cum unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then take care of that with ointment, until it is healed.
Quod si extendatur dolor usque ad coxam, aut crus: fac ei statuam in eo quod continet aquam, secundum quod fecisti in ancha aequaliter.	If the pain extends to the hip, or the foot: let him have a standing position in it that holds water, according to what you did in the ash equally.
Et iste est modus aquae calidae: et ego iam scripsi eam in tractatu rectificationis medicinarum.	And this is the method for hot and cold water: I have already written about it in my treatise on rectifying medicines.
Sume alcali, et calcis non extinctae amborum ana partem unam: tere utraque, et pone ea in ollam nouam, cuius inferior pars sit perforata foramine uno paruo, secundum quantitatem quod ingrediatur ipsum radius: et pone sub fundo ollae ollam aliam uitreatam: et proiice super alcali et calcem ex aqua dulci, quod submergat utraque per digitum: post quam tu comprimas ea manu tua compressione bona: et dimite ollam, donec descendat aqua acuta inferiori parte ollae uitreatae.	Take the two medicines, one part alkaline and one part non-extinct calcis; mix them together, and put them into a new jug with a small hole at the bottom of one part only, according to the quantity that is to be added: and put under the bottom of the jug another jug empty: and pour on the water from the sweet well which immerses both of them with the finger: then squeeze them together firmly with your hand; and let the jugs go until the sharp water comes out at the bottom of the jug.
Deinde aggrega illam aquam totam, et proiice eam super aliam calcem: et cola, donec renouetur.	Then collect the whole water, and pour it on the other calcis; and drink it up, until it returns again.
Ipsa enim erit tunc fortis acuitatis ualde, quae administratur in multis operationibus medicinae, et in cauterizatione reliquorum membrorum.	This will then be very strong in acidity, which is administered in many medicinal operations, and in the cauterization of the remaining members.
Quoniam efficit operationem ignis ipsius.	For it efficacious in operation of fire itself.
Et ex medicinis sunt, cum quibus cauterizantur ancha, etiam sicut tesisie, et mel anacardi, et calx cum sapone, ita quod utraque sint permixta. ¶	And from medicines are, with which they cauterize the broad, also as theriacakis, and honey of anacardium, and calcic soap, so that both are mixed together.
Et Galenus quidem narrando retulit, cuiusdam uiri ex antiquis curationem, qua curatus est dolor anchae et uenae sciaticae: et magnificauit esse eius ualde.	And Galenus himself reported, relating of a man of the ancient cure, who was cured of pain in the ankle and sciatic pain: and he praised it very much.
Et dixit, quia non indiguit alia curatione, et quia sanatus est ex uice una, donec retulit, quia ipse fortasse intrauit balneum delatus, et exiuit ex eo iam sanus.	And he said, "He did not like any other cure, and was cured from one foot only, until he reported, that perhaps he entered into a hot bath, and came out already well.
Et est, ut accipiatur ex seitaragi uiridi: et si non inuenitur uiride, sumatur siccum, recens: et teratur multum cum aliquanto adipe, et ponatur super ancham, ubi est dolor, aut crus, aut in coxa: et ligetur, et dimittatur quantitate trium horarum, aut per quantitatem quod sentiat infirmus sedationem adustionis.	And this is to be taken from the seitaragi man: and if a viride is not found, it is taken just as it is, fresh: and it is massaged much with some fat, and placed on the ankle, where the pain is, or on the hip: and it is bound up, and left for three hours, or for such a quantity that the patient feels the sensation of painful tedium.
Deinde intromitte eum in balneum.	Then introduce him into the bath.
Cum ergo roridum fit corpus eius, intromitte ipsum in solium.	When therefore the body becomes hot, introduce it into the heat.
Nam dolor recedit, et sanatur.	For the pain has subsided, and he is recovering.
Et scias, quia non oportet ut utatur aliquis cauterio cum istis medicinis, nisi post euacuationem corporis.	And you should know that it is not appropriate to use any medicine with these medicines unless after the body has been evacuated.
Et Dioscorides qui dem dixit, quod stercus caprarum, quando cum eo cauterizatur uena sciatica, confert ei: et fit cauterium secundum hunc modum.	And Dioscorides, who said that when the dung of goats is applied with fire to a sciatic pain, it will be cured; and it becomes a fire in this way.
Sumatur lana, et imbibatur oleo antiquo, et ponatur super locum profundum, qui est inter pollicem pedis, et inter focile, et est propinquior focili.	The wool is dried, and imbibes the old oil, and is placed on a deep place, which is between the thumb of the foot, and between the fire, and is closer to the fire.
Deinde accipe stercus caprarum siccum, et inflamma ipsum in igne, donec fiat carbo.	Then take the goat dung as it is, and set it on fire in the fire, until it becomes a coal.
Deinde pone ipsum super lanam, et dimitte ipsum, donec extinguatur.	Then place the coal on the wool, and leave it until it goes out.
Deinde itera illud.	Then repeat this.
Non cesses ergo facere illud, usquequo perueniat sensus super mediatione usque ad ancham, et quiescat dolor.	So do not stop doing that, until the sense has become accustomed to the mediation up to the ankle, and the pain has rested.
Et iste modus cauterii nominatur cauterium Vaccinum.	And this method of cautery is called Vaccinium cautery.
¶ De cauterizatione doloris Dorsi.	§ On the cauterization of the pain of the back.
Caput XLIIII.	Head 44.
Quandoque accidit dolor in Dorso ex caussis multis, aut a casu, aut a percussione, aut euacuatione superflua, et illis similibus, ex infusione materiei frigidae, et humidae: et cauterium quidem non cadit, nisi in hac specie sola, quae fit ex infusione materiei frigidae.	When pain occurs in the back from various causes, or from injury, or from excessive discharge, and such like, by means of cold and wet material: and cauterization does not take place unless in this one form alone, which is made by applying cold material.
Oportet ergo post euacuationem infirmi cum pillulis foetidis, et eis similibus, ut fiant super Dorsum, ubi est dolor, tres lineae secundum latitudinem almeidati ipsius, postquam signas cum encaustro in omni linea quinque cauteria, aut plura secundum quantitatem quae uenit ex tolerantia infirmi uirtute eius: et fiat cauterizatio cum cauteriopuncti.	It is necessary therefore after the discharge of the wounds with pungent pills, and similar ones, that they may be placed on the back where there is pain, three lines according to the length of the spine itself, after having marked them with fire in every line; five cauterizations, or more according to the quantity which comes from the tolerance of the wound's virtue: and let cauterization be made with cautery punctures.
Et si uis, cauteriza tribus cauteriis, aut quatuor, cum cauterio clauili mediali, secundum hanc formam.	And if you wish, cauterize three cauterizations, or four, with the middle clavus, according to this form.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in incaeptine Gibbositatis.	To cauterize in the cauldron of gibbosity.
Caput XLV.	Ch. De modo cauterizandi in incaept
Multotiens accidit haec aegritudo infantibus paruis.	This illness often occurs in small children.
Et signum incaeptionis eius in pueris est: quod accidit super eum strictura in anhelitu apud eleuationem, et motum: et inuenis in ultima spondilium Dorsi et nodorum eius, quod iam incaepit eminere super reliquos spondiles.	And the sign of this illness in children is: that which happens to him a rigor in hunger when they are lifted up, and movement: and an swelling in the last spine of the back and knots of him, which already began to emerge over the other spines.
Cum ergo uides illud, et uis facere illud, tunc cauteriza ipsum cum cauterio quod sit circulus secundum hanc formam.	When you see this, and want to make it, then cauterize him with the cauldron that sits in this form a circle.
Et capiat cauterium super omnem partem spondilis aequaliter: et si uis cauteriza in circumitu spondilis cum cauterio puncti duas lineas, aut tres: et sint puncta propinqua adinuicem.	And he takes the cautery over all parts of the spine equally: and if you want to cauterize around the spine with the cauldron of a dot two lines, or three: and let be dots nearby side by side.
Deinde cura locum, donec sanetur cum eo quod diximus.	Then care for the place, until it is healed with him that I said.
Et caue, ne administres cauterium in gibbositate, quae fit in spasmo nerui.	And be careful, do not administer the cauldron to gibbosity, which is done in a spasm of a nerve.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Podagra, et doloribus iuncturarum.	Ch. On the mode cauterizing in podagra, and pains of joints.
Caput XLVI.	Chapter XLVVI.
Quando dolores iuncturarum sunt ab humiditatibus frigidis, quae effunduntur ad cuiuslibet membra corporis, tunc quando accidunt dolores in pedibus, de consuetudine medicorum est, ut nominent illud Podagram proprie.	When the pains of joints are from cold humidities that are poured out to any member of the body, then when these pains occur in the feet, it is the custom of the doctors to name it podagra by right.
Cum ergo curatur Podagra frigidae caussae cum modis curationis, et non remouentur dolores, tune cauterium remouet eos.	When this podagra of cold cause is cured with modes of curing, and the pains do not move away, then remove the cautery to move them.
Et est, ut cauterizes eum post euacuationem in circumitu iuncturae pedum, cauteriis multis: et sit cauterium Oliuare.	And is, as cauterizes him after his evacuation in the circumférence of the joint of the feet, caulteries many: and let be the cauldron Olive oil.
Cuius haec est forma.	Whose this form.
Et si indiges ut punctes super faciem pedis, tunc fac cum cauterio puncti.	And if you can stand as dots on the face of the foot, then do it with a dot of cauldron.
Quod si ascendunt dolores usque ad genua, aut reliquas iuncturas, et multotiens accidit illud, tunc cauteriza ipsum super omne genu tribus cauteriis, aut quatuor ab omni parte, cum hoc eodem cauterio Clauili.	That if they ascend pains up to the knees, or other joints, and often this happens: then cauterize him over all knee with four cauldron, or six from every part, with this same cauldron of Olive oil.
Si autem necessaria sunt tibi plura hoc cauterio, tunc cauteriza ipsum.	If, however, you need more of this remedy, then cauterize him then.
Et non submergas manum tuam cum cauterio, imo sit circiter spissitudinem cutis tantum.	And do not submerge your hand with the caustic, but rather sit around it with only the spiciness of the skin.
Si autem ascendunt dolores ad genua, et dorsum: tunc administra quod diximus ex cauterio in capitulo suo.	If, however, the pains rise up to the knees, and the back: then administer what we said above from the caustic in our chapter.
Quod si dolores sunt in manibus tantum, tunc puncta in circumitu focilium, sicut reuoluuntur duae lineae.	That if the pains are only in the hands, then poke around with fire, as they return like two lines.
Si autem remanet ex doloribus in digitis, tunc puncta eos, super omnem nodum punctum, et super pectinem manus.	If, however, there remains any pain in the fingers, then poke them, over every lump a point, and over the palm of the hand.
Si autem ascendunt dolores post dies ad cubitos, aut ad humeros, tunc cauteriza utrosque ab omni parte.	If, however, the pains rise up after days to the elbows, or to the shoulders, then cauterize both of them from all parts.
Et non euacues infirmum ex regimine bono, ex recaeptione medicinarum.	And do not let the sick person recover from a good regimen, from the reception of medicines.
Nam si bonum fiat regimen, et euacuetur phlegma, sanabitur auxilio Dei cum isto cauterio.	For if the regimen is made good, and the phlegm is excreted, it will be healed by the help of God with this caustic.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Rupturis.	On the Manner of Causing a Burn to Heale Broken Bones.
Caput XLVII.	Head XLVII.
Quando accidit Ruptura in inguinibus, et descendit intestinum, aut zirbum ad testiculum, et est illud incipiens propinquum: tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmo dimittere comestionem in die suo.	When a Rupture has occurred in the groin, and has descended into the bowels, or to the testicle, and it is beginning to be near to the scrotum: then you shall order the sick person to cease from food in his own day.
Et utatur ex lenientibus, quo descendat stercus a uentre suo.	And let him use laxatives, so that the dung may descend from his own gut.
Deinde sedeat inter manus tuas super dorsum suum: et praecipe ei, ut teneat anhelitum suum, donec egrediatur, uel appareat zirbum, aut intestinum.	Then let him sit between your hands on his back: and order him that he hold his breath until he has gone forth, or show his buttocks, or his intestine.
Deinde reduc ipsum digitis tuis, et signa cum encaustro sub Ruptura super os pectinis, cum signo cuius extremitas sit similis medietati circuli ad superiora corporis.	Then let him reduce the man with your fingers, and mark with the caustic under a Rupture on the top of the pelvis, with the sign whose end is similar to half a circle towards the upper part of the body.
Deinde igni cauterium, cuius haec est forma, donec ueniat album, et proiiciat seintillas.	Then let the caustic fire be held, with this form, until it has become white, and throw off sparks.
Deinde reduc intestinum, aut zirbum ad concauitatem suam.	Then let the intestine be reduced, or the buttocks to its cavity.
Deinde ponat minister manum suam super locum, ut non exeat intestinum: et tu iam aperuisti inter crura infirmi, et posuisti sub eo puluinar, et seruiens alius super crura eius, et alius super pectus eius qui tenet manus.	Then let the attendant place his hand upon the place so that he does not exit the intestines: and you have already opened between the ribs of the sick person, and placed under it the penis, and one servant stands on his ribs, and another on his chest who holds the hands.
Deinde depone cauterium super ipsum signum, manu tua cum cauterio stante recta.	Then let him deposit the caustic on the spot, with your hand holding the caustic upright.
Et tene ipsum, donec cum eo consequaris os: aut itera cum eo uice alia, si non consecutus fueris cum eo in prima usque ad os.	And hold him, until you are satisfied with him: or else go again with him by another route, if you are not satisfied with him in the first place up to the mouth.
Et prudenter obserua ab exitu intestini in hora cauterizationis tuae, ne comburas ipsum, et eueniat per illud super infirmum aut mors, aut malicia magna.	And carefully observe that there is no exit from the intestines at the time of your cauterization, so that he does not burn himself, and let him go through it to the sick or to death, or great mischief.
Et scias, quod quando tu non consequeris cum cauterio os, non confert operatio tua.	And know that when you do not achieve the mouth with the caustic, your operation is fruitless.
Et oportet ut sit cauterium infantium subtile, secundum mensuram eorum.	And it should be that the caustic of infants is subtle, according to their measure.
Deinde cura cum reliquis unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then care for him with the rest of the ointment, until he recovers.
Et sit infirmus iacens super dorsum suum quadraginta diebus, donec sigilletur uulnus.	And let the sick person lie on his back for forty days, until the wound is closed.
Et oportet, ut ponas nutrimentum eius longitudine temporis curationis eius, quod leniat uentrem eius: ut non exeat intestinum apud conamen et egestionem.	And let him take food by length of time of his cure, which softens his gut: so that he does not exit the intestines through desire and defecation.
Deinde quando uult surgere post quadraginta dies, tunc administra ligamentum decenter factum, et teneat ipsum quadraginta diebus aliis.	Then when he should rise after forty days, then give him a looser ligature, and let him hold for forty more days.
Et minoretur a labore, et repletione cibi et potus, et uocibus uehementibus.	And let him abstain from work, and be filled with food and drink, and loud speeches.
Nam quando utitur hoc regimine, ita sanatur sanatione integra.	For when he uses this regimen, he is healed by a whole cure.
Et ego dicam curationem Rupturarum cum incisione in capitulo suo.	And I will tell the cure of ruptures with an incision in its chapter.
Quando autem Rupturae accidunt in reliquo uentre, et sunt incipientes, et uis ut non addantur, tunc cauteriza Rupturam eius cauterio rotundo secundum quantitatem eius: et sit illud quod aduritur ex tunc sicut tertia eius.	When, however, ruptures occur in the remaining gut, and are incipient, and do not enter, then cauterize his rupture with your round caustic according to its quantity: and let it be what is burned from then on as the third one.
Deinde cura ipsum, cum eo quod diximus: et non addetur.	Then take care of yourself, as we have said: and do not be led astray.
Et iam dixerunt quidam primi: ut cauterizetur Ruptura cum cauterio triangulato, secundum hanc formam.	And some have said first: that it should be cauterized with a triangular cautery, according to this form.
Postquam signatur cum encaustro, et ponitur linea quae est per latitudinem in latere superiori Rupturae, et linea altera ad inferius.	Afterwards sign it with encaustic, and place the line which is across from the lateral upper part of the rupture, and another line towards the bottom.
Et depone manum tuam in medio cum cauterio clauili.	And put your hand in the middle with the cautery closed.
Sed cauterium primum est facilius et melius.	But it is easier and better to use the cautery first.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in doloribus propter casum, aut percussionem.	The mode of cauterizing in pains by accident, or by percussion.
Caput XLVIII.	Chapter LXVIII.
Quando accidit in quibusdam membris a casu, aut percussione dolor: et perseuerat ille dolor tempore longo, et non confert in eo curatio cum medicinis: tunc oportet ut cauterizetur cum cauterio Puncti.	When it happens in some member by accident, or by percussion: and that pain persists a long time, and does not respond to treatment with medicines: then it should be cauterized with the Pointed cautery.
Et sit cauterium omnis membri cauterium secundum magnitudinem eius, et ipsius paruitatem, et debilitatem eius, et ipsius uirtutem, et locationem torsionis, et doloris ex eo.	And let the cautery be to all members according to its size, and its health, and its weakness, and its virtue, and its location of twist, and the pain from it.
Si ergo sanatur ex cauterio primo, est bene.	But if it is healed by the first cauterization, it is good.
Si non: tunc itera super ipsum cauterium.	If not: then repeat on top of it the cauterization.
Quoniam de consuetudine horum dolorum est, ut permutentur ex membro ad illud quod appropinquat ei.	For these pains are used to pass from one member to another as it approaches that which is affected.
Quare oportet ut consequaris eos cum cauterio, donec sanetur infirmus.	Why should the consequences be caused by the cautery, until the sick is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Lepra.	The mode of cauterizing in Leprosy.
Caput XLIX.	Chapter LIX.
Leprosi autem quandoque iuuantur cauterio iuuamento maximo.	But the lepers should be cauterized by a sharp instrument.
Et praecipue species Leprae, quae fit propter putrefactionem phlegmatis et melancholiae: cum ergo uis cauterizare ipsam considera.	And especially the characteristic of Leprosy, which is caused by putrefaction of phlegm and melancholy: so that you consider carefully how to cauterize it.
Si ergo Lepra est ineipiciens, et curasti eam cum eo, quod diximus in diuisione, et non descendit, neque stat: et times super infirmum, quod comprehendat corruptio super totam complexionem eius: tunc cauteriza eum super caput quinque cauteriis: uno in medio capitis noto, et secundo inferius eo uersus frontem apud finem capillorum, et duobus super duo cornua, et uno posterius super nucea ceruicis.	If this Leprosy is not open, and you have treated it with the one we have mentioned in the division, and it has not come down, nor stayed: and you wait for the disease to encompass the whole complexion: then cauterize him on top of the head with five cauteries: one in the middle of the hairline, and a second lower down towards the forehead at the end of the hair, and two above the two ears, and one behind the nape of the neck.
Et ultima manum tuam cum cauterio parumper, donec imprimat in os impressionem paruam, et dislocentur ex eo cortices: ut alleuietur expiratio uaporum grossorum ex eo, et cauteriza cauterio etiam super ipsum splenem, secundum quod praecessit.	And last, you shall hold your hand with the cautery just a little while, until it prints upon the mouth an impression of pallor, and the membranes are displaced from it; that the expiration of the vapors of great heat may be relieved, and the cautery also over the splenetic organ, according to what went before.
Sin autem Lepra iam sparsa est super infirmum, et apparet manifeste: tunc oportet ut cauterizes cum istis cauteriis, quae diximus in capite, et cauterio super extremitatem nasi, et duobus cauteriis super duas maxillas, et duobus cauteriis super spondiles colli, et sex super spondiles dorsi, et uno magno super alhahosos apud gran caudae et uno supra ipsum, in ipso almeidati: et duobus super anchas: scilicet super omnem ancham uno, et duobus super genua: uno super omne genu, et duobus super humeros, et duobus super cubitos, et duobus super teneritudines pectoris sui: et cauteriza ipsum super omnem iuncturam, ex iuncturis digitorum manuum suarum, et pedum suorum: et cauteriza super omnem calcaneum pedum suorum, et focilia manuum suarum.	But if the leper has already spread on the sick person and appears clearly: then you shall cauterize with these cauteries which we said in the beginning, and with a cautery on the tip of the nose, and two cauteries on the two cheeks, and two cauteries on the two sides of the neck, and six on the sides of the back, and one great one on the hahosas near the tail end and one above it: and two on the shoulders and two on the elbows, and two on the breasts, and one on the entire chest, from the connection of the fingers of his hands and feet: and cauterize him on all joints, from the connection of the fingers of his hands and the feet of his feet: and cauterize him on all heels of his feet, and on the knuckles of his hands.
Et caue tibi a neruis qui sunt super postremum calcanei, ut non comburas eos.	And so that you do not burn them, take care from the nerves that are at the very end of the heel.
Et quandoque cauterizatur cauterio super os pectinis, et alio super os stomachi, et alio super epar.	And when one is cauterized with a cautery on the bone of the chest, and another on the bone of the stomach, and another on the liver.
Et scias, quod quanto plus addis cauterium, est magis iuuamentum, et magis conferens.	And you should know that the more you add cautery, the greater is the benefit, and the more it confers.
Et scias, quod infirmus non inuenit in cauterio dolorem, sicut inueniunt ipsum sani: propterea, quod corpus eius iam stupefactum est.	And you should know that a sick person does not feel pain in the cautery, unlike a healthy person: therefore because his body is already stunned.
Et oportet ut sint cauteria ex magnitudine, et paruitate secundum membra et iuncturas: secundum quod praecessit ex speciebus ferramentorum.	And it is fitting that the cauteries should be of a size and proportion appropriate to the limbs and joints: according to what went before from the appearance of the tools of the trade.
Deinde cura cauterium ex farina herbi cum melle, et reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then care for the cauteries with flour of herb and honey, and with the rest of the cure, until it is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Stupore.	To cauterize in a stupor.

Quando stupet aliquod membrum, et curatur cum medicinis, et oleis, et emplastris, et non sanatur, tunc cauteriza ipsum membrum stupefactum cauteriis, secundum quod meretur magnitudo membri, aut paruitas eius.	When a limb is stuporous and does not heal with medicines, oils, plasters, and so on, then cauterize the limb that is stuporous with cautery, according as the magnitude of the limb is increased, or its diminutio
Et sit cauterium tuum intrans in spissitudinem cutis parumper.	And place your cautery instrument within the thickness of the skin a little.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then care for the limb with ointment until it is healed.
Et quandoque cauterizatur ad quiddam stuporis, qui accidit manui, et pedi, in spondilibus dorsi apud exitum neruorum, qui mouent illud membrum: et remouetur stupor.	And sometimes when cauterization occurs for some stupefaction which befalls the hand, or foot, in the spine of the back near the exit of nerves which stir that limb: and the stupefaction is removed.
Verum non praesumat super illud, nisi qui est sapiens in anatomia membrorum, et egressione neruorum mouentium corpus.	But he does not do this [cauterization] unless he is wise in the anatomy of limbs, and knows the exit of nerves which stir the body.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Albaras.	The way to cauterize in Albucasis.
Caput LI.	Head.
Quando antiquatur Albaras, et non confert in eo aliquid ex ingeniis medicinae: tunc cauteriza super ipsam cauterio profundo parumper, secundum quantitatem spissitudinis cutis, donec remoueatur albedo, et mutetur color eius.	When Albucasis is burned and does not bear any of the artifice of medicine: then cauterize on top of it a little with deep cautery, according as the thickness of the skin, until the hue is removed, and its color is changed.
Deinde cura ipsum cum farina herbi, et lentis cum oleo rosa, et foliis arnoglossae, et sanguine columbae, et sanguine hyrundinis: de unoquoque sit pars una: misceantur haec omnia, et liniantur super pannum, et adhaereant loco, donec sanetur.	Then care for the limb with herb flour, with rose oil and leaves of arglochea, and pigeon blood, and duck blood: let one part be mixed, let them spread on a cloth, and let them adhere to the place until it is healed.

Sapientes autem dixerunt, ut cauterizetur cauterio ultimo in medio.	But the wise have said, that the last cautery in the middle should be used.Et quandoque cauterizatur, non facit utrique oculo, sed mediocoelo, et postea
Mihi autem non uidetur illud: quoniam timeo quod ulceretur: et ego iam uidi illud aliquotiens.	But to me that does not seem right: for I fear that it will ulcerate: and I have seen it sometimes.
Et rectius est, ut cauterizetur in circumitu eius cum circulo, sicut diximus: aut cauteriis multis.	And it is better that he be cauterized around his wound with a circle, as we have said: or with many caustics.

Quando aliquis habet Adubelati, et tardatur in maturatione, aut propter superfluitatem facientem eam, aut propter aetatem infirmi, quando est decrepitus pauci sanguinis, aut propter tempus, et uis festinare in maturatione Adubelati, tunc cauteriza in circumitu eius cum cauteriis paruis multis punctando.	When someone has ablation and it is delayed in maturing, or because of superfluous reasons that cause it, or because of old age, when the blood is little, or because of time, and the pulse rushes to mature ablation, then cauterize around his wound with a few caustics by pricking.
Deinde dimitte eam.	Then let go of him.
Nam ipsa festinabit cum maturatione.	For it will hurry with the maturation.
Si autem uis perforationem eius cum cauterio, tunc igni cauterium, cuius haec est forma.	But if you pierce his wound with a caustic, then take this kind of caustic, which is in the form of:
Et depone ipsum in medio Adubelati, donec penetret cutem: et sit cauterium ab eo quod sequitur infirmus, ut alleuietur cursus puris.	And place him in the middle of the ablation until it enters the skin; and let the caustic remain with him because it will weaken, so that the flow of blood may be eased.
Deinde cura ipsum donec sanetur.	Then take care of him until he is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in malo corrodente.	Regarding the method of cauterizing with a caustic that corrupts.
Caput LIIII.	Chapter III. On Corrupted Wounds.
Corrodens non est nisi corruptio in membro ambulans, et corrodit ipsum: sicut ignis comedit ligna sicca.	Corrosion is not but corruption in a walking member, and it corrupts the member itself; just as fire consumes dry wood.
Si ergo uides corrodentem in loco qui toleret cauterium cum igne, tunc igni cauteria multa, clauilia parua et magna, secundum quod conueniet illi loco in quo est corrodens.	But if you see corrosion in a place that tolerates caustic with fire, then take many caustics, small and large, as is suitable for the place where corrosion is.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum ab omni parte donec eradices corruptionem totam, et non remaneat ex ea aliquid penitus.	Then cauterize him from all parts until you eradicate the entire corruption, and do not leave any trace of it.
Deinde dimitte ipsum tribus diebus, et pone super loca cauterizata sulphur tritum cum oleo, donec eradicentur escharae omnes, et omnis corruptio.	Then let him go for three days, and place sulfur, reduced with oil, on the cauterized places until all the eschar and corruption are eradicated.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguentis generantibus carnem.	Then take care of him with ointments that generate flesh.
Si ergo uides, quod post tres dies caro nascitur natiuitate sana, in qua non est corruptio, est bonum.	But if you see that after three days healthy flesh is born by a kind of rebirth, and there is no corruption, it is good.
Et si non: tunc itera cauterium super illud quod remansit ex locis corruptis.	And if not: then apply cautery to that which remains in the corrupted locations.
Et corrodens medicatur quandoque cum medicina acuta.	And sometimes when it is infected it is cured with acute medicine.
Ipsa namque surgit loco cauterii.	For it itself rises up at the place of cauterization.
Verumtamen cauterium cum igne est uelocioris iuuamenti: et ego quidem iam dixi cauterizationem eius cum medicina acuta in diuisione: accipe ergo eam illic quando ea indiges.	However, cauterization with fire is faster in effect: and I have indeed already said that cauterization with acute medicine is applied in division: so take it there when it tolerates it.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Clauis, et Verucis.	On the method of cauterizing in slits and warts.
Caput LV.	Chapter 50.
Multotiens accidit in inferioribus partibus pedum haec aegritudo: et est res grossa, filtrata, quae laedit pedem.	This disease often occurs in the lower parts of the feet: and it is a gross, filter-like growth that hurts the foot.
Et cauterium quidem in eis est secundum duos modos: cauterium cum igne, et cauterium cum aqua calida.	And there are two ways of applying cauterization to them: cauterization with fire and cauterization with hot water.
Quantum autem cum igne est, ut ignias cauterium concauum simile pennae uulturis: quod fiat ex ferro, secundum quantitatem quod contineat clauum ab omni parte: et sit subtilium marginum.	As for the cauterization with fire, like the feathers of a penning torch it is prepared from iron, according to the quantity that contains the clap when all parts are covered: and its edge should be sharp.
Deinde depone ipsum ignitum super clauum.	Then place the burned thing on the clap.
Deinde reuolue manum cum cauterio in circumitu claui, donec perueniat cauterium ad profunditatem claui: et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus, donec incipiat emittere pus.	Then turn the hand with the cautery around the clap, until the cauterization reaches the depth of the clap: and leave it for three days, until pus begins to be discharged.
Deinde emplastra ipsum cum maluis syluestribus, contritis cum sale: et dimitte emplastrum super ipsum in nocte.	Then bind the thing with wet silkworm threads, crushed with salt: and leave the plaster on the thing at night.
Ipse enim eradicabitur ex radicibus suis.	For it itself will be eradicated from its roots.
Deinde cura locum unguento generatiuo carnis, donec sanetur.	Then care for the place with a soft salve of meat, until it heals.
Quod si sunt non conuersi, et multotiens accidunt in superficie corporis, praecipue in manibus et pedibus: tunc administres in eis cauterium cum aqua calida: et est, ut accipias cannulam ex aere, aut ferro, aut ex penna uulturis: et depone eam super clauum, aut althelul.	If they are not turned inside out and often occur on the surface of the body, especially on the hands and feet: then apply to them cauterization with hot water: and it is like receiving a tube made of brass, iron, or a feather of a penning torch: and place it on the clap, or on an atharel.
Deinde proiice in cannulam ex aqua calida quantitatem paucam: retine manum tuam, et tu reuolue eam cum compressione manus tuae parumper, ut imprimatur margo cannulae in radice claui, et inueniat aqua calida uiam ad profundum, ad radicem claui: et expectet infirmus parumper super mordicationem aquae calidae hora una.	Then pour into the tube a little amount of hot water: hold your hand so that it is turned around with your finger to such an extent that the edge of the tube is pressed into the root of the clap, and the hot water is found at the bottom: and let stand for a while on the prickling of the hot water.
Deinde dimitte ipsum, nam clauus eradicatur cum radicibus suis.	Then release him, for the wound to be cured with its roots.
Ita fac cum eis uno post unum, donec uenias super omnes qui ex eis sunt in corpore.	So do with them one after another until you have done all that are in the body.
Deinde cura eos postquam eradicantur, cum eo quod generat carnem ex unguentis.	Then take care of them after they have been eradicated, with the same unguent that generates flesh from the wax.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Tremore.	The method for cauterizing in a tremor.
Caput LVI.	Chapter LVI.
Quando accidit alicui Tremor ex frigore in neruo, aut ex febre quartana, aut alio: tunc oportet ut cauterizes ipsum quatuor cauteriis, aut quinque super spondiles dorsi, et inter omnem spondilem cauterio, et in pectore eius cauterio, et super stomachum eius cauterio.	When it happens to someone who has a tremor due to cold in a nerve, or from quartan fever, or otherwise: then you should cauterize the spot four times, or five on top of the spine, and between each vertebrae with cautery, and in the pit of the stomach with cautery, and above the stomach with cautery.
Tremor enim quiescit cum cauterio oliuari, et festinat sanitas aegritudinis frigidae.	For a tremor ceases when it is oiled with cauterization, and a feverish health is hastened by the health of cold.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Albathir.	The method for cauterizing with Albathir.
Caput LVII.	Chapter LVII.
Quandoque expelluntur in corpore Albathir foedae, id est, pustulae, quae fiunt a materiis grossis corruptis.	When albater are expelled from the body, that is to say, pus that is produced from corrupted coarse material.
Oportet ergo in primis cum apparent, ut cauterizentur super omne caput pustulae cauterio subtili cum ligno myrti, cuius extremitas accensa est cum igne.	Then, when it first appears, it should be cauterized all over the head with fine cautery and a piece of myrrh, whose tip is lit with fire.
Aut cum radice aristolochiae longae.	Or with long roots of aristochnema.
Aut cum cauterio lenticulari.	Or with a lenticular cautery.
Et quandoque cauterizantur ademenul, in principio expulsionis suae secundum hunc modum: et non augentur: et disrumpitur superfluitas faciens eos, et sanatur ex eis.	And when they are cauterized with fire, at first during their expulsion in this way: and they do not increase: and they are broken up by the excess, and are healed from them.
Verumtamen oportet ut fiat illud post euacuationem cum phlebotomia.	However, it should be done after evacuation with phlebotomy.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in fluxu sanguins ex arteria in uulnere.	The method for cauterizing in a flux of blood from an artery in the ulnar:
Caput LVIII.	Chapter LVIII.De modo autem hic cauterizandi f
Multotiens accidit fluxus sanguinis ex arteria, quae incisa est apud uulnus, quod accidit extrinsecus, aut apud incisionem apostematis, aut cauterium membri, et similia eis: et fit difficile abscindere eum.	However, it often happens that a flux of blood comes from an artery that has been cut near the ulnar, whether from outside, or at the site of an abscess, or when cauterizing a member, and similar things: and it is difficult to stop it. Oportet itaque ex parte, ubi accidit, aduersus haec caute
Cum ergo accidit alicui illud, tunc propera cum manu tua ad orificium arteriae, et pone super ipsum digitum tuum indicem: et stringe eum multum, donec obsessus sit sanguis sub digito tuo, et non egrediatur ex eo aliquid.	So when this happens to someone, then grasp the affected artery with your hand and place your finger over it as an indicator: and grip it very tightly until the blood is stopped under your finger and nothing comes out of it.
Deinde pone in ignem cauteria oliuaria parua, et magna numero plura: et suffla super ea, donec fiant ignita ualde.	Then put on a small amount of olive oil fire, and a great many more: and blow on them until they are very hot.
Deinde accipe ex eis unum, aut paruum, aut magnum, secundum uulnus et locum, in quo disrupta est arteria, et depone cauterium super ipsam uenam, post quam tu remoues digitum tuum festinanter: et tene cauterium, donec abscindatur sanguis.	Then take from them one, or small, or large, according to the size and place of the broken artery, and place the fire on it: then remove your hand quickly: and hold the fire until the blood is completely stopped.
Quod si expellatur cum eleuas digitum ab orificio arteriae, et extinguis cauterium, tunc accipe cauterium aliud festinanter, ex cauteriis quae in igne sunt praeparata.	If you should release your hand from the opening of the artery and put out the fire, then take another fire quickly from those that are prepared in the fire:
Non ergo cesses facere illud cum uno post aliud, donec abscindatur sanguis.	So do not stop doing this with one after the other until the blood is completely stopped.
Et caue, ne comburas neruum qui est illic, et accidat super infirmum malicia alia.	And be careful so that you do not burn the fire that is there, and do not bring on another injury to a healthy person.
Et scias, quod quando ex arteria fluit sanguis, tunc non est possibile abscindere ipsum: praecipue quaudo arteria est magna, nisi cum uno quatuor modorum.	And know that when blood flows from an artery, it is then impossible to stop it: especially if the artery is large, unless with four fingers.
Aut cum cauterio, sicut diximus.	Or with fire, as we have said.
Aut cum extractione, quando non est extracta.	Or with extraction, when it has not been extracted.
Nam quando extrahitur, contrahuntur extremitates eius, et abscinditur sanguis.	For when it is extracted, its ends are drawn back, and the blood stops flowing.
Aut ligetur cum filo ligatione forti.	Or it is bound with a strong knot of thread.
Aut ponantur super ipsum medicinae de proprietate, quarum est abscindere sanguinem, et stringatur cum puluinari constrictione decenti.	Or are placed on the top of a drug that stops the flow of blood and is tightened with a decreasing constriction.
Qui autem administrat abscisionem eius cum ligamento, et strictura cum panno, aut positione rerum comburentium, et similium, non confert ei penitus, nisi raro.	But he who gives the cut with a knot, and constriction with a cloth, or puts burning things together, and similar things, does not give it deeply unless rarely.
Si autem accidat alicui illud, et non sit ei praesens medicus, neque medicina: tunc incipiat cum positione digiti indicis super orificium uenae ipsius, sicut narrauimus, et constrictione eius ualde, donec obsessus sit sanguis a superiori parte uulneris, et super arteriam.	But if this happens to someone and there is no present physician or medicine: then begin with the position of the index finger over the opening of the wound, as we have related, and its constriction very tightly until the blood is stopped from the upper part of the wound, and around the artery.
Et digitus non remoueatur, desuper ipsum cum aqua frigida uehementis frigoris semper, donec congeletur sanguis, et ingrossetur, et abscindatur.	And the finger should not be moved away, above it with cold water always stirring the cold, until the blood has congealed, and has thickened, and has been cut off.
Et interim consideret in eo, quid indiget ex cauterio, aut ex medicina.	And while that is considered, what does not require a poultice or medicine.

¶ De Incisione, Perforatione, et Phlebotomia in uulneribus, et his similibus.	On incising, perforating, and draining wounds, and similar matters.
Iam Diximus in Capitulo Primo, omnem aegritudinem in qua conueniens est cum igne cauterium et medicina comburente, et occasiones eius, ipsius caussas, et instrumenta eius, et formas cauteriorum.	We have already spoken in the first chapter about all illness that is treated with a burning cauterization and medicine, and its causes, instruments, forms of cauterization.
Et posui illic capitula a uertice usque ad pedem.	And I placed those chapters from the top to the bottom.
Et ego procedam in hoc capitulo illa eadem uia: ut alleuietur super quaerentem quaesitum eius.	And I will proceed in this chapter in the same way: so that the one who is inquiring may find what he seeks easily.
Et antequam incipiam illud, oportet ut addiscatis o filii, quod in hoc capitulo est ex terrore illud quod est in capitulo primo de cauterizatione.	And before I begin that, you should learn from your son, that horror is in the first chapter about cauterization.
Et propter illud oportet, ut sit cautela in eo uehementior, quoniam in operatione quae est in hoc capitulo, multotiens cadit euacuatio cum sanguine, cum quo stat uita apud apertionem uenae, aut incisionem super apostema, aut apertionem exiturae, aut curationem uulneris, aut extractionem sagittae, aut incisionem super lapidem, et illis similia: ex quibus omnibus associatur tremor, et timor, et cadit in pluribus eorum mors.	And because of that, it is necessary to be more careful, since there are many things in this operation that cause a tremor and fear, and they lead to death.
Et ego moneo uos, ne cadat super uos illud in quo est haesitatio, nam quandoque cadunt ad uos in hac arte modi hominum cum modis infirmitatum.	And I warn you, do not allow that hesitation to come about, for sometimes those who are in this art of surgery get into a difficult situation with the diseases of people, and that leads to their own death.
Ex eis enim est qui irascitur cum aegritudine sua, et est leuis apud eum mors: propter uehementiam eius quod inuenit ex infirmitate sua et longitudine eius maliciei.	For some of them become angry with their own illness, and they are easily killed because of the severity of their disease and the length of their suffering.
Et cum aegritudine est ex timore quod significat mortem.	And when ill health comes from fear, which indicates death.
Et ex eis est, qui dat tibicensum suum, et ditat te cum eo, sperans sanitatem, et aegritudo eius est perniciosa.	And some of them give you a gift, and they promise you health, but their illness is destructive.
Non ergo oportet ut consentiatis ei qui uenit ad uos ex eis, cuius modus est talis.	Therefore it is not necessary that you should assent to him who comes to you from them, whose way is such.
Et sit cautela uestra uehementior, quam cupiditas et uestra rapacitas.	And be your prudence greater than your cupidity and your avarice.
Et non praesumatis super aliquid ex illo, nisi post scientiam certam, quae uerificat apud uos illud ad quod peruenit successio laudabilis.	And do not presumptively surmise anything from him, unless after having certain knowledge that confirms it with you as regards the success of what is worthy of praise.
Et utimini in curatione omnium infirmorum uestrorum, prognosticatione et indicatione de eo ad quod conuenienter sit salus.	And for the treatment of all your sick patients, with prognosis and indication of that which is appropriate for their recovery.
In illo namque est uobis adiutorium super acquisitionem famae et gloriae, et memoriae et laudis.	For in him is an aid to you in acquiring fame and glory, and memory and praise.
Inspiret uobis Deus o filii, intellectum suum, et non auferat uobis directionem et inspirationem: quoniam illud est in manu eius.	May God inspire you, O son, with his understanding and not take away from you his guidance and inspiration: for it is in his power.
Et ego quidem ordinaui hoc Capitulum distinguendo per capitula, secundum quod praecessit in capitulo Cauterii, a ceruice usque ad pedes: ut alleuietur uobis quaesitum quod uultis ex eo, et quo indigetis.	And I have ordered this chapter distinguishing it into chapters, according to which precedes in the chapter of Cautery from the crown to the feet: that you may be aided with what you wish from him and for which you are in need.
¶ De curatione Aquae quae aggregatur in capitibus puerorum.	Of the treatment of water which is added to the heads of boys.
Caput I.	Chapter I.
Scias, quod haec infirmitas multotiens accidit pueris apud partum: aut quando stringit obstetrix caput pueri absque leuitate.	You should know that this sickness often occurs in boys at birth; or when the midwife squeezes the head of the boy without gentle touch.
Et quandeque accidit etiam ex caussa occulta quae non scitur.	And whenever it also happens for an unknown cause which is not known.
Et ego quidem non uidi hanc aegritudinem in aliis quam in pueris: et ad omnem quem ex eis uidi properauit mors: propter illud ergo uisum est mihi dimittere operationem in ea.	And I have not seen this disease in any other than in boys; and I wished to see all of them die, because of that, therefore I have left off the operation on it.
Et ego quidem uidi ex eis puerum, cuius caput impletum erat aqua, et caput magnificabatur in omni die, donec non poterat sedere super seipsum, propter magnitudinem capitis sui: et humiditas augmentata fuit, donec mortuus est.	And I have seen a boy from among them, of whom the head was filled with water, and his head increased in size every day, until he could not sit himself up on his own, because of the size of his head: and his moisture increased, until he died.
Et haec quidem humiditas, aut aggregatur inter cutem et os: aut aggregatur sub osse super sifac.	And this moisture, or it is added between the skin and the jaw: or it is added under the bone over the Mandible.
Et operatio in illo, si est humiditas inter cutem et os, et apostema est paruum, tunc oportet ut findas in medio capitis fissura una in latitudine: et sit longitudo fissurae quasi duo nodi, donec currat humiditas.	And the operation in that, if there is humidity between the skin and bone, and the apostema is small, then you should find a fissure in the middle of the head in width; and its length be almost two knots until the humidity has run out.
Et haec est forma spatumilis.	And this is the form of the scalpel.
Si ergo humiditas est magis augmentata, et apostema est maius, tunc pone eas duas fissuras, secundum formam hanc.	But if the humidity is increased and the apostema is larger, then place two fissures according to this form.
Et si humiditas est sub osse, et signum eius est, quod uides commissuras capitis apertas ab omni parte: et aqua deprimitur quando comprimis eam manu tua ad interiora, et non occultatur tibi illud: tunc oportet ut findas in medio capitis tribus fissuris, secundum hunc modum.	But if the humidity is under the bone and the sign of it is that you see the comissures of the head open from all parts: and the water is depressed when you press it with your hand towards the inside, and is not hidden from you: then you should find in the middle of the head three fissures, according to this manner.
Et post incisionem extrahe humiditatem totam.	And after the incision, remove all the humidity.
Deinde stringe fissuras cum pannis et puluillis.	Then tighten the fissures with rags and flour.
Deinde embroca illud desuper cum uino et oleo usque ad diem quintum.	Then dip it in vinegar and oil until the fifth day.
Deinde solue ligamentum, et cura uulnus cum tentis, et unguentis.	Then dissolve the ligaments, and care for the wounded joints with linen, and ointments.
Et non dimittas stringere caput cum aequalitate.	And do not cease to tighten the head with equality.
Et ciba infirmum omni cibo sicco paucae humiditatis, usquequo confortetur membrum, et sanetur.	And feed the sick with dry and little-humidity food until their member is comforted, and healed.
Et modus alius incisionis est, ut consideres ubi apparet magnitudo apostematis, et collectio aquae.	And another way of incision is that you consider where the appearance of the size of the apostema and the collection of water appears.
Quoniam quandoque est in occipitio plus, aut in sincipite, aut in dextra, aut in sinistra.	Since when ever it is in the back more, or in the front, or on the right, or on the left.
Ascende ergo cum incisione ubi apparet tibi apostema et impletio aquae: et scinde illud secundum quod tibi possibile est.	So climb up with an incision where you see the apostema and the filling appear: and cut it according to what is possible for you.
Et obserua, ne incidas arteriam, et accidat fluxus sanguinis, et moriatur infirmus ex illo fluxu cum euacuatione humiditatis.	And observe, so that you do not hit the artery, and does not happen a flow of blood, and the sick dies from that flow with the evacuation of water.
¶ De incisione Arteriarum quae sunt post aures.	Of the incisions of arteries which are behind the ears.
Caput II.	Head 2.
Quando accidunt alicui catarri ad oculos, aut ad pectus, et antiquatur illud, et non confert curatio medicinarum: tunc magis ultima curatio est in illo, incisio harum duarum arteriarum.	When there happens to someone a catarrh to the eyes, or to the chest, and it does not improve with medicines: then the last treatment is in that, incision of these two arteries.
Oportet ergo quando uis incidere eas, ut radat infirmus caput suum.	So when you want to cut them, let the sick person carry his head.
Deinde frica locum cum panno aspero, ut appareant arteriae.	Then cover the place with a sharp cloth so that the arteries appear.
Deinde stringat infirmus collum suum, cum quolibet panno suo.	Then let the sick person tie his neck with any of his cloths.
Deinde considera, ubi pulset uena.	Then consider where the pulse is beating.
Et loca utriusque sunt loca quae sunt post aures depressa: et raro occultatur, nisi in quibusdam hominibus.	And the places are those which are behind the ears: and rarely they are hidden, except in some people.
Deinde signa cum encaustro super utraque: et incide utramque cum spatumili utrimque acuro, incisione perueniente ad os: et fiat illud per latitudinem capitis.	Then mark with caustic on each: and cut both with a sharp scalpel, cutting towards the mouth: and let it be made through the width of the head.
Et si uis, intromitte spatumile sub arteria, et incide eam ad superiora cum incisione.	And if you want, insert the scalpels under the arteries, and cut them from above with a cut.
Et sit longitudo incisionis quasi duo digiti iuncti.	And let the length of the cut be almost two fingers joined together.
Nam quando inciditur uena, egreditur sanguis egressione pulsatili, qui salit ad interiora saltu frequenti.	For when the vein is cut, blood flows out with a pulsating movement, which climbs to the inside at an frequent interval.
Si autem arteria non apparet sensui, tunc oportet ut mensures ab aure quantitatem spacii trium digitorum.	But if the artery does not appear by touch, then it is necessary that measurements are taken from the color of three fingers.
Deinde signa cum encaustro, et finde usque ad os.	Then mark with caustic and find until you reach the mouth.
Et illud quod oportet emittere ex sanguine, est VI uncia et fortasse emittis ex eo plus, aut minus.	And what needs to be emitted from blood, is six minutes and perhaps you emit more or less from it.
Totum illud secundum quantitatem quae apparet tibi ex uirute infirmi et repletione arteriae eius.	All this depends on the amount that appears to you from the vein and filling of the artery.
Deinde considera ad uulnus.	Then consider towards the neck.
Tunc si remanet ad os ex sifac aliquid, tunc incide illud, ut non accidat apostema calidum: tunc stringe uulnus cum liciniis ex panno lini.	Then if there is something stuck in the throat, then cut it so that it does not cause a boil to form: and tie the neck with linen thread from a cloth.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then care for the patient with ointment, until he recovers.
¶ De extractione arteriarum, quae sunt in timporibus.	Regarding the extraction of arteries, which are in the temples.
Caput III.	Head
Quando accidit homini hemicranea antiqua, aut catarri acuti propter humiditates acrimoniales, et caliditate in lacertis timporum, aut soda antiqua, uehemens, et similia illis: et medicatur cum modis curationis medicinae, et non confert illud: tunc experti sumus in his aegritudinibus extractionem arteriarum ex timporibus, aut cauterizationem earum, sicut narrauimus.	When a man has an old headache, or sharp cataracts because of the acrid and sour liquids, and heat in the temples, or old sodas, stinging, and similar things: and he is treated with the methods of medicine, and does not report it: then we are expert in these diseases, extracting the arteries from the temples, or cauterizing them, as we have described.
Et modus operationis in extractione earum, est, ut radat infirmus pilos qui sunt in timporibus, et intendat ad arteriam apparentem in timpore.	And the method of operation in extracting them, is, as the patient has hair on his temples, and it points to an apparent artery in the temple.
Ipsa namque ostenditur tibi ex pulsu suo, et raro occultatur nisi in paucis hominibus, aut uehementia frigoris.	And himself he shows you from his pulse, and rarely is hidden except in a few men, or when he shudders with cold.
Quod si occultatur tibi, tunc stringat infirmus caput suum cum quolibet panno suo: deinde frica locum cum panno aspero.	If it is hidden from you, then the patient should tie his head with any cloth: and then he should cover the place with a rough cloth.
Aut uapora locum cum aqua calida, donec appareat tibi apparitione manifesta.	Or he should moisten the place with warm water, until it appears to you in a manifest way.
Deinde accipe spatumile, quod paulo ante formaui.	Then take a spikelet, which has been slightly bent.
Deinde excoria cum eo cutem cum facilitate, donec peruenias ad arteriam.	Then scratch the skin with it easily, until you reach an artery.
Deinde proiice in eam uncinum, et extrahe eam ad superiora, donec extrahas eam ex cute, et facias eam euadere ex tunicis quae sunt sub ea ab omni parte.	Then throw it into her and extract it from above, until you draw it out of the skin, and make it ooze with sweat from tunics which are under it on all sides.
Si autem arteria est subtilis: tunc inuolue eam cum extremitate uncini.	If the artery is thin: then wrap it up with the end of the spikelet.
Deinde incide ex ea partem secundum quantitatem qua elongentur extremitates eius, et contrahantur, et non accidat fluxus sanguinis.	Then cut from that part a little more than the length of its ends, and turn them in opposite directions, and do not let there be any flow of blood.
Nam si non inciditur, et si non abscinditur, non ascendit sanguis penitus.	For if it does not cut, and if it does not split, the deep blood will not rise.
Deinde euacua ex sanguine ana VI unci, usque ad .III.	Then make ooze with blood for six ounces, up to three drops.
Quod si arteria est magna: tunc oportet ut liges eam in duobus locis ex filo duplo, forti, ex serico: aut ex chordis alhohod, ut non properet ad ipsam putrefactio ante consolidationem uulneris, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	If the artery is large: then it should be tied in two places with double thread, strong, from silk: or with string of the hair, so that it does not come under putrefaction before hardening of the wound, and let there be a flow of blood.
Deinde incide superfluitatem, quae est inter duo ligamenta.	Then cut away the superfluity, which is between the two ligaments.
Fac illud in illa hora, aut post horam aliam.	Make it do this thing at that hour, or after another hour.
Et si uis, cauteriza eam cauterio usque ad os, cum cauterio cultellari: donec incidantur extremitates eius, et stabit loco eiusdem operis.	And if there is a wound, cauterize it with the knife until it reaches the mouth, with a surgical knife: until the ends of it stand still in its place.
Et est melius opus, nisi si infirmus habet febrem, autest calefactae complexionis.	And this work is better if the patient has no fever, or if his complexion is tepid.
Quoniam cauterium est ex eis, quae iuuant ad finiendas humiditates.	For the cautery is from those which remain to finish the wetnesses.
Ergo est melius iuuamentum.	Therefore it is better to use a ligature.
Et oportet post extractionem arteriarum, ut impleatur locus cotto antiquo: et ponantur super ipsum puluilli decenter facti.	And it is necessary after the extraction of the arteries, that the place may be filled with the old cooked substance: and let them be placed on the flesh from afar made pulli.
Et post solutionem curetur cum medicinis siccis, quae faciunt nasci carnem, et cum liciniis, donec sanetur.	And after the solution of the ointment with dry medicines which make the flesh grow, and with ligatures, until it is healed.
Quod si interim dum operaris accidit fluxus sanguinis ex arteria, tunc propera ad abscindendum eum cum cauterio, aut ut impleas locum cum zegi: et stringe manum tuam, donec abscindatur sanguis.	That if during the operation a flow of blood comes from an artery, then you should proceed to cut it off with the cautery, or to fill the place with a bandage: and hold your hand firm, until the blood is cut off.
Quod si nihil ex illis est tibi praesens, tunc pone super locum digitum tuum, donec congeletur sanguis.	That if you have nothing present for this, then place your finger on the place, until the blood has congealed.
Et embroca locum cum aqua uehementis frigoris, donec quiescat acuitas, et stringatur secundum quod oportet.	And dip the place in the water of cold frothiness, until the sharpness is calmed down, and hold it firm according to what is necessary.
Et ex eo quod est leuius et facilius extractione arteriae, est, ut cauterizes uenam cum hoc cauterio habente duos cultellos: sitque acuitas duorum cultellorum similis almagdatem.	And from that which is easier and more easily extracted the artery, it is, as if a pin has two points, like an almond;
Verumtamen sunt multo minoris acuitatis, quam duo cultelli.	However, there are much less sharpness than two knives.
Quoniam si sunt acutae, sicut duo cultelli, properat utrisque frigus: et non incidunt carnem cum uelocitate.	For if they are sharp, like two knives, it is necessary for both to have coldness: and do not cut into the flesh with speed.
Cum ergo in eis est aliquantulum grossitudinis, tenetur in eis calor ignis, et abscinditur caro uelociter: cum hoc ergo opus est melius omni opere, et leuius, et facilius.	And when there is a little roughness on them, it is held in them the heat of fire, and the flesh is cut off quickly: and so this work is better on all operations, and lighter and easier.
Et sit spacium quod est inter duos cultellos quantitas grossitudinis digiti, postquam tu signas duo loca cum encaustro: et depone utrosque ignitos ualde, donec perueniant ad os, et incidant uenam in duobus locis: ut elongetur quod est inter extremitates eius.	And set a space which is the quantity of the roughness of the finger between the two knives, after you have marked the two places with the caustic: and put both on well alight, until they come to the nose, and fall into only two places: that it may be stretched out what is between their extremities.
Nam non consolidantur cum hoc cauterio penitus.	For with this cautery, deep parts are not consolidated.
Et haec est forma cauterii.	And this is the form of cauterization.
¶ De cura cursus lachrymarum acutarum assiduarum ab oculis.	On the treatment of acute, chronic, and stinging eye wounds.
Caput IIII.	Chapter IV.
Quando sunt lachrymae assiduae, et est cursus earum ex uenis, quae sunt super craneum capitis exterius: et non confert in eis aliquid curationis medicinae cum medicinis, et uides faciem infirmi iam rubere, et sentit in fronte sua deambulationem, sicut est deambulatio formicarum: et oculi eius sunt extenuati, humidi, ita quod iam corrosi sunt pili eorum cum corrosione: et calefactae sunt palpebrae eius ex acuitate lachrymarum: tunc antiqui indiguerunt in curatione earum hac operatione, et denominauerunt eam curationem, cum Ense.	When the tears are persistent and there is a course of blood from the veins that run along the outside of the skull: when this does not respond to medical treatment, his eyes will begin to turn red, and he will feel a crawling sensation on his forehead, as if it were caused by ants walking over it; his eyes will become dry and irritated, so they have been corroded by their hair with corrosion; and his eyelids will become heated from the pain of the tears. Then the ancient people used to treat them with this operation, and called it the Ense cure.
Et est, ut praecipias infirmo radere pilos qui sunt in fronte sua.	And is, as you command, to shave off the hair on the forehead of the sick.
Deinde incide in fronte tres fissuras aequedistantes secundum longitudinem frontis: et sit longitudo fissurae quasi duo digiti, et fissura una sit aequedistans longitudini nasi in medio frontis, et secunda secundum longitudinem parumper a motu lacertorum, et tertia a parte altera: et caue ab incisione arteriarum quae sunt in duobus lateribus: et elonga manum tuam a continuatione duarum mandibularum, et sit spacium omnis incisionis quantitas trium digitorum coniunctorum: et sit tibi frustum spongiae praeparatum, aut panni siccati multi, cum quibus exsicces sanguinem.	Then make three incisions in the forehead that are equally spaced according to its length: and let the length of each incision be almost as long as two fingers, and let one incision be equally distant from the middle of the nose, and the second according to half the distance between the two mandibular teeth, and the third from the side of the second: and pay no attention to the arteries that are on either side: and extend your hand out from the joint of the two jaws, and let the space between each incision be the length of three joined fingers: and have a sponge plug or a dry cloth ready for stopping up the blood.
Deinde intromitte spatumile duarum acutarum extremitatum, cuius mox sequens est forma.	Then introduce a long sharp instrument into the two ends of the incision, whose end is soon followed by this form:
Ab incisione quae est a parte timporis, usque ad incisionem secundam: et excoria cum eo totam cutem, quae est inter duas incisiones, cum sifac, quod est super os.	From the incision that is from the temporal side, all the way to the second incision: and scrape with it all the skin that is between the two incisions, along with the waxy membrane that is on top of the bone.
Deinde fac illud etiam ab incisione media usque ad incisionem secundam.	Then do this also from the middle incision to the second incision.
Deinde extrahe hoc spatumile, et intromitte in incisionem primam iterum instrumentum aliud, quod nominatur cultellare acutum, ab una parte lene, non acutum ab altera parte.	Then pull out this spoon and introduce into the first incision again a different instrument, which is called a sharp chisel from one side of the lather, not acute from the other side.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is his form.
Et pone latus eius acutum uersus carnem annexam cum cute, et latus eius lene uersus os: et impelle ipsum, donec perueniat ad fissuram mediam: et abscinde cum eo omnia uasa, quae descendunt a capite ad oculos: praeter quod continuetur incisio usque ad illud quod apparet de cute.	And this is his form.
Deinde fac illud in fissura media usque ad fissuram aliam.	Then place the acute side of him towards the flesh attached with skin, and the soft side towards the bone: and push him, until he reaches the middle crack: and cut off with him
Et postquam currit ex sanguine quantitas aequalis, exprime loca ex frustis sanguinis coagulati.	And when an equal quantity of blood runs out, then express the places from the clotted blood.
Deinde pone in omnem fissuram licinium ex cotto ueteri, et pone super eos puluillos imbibitos in uino, et oleo, aut aceto.	Then place into every crack a chip of hard-boiled bread, and place on them wet rags soaked in wine, or oil, or vinegar.
Et uide ut non accidat apostema calidum.	And check so that the swelling does not become hot.
Et in die tertia solue ligamentum, et administra infusionem multam cum aqua tepida.	And on the third day, loosen the ligaments, and give a strong infusion with warm water.
Deinde cura illud ex unguento basilicon, et reliquis quibus curantur uulnera: usquequo sanetur.	Then care for him with basilic ointment, and with the other ointments that heal wounds: until he is healed.
¶ De cura lachrymarum acutarum et catarrorum ad oculos ex interioribus capitis.	§ On the treatment of acute tears and cataracts in the eyes from within the head.
Caput V.	Head
Quando accidunt alicui catarri acuti, acres, assidui: et uides oculos eius extenuatos, paruos, et iam debilitatus est aspectus eorum: et palpebrae ulceratae, et cadunt pili ex eis, et in profundo capitis est dolor acutus, laedens, et sternutatio consequens: tunc sume ex istis accidentibus, quod illae materiae, et catarri non ueniunt, nisi ex uenis multis.	When acute, sharp, and frequent tears occur in someone's eyes, and their eyes appear weak, pale, and already weakened: and the eyelids become ulcerated, and hair falls out from them, and there is a sharp pain in the deep part of the head, and resulting sneezing: then remove these accidents, so that those materials do not come, unless they are removed with many.
Et melior curatio in eis est haec.	And the best treatment for them is this.
Et est, ut praecipias infirmo radere frontem suam.	And it is as you instruct the sick person to shave his forehead.
Deinde incide in eam fissuram unam in medio frontis, aut alterius parumper per latitudinem, et incipe cum fissura a timpore sinistro ad timpus dextrum: et sit incisio usque ad os: et elonga manum tuam a lacertis timporum, qui mouentur apud masticationem: donec quando detegitur os: et exsiccabis totum sanguinem cum spongia.	Then make an incision in the middle of his forehead, or to the right or left of its width, and start from the left-hand side of the temple until it reaches the right-hand side: and push it up to the bone: and extend your hand away from the jaw bones that move during mastication: until it is detected by the bone: and dry out all the blood with a sponge.
Tunc separa inter duo labia fissurae cum cotto ueteri, aut cum liciniis ex lino.	Then separate between the two lips of the wound with a hot sponge, or with linen bandages.
Deinde stringe desuper cum puluillis: et imbibe puluillos cum uino et oleo, ut non accidat apostema calidum.	Then bind above with flannel: and dip the flannel in wine and oil so that a hot pus does not form.
Et quando soluis illud, et uides quod apostema calidum iam imminuitur: tunc oportet ut frices os, donec incipiat in eo nasci caro.	And when you have removed it, and you see that a hot pus is about to appear: then it is necessary that the surgeon should come, until it has begun to grow there.
Deinde cura ipsum cum regimine exiccatiuo quod facit nasci carnem: sicut si accipias ex farina tritici partes duas, et ex colophonia quatuor partes: et praepares ex eis emplastrum, et administretur ad natiuitatem carnis in istis uulneribus.	Then take care of the man with the dry cure that makes the flesh grow: as if you had taken two parts of wheat flour and four parts of colophony: and prepare an ointment from it, and administer it to the birth of meat in these wounds.
¶ De cura eius quod cadit in Aurem.	Regarding the cure that falls on gold.
Caput VI.	Chapter VI.
Omne Quod in Aurem cadit, est una quatuor specierum: aut lapis mineralis, aut simile lapidi, sicut ferrum, et uitrum: aut est ex planta, sicut est cicer, et fabae: aut est res fluxibilis, sicut aqua, et acetum, et eis similia: aut aliquod animal.	All that falls on gold is of four kinds: either mineral rock, or similar stones, such as iron and lead; or it is from a plant, such as chickpeas and beans; or it is a fluid, such as water and vinegar, and things like them; or some kind of animal.
Quando ergo cadit in aurem lapis, aut genus lapidis ex eis quae non adduntur, neque crescunt in aure, expone Aurem soli: si ergo uides lapidem, tunc distilla in Aurem aliquid ex oleo uiolato, aut sisamino.	When, however, a stone falls on gold, or a kind of rock that does not add to it, and does not grow in gold, expose gold to the sun: but if you see a stone, then distill into gold some of the oil of olive nuts, or sesame seeds.
Deinde administra extractionem eius, et fac sternutare cum condisi, et opila nares apud aduentum sternutationis, postquam tu ponis in circumitu auris frusta ex pannis, aut lana, et extendis aurem ad superiora.	Then administer the extraction, and make it snort with ointment, and paint the nose at the approach of the snorting, after you have put on around the ears rolls of cloth or wool, and extend the ear towards the top.
Multotiens enim egreditur cum hac cura.	For often with this cure one goes wrong.
Si autem non egreditur, tunc administra extractionem eius cum Gesti, id est, Pizigarolis subtilibus: cuius forma est haec.	But if he does not go wrong, then administer the extraction with gentle hand, that is, with thin gestures: whose form is this.
Si ergo egreditur cum gesti, est bonum.	But if he goes wrong with his hand, it is good.
Et si non, tunc administra extractionem eius cum uncino caeco subtili paucae duplicationis.	And if not, then administer the extraction with a thin, blind hook, made in a few places.
Si ergo non egreditur per illud, tunc fac cannulam ex aere, et intromitte extremitatem cannulae in foramen auris multum, et opila quod est in circumitu cannulae cum caera mollificata cum oleo, ut non sit uento uia nisi cannulae: deinde extrahe cum uento tuo attractione forti.	If therefore he does not come out through that [incision], then make a tube of brass, and introduce the end of the tube into the ear hole a lot, and the dust that is around the tube with the softened gold with oil, so that there is no way for the wind except through the tube: then draw it out with your breath strongly.
Multotiens enim egreditur cum eo quod narrauimus.	For many times he went out with it when we told him.
Si autem non egreditur hoc modo: tunc accipe ex helkalimbat, aut ex uisco, id est, gluten praeparato, cum quo capiuntur aues, rem modicam: et pone ipsum in extremitate radii postquam tu inuoluis super eam cotum decenter positum: deinde intromitte ipsum in foramen auris cum facilitate, postquam tu exiccas aurem ab humiditate.	But if it does not come out in this way: then take from the alum-pot or from the water, that is, the gluten prepared, with which gold is woven, a little piece: and put it on the end of the ear after you have dried the ear with moisture. Then introduce it into the ear hole easily, after you have removed the wax from the ear.
Si ergo non egreditur cum omnibus quae narrauimus, tunc propera ad scindendum, antequam accidat apostema calidum, aut spasmus.	But if it does not come out with all that we have told you, then prepare yourself to split it, before a hot blister or spasm occurs.
Et modus fissurae est, ut phlebotomes infirmum in primis in cephalica: et extrahe ei ex sanguine secundum mensuram uirtutis eius.	And the way to split it is so that the phlebotomist takes blood from the head first: and draw out the blood according to the measure of its strength.
Deinde fac sedere infirmum inter manus tuas, et conuerte aurem eius ad superiora, et finde fissuram paruam in radice auris apud adipem eius in loco depresso ipsi: et sit fissura lunaris figurae, donec peruenias ad lapidem: deinde aufer eum cum eo, quod est tibi possibile ex instrumentis.	Then make the sick person sit between your hands, and turn his ear towards the top, and find a small hole at the base of his ear next to his fat there: and make the hole round in shape, until you reach a stone: then take it out with that, which is possible for you from instruments.
Deinde sue fissuram ab hora tua cum uelocitate, et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	Then close up the hole from your side with speed, and care for that, until it heals.
Quod si res cadens in aurem est ex uno granorum, quae crescunt, et inflantur: tunc administra extractionem eius.	That if what falls into the ear is from one grain, which grows, and swells up: then administer its extraction.
Si autem non obedit tibi ad exitum, tunc accipe spatumile tenue, subtile, secundum hanc formam.	But if it does not obey you to come out, then take a thin spike, subtle, according to this shape.
Et administra cum eo abscisionem illius speciei ex granis, quae cadunt in aurem, et non facias illud, quando tu cogitas, quod illud granum iam humectatum est per uaporem auris, donec ponis ipsum frusta multa: deinde extrahe ea cum uncinis, aut cum gesti subtili, aut cum suctione, sicut diximus, nam extractio eius alleuiatur.	And administer with that from the grain, which falls into the ear, a little spike, according to this shape. And do not consider it, when you think, that this grain is already moistened by the moisture of the ear, until you put it on many thorns: then draw it out with a hook, or with a gentle gesture, or with suction, as we have said, for its extraction alleviates it.
In aqua autem quae ingreditur in aurem, oportet ut utatur infirmus sternutatione cum condisi in primis: et iam impleuit aurem suam cum aliquanto cotto ueteri: et est iacens super illam aurem, in qua est aqua.	But the water that is poured into the ear should be used by the sick with sternutation first, and also to fill his ear a little cooked old: and lying down on it his ear, where there is water.
Si ergo egreditur per illud, est bonum.	If so then leave it through that, it is good.
Et si non: tunc accipe lapides multos, secundum longitudinem digiti, tenues, lenes, et calefac eos cum igne parumper, et intromittat infirmus ex eis unum in foramen auris suae: et saliat super pedem suum unum ex illa parte, et percutiat cum lapide alio super lapidem qui est in aure.	And if not: then take many stones, according to the length of a finger, fine, soft, and heat them slightly with fire, and insert one of them into the ear hole of the sick: and let him sit on one leg from there, and hit it with another stone against the ear bone.
Non ergo cesset facere illud cum lapide et lapide, donec egrediatur tota aqua.	So he will not cease to do this with stones and pebbles, until all the water has come out.
Et iam egreditur aqua ita, ut accipias ex parpyro, aut ex iunco unum, et intromittas extremitatem eius unam in aurem: et accendas extremitatem alteram cum igne, donec comburatur plurimum eius.	And already the water is coming out so that you take it from a torch or from one branch and insert the end of it into the ear: and light the end with fire, until it is burned up completely.
Deinde itera iuncum alium, et fac illud multotiens, donec egrediatur tota aqua: et extrahe ipsam cum cannula secundum quod praemissum est in lapide.	Then repeat the branch a few times, until all the water has come out: and take it out with a tube according to what has been said before in the stone.
In extractione autem animalis intrantis in eam, si est parui corporis, ut pulex, et ei simile, cura ipsum sicut dixi in diuisione.	In extraction however of an animal inside it, if it is a small body, like a flea, and similar to it, take care of it as I have said in the division.
Sed si est corporis magni, quod appareat sensui: tunc administra extractionem eius cum gesti, et uncinis: et res eius est facilior omnibus, quae tenentur in aure.	But if it is a large body, which seems to the sense: then administer its extraction with gestures and hooks: and the work of it is easier for all those who hold it in the ear.
In extractione autem uermis generati in aure, quando curas eum cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et in tractatu distilationum, et non confert curatio tua: tunc oportet ut aspicias aurem in sole.	But in the extraction of scabs from the ear, when you care for it with what we have said in division and in the book of distillation, and your cure does not bring about this: then it is necessary that you observe the ear in the sun.
Si ergo apparet illic aliquid ex uermibus, tunc extrahe illud cum gesti, aut cum uncinis subtilibus.	If so then appears there something like scabs, then extract it with gestures, or with fine hooks.
Si autem non apparet illic aliquid, tunc accipe cannulam, cuius haec est forma, stricta inferius, ampla superius: et intromitte extremitatem subtilem in aurem secundum quantitatem quod tolerat eam infirmus: deinde suge cum ea suctione forti.	But if there does not appear anything there, then take a tube whose this form, narrow below, wide above: and insert the end into the ear according to the quantity that the sick can bear it: and then suck with it a strong suction.
Fac illud multotiens, donec egrediantur omnes uermes.	Here he was quite often, until all the wounds had healed.
Si autem non obediunt tibi ad exitum, tunc opila circumitum cannulae cum caera, sicut dixi in lapide.	But if they do not obey you to go out, then bind around the catheter with plaster, as I said in the stone.
Quod si non egrediuntur cum eo quod diximus: tunc administra distillationes quas iam experti sunt antiqui in interfectione uermium: et inuenies illud in tractatu distillationum.	That if they do not go out with him which we have said: then administer the distillations which the ancient ones know about in the infection of wounds: and you will find it in the book on distillations.
Et sit effusio tua qua effundis olea et medicinas in aurem cum hoc instrumento, cuius forma depicta est hic.	And be your pour forth which you pour forth oil and medicines into the ear with this instrument, whose form is depicted here.
Sicut uides fac ipsum ex argento, aut aere, inferius strictum, in quo sit foramen paruum, amplum superius.	As you see make it from silver, or from brass, lower part tight, in which sits a small hole, wide upper.
Sit ergo ut impellens quod est in concauitate cannulae, sit ex aere decenter factum.	Then sit as if you push forth what is in the constriction of the catheter, sit from brass slightly made.
Et si uis, accipe radium, et inuolue in extremitate eius cottum inuolutione decenti: deinde proiice oleum, aut succum, aut quod uis ex istis medicinis in cannulam: et ipsa sit in aure: deinde intromitte radium cum cotto desuper, et exprime ipsum manu tua compressione temperata, donec impellatur oleum in concauitate auditus, et sentiat ipsum infirmus interius: et illud quod infunditur in aurem, sit iam calefactum cum igne parumper: et caue ne sit res quae distillatur in eam frigida ualde: medicinae enim non tolerant illud.	And if you want, take radium, and pour it on the end of the cotton in a gentle boiling: then pour forth oil, or broth, or what you want from these medicines into the catheter: and let it sit in brass: then insert radium with the cotton coming out, and squeeze it forth by your hand gently, until it pushes forth oil in the constriction of the ear, and feels it within: and that which is poured into the ear, may already be warmed a little with fire: and may not be cold so as to distillate it in there: for these medicines do not tolerate it.
¶ De cura opilationis accidentis Auri.	Regarding the treatment of auricular accidents.
Caput VII.	Chapter VII.
Quandoque egrediuntur quidam infantes ex uentribus matrum suarum non perforati.	When certain children come out of their mothers' wombs with their ears not pierced.
Et iam accidit etiam quibusdam hominibus opilatio in meatu Auris a uulnere, aut carne nata in ea.	And it has happened also to some people that they have an auricular ojection from a scar, or from flesh born in it.
Et haec opilatio quandoque fit in profundo foraminis Auris, quam non consequitur uisus: et quandoque accidit ad exteriora foraminis parum, et consequitur eam uisus.	And this ojection, when it comes to be in a deep pore of the ear, which does not result from a cut: and when it happens to be on the outside of a pore little, and results from that cut.
Illa ergo quae accidit in profundo Auris, et quam non comprehendit aspectus, est in pluribus dispositionibus difficilis sanationis.	That which has happened in a deep pore of the ear, and which does not comprehend in its appearance, is in many dispositions difficult to heal.
Et in illa quam consequitur uisus, oportet ut ponas Aurem infirmi in sole, et aspicias in ea: tunc si uides opilationem apparentem, aperi eam cum spatumili subtili, cuius forma est haec quae sequitur, sit extremitas eius in qua sit quaedam latitudo parua, cuius quaedam pars sit acuta: et reliquum spatumile sit duarum laterum lenium: ut non laedat aurem.	And in that which follows the opening of the wound, you should put the gold nurse on the sun, and look at it: if you see the operation apparent, open it with a thin spatula, whose form is this which follows, let the end of it be in a small width, some of it being acute: and let the rest of the spatula be soft on both sides: so that it may not hurt the ear.
Si ergo opilatio est a carne nata in meatu auris: tunc tene eam cum uncino subtili, et incide eam cum facilitate uehementi, donec auferatur tota caro.	If then the operation is from the flesh born in the meatus of the ear: then hold it with a small hook, and cut it with ease of cutting, until all the flesh is taken away.
Quod si opilatio est in profundo auris: tunc accipe radium subtilem, lenem, et calefac ipsum cum igne parumper: deinde mitte ipsum in meatum auris.	That if the operation is in the deep of the ear: then take a small ray, soft, and heat it slightly with fire: then put it into the meatus of the ear.
Si ergo senseris opilationem cum eo, quod inuenit infirmus cum grauitate auditus, conare apertionem eius cum facilitate: et caue, ne uulneres neruos auris.	If then you feel the operation with it, that it remains weak with the weight of hearing, be careful in opening it with ease: and with care, so as not to hurt the nerves of the ear.
Deinde pone in aurem licinium secundum quantitatem amplitudinis foraminis, quod inuoluisti in unguento aegyptio: fac illud aliquot diebus, donec sis securus de consolidatione uulneris.	Then put in the ear a little linen according to the quantity of width of the foramen, which you have inserted into the Egyptian ointment: let it be a few days, until you are sure of the healing of the wound.
Aut accipe licinium, et infunde ipsum in aqua rosata, et pulueriza super ipsum zegi tritum, et utere ipso.	Or take linen, and pour into it water rose, and powder over it some fine powder, and use it.
Quod si uides aurem iam apostemari: tunc oportet ut extrahas licinium, et permittas ipsum cum licinio alio, quod inuolues in caeroto quod sit factum cum oleo rosato, donec sedetur apostema calidum: deinde cura ipsum usquequo sanetur.	That if you see the ear already separated: then it is necessary that you should take out linen, and let it with other linen which you have inserted into the green which you make with rose oil, until it is healed: then take care of the ear until it is cured.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis: tunc submerge spongiam, aut pannos in aqua frigida, et pone super eam aurem: et utere reliqua curatione, quae abscindit fluxum sanguinis praedicta in tractatu distillationum.	If then blood flows: then dip a sponge, or cloth, into cold water, and put it on the ear: and use the remaining cure, which stops the predicted flow of blood in the book of distillation.
¶ De cura Altheli palpebrarum.	Of the care of the eyelids.
Caput VIII.	Head VIII.
Isti Althelil qui accidunt in Palpebris oculi, quandoque sunt humidi, et sunt sicci.	These are the signs of Althelil which occur in the eyelids when they are moist and dry.
Oportet ergo ut teneas eos cum tenaliis: aut cum uncino, et incidas eos cum spatumili a radicibus suis.	You should therefore hold them with tenails; or with an anchor, and strike them with a mallet from their roots.
Deinde pone super loca zegi tritum.	Then put on the ground the three-sided piece of wood.
Si autem ex eis fluat sanguis, tunc cauteriza eos cum cauterio lenticulari subtili.	But if blood flows from them, then cauterize them with a fine lenticular cauldron.
Et cauterizare eos, est melius post incisionem.	And cauterizing them is better after the incision.
Multotiens enim redeunt quando remanet ex radicibus suis aliquid.	For many times they run away when something remains of their roots.
Et quando cauterizantur cum igne, comburuntur illae radices, et non redeunt.	And when they are cauterized with fire, those roots are burned and do not run away.
¶ De cura Grandinum palpebrarum oculi.	In regard to the care of the eyelids of the eye.
Caput IX.	Chapter IX.
Multotiens accidit in palpebris aliquid quod assimilatur Crandini in fortitudine sua, et sua duricie, et propter illud nominatur Grando: et est aggregatio humiditatis grossae in palpebra superiore, et palpebra inferiore.	This often happens to the eyelids which is a accumulation of moisture which is thick and hard, and for that reason it is called Grando; and it is an aggregation of moistness which is thick on the upper eyelid, and the lower eyelid.
Operatio ergo in eis est, ut consideres tunc, si est Grando procedens in eo, quod apparet de palpebra, et mouentur ad omnem partem, et res eius est facilis.	The operation in them is therefore, that you should consider then, if there is Grando proceeding from it, which appears from the eyelid, and moves to all parts, and the thing is easy.
Finde ergo super eam fissura per latitudinem.	So then put a slit across the width.
Deinde excoria eam ab omni parte cum facilitate, donec euadat.	Then peel off that skin from all parts with ease until it is peeled off.
Deinde suspende eam cum uncino, et abscinde ipsam.	Then hang it on a hook and cut it off.
Si autem non praeparatur tibi abscisio eius, nisi postquam tu penetras palpebram cum incisione parumper, tunc nocet infirmo illud in aliquo.	But if you are not prepared to cut it off, unless after you have made a slight incision in the eyelid, then that will hurt the sick person.
Quod si fissura est magna: tunc aggrega ipsam cum sutura: et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	That if the slit is large: then aggregate it with a stitch; and take care of it, until it heals.
Et si est parua, non superueniet tibi malum ex ea.	And if it is small, you will not have any trouble from it.
Vnguentum enim restaurat ipsam, et incarnat eam.	The unguents restore that skin and make it flesh again.
Et si grando est decliuis ad interiora auris uersus superficiem intrinsecam, tunc inuersa palpebram, et suspende grandinem cum uncino: praeter quod indigeas incisione, et preme eam ab omni parte.	And if Grando is a discharge towards the inner part of the ear towards the inside surface, then reverse the eyelid and hang up Grando on a hook: except that you should make a slight incision, and press it from all parts.
Quod si elongatur palpebra per incisionem, non nocet illud in aliquo.	If the eyelid is made longer by an incision, this does not hurt in any way.
Deinde ablue oculum post incisionem grandinis, cum aqua salsa: et cura locum cum eo quod incarnat, donec sanetur infirmus.	Then, after the incision has been made with a blade, wash the eye with salty water; and take care of the place where it is swollen, until the wound heals.
¶ De cura Axirnath palpebrarum.	On the care of the eyelids.
Caput X.	Chapter 10: Head.
Axirnath est adeps qui generatur in tunicis palpebrae superioris: et plurimum quidem accidit illud pueris: et ipsum grauat oculos eorum, et accidunt eis catarri in matutinis, et non possunt intueri lumen solis, propterea, quod lachrymae properant ad eos, et propter illud uides eos discumbere super facies suas semper, et super eas dormiunt, et sunt palpebrae eorum sub superciliis humidae, quas iam cooperuit inflatio: et eminentia quidem Axirnath apparens est oculo, et quando tu premis locum cum digitis tuis, sentis Axirnath inter eos.	Axirnath is a grease that is generated in the eyelids; and it often happens that this affects young people: it damages their eyes, causing them to have cataracts in the morning, and they cannot see the light of the sun, because their tears flow towards them, and for that reason they always rest their faces on their hands, and lie upon them when they sleep, and their eyelids are moist with an inflammation, which has already been caused by the swelling: and the protuberance of Axirnath is apparent to the eye; and when you press the spot with your fingers, you feel Axirnath between them.
Et modus operationis eius est, ut ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo.	And its mode of action is such that he who has the illness places his head in your lap.
Deinde accipe pannum lini, et praepara in eo licinia, et fac ex illo licinio circulum secundum quantitatem quod continet Axirnath ab omni parte.	Then take a piece of linen cloth, and prepare it with a knot, and make from it a circle which will encompass all the Axirnath.
Deinde pone eum super eam, et preme cum digitis tuis ab omni parte, ut aggregetur Axirnath in medio circuli.	Then put it on that, and press with your fingers from all parts so that the Axirnath is gathered in the middle of the circle.
Deinde finde in medio illius humiditatis cum spatumili incidente fissuras per latitudinem, et non sit fissura maior illa quae fit in phlebotomia in profundo.	Then find in the middle of it with a sharp knife an incision that is not larger than a toothpick, and does not extend to the deeper part.
Aut oportet ut findas cutem totam, donec peruenias ad Axirnath in pluribus enim dispositionibus procedit Axirnath ex fissura secundum formam frusti pinguedinis albae.	Or you should find the whole skin, so that you reach the Axirnath; for in several positions the Axirnath proceeds from a crack of a second kind, as if by the loss of snow on the white hair.
Extrahe ergo eam cum panno, quem infiltrasti inter digitos tuos ad exteriora: et tu reuoluis manum tuam ad dextram et sinistram, donec dispergatur: et caue, ne addas in fissura, ut non peruenias cum spatumili ad oculum, et laedas eum.	Then pull it out with the cloth which you have soaked between your fingers towards the outside: and you should move your hand to the right and left until it has spread out; and carefully so that you do not add to the incision with the knife at the eye, and let it go.
Si autem non appareat tibi Axirnath in principio fissurae, tu addas in fissura parum cum facilitate, donec procedat Axirnath.	If however it does not appear to you at first in the fissure, you add a little to the fissure with ease, until the axil comes out.
Deinde extrahe eam, sicut diximus.	Then take it out, as we have said.
Deinde submerge pannos in aceto et aqua, et pone eos super locum, et stringe eum cum puluillis.	Then dip the cloth in vinegar and water, and place it on the spot, and squeeze it with flour.
Et ex hominibus sunt qui terunt salem, et ponunt ipsum in concauitate fissurae, ut liquefiat quod remansit ex illa humiditate.	And there are people who grind salt, and put it in the concavity of the wound, so that what remains of the moisture is liquid.
Deinde cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	Then take care of it, until it heals.
Si autem accidat in loco apostema calidum, tune cura ipsum cum emplastris sedatiuis, donec sanetur.	If however a blister arises in the place, then take care of it with soothed plasters, until it heals.
¶ De modis Ataxmir oculi, id est, cum palpebra mollificatur oculi, unde fit ut rugetur sicut non debet.	Regarding the methods of Ataxmir for the eyes: that is, when the eyelid becomes soft to the eye, so that it rubs as it should not.
Caput XI.	Chapter XI.
Quando nascuntur in palpebris oculi pili additi praeter cursum sub pilis naturalibus, et antiquantur: tunc ipsi nocent oculo, et faciunt accidere modos aegritudinum, sicut lachrymas assiduas, et mollificationem palpebrarum, et albuginem, donec fit illud caussa destructionis oculi.	When hairs grow out of the eyelids besides their usual course under the natural lashes, and turn backwards: then they harm the eye, and produce diseases such as constant tears, softening of the eyelids, and cloudiness, until they cause the destruction of the eye.
Et Ataxmir quidem oculi curatur secundum quatuor modos.	And Ataxmir treats the eyes according to four methods.
Aut per cauterium cum igne.	Or with a caustic and fire.
Aut cum medicina acuta, secundum quod praemissum est in capitulo cauterii.	Or with acute medicines, according to what is set down in the chapter on cautery.
Aut curatur Ataxmir per incisionem et suturam.	Or Ataxmir treats with incision and stitchings.
Aut per cannas, secundum quod ego dicam.	Or with blisters, according to what I say.
Oportet ut ponas caput infirmi in sinu tuo.	It is necessary that you put the head of the patient in your lap.
Deinde conuerte palpebram oculi manu tua sinistra.	Then take the left hand and turn the eyelid of the eye with your fingers.
Si ergo conuertitur, bonum est.	If it is turned, it is good.
Et si non: intromitte acum in eam, in qua sit filum ab inferiori parte palpebrae, et fac penetrare acum cum filo desuper, et sit illud prope pilos ipsos, id est, prope marginem palpebrae, in quo nascuntur pili: et trahe filum ad superiora cum palpebra, et conuerte eam cum radio.	And if it is not turned: push the point into it, where there is a hair from the lower part of the eyelid, and make it penetrate with the wire from above, and let it lie close to the hairs themselves, that is, close to the edge of the eyelid, where the hairs grow out: and pull the wire upwards with the lid, and turn it outwards.
Deinde finde in interiori parte palpebrae sub pilis additis cum spatumili incidente a lachrymali maiore usque ad lachrymale minus.	Then find in the inner part of the eyelids under the hairs with the spatula incident from the greater tear up to the smaller tear.
Deinde extrahe filum, et pone sub palpebra puluillum paruum ex cotto, aut panno: deinde signa super palpebram cum encaustro, quod sit sicut figura folii myrti.	Then remove the filament, and put under the eyelid a thin bit of wool from wool or cloth: then mark on the eyelid with the caustic, which is like the shape of the leaf of mint.
Verumtamen oportet, ut fit figura secundum quantitatem et eleuationem palpebrae: quoniam iam diuersificatur illud in hominibus.	However, it is necessary that it be made according to the amount and height of the eyelid: for this varies from person to person.
Ex eis enim est, qui indiget ut incidatur ex palpebra quantitas magna, secundum quantitatem quae mollificatur a palpebra.	From these is one who needs it so that it should strike out from the eyelid a large amount, according to the amount which softens from the eyelid.
Deinde cum spatumili finde super duas lineas quas signasti, et incipe a lachrymali maiore usque ad lachrymale minus, et sit fissura una prope pilos naturales, sicut est grossitudo radii.	Then with the spatula find over the two lines which you marked, and begin from the greater tear up to the smaller tear, and let there be a single crack near the natural hairs, as is the roughness of the radius.
Deinde intromitte uncinum in uno duorum angulorum cutis.	Then introduce the hook into one of two angles of the skin.
Deinde excoria ipsam totam.	Then scrape all that.
Deinde aggrega cum sutura duo labia, cum acu et filo lana subtili: et absterge sanguinem, et fac adhaerere quod superfluit ex filis super duo supercilia, cum quibusdam rebus inuiscantibus, si uis facere illud: et si non, non cures.	Then collect with a stitch the two lips, with ac and fine wool thread: and wipe away the blood, and let it adhere what is superfluous from the hairs over the two eyelids, with which some things are to be seen, if you wish to do so: and if not, then don't worry.
Deinde dimitte suturam et fila usque ad tres dies, aut quatuor: postea cura illud.	Then let go of the stitch and the thread up to three or four days: then take care of that.
Et si uis, dimitte uulnus absque sutura, et cura ipsum cum eo, quod exsiccat et constringit.	And if you wish, let go of the knot without a stitch, and take care of itself with it, which dries up and tightens.
Nam palpebra eleuatur apud sigillationem uulneris et aggregationem eius: sed futura est melior.	For the eyelid becomes detached at the seal of the wound and aggregation of it: but the future is better.
Hunc modum curandi Ataxmir docuerunt antiqui.	This way of treating has been taught by the ancient Ataxmir.
Verumtamen in eo est sollicitudo super infirmum, et est ex bona operatione, et non est in eo timor.	However, there is concern over the weak one, and it is from a good operation, and it is not in it any fear.
Et modus alius est in Ataxmir etiam: et est, ut signes super palpebram figuram, quae sit sicut figura folii myrti, sicut narrauimus.	And another method is also with Ataxmir: and that is, as the signs on the eyelid are made like the shape of the leaf of mint, which we have described.
Deinde eleua palpebram cum tribus uncinis separatis, aut aggregatis, secundum formam hanc quae sequitur, deinde incide quod superfluit cum forficibus paruis, secundum hanc formam, cum aequalitate incisionis.	Then clean the eyelids with three separate hooks, or gathered together, according to this form which follows; then cut what is superfluous with small scissors, according to this form, with equality of the incision.
Si autem non est tibi possibile tenere uncinum, et non aequatur illud: tunc accipe acum in qua sit filum, et intromitte ipsum in medio figurae: et intromitte filum aliud prope lachrymale maius, et filum secundum prope lachrymale minus: et aggrega inter digitos tuos fila cum aequalitate.	But if you are not able to hold the hook, and it does not match: then take an acumen where the hair is, and insert it in the middle of the form: and introduce another hair near the larger tear, and a second hair near the smaller tear: and gather the hairs between your fingers with equality.
Deinde eleua manum tuam eleuatione aequali: et eleua cutem super quam est signatum cotum, sicut narrauimus.	Then clean your hand with equal cleaning: and clean the skin above where the mark of the knot is, as we have said.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris cum sutura: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then gather together the two lips of the wound with a stitch: and care for it, until it heals.
Si uero accidat apostema apud incisionem tuam, aut fissuram tuam: seda illud apostema cum caeroto, et his similibus, ex unguentis sedantibus.	But if there is an abscess by your incision, or a hole: but this abscess with caustics, and those similar, from a wax sitting.
Et quandoque accidit palpebrae etiam, ut conuertantur pili eius.	And when the eyelids also happen, so that his hair turns.
Oportet ergo ut utaris in ea quod diximus in incisione: sed sutura utrisque magis est artificialis.	Therefore it is necessary that you use in this what we have said in the incision: but the stitch on both sides is more artificial.
¶ De cura Ataxmir cum cannis.	Of the care of Ataxmir with the scissors.
ET Est, ut conuertas palpebram, et scindas fissuram quae est deintus, secundum quod narraui.	AND It is, so that you turn the eyelid, and cut the hole which is within, according to what we have told.
Deinde arte fac duas cannas, aut duo ligna subtilia: quarum longitudo sit secundum longitudinem palpebrae, et latitudo earum sit minor latitudine spatumilis: et tu iam incidisti in extremitatibus utriusque ab utrisque partibus ubi tenes fila.	Then with art make two scissors, or two thin sticks: whose length is according to the length of the eyelid, and their width is less than the width of a hair: and you have already incised at the ends of each side where you hold the hairs.
Deinde aggrega utramque cum subtilitate super illud quod superfluit ex palpebra oculi, et stringe duas cannas ab utrisque partibus strictura forti, et dimitte eam diebus aliquot.	Then gather each with subtlety above what is superfluous from the eyelid of the eye, and tightly tighten the two scissors from both sides, and let it go after a few days.
Cutis enim stricta morietur, et denigrabitur, et putrefiet, donec cadet per se.	For the skin is tight to kill, and will be covered with rust, and will rot, until it falls by itself.
Si ergo tardatur, tunc incide eam cum forficibus.	But if it delays, then cut it with scissors.
Deinde cura eam, donec sanetur.	Then care for her, until she recovers.
Cum ergo consolidatur, eleuatur palpebra: et non pungunt pili.	When therefore she is healed, take away the plaster; and do not prick the cicatrice with a pin.
Et haec est forma duarum cannarum, quas facies secundum hanc figuram, et quantitatem in longitudinem et latitudinem.	And this is the form of two cans, which you shall make according to this figure, and their quantity in length and breadth.
¶ De eleuatione pilorum pungentium in oculo cum acu.	De the creation of two canisters for puncturing the eye with an aiguille.
Caput XII.	Chapter XII.
Operatio in illo est, ut accipias acum subtilem, et intromittas in eam filum ex serico subtile, lene.	The operation in that case is, that you should take an aiguille sharp, and stick it into the eye with a thread of silk.
Deinde aggreges extremitates eius, et nodes utramque nodo subtili ualde: et sit longitudo filorum palmus unus.	Then bind the ends together, and tie each with a small knot; and make the length of the threads be half an inch.
Deinde compone in Alinxotati filum aliud subtile sub eo in breui, et noda extremitates eius si uis.	Then take another thin thread and put it under the first bandage, and tie the ends together if you wish to.
Deinde ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo, et sit prope solem ut declaretur operatio: quoniam est operatio subtilis, uel minuta.	Then place the sick person's head in your lap, and hold it near the light that the operation may be seen; for it is a delicate operation, or a minute one.
Deinde intromitte acum cum alinxotati in radicem palpebrae, et fac eam penetrare in palpebram festinanter, donec extrahas eam desuper pilum naturalem.	Then stick the aiguille with the bandage into the root of the eyelid, and let it penetrate quickly into the eyelid, until you draw out a natural pimple.
Deinde trahe pilum usque supra alinxotati: et intromitte in alinxotati illum pilum: si est unus, aut duo, aut tres, non plures.	Then pull the pimple up above the bandage: and stick it into the bandage; if it is one, or two, or three, not more.
Deinde trahe manum tuam cum eo, donec egrediatur pilus cum alinxotati in palpebra cum pilo naturali.	Then take your hand with it, until the pimple and the bandage go out of the eyelid with a natural pimple.
Si autem trahatur alinxotati, et non egrediatur pilus cum ea: trahes alinxotati ad inferiora, cum filo quod tu composuisti in ea, donec egrediatur alinxotati ex foramine superiori, et uideas eam uisione oculi: tunc enim trahes alinxotati, et filum: et extrahe utraque, et claude oculum: et dimitte ipsum clausum duobus diebus, aut tribus, donec adhaereat pilus loco suo, et nascatur super ipsum caro.	If however the bandage is pulled out, and does not come out with it: take the bandage from below, with the thread which you have put into it, until you draw out the bandage from the upper aperture, and cover the eye; then take both of them away, and close the eye; and let him be closed for two days, or three, until the pimple adheres to its place, and grows on the flesh.
Quod si pilus est breuis, tunc aut associa ei pilum longum ex pilis naturalibus, et eleuatur cum eo: aut dimitte ipsum, donec elongetur post spacium, et tunc eleua ipsum.	If however the pimple is short, then either join it with a long natural pimple, and take it away with it; or dismiss him, until he grows longer in space, and then stick him.
¶ De cura Alxatrati quae accidit in palpebra superiori.	On the treatment of a wound on the upper eyelid.
Caput XIII.	Chapter XIII. On the treatment of a wound on the upper
Quando accidit oculo haec Alxatrati, nominatur Leporina.	When it affects the eye, this is called Leporine.
Et haec Alxatrati est aut naturalis, aut accidentalis.	And this Al-Xatrati is either natural or accidental.
Accidentalis ergo fit ex consolidatione uulneris, aut sectionis, aut cauterii, et similium illis.	So the accidental one is caused by the consolidation of a wound, or a section, or a cauterization, and similar things.
Et modus operationis in ea est, ut tu findas illam consolidationem, et ut separes labia eius, et ponas in eo quod est inter ea licinium ex lino, et liges eam, donec sanetur.	And the mode of operation in it is such that you find her consolidation, and so that you separate her lips, and put into it what is between them from a linen cloth, and bind her, until she heal.
Et non oportet, ut utaris in curatione eius rebus quae exiccant et constringunt: nam si tu facis illud, redit Alxatrati deterior quam fuit: imo utere in ea rebus quae mollificant, sicut foenumgraecum: et embroca cum aqua, in qua cocta sit althea, semen lini: et unguento dyaquilon, quod liquefactum sit cum aliquo ex oleis: et inuolue cum eo licinium, et cura cum eo.	And it is not necessary, that you use in her cure the things which dry and tighten: for if you do so, Al-Xatrati will be worse than it was: but you should use in her cure the things which soften, such as fenugreek: and dip with it into water, in which has been boiled aloe, linseed: and apply with it an unguent, which melts when mixed with some oils: and wrap it up with the linen, and apply the unguent with it.
Et thesaurus curationis tuae est, ut coneris omni ingenio, ut non consolidetur, secundum formam quae fuit in primis.	And the treasure of your cure is such that you may keep all art, so that she does not consolidate, according to the form which it had in the beginning.
Et haec quidem operatio quam diximus, non est nisi quaedam rectificatio Alxatrati, ut non redeat forma loci secundum quod fuit omnino.	And this operation which we have described, is but a certain correction of Al-Xatrati, so that the form of the place may not be completely changed, altogether.
¶ De cura Alxatrati quae fit in palpebra inferiori, et est rugatio uel contractio sursum ad dextrum et sinistrum.	On the treatment of Al-Xatrati when it affects the lower eyelid, and is a wrinkling or contraction upward toward the right or left.
Caput XIIII.	Chapter XVIII. On the treatment of Al-Xatrati when it
Haec Alxatrati quae fit inferius, est quae uere nominatur Alxatrati.	This Al-Xatrati which affects below is what is called Al-Xatrati.
Et est naturalis, et est accidentalis.	And it is either natural or accidental.
Et accidentalis fit ex uulnere, aut fissura, aut cauterio, et illis similibus.	And the accidental one is caused by a wound, or a nick, or a cauterization, and similar things.
Et uia operationis in ea est, ut accipias acum, in qua sit filum duplum, et tingas eam in carnem, et facias eam penetrare a lachrymali sinistro usque ad lachrymale dextrum, donec perueniat filum in duabus extremitatibus carnis.	And the mode of operation in it is such that you take up the akh (a substance used in medicine), in which there is a double thread, and dip it into flesh, and let it penetrate from the left tear gland to the right tear gland, until the thread reaches both extremities of the flesh.
Deinde extende carnem ad superiora cum acu, et incide eam cum spatumili lato.	Then extend the flesh to the upper parts with an awl, and cut it with a chisel.
Si ergo redit figura palpebrae secundum quod oportet, est bonum.	If, then, the figure returns to the eyelid according to what is necessary, it is good.
Et si non, accipe radium, et pone ipsum in fissuram, et conuerte cum eo palpebram: et finde duas fissuras in latere interiore palpebrae, et sint extremitates duarum fissurarum ex duobus angulis incisionis, donec concurrant et fiat ex eis angulus: donec quando aggregantur fiat figura earum haec figura, et est litera lauda graeca.	And if not, take the ray, and put it in the notch, and turn it with it the eyelid: and find two notches in the inner side between the eyelids, and are the ends of the two notches from two angles of incision until they meet and make the figure this figure, and it is a Greek letter.
Deinde aufer illam carnem per quantitatem, quod est latus eius acutum inferius, ab eo quod sequitur palpebram.	Then remove that flesh by quantity, which is the acute lower side of it, from him who follows the eyelid.
Deinde aggrega partes separatas: sue eam cum filo lanae.	Then gather together the separated parts: sew them with a wool thread.
Deinde cura eas cum eo quod diximus, de medicinis mollificantibus, et liciniis, donec sanentur.	Then care for them with what I have said, about medicated salves, and liniments, until they are healed.
Et si Alxatrati accidat ex fissura, et sutura, aut cauterio: tunc oportet ut findas fissura plana sub pilis palpebrarum, etiam secundum quod praecessit.	And if an alien body comes out of the notch, and sewing, or cauterizing: then you should find a flat notch under the eyelids' hairs, also according to what has preceded.
Deinde separa inter duo labia cum licinio, secundum quod diximus.	Then separate between the two lips with a liniment, according to what I have said.
Et summa sermonis de cura Alxatrati, quando est desuper, aut inferius, est, ut currat in ea operatio, secundum quod praeparatur ex forma Alxatrati.	And the whole speech about the cure of an alien body, when it is on top, or below, it is, that it runs in this operation, according to what is prepared from the form of Al-Xatrati.
Ipsa namque est multarum diuersitatum in forma: et artifex prudens praeparat ingenium cum quocunque modo est possibile ei, donec redire faciat figuram ad formam naturalem, aut prope eam, et ipsemet infirmus, secundum quod conuenit ei ex operatione et instrumentis in plurimis dispositionibus.	For it is itself a multitude of different forms: and the prudent artisan prepares the mind with whatever way is possible for him, until he makes the figure return to its natural form, or close to it, and himself becomes infirm, according to what suits him, from operation and instruments in many dispositions.
¶ De adhaerentia palpebrae oculi cum coniunctiua, aut cornea.	Regarding the adhesion of the eyelid of the eye with the conjunctiva, or cornea.
Caput XV.	Chapter XV
Quandoque accidit haec consolidatio multis hominibus, ita ut consolidetur palpebra superior cum albedine oculi, et prohibeat ipsum ab operationibus suis naturalibus.	When this consolidation happens to many people, so that the upper eyelid is consolidated with the white of the eye, and prevents itself from its natural operations.
Oportet ergo quod intromittas extremitatem radii sub palpebra, et eleues eam sursum: aut extendas eam cum uncino: deinde incide adhaerentiam cum spatumili subtili, quod non sit cum acuitate incisionis spatumilium, imo sit obtusum parumper: ut non inquietetur infirmus apud operationem, et remoueatur spatumile, et laedat oculum cum acuitate sua: et sit incisio tua quasi tu excories illam adhaerentiam cum facilitate, donec quando redit palpebra secundum formam suam naturalem, et sanetur adhaerentia tota.	Therefore, it is necessary that you introduce the radius end under the eyelid and lift it up; or extend it with a hook: then cut the adhesion with a fine blade, which should not be too sharp, but rather a little blunt: so that the sick person does not disturb during the operation, and does not move the blade, and does not hurt his eye with its sharpness: and your incision should be as you remove this adhesion easily, until when the eyelid returns to its natural form, and heals all the adhesion.
Funde tunc in oculum aquam salsam, cum aqua ablue ipsum: aut distilla in ipsum ex sief facto, ex ziniar dissoluto cum aqua.	Then, at that time, pour into the eye salty water to wash it, with water Ablute him: or distill in him from a mixture of distilled water and dissolved zinc:
Deinde separa inter palpebram et oculum cum licinio lini: et pone super oculum lanam infusam cum albugine oui: et post diem tertium utere sief, et cum solidatiuis, donec sanetur.	Then, after a day, use a thread to separate the eyelid from the eye: and place on the eye wool dipped in Albughine: and after three days use a blade, and with solids, until it heals.
¶ De incisione ungulae et eminentiae carnis lachrymarum.	Regarding the incision of the nail and the eminence of the flesh of tears.
Caput XVI.	Chapter XVI.
Scias, quod ungula est secundum duos modos.	You know that the nail is according to two ways.
Aut est neruosa: et est similis sifac duro, subtili.	Or it is nervous: and it is similar to a soft, thin wood.
Aut est non neruosa, similis humiditati congelatae albae: quae quando tangit cam ferrum, aut conaris capere eam cum uncino, abscinditur, et non figitur in ea uncinus.	Or it is not nervous, similar to frozen moisture as snow: which when it touches metal, iron, or tin takes it with a hook, and does not stick to it.
Et utraeque species non incipiunt, nisi a lachrymali maiore, usquequo uadit paulatim, donec cooperit uisum, et prohibet lumen, et motum oculi.	And both kinds do not begin, unless from the greater tear, until it is slowly discharged, until it dries up, and prevents the light, and the movement of the eye.
Et modus operandi in incisione eius est: ut ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo.	And the method of working on his incision is: so that the sick person puts his head in your lap.
Deinde aperi oculos eius, et eleua palpebram manu tua.	Then open his eyes and lift his eyelids with your hand.
Deinde collige ungulam cum uncino paucae duplationis, et extende eam ad superiora.	Then take the nail with a little hook, and extend it upwards.
Deinde accipe acum, et intromitte in eam pilum ex pilis equi, et bouis, aut uaccae: et sit filum forte, et duplica extremitatem acus parumper, et fige eam in medio ungulae: et penetra eam cum acu, et liga cum filo ungulam, et extende eam ad superiora: et excoria cum pilo latus ungulae quod sequitur pupillam, ac si tu serres eam cum pilo usque ad postreimnum eius.	Then take a sharp needle, and insert it into the nail with a horsehair thread, or a hook: and make the thread strong, and double the end of the needle slightly, and fix it in the middle of the nail: and pierce it with a pin, and tie the nail to the thread, and extend it upwards: and cut it with a sharp blade, and remove it from the nail, and extend it again upwards: and scrape it with the hair of the nail that follows the pupil, as if you were holding it with a hair until its tip.
Deinde incide residuum in radice lachrymalis cum spatumili subtili, aut cum forficibus paruis: et dimitte carnem lachrymalis naturalem, ut non accidat ex incisione eius cursus lachrymarum assiduus.	Then cut the residue on the lacrimal root with a fine scalpel, or with small forceps; and release the natural flesh of the lacrimal so that its course of tears is not interrupted by the incision.
Et quandoque extenditur ungula cum uncino solo: aut cum filo, sicut diximus.	And when ever the nail extends itself in the sole with a hook: or with a thread, as we have said.
Deinde excoriatur cum spatumili leni, cuius haec est forma.	Then scrape it with a soft scalpel, whose shape is like this.
Et caue, ne tangat spatumile tunicam corneam, et accidat in ea ruptura, et perforetur pupilla.	And be careful not to touch the horny tunic with the scraper, lest it cause a break, and pierce the pupil.
Deinde post incisionem, proice in oculum aliquid salis contriti, aut ex sief facto ex ziniar, et dimitte ipsum usque ad diem alium.	Then, after the incision, pour into the eye some crushed salt, or make a paste of zinc, and leave it until another day.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod oportet, usquequo sanetur.	Then take care of the eye with whatever is necessary, until it heals.
Quod si ungula est non neruosa, et non potes intromittere in eam acum, neque figitur in ea uncinus, tunc multotiens curatur haec species ungulae cum medicinis, et sanatur sicut narraui in diuisione.	If the nail is not nervuous, and you cannot get into it, nor does the hook hurt it, then often cure this nail condition with medicines, and it heals as well as that in the division.
Quod si uis incidere eam, tunc aperi oculum infirmi, et accipe spatumile subtile, lene, debilis acuitatis, secundum hanc formam.	If you need to cut it, then open the eye for nursing, and take a fine scalpel, gentle of sharpness, according to this form.
Et rade ungulam desuper rasione cum subtilitate.	And scrape the nail from above with subtlety.
Quod si uides quod ipsa rarificatur et confringitur, et imprimit in eam rasio, tunc distilla ex hora tua in oculum ex sief facto ex ziniar, aut ex sief rubeo, aut sale trito: et opila oculum usque ad diem alium.	If you see that it is getting thinner and drying up, and the rasion becomes imprinted in it, then distil from your own blood into the eye, made of zinc paste, or of red ochre, or of fine salt: and pamper the eye until another day.
Deinde itera super ipsam operationem, donec remoueatur totum eius.	Then repeat this operation on it again, until it is completely removed.
Nisi contrarium sit tibi in oculo apostema calidum: tunc enim dimitte ipsam, et cura apostema, donec sanetur.	Unless you have a warm apostema in the eye: for then let go of it, and take care of the apostema until it heals.
Deinde itera operationem super ipsam cum rasione, donec sanetur.	Then repeat the operation on the nail with the rasp, until it heals.
Eminentia autem carnis lachrymalis, si nocet in oculo nocumento magno, suspendatur cum uncino, et incide ex ea partem eius: et non ultimes incisionem, ut non accidat cursus lachrymarum.	Except that the flesh of the lacrimal, if it hurts greatly in the eye, be suspended with a hook, and cut off from it: and do not make the last incision, lest the course of tears be interrupted.
Deinde stilla in lachrymale sief rubeum, aut factum ex ziniari, donec sanetur.	Then pour the eye-wash into the tear-vessels with red rub, or made from za'atar, until it heals.
¶ De incisione Alguardenic, et carne nata in oculo.	In regard to the incision and the flesh that has come out of the eye.
Caput XVII.	Chapter XVII
Nascitur quandoque in quibusdam oculis hominum caro rubea composita, uel superposita, donec cooperit pupillam, aut appropinquat, aut stringit super palpebras, et fortasse conuertit palpebras ad exteriora: et assimilatur rosae balaustinae.	This flesh sometimes becomes attached to the eye of some men, mixed with red color or laid on top of it, until it covers the pupil, or approaches it, or presses against the eyelids, and perhaps turns the eyelids outward; and is absorbed into the rose-colored cheeks.
Et operatio in ea etiam est, ut ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo.	And the operation on it is also that he who is lame should put his head in your lap.
Deinde aperi oculos eius, et collige illam carnem totam cum uncinis conuenientibus ad illud: et tene illud cum forcipe uno, aut gesti.	Then open his eyes and pluck out all the flesh with a suitable hook; and hold it with a forceps, or grasp it.
Deinde incide carnem in primis, donec finiatur totum eius cum incisorio.	Then make the incision on the flesh first, until you have cut off all of it with the scalpel.
Et caue ab oculo, ut non laedas ipsum apud operationem: et sit incisio tua qua ipsam incidis, aut cum spatumili, quod narrauimus in incisione ungulae: aut cum forficibus paruis, cum quibus colligitur asebel, secundum quod ueniet forma eius post hoc capitulum.	And keep away from the eye so that you do not wound it during the operation: and let your incision be where you incise, or with a scalpel, which we have mentioned in the incision of the nail: or with small forceps, with which Așbel is caught, according to what its form will be after this chapter.
Cum ergo completur incisio tua, et remouetur tota alguardenici, tunc imple oculum ex sale contrito: aut distilla in eum puluerem rubeum, et similia illi ex medicinis corrosiuis: et pone super oculum deforis cottum cum albugine oui: ut securetur ab apostemate calido.	When your incision is complete and all the algardenium has been removed, then fill the eye with ground salt: or distil into it red powder, and similar medicines that are corrossives: and put on top of the eye a cotton wool with alumen, so that it is protected from the burning heat.
Quod si remanet ex alguardenici aliquid, et dominatur tibi sanguis calidus, et times apostema calidum: tunc dimitte oculum, et cura ipsum cum eo quod sedat apostema.	If there remains any algardenium, and hot blood reigns over you, and you are worried about the heat of the aposteme; then let go of the eye, and take care of it with him when he sits down.
Deinde itera super ipsum cum operatione, donec sanetur.	Then repeat the operation on the flesh again, until it heals.
Et similiter fac cum carne addita quae accidit in oculo ex hac specie.	And do likewise with the meat that has come out of the eye from this kind.
Verumtamen oportet, ut alienes curationem omnis oculi debilis ex uia naturali, aut ex uia accidentali, operando cum ferro: et non intromittas manum tuam in aliqua harum operationum, donec uideas, quod illud membrum est tolerans illam operationem.	However, it is necessary that you keep away from natural or accidental causes of eye disease, operating with iron: and do not put your hand into any of these operations, until you are certain, for that member is able to bear that operation.
¶ De collectione Sebel ex oculo.	About collecting sevel from the eye.
Caput XVIII.	Chapter XVIII.
Sebel sunt uenae rubeae quae texuntur super oculum, et prohibent uisui operationem suam: et debilitant oculum cum longitudine dierum.	Of sevel that are small red sores that grow on the eye, and that prevent vision; and also weaken the eye with the passage of time.
Necesse est ergo tibi in primis, ut consideres, si oculus in quo est Sebel, est fortis, et non est in eo aegritudo aliqua, praeter Sebel: tunc collige Sebel eius.	It is therefore necessary for you to consider, first of all, whether the eye in which there is sevel is strong and has no other disease except the sevel; then collect the sevel from it.
Et est, ut praecipias infirmo, ut ponat caput suum in sinu tuo.	And if you command the sick person to place his head in your lap.
Deinde suspende illas uenas cum uncino uno, aut duobus secundum prudentiam tuam: et sit uncinus subtilis duplationis, secundum hanc formam, aut sint duo uncini gradat in corpore uno, secundum hanc formam.	Then hang the sores by one or two hooks according to your skill: and let the hook be thin, double-shaped, or there may be two hooks on a single bar, according to this form.
Deinde collige cum forficibus subtilibus illas uenas cum subtilitate, et absterge sanguinem hora post horam, donec uideas illas uenas remoueri ex oculo, et resoluuntur: et caue ne laedas oculum cum extremitatibus spatumilis.	Then take with delicate hooks the sores with carefulness, and wipe away the blood hour after hour, until you see the sore spots coming out of the eye and healing up; and do not touch the eyes with your fingertips.
Et sit operatio tua in meridie coram sole, et sis firmus in operatione tua ualde: ut non incidas nisi illas uenas.	And let your surgery take place in the middle of the day, and be very firm in your surgery: so that you do not fall except for the sores.
Et cum tu expleueris, tunc distilla in oculum sief uiride, aut rubeum: ut sua acuitate corrodat quod remansit ex sebel.	And when you have cleaned it out, then pour into the eye a little saffron liquid or a little red liquid; so that its own acuity may corrode what is left of the sevel.
Si autem non est tibi possibile colligere illud totum in illa hora, tunc emplastra oculum cum eo, quod sedat dolorem oculi: et dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot, donec sedetur dolor eius: et securetur ab apostemate calido: deinde itera super ipsum secundum modum eundem, donec sanetur.	But if you are not able to collect all of it in that hour, then plug the eye with something that soothes its pain; and let it rest for a few days, until the pain subsides: and protect it from the heat of the sun: and then repeat the same operation on it again according to this method, until it heals.
Et haec est forma forficis.	This is the form of the hook.
¶ De reductione Arissati ad nasum.	Chapter XVIII.
Caput XIX.	Of reducing ari-sat to the nose.
Nominant medici Arissati Fistulam, quam curas cum cauterio, aut cum medicina acuta comburente, secundum quod praecessit eius narratio.	They named the medical instrument a fistula, which is used with caustic or acute fire according to what came before in its account.
Et si non sanatur, tunc non est ingenium in ea: nisi ut findas super apostema apud natiuitatem eius, et extrahas totam humiditatem quae est in eo et pus, donec detegatur os.	And if you do not heal it, then there is no skill in it: unless you discover a pimple at the time of its birth and drain all the moisture that is in it and the pus, until the bone is detected.
Cum ergo detegitur os, et uides in eo corruptionem, aut nigredinem, tunc rade ipsum cum instrumento, cuius forma est haec.	And when the bone is detected, and you see corruption or discoloration in it, then scrape it out with this instrument, whose shape is like this.
Et nominatur Asperi capitis.	And it is called the chisel of the head.
Fiat ex ferro indo, et sit caput eius rotundum sicut azir, quod sit punctatum punctatione limae, aut punctatione aliskilferi punctatione subtili: et pone ipsum super locum corruptum ossis.	Let it be made of iron and let the head be round like a chisel, which is marked with the file or with fine sand: and place the instrument on the corrupted place of the bone.
Deinde reuolue ipsum inter digitos tuos, et tu preme manum tuam parumper, donec scias quod illa corruptio iam rasa est: et fac illud aliquotiens.	Then turn the instrument between your fingers and press your hand lightly, until you know that that corruption has now been shaved: and do it sometimes.
Deinde restaura locum cum medicinis exiccatiuis stipticis.	Then restore the place with dry leeching.
Si ergo consolidatur locus, et nascitur in eo caro, et abscinditur cursus saniei: et remanet quadraginta diebus, et non renouatur, et non apostematur, et non accidit in eo accidens: tunc scias quia iam sanatus est.	If then the place is healed, and a bone grows up in it, and the wound heals over: and remains forty days, and does not break again, and does not get infected, then you shall know that it has now been healed.
Et si non, tunc non est in eo ingenium, nisi reducere fistulam ad foramen nasi, secundum hanc formam.	And if not, then there is no skill in it, unless a tube is reduced to the nostril, according to this form.
Et est, ut detegas ab osse secundo cum ferro, aut cum medicina acuta: et cum detectum est os, tunc accipe terebrum secundum hanc formam, sit extremitas ferrea, triangulata: et lignum eius sit pyramis extenuata usque ad extremitatem, sicut uides.	And it is so that you may extract the second bone with iron, or with sharp medicine: and when the bone has been detected, then take a chisel according to this form, whose end is metal, triangular: and let the wood of it extend to an edge like a pyramid, as you see.
Deinde pone illud super os ipsum: et sit illud prope lachrymale: et elonga manum tuam ab oculo parum.	Then put it on the bone itself: and let it be near the tear: and extend your hand from the eye a little way.And when tu sentias in oculo, et vidisti strabismus, et non ponit caput tuum secundum naturalem locum suum: tunc scias quae ueneat cor
Deinde reuolue manum tuam cum terebro, donec penetret os, et sentiat illud infirmus: per hoc quod inuenit uentum exire ex eo, quando tenet manum suam super nasum suum.	Then feel with your hand if you can feel the eye, and see if it is strabismus, and does not put your head into its natural place: then you shall know that the disease is coming out of it, whenever it feels weak.And then turn your hand with the chisel, until it enters the bone, and feels sick: by this means let it be known that the disease is leaving it, whenever it holds its hand over its nose.
Ergo tunc restaura locum cum medicinis stipticis exiccantibus, sicut docui te.	Therefore then restore the place with stictical medicines that are drying out, as I have taught you.
Cum ergo nascitur caro, et induratur locus: tunc materia quae effundebatur ad exteriora, redit ad nasum: est ergo leuius illud super infirmum.	When the flesh is then born and the place hardens: then the substance that flows out to the outside returns to the nose: so it is lighter on the sick.
¶ De reductione eminentiae Oculi.	On the reduction of vision.
Caput XX.	Chapter 20.
Quando eminet Oculus cum totalitate sua, et non accidit in uisu nocumentum, neque diminutio: tunc oportet ut soluas infirmum: deinde phlebotomes eum: postea ponas uentosas in ceruice absque scarificatione, sed cum suctione.	When the eye shoots out with all its power and does not cause damage or loss of vision, then it is necessary to let go of the sick person: then let him bleed; afterwards put vents on the scalp without scarification but with suction.
Deinde pone super Oculum linimentum quod fit ex acacia, et aloe, et olibano, et sarcocolla.	Then put on the eye a liniment that is made of Acacia, and Aloes, and Olibanum, and Sarcocolla.
Deinde stringe Oculum desuper super emplastrum cum puluillis multis.	Then tighten the eye from above over a plaster with many powders.
Et modus puluillorum est: ut accipias pannos lenes, multos, et duplicetur omnis pannus ex eis super quatuor: fac ex eis multos: deinde pone eos unum super alium, secundum quantitatem qua indiget Oculus: deinde stringe super ipsos cum panno duro strictura forti.	And the mode of the powders is this: that you take soft cloths, many and double all the cloths out of them on four sides: make out of them a lot: then put them one over another according to the amount which the eye needs: then tighten them strongly with a hard cloth.
Et itera uentosas cum suctione sine scarificatione.	And repeatedly apply vents without scarification.
Deinde aufer uentosas, et dimitte oculum strictum die et nocte.	Then remove the vents and let go of the tightened eye during the day and night.
Si autem ligamentum iterum mollificatur, tunc oportet ut stringatur multum: deinde aufer ligamentum post diem et noctem, sicut diximus.	If, however, the ligament again softens, then it is necessary to tighten it a lot: then remove the ligament after day and night, as we have said.
Si ergo uides oculum iam redisse uuae tunicae, est bonum: et si non, tunc itera emplastrum, et puluillos, et stricturam, et uentosas, donec sanetur.	If the eye then is already clean with new wounds of the ligature, it is good: and if not, then repeatedly apply vents, and tightness, and vents, until the healing.
¶ De incisionie Vuae tunicae.	On the incision of the ligament.
Caput XXI.	Chapter 21.
Quando accidit disruptio in tunica Vuea, deinde eminet et procedit extra palpebras sicut granum Vuae, et foedatur forma hominis propter illud, et uis incidere illud: tunc operatio in eo est, secundum quod narro: et est, ut intromittas acum in radice Vuae ab inferiori ad superiorem partem.	When the break-out occurs in the Veal ligament, then it shoots out and proceeds outside the eyelids like a grain of corn, and moves in the form of a man because of it, and the eye incises it: then the operation on it is this: and it is as if you were to insert an acorn in the root of the Veal from below to above.
Deinde intromitte acum aliam in qua sit filum duplum a parte lachrymalis, et fac eam penetrare: et dimitte acum primam secundum dispositionem suam.	Then introduce another instrument into the space between the lacrimal and nasal bones, and let it penetrate: and then remove the first one according to its position.
Deinde incide locum fili dupli, et liga cum eo partem Vuae in circumitu acus: et stringe eam multum.	Then cut a space with a double-bladed knife, and fasten one end to the area around the nose with a ligature: and tighten it very much.
Deinde extrahe acum, et pone super oculum lanam infusam in albugine oui: et dimitte eum, donec cadat filum cum Vua.	Then remove it now, and place a woollen thread soaked in white of egg on the eyeball: and let go of it until the thread falls with the lacrimal filament.
Deinde cura oculum cum eo, quod confortat ipsum, donec sanetur uulnus.	Then care for the eye with it, that it may comfort itself, until the wound heals.
Et quandoque stringitur Vua ab omni parte cum circulo ex panno, donec addat oculus eminentiam magnam.	And when the thread is tightened around the entire area with a circle of cloth, until the eye has developed great prominence.
Deinde perforetur cum spatumili subtili, quod perueniat ad profundum oculi, et currat humiditas albuginea, et descendat oculus, et ingrediatur statim: deinde stringe eum, donec sanetur.	Then pierce it with a thin spatulum, which reaches to the depth of the eye, and let moisture from the white of egg flow in, and let the eye fall down, and immediately put it back in: then tighten it until it heals.
¶ De curatione Alcomnati.	§ On the Cure of Alconey.
Caput XXII.	CHAPTER XXII.
Haec Aegritudo quae nominatur Alcomnati, non, est nisi sanies, quae aggregatur in oculo, similis aquae descendenti, et non est ipsa.	This condition called Alconey, is not anything but the white accumulating in the eye, similar to water dropping down, and it itself is not.
Et modus operandi in ea est, ut facias sedere infirmum super sedem praeparatum, uel directum.	And the method of treatment for it is, that you should make the sick person sit on a prepared bench, or directly.
Deinde accipe caput eius manibus tuis a partibus duabus, et moue ipsum, donec uideas saniem peruenire ad inferiora oculis tuis.	Then take his head in your hands from both sides, and gently move it, until you feel the white moving to the lower part of his eyes.
Deinde figatur, et non descendat, et absoluatur lumen: et uideat infirmus res sicut uidebat: et si non descendit inferius, scias quia est aqua.	Then bind it, and let it not fall down, and make the light complete: and the sick person shall see as he used to; and if it does not fall down below, you shall know that it is water.
Si autem non praeparatur descensus saniei cum eo quod diximus, tunc fac sedere infirmum inter manus tuas.	If, however, the descent of the white with it has not been prepared as we have said, then make the sick person sit between your hands.
Deinde accipe spatumile subtile, et finde cum eo supra panniculum corneum parumper apud continuationem coniunctiuae cum tunica cornea in corona, donec egrediatur sanies.	Then take a thin spatulum, and find it with him slightly above the connection of the corium with the corneal layer in the crown, until the white comes out.
Cum ergo egreditur, tunc distilla in oculum aquam calidam in qua miscuisti mel: aut aquam in qua iam bullisti foenumgraecum et mel: deinde curetur cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	So then when you have walked out, then distill into the eye hot water in which you mixed honey: or water in which you have already boiled fenugreek and honey; and then treat with the remaining treatment, until it is healed.
¶ De cura aquae, quae descendit in oculo, uel cataracta.	On the treatment of water that has entered the eye, or a cascade.
Caput XXIII.	Chapter XXIII On the Treatment of Water That Has Entered the Eye
Iam Diximus species aquae in diuisione, et quae conuenit ad perforandum sermone declarante et exponente, tunc accipe illud idem secundum sanitatem.	I have already spoken on the species of water, which are divided, and which suit the diagnosis and explanation, then take that same one according to the cure.
Tunc ergo oportet ut facias sedere infirmum inter manus tuas quadratum, oppositum lumini, prope solem: et liga oculum eius sanum, et stringe eum ualde: deinde palpebram oculi eius manu tua dextra, si oculus in quo est aqua, est oculus sinister: aut manu tua sinistra, si oculus est dexter.	Then you should make the patient sit with his two hands between himself and the light, near the sun: and bind his healthy eye, and tighten it: then you can blink his eye with your right hand, if the water has entered his left eye: or with your left hand, if it is his right eye.
Deinde accipe manu tua dextra almagda, si oculus est sinister: aut manu tua sinistra, si oculus est dexter.	Then take alum with your right hand, if the eye is on the left: or with your left hand, if it is on the right.
Deinde pone extremitatem almagda prope coronam per grossitudinem radii in ipsa albedine oculi apparente lachrymalis minoris: deinde impelle almagda cum uirtute: et tu reuoluis cum eo manum tuam, donec penetret in albuginem oculi: et sentias, quod almagda iam peruenit ad rem uacuam.	Then put the end of the alum towards the crown by the thickness of the radius in the white of the eye which appears to be the tear: then push the alum with force: and you can turn your hand while doing so, until it penetrates into the socket of the eye: and you will feel that the alum has already reached the dry spot.
Et oportet, ut sit mensura itineris almagda ad profundum, mensura spacii quod est a pupilla usque ad finem nigredinis: et est corona oculi.	And it should be such a measure of distance for the alum to the depth, which is the space between the pupil and the end of the blackness: and that is the crown of the eye.
Uidebis enim ea in ipsa pupilla uisione oculi, propter claritatem tunicae corneae.	You will see it in the same pupil with a red eye, on account of the clarity of the cornea.
Deinde pone almagda usque ad locum in quo est aqua.	Then put the alum until you reach the place where the water is.
Deinde preme ipsum inferius uice una post aliam.	Then press it down with a gentle force.
Si ergo descendit aqua statim, tunc infirmus uidet illud super quod aperit uisum suum statim, et almagda in oculo suo.	But if the water has already descended, then the sick person will see it right away, and the alum in his own eye immediately.
Deinde quiescas paululum.	Then rest a little.
Si ergo descendat aqua, tunc depone eam secundo, praeter quod egrediatur almagda.	If water has fallen, then deposit it second, except for what has exited as almonds.
Quando ergo figitur, et non ascendit: tunc extrahe almagda cum facilitate: et tu reuoluis manum tuam paulatim.	When, however, it is formed and does not rise up: then extract the Almonds with ease: and you shall move your hand gradually.
Deinde dissolue in aqua aliquid ex sale claro gemmae: et ablue cum eo oculum deintus.	Then dissolve in water a little of the clear salt of the gem: and wash with it the inner eye.
Deinde pone extra oculum totum stuppam, aut lanam infusam oleo rosato, et albugine oui: et liga cum eo oculum sanum.	Then put on the whole eye a drop, or a wool dipped in rose-oil, and white of egg: and bind it with it the healthy eye.
Nos autem, et illi qui sunt nostri temporis, ponimus super eum ciminum tritum cum albumine oui.	But we, and those who are our companions at this time, put on him powdered cumin, mixed with white of egg.
Quod si non obedit tibi almagda ad introitum in oculum propter duriciem suam, quoniam ex hominibus est, cuius oculus est durus ualde: tunc oportet ut accipias spatumile, quod nominatur Alberid, cuius haec est forma.	That if the Almond does not obey you at the entrance to the eye through its durezza, since it is from a man, whose eye is very hard: then you should take the spikelet which is called Alberid, whose this form.
Pefora ergo cum eo ipsam coniunctiuam tantum, et non ultimes manum tuam in foramine: et non est nisi ut facias uiam ad almagda locum subtilem.	Open it then with him only the conjunction so much, and not the last your hand in the hole: and is there only to do you make a small space for the Almond.
Deinde intromitte almagda, secundum quod diximus.	Then introduce the Almond, according to what we have said above.
Et apud complementum operis tui, praeparetur infirmo dormitorium decenter factum, in quo dormiat super dorsum suum in domo tenebrosa: et prohibeatur ab omnibus motibus, et a tussi: et pone cibum eius illud quo lenitur natura eius: et non moueat caput suum dextra, neque sinistra omnino.	And at the completion of your work, let be prepared for the sick an uneven-made bed, in which he may sleep on his back in a dark house: and let be forbidden from all movements, and from coughing: and place before him food by which nature heals him: and let not move his head to the right, or at all to the left.
Et sit ligamentum secundum dispositionem suam usque ad diem tertium.	And let sit the ligature according to its position until the third day.
Deinde solue illud in illa domo tenebrosa, et experire uisum eius: et fac eum uidere res.	Then dissolve it in that dark house, and test his vision: and let him see objects.
Deinde reduc ligamentum usque ad diem septimum.	Then reduce the ligature until the seventh day.
Et non oportet ut faciat illud in hora curationis, aut post incisionem statim: imo oportet, ut alienes illud: propterea quod aqua ascendit uelociter per aspectum uehementem.	But it is not necessary that he do this at the time of healing, or immediately after the incision: but rather, let him keep it away: because water rises quickly through a steep aspect.
Si autem accidit apostema calidum: tunc oportet ut soluas oculum ante septimum: et rectifica illud cum eo quod sedat apostema, donec sedatur: tunc absolue ipsius uisum, et pone super faciem eius orale quo regatur uisus eius sub eo diebus aliquot, ipso existente in illa domo tenebrosa.	If, however, the apoplexy is hot: then it is necessary that you release the eye before the seventh; and correct it with that which is settled when the apoplexy is settled: then absolve his sight, and put over his face the oral part in which the sight of him under lies for a few days, while he remains in that dark house.
Deinde egrediatur a domo gradatim, et conuersetur in casis suis.	Then let him leave the house gradually, and turn round in his seats.
Et scias, quod in zaltea non excusatur discipulus a uisione aliquotiens: tunc enim audeat super operationem.	And know that the student is not excused from sight sometimes in the zalah: then let him dare to look at the operation.
Et iam quidem peruenit ad nos quidam ex illis qui sunt de Alayrach, qui dixit, quod factum fuit in Alayrach magdan perforatum, quo sugitur aqua.	And indeed one of those who are from Al-Ayrah has already come to us; he said that it was done in Al-Ayrah a hole made with the magdan by which water is sucked up.
Verum ergo non uidi aliquem in terra uostra, qui fecerit illud: neque legi illud in aliquo ex libris antiquorum: et est possibile, ut sit illud nouum.	But verily you will not see anyone on earth who did that: and it is not written about him in any of the old books: and it is possible that it should be new.
Et istae sunt formae specierum ex magda, ut stet super ea qui ea ignorat.	And these are the forms of the eyes from the magdan, so that they stand on her who does not know them.
Fiant ex aere proprie: et sint extremitates eorum cum hac eadem subtilitate triangulatae, et extremitas acuta.	Let them be made of pure brass: and let their ends be with this same subtle triangular shape, and the acute end.
Formae magda.	The forms of the magdan.
¶ De cura Carnis natae in naso.	Regarding the care of a birthmark on the nose.
Caput XXIIII.	Head 24th.
Quandoque nascuntur in naso Carnes diuersae additae, ex quibus est aliquid quod assimilatur scorpioni multorum pedum: et ex ea est caro cancerosa, lapidea, fusci coloris: et ex ea est quae est caro lenis, non fusci coloris.	When and what different meats are added to the nose, from which there is something that resembles a scorpion of many feet: and from it is that cancerous meat, stone-like in colour, which is soft; and from it is that flesh which is soft, not stone-like in colour.
In ea ergo quae ex istis carnibus est lenis, non fraudulenta, neque cancerosa, oportet ut facias sedere infirmum inter manus tuas oppositum soli, et aperi nares eius, et proiice uncinum in illas carnes: deinde trahe eas ad exteriora, et incide quod comprehendisti ex eis cum spatumili subtili acuto a parte una, donec scias quod caro tota iam ablata est.	In that which of these meats is soft, not deceitful, and not cancerous, you should make it sit between your hands opposite the sun, and open its nostrils, and throw in a hook made of thin sharp iron from one side; then pull it out to the outside, and cut off what you have caught with it by means of a fine sharp chisel: then draw it towards you, and see if all the meat has gone.
Quod si remaneret aliquid ex ea cuius abscisio non est possibilis: tunc rade illud cum uno instrumentorum subtilium cum facilitate, donec non remaneat ex eo aliquid.	If anything remains that cannot be cut off: then cut it with a slender instrument easily, until nothing remains of it.
Si autem sanguis tibi dominatur, aut accidat apostema calidum: tunc oppone ei per id quod oportet: aut est ex apostematibus malignis, tunc propera cauterizando eum, donec abscindatur sanguis, et auferantur omnes carnes.	But if blood rules over you, or a fever occurs: then oppose it with that which is necessary; or if it is a malignant abscess, then approach it by cauterizing it, until the blood is cut off and all the flesh is taken away.
Deinde proiiciatur in nasum post incisionem acetum, et aqua, aut uinum.	Then let it be poured into the nose after an incision with vinegar, and water, or wine.
Si autem aperitur nasus, et procedat ex eo humiditas usque ad palatum, tunc scias quia iam sanus est.	But if the nose is opened, and moisture proceeds from it to the palate, then you should know that he is already well.
Si uero non penetrat humiditas, secundum quod oportet, tunc scias quod intra ipsum est caro nata in superioribus ossibus naris, ad quae non peruenit cum incisione instrumentum.	But if the moisture does not penetrate as it should, then you should know that within himself there is a birth in the upper bones of the nose, to which the knife does not reach with the incision.
Tunc ergo oportet, ut intromittas filum lini cui sit quaedam grossitudo, et noda in eo nodos multos: et pone inter omnem nodum quantitatem digiti, aut minus: et ingeniet infirmus, ut mittat extremitatem unam fili in nasum cum radio, aut cum quo possibile est ei postquam fecerit ipsum simile azer: et trahat odoratum suum, donec perueniat usque ad caassum, et egrediatur super guttur suum.	Then it is necessary that you introduce a thread of linen, of which there is some grossness, and spots in it many: and place between each spot the amount of a finger, or less: and he will be relieved, so that he lets one end of the thread into his nose with a ray, or with whatever is possible for him after he has done himself similar azur: and he should carry his odor, until it reaches as far as his throat, and he should come out onto his throat.
Et multotiens quidem faciunt simile huic Attomi pueri in scholis: et est res facilis ei, qui uult.	And often indeed do this boys like this in school: and it is a simple thing for him who wants to.
Deinde pone duas extremitates fili, extremitatem unam quae egreditur super nasum, et alteram quae remansit in naso.	Then place the two ends of the thread, the end that comes out onto the nose, and the other that remains in the nose.
Deinde ac ministra serraturam carnis cum nodis qui sunt in filo.	Then also close the opening of the skin with the thread.
Fac illud donec scias quod carnes iam sunt cum nodis fili.	Let him be until you know that the flesh is already there with the spots on the thread.
Deinde extrahe filum: et pone in nasum post abstersionem sanguinis licinium quod imbibisti in unguento aegyptio: fac illud tribus diebus, aut plus, donec unguentum corrodat totum quod remansit ex carnibus.	Then pull out the thread: and put into the nose after drying up of the blood a liquid that you soaked in Egyptian ointment: let him be for three days, or more, until the ointment eats away all that remains of the flesh.
Deinde pone in fine rei in nasum cannulam de plumbo, diebus aliquot, donec sanetur.	Then put in the end of the nose a canula of lead, for several days until it heals.
Si autem indiget curatione quae exiccet, utere illa.	If it needs more cure than to dry it up, use that.
Ad caputpurgium faciendum, cum quo distillantur olea, et aliae medicinae in nasum, fac illud ex argento, aut aere: quod sit simile lampadi paruae, apertum sicut conchula: et meatus eius similiter.	For making the lavage, when it is distilled with oil and other medicines to the nose, make it of silver or brass: that it be like a little lamp, open-ended like a seashell: and its bore also.
Et si uis fac cannulam clausam, sicut canna.	And if you want to make a closed canula, like a reed.
Et conchula instrumenti ad caputpurgium faciendum, sit plena, detecta: cui sit manubrium in postremo eius, cum quo teneas ipsam, quando calefacis in ea oleum, aut quod uis ex succis, et rebus fluxibilibus.	And the shell of the instrument for making the lavage be full, fixed: which has a handle at the end, so that you hold it when you heat it with oil, or what you want to use and liquid things.
Et haec est forma instrumenti.	And this is the shape of the instrument.
¶ De cura Thelul nasi.	On the cure for the nose.
Caput XXV.	Head 25.
Multotiens nascitur in extremitate nasi Thelul, et magnificatur, et augmentatur cum diebus, donec foedus fit aspectus eius.	The Thelul of the nose often begins at the end and grows larger, and increases in appearance over several days until it appears like a festering wound.
Et propter illud oportet, ut in cidas illud in principio apparitionis eius, et eradices totum eius.	And because of that, you should cut off all of its growth at the beginning of its appearance, and scrape it out completely.
Deinde pone super locum, aut cauterium, aut medicinam comburentem quae stat loco eius.	Then put over the place, or cautery, or burning medicine that stays in its place.
Si ergo tardatur incisio eius, donec magnificetur, tunc considera, si est lapideum, durum, fusci coloris, pauci sensus: tunc non tangas ipsum cum ferro: quoniam apostema est cancerosum.	If the cutting then lags behind until it grows larger, then examine it, if it is hard and has a dull color and few senses: then do not touch it with iron: because it is a cancerous growth.
Multotiens enim uidi, qui incidit hmoni apostema, et accidit ex eo malicia magna super illum qui ipsum habebat.	For often the eye that has cut into a person's head develops a large, evil growth on top of it from which bad things arise.
Et si apostema est lenis tactus, non fusci coloris, et uides quod incisio possibilis est in toto eius, tunc euacua infirmum, et incide ipsum sine timore, absque pauore: et cura locum cum eo quod exiccat et constringit, donec sanetur.	And if the growth is soft to the touch and not dull in color, and you see that the cutting may have reached its whole extent, then wash it with water that is cool and cut the person without fear or trepidation: and heal the place along with it by drying it up and constricting it, until it heals over.
¶ De sutura nasi, et labii, et auris.	On sewing up the nose, mouth, and ears.
Caput XXVI.	Head and neck.
Scias Quia quando accidit solutio continuitatis in una harum cartilaginum, parum confert in ea operatio, nisi in quibusdam hominibus.	For when a break in the continuity of one of these cartilage pieces occurs, little operation is effective on it, except in some men.
Oportet ergo quando accidit alicui aliquid ex illo, ut consideres, si est uulnus recens cum sanguine suo: et tunc aggrega duolabia uulneris cum sutura: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	It is necessary, therefore, when it has happened to anyone of these things, as you should consider if the bone is recent with its blood: and then gather the pain of the wound with a suture: then take care of it, until it heals.
Et si solutionis continuitatis labia iam separata sunt, et facta est unaquaeque pars sana: tunc oportet ut excories omnem partem a cute sua apparente, donec sanguinetur.	And if the continuity of the solution has already separated the lips, and some healthy part has been made: then it is necessary that you remove all of its own skin, until it bleeds.
Deinde aggrega duo labia cum sutura, et stringe ea, et pulueriza super ipsum sanguinem draconis, et olibanum trita: et pone supra pulueres frustum emplastri diafinicon, et alicuius alterius ex emplastris consolidatiuis: et dimitte ipsum ligatum duobus diebus, aut tribus.	Then gather the two lips with a suture, and tie them tightly, and powder them over the wound with dragon's blood, and olive oil, ground: and put over the powders a fragment of a plaster of diafinicon, and some other of a consolidated plaster: and leave it tied for two days, or three.
Deinde solue ipsum, et permuta medicinam: et dimitte ipsum, donec abscindantur fila per se.	Then dissolve it, and change the medicine: and leave it, until the threads separate by themselves.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then take care of the wound with ointment, until it heals.
Modus autem suturae est, ut aggreges solutionem continuitatis, aut cum acubus, sicut narrauimus in sutura uentris: aut aggrega solutionem cum filo, sicut feci te scire.	But the method of the suture is, to gather the solution of continuity, or with the knuckles, as we have told you about the suture of the foot: or to gather the solution with a thread, as I have made you aware.
¶ De extractione nodorum labiorum.	The extraction of nodules from the lips.
Caput XXVII.	Head and neck.
Multis Quidem hominibus accidunt plaerumque in interioribus labiorum suorum apostemata dura similia granis herbi: et quaedam eorum minora, et maiora.	In fact, it happens to many men, and especially in the inner lips there are similar hard little lumps of herbs: and some smaller, and some larger.
Ergo oportet ut conuertas labium, et findas super omnem nodum eius, et suspendas ipsum cum uncino, et incidas ipsum ab omni parte.	Therefore it is necessary that you open the lips, and find out on every lump, and hang it up with a hook, and drop it from all sides.
Deinde impleas locum post incisionem zegi trito, donec abscindatur sanguis.	Then fill the place after cutting dry, ground, until the blood dries.
Deinde colluatur cum aceto, et curetur locus cum eo, in quo est stipticitas, usquequo sanentur uulnera.	Then clean it with vinegar, and take care of the place with it, where there is a stinging sensation, until the wounds heal.
¶ De incisione carnis natae super gingiuam.	Of the incision of flesh that has grown on the gums.
Caput XXVIII.	De incisione carnis natae super gingiuam.
Multotiens nascitur super gingiuam caro addiat, quam antiqui nominant abuluss.	Often a sore grows on the gums, which the ancients called abluss.
Oportet ergo ut suspendas eam cum uncino: aut teneas eam cum forcipibus, et incidas eam apud radicem suam, et dimittas saniem currere, aut sanguinem.	It is necessary that you should hang it by a hook: or hold it with tongs and cut it close to its root, and allow the wound to discharge its pus or blood.
Deinde pone super locum zegi tritum, aut alios pulueres stipticos, exiccatiuos.	Then put on a place of poultice of ground pepper, or other astringent powders, drying agents.
Quod si redit illa caro post curationem, nam multotiens redit, tunc incide eam secundo, et cauteriza ipsam: ipsa namque non redit post cauterium.	That if that sore returns after treatment, for often it does return, then cut it again and causticate it: for this does not return after the cauterisation.
¶ De rasione Dentium cum ferro.	As regards shaving the teeth with iron.
Caput XXIX.	De rasione dentium cum ferro.
Quandoque aggregantur in superficiebus Dentium ab interiori et extetiori parte, et inter gingiuas cortices asperi, turpes, et quandoque denigrantur, et citrini fiunt, et uirides, donec peruenit ex illo corruptio ad gingiuam, et foedi fiunt dentes per illud.	When they have gathered on the surface of the teeth from within and from outside, and between the gums are rough, knots, and sometimes corroding them, and becoming yellow, and white, until the corruption reaches the gums, and the teeth are decayed by it.
Oportet ergo ut facias sedere infirmum inter manus tuas, et caput eius in sinu tuo, et rade molam et dentem, in quo apparent tibi cortices, et res similis arenae: donec non remaneat ex eis aliquid, et similiter fac de nigredine, et uiriditate, et citrinitate, et aliis donec mundentur.	It is necessary that you should put the sick person between your hands, and his head in your lap, and shave off the rotten molars and teeth on which you see the gums, and similar ground powder: until there remains nothing of it, and likewise do with the blackness, rustiness, yellowness, and other discolourations, until they are cleansed.
Si ergo auferatur quod in eis est a principio rasionis, bonum est: et si non, tunc itera super eos rasionem die alio, secundo, et tertio, donec ad ultimum perueniat studium in eo quod uis.	If then what is removed from them at the beginning of the shaving is good: and if not, then repeat the shaving another day, and a third time, until you have come to the last study in it that you wish.
Et scias, quod dens indiget rasoriis diuersarum formarum, multarum figurarum: secundum quod praeparatur operationi tuae: proptera, quod rasorium quo raditur dens ab inferiori parte, est aliud a rasorio quo raditur inter dentes, secundum formas alias.	And know that the teeth respond to various shapes of blades: and also, as regards preparing your operation, this blade with which you cut from below is different from the blade which cuts between the teeth, according to their shapes.
Et istae formae rasoriorum sint apud te praeparatae, quas uides.	And these forms of blades are prepared for you, which you will see.
¶ De extractione doloris Dentium.	On the extraction of toothache.
Caput XXX.	Chapter 30.
Oportet ut cures Dentem a dolore suo cum omni ingenio, et tardes in eradicatione eius.	It is necessary that he who seeks to extract a tooth should be very careful and diligent in its extraction and late in its eradication.
Non est enim quod uicem eius suppleat quando eradicatur: quoniam est substantia sublimis: donec quando non est excusatio de eradicatione eius, tunc oportet quando cogitur infirmus eradicare ipsum, ut firmetur, et certificetur apud te dens dolens.	For the tooth cannot be made to yield when it is eradicated: since the substance is soft; until, indeed, there is no excuse for its eradication, then let him who seeks to extract a tooth when he is ill consider eradicating it so that it hardens, and certify with you, the toothache.
Multotiens enim decipit infirmum dolor, et putat quia est in dente saha et eradicat ipsum: deinde non recedit dolor, donec eradicetur dens infirmus.	Often the illness deceives the sick person and he supposes that the pain is in the tooth and eradicates it himself: then the pain does not retreat until the tooth is eradicated.
Nos enim iam uidimus illud ex operatione phlebotomatorum.	For we have already seen from the operation of bleeding.
Cum ergo certificatur apud te dens dolens ipsemet, tunc oportet ut scarifices in circumitu dentis cum spatumili, in quo sit quiddam uirtutis, donec soluatur gingiua ab omni parte: deinde moue ipsum digitis tuis, aut cum forcipibus subtilibus in primis paulatim, donec concutias ipsum.	Then, when the toothache is certified with you, let him who seeks to extract it scrape around the tooth with a file, in which there is some virtue, until it has healed the gum entirely: then, with your fingers or with delicate forceps little by little, until you have struck it.
Deinde loca tunc in eo forcipes magnos locatione bona, et caput infirmi inter genua tua: quod iam bene tenuisti, ita quod non moueatur: deinde trahe dentem secundum rectitudinem, ut non frangas ipsum.	Then, when the place is good and you have located it well, and your head is between your knees, which you hold firmly so that it does not move: then, with a firm grip, draw out the tooth according to its straight line, so as not to break it.
Si ergo non egreditur, tunc accipe aliquod illorum instrumentorum, et intromitte ipsum sub eo ab omni parte cum facilitate, et conare motionem eius, sicut fecisti in primis.	If then it does not come out, then take one of these instruments and push it under it from all sides with ease, and try to move it, as you did at first.
Si autem dens est perforatus, aut corrosus: tunc oportet ut impleas illud foramen panno: et stringas ipsum cum extremitate radii subtilis, ut non frangatur in hora constrictionis tuae super ipsum cum forcipibus.	If then the tooth is pierced or corroded: then it is necessary to fill the cavity with cloth: and you should hold it tight with a narrow forceps so that it does not break at the time of your constriction on it with the forceps.
Et oportet, ut exquisite agas cum scarificatione in circumitu gingiuae ab omni parte multum.	And it is necessary, that you should carefully examine with scraping around the gum entirely.
Et custodi fortitudinem tuam, ut non frangas ipsum, et remaneat pars eius, et redeat super infirmum ex ea malicia quae sit maior dolore eius primo.	And keep your strength, so that you do not break it and a part of it remains, and returns to the sick one from that evil which causes him greater pain first.
Et caue, ne facias illud quod ignorantes faciunt phlebotomatores in festinatione sua, et audacia ipsorum super eradicationem eius, praeter quod administrent illud quod narrauimus.	And for that reason, do not do what the phlebotomators do when they are in a hurry and their boldness overcomes them in eradicating it, except that they administer it which we have said.
Multotiens enim faciunt euenire super homines infirmitates magnas, quarum difficiliores sunt ut frangantur, et remaneant radices eius omnes, aut quaedam earum: aut ut extrahant ipsum cum quibusdam ossibus mandibulae: sicut testificati sumus multotiens illud.	For this reason, repeatedly they bring about great illnesses in men, which are more difficult to break than to heal and leave all the roots of it or some of its parts; or take it out with some of the bones of the jaw: as we have been told many times that thing.
Deinde colluatur post eradicationem eius cum uino, aut cum aceto et sale.	Then they wash it after eradicating it with wine, or with vinegar and salt.
Quod si accidat fluxus sanguinis ex locis (multotiens enim accidit) tunc tere aliquid ex zegi, et imple cum eo locum: et si non, cauteriza ipsum si non confert tibi zegi.	That if it should happen that the flow of blood comes from the places (for it often happens) then dry up a little of the wound, and fill it with it: and if not, cauterize it, if it does not give you any relief.
Formae forcipum subtilium quibus mouetur dens in primis, sint longarum extremitatum, breuis manubrii, grossi, ut non duplicentur quando cum eis premitur super dentem: sint sicut uides grossorum manubriorum, donec quando stringis cum eis, non dent seipsas, neque duplicentur: breuium extremitatum, et sint ex ferro indo, aut ex faled decenter facti, directarum extremitatum: et in eorum extremitatibus sint dentes, quorum quidam ingrediantur in quosdam, et stringant constrictione decenti, forti.	The shapes of the forceps which move with subtlety in the first place are long at their ends, short in the handle, thick so that they do not double when pressed against the tooth: they are like the thick handles which you see, until when you press them together they do not bite into themselves, nor double; and the shorter ends, and they are made of iron ingot or a twisted bar of iron, straightened out: and in their ends there are teeth, some of which enter into some things, and by constricting them tightly, they hold fast with force.
Et quandoque fiunt extremitates sicut forma oris auis quae nominatur ciconia, et sunt fortis constrictionis.	And when the ends become like the shape of an ear which is called a ciconia, and are strong constriction:
¶ De eradicatione Dentium, et extractione ossium mandibularum fractorum.	of the eradication of teeth and extraction of fractures of the mandible bones.
Caput XXXI.	Chapter 31.
Quando remanet apud eradicationem Dentis qui frangitur aliquid, tunc oportet ut ponas super locum cotum cum butyro die uno, aut duobus diebus, donec mollificetur locus: deinde intromitte ad ipsum algasti, aut forcipes: quorum extremitates assimilantur ori auis quae nominatur ciconia.	When a tooth that is broken remains after eradication, then you should place it on the cot with butter for one or two days, until it softens: and then introduce into it the gouge or the forceps; whose ends are like an ear which is called a ciconia.
Forma autem haec est forcipum.	The shape of this forceps is.
Sint extremitates eorum factae sicut lima deintus: aut sicut aliskilfegi.	Make the ends smooth like a file: or like an awl.
Si ergo non obedit tibi ad exitum cum istis forcipibus, tunc oportet, ut caues super radicem, et detegas carnem totam, et intromittas instrumentum quod nominatur Palanca parua, cuius forma est haec.	But if he does not yield to you at the exit with these pincers, then you should cut off the root, and peel off all the flesh, and insert the instrument which is called a small palanquin, whose shape is this.
Sit breuis extremitatis, grossae parumper: et non sit imbibitum, ut non frangatur.	The short end should be slightly thicker; and it should not be wet, lest it break.
Si ergo egreditur radix per illud, est bonum: et si non, iuuare oportet cum istis instrumentis aliis quorum formae sunt istae.	But if the root comes out by means of that, it is good; and if not, you should help with these other instruments whose shapes are these.
Forma primi triangulatae extremitatis, in qua est quaedam grossitudo.	The shape of the first triangular end, in which there is some thickness.
Forma triangulatae extremitatis subtilis.	The shape of the second triangular end, which is thinner.
Etiam iuuatur cum hoc instrumento habente duos ramos, cuius haec est forma.	Also help with this instrument having two branches, whose shape is this.
Et cum aliis instrumentis et ferramentis quae praecesserunt in rasione dentium.	And with the other instruments and tools which have gone before in the description of the teeth.
Etiam sit iuuamentum cum hoc instrumento quod assimilatur uncino magno, huius formae, triangulatae extremitatis tortae, in qua est quiddam grossitudinis, ut non frangatur: et sit non imbibitum.	Also help with this instrument which is like a large hook, of the shape of the second triangular end, twisted, in which there is some thickness so that it does not break; and let it not be wet.
Et scias, quod instrumenta dentium sunt multa: et similiter reliqua instrumenta non computantur, et artifex prudens, subtilis in arte sua inuenit per se ipsum instrumentum, secundum quod significant ei operatio et aegritudines ipsae.	And know that there are many instruments for the teeth; and likewise the other instruments do not count; and the prudent artisan finds out by himself the instrument, according to which it is necessary for him to operate and to cure his own ailments.
Quoniam ex agritudinibus sunt ad quas non dixerunt antiqui instrumentum, propter diuersitatem specierum earum.	For from the diseases of the teeth, there are instruments which the ancient ones did not describe, because of the diversity of their forms.
Si autem frangatur os ex mandibula, aut ex aliis ossibus oris, aut putrefit: tunc perscrutare super ipsum in loco suo cum eo quod conuenit ei ex instrumentis et forcipibus quae dixi in extractione radicum, et iuuare cum gesti, cuius forma est haec.	But if the jaw is broken by the molar, or by any other bone of the mouth, then examine it carefully in its place with what belongs to it from the instruments and pincers which I have described for extracting the root, and help with these gestures, whose shape is this.
Sit in eo quiddam grossitudinis paulatim, ut stringatur, uel teneatur cum eo os, et non fugiat et uadat, donec egrediatur os: et restaura locum cum medicinis conuenientibus ad illud.	Let it be slightly thicker so that it holds together, or let it be held with the jaw, and do not let it move or vibrate until the jaw comes out; and restore its place with the suitable medicines for it.
Si autem in osse est putredo parua, tunc rade ipsum a putredine sua, et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	If there is putrid pus in bone then scrape it off and cure it until sound.
De serratura Dentium eminentium super alios.	On the removal of the teeth from the jaw-bone.
Caput XXXII.	Of the dismembering of a tooth from the jaw-bone.
Quando Dentes eminent non secundum cursum suum naturalem, foeda fit per illud forma: et praecipue quando accidit illud in mulieribus, et puellis, scilicet uenalibus.	When teeth become dislocated from their natural course, they get foul through the shape of the jaw, especially when it happens to women and girls, that is to say, young.
Oportet ergo ut consideres.	It is necessary for you to consider.
Nam si dens est natus post dentem alium, et non locatur, uel est possibilis eius serratura, neque limatura ipsius: tunc eradica ipsum: et si est annexus cum dente alio, tunc incide ipsum cum isto instrumento, cuius haec est forma.	For if one tooth has come after another, and does not fit into its place, or is possible to open it with a file, then scrape it out: and if it is joined with another tooth, then cut it out with this instrument, of which the following is the form.
Est simile rostro paruo, et fit ex ferro indo, acutae extremitatis ualde.	It is like a little chisel, made of iron, with a sharp end.
Et sit incisio tua qua ipsum incidis in diebus multis, et propter duriciem dentis, et ut non commoueatur alius ex dentibus.	And your cut should be deep so that it can go through the bone, and for the hardness of the tooth, and so that another tooth does not move.
Si autem est eminens expositus limaturae suae: tunc lima ipsum cum lima ex indo, cuius forma est haec.	If it is exposed by the wear of its own file: then scrape it with a file made of iron, of which the following is the form.
Sit totum ex indo, et manubrium eius minutorum punctorum ualdae, sicut lima cum qua fiunt acus: cum quo limetur dens paulatim in diebus multis cum facilitate, ut non commoueatur dens, et cadat: deinde leni ipsum, in fine rade ipsum cum quibusdam rasoriis.	It should all be made of iron, and its little end pointed with the point of an awl, like a file with which nails are made: and with this the tooth is scraped little by little over several days with ease, so that another tooth does not move, and it falls off: then it is to be smoothed, in the end, scraped with some rasps.
Quod si est dens, ex quo frangatur pars, et laedit linguam: tunc oportet ut limes eum etiam, donec auferatur asperitas illius fractionis, et aequetur: et applanetur, et non laedat linguam, neque corrumpat sermonem.	If it is a tooth that breaks off a piece and hurts the tongue: then you must also smooth out this piece, until its roughness has gone, and make it even: and it should be smoothed, so as not to hurt the tongue, or damage the speech.
¶ De retatione Dentium cum filis auri.	Of the retaining of teeth when they are decayed with gold.
Caput XXXIII.	Chapter 33: Of the extraction of teeth when they are decay
Quando accidit Dentibus anterioribus concussio et commotio a percussione, aut casu: et non potest infirmus stringere super illud quod comedit ut non cadat: et curasti eos cum medicinis stipticis, et non ualuit curatio: tunc ingenium in eis est, ut stringantur cum filo auri: quoniam argentum fit uiride, et putrefit post dies: sed aurum nunquam mutatur.	When the anterior teeth have a shock or movement by reason of a blow, or accident: and cannot hold firm on them, and they do not taste good after the use of medicines for their relief, then it is clever in them to fasten them with gold wire: because silver becomes yellow, and decayed after a few days: but gold does not change.
Et sit filum medium in subtilitate et grossicie secundum quantitatem quod capiat inter Dentes.	And let there be a thread medium in fineness and coarseness according to the quantity that it takes between teeth.
Et forma quidem retationis est, ut accipias filum, et intromittas duplum eius inter duos dentes sanos: deinde texeas cum duabus extremitatibus fili inter dentes motos, siue unus sit, aut plures, donec peruenias cum tela usque ad dentem sanum alterius partis.	And the shape of the retention is so that you take the thread and insert it twice its length between two healthy teeth: then you knit it with its two extremities in a thread between the teeth of both parts until you reach the other healthy tooth.
Deinde itera texturam usque ad partem a qua incaepisti: et stringe manum tuam cum subtilitate et sapientia, donec non remoueatur prorsus: et sit constrictio tua qua stringis filum, apud radices dentium, ut non euadat.	Then repeat the texture until you reach the side from which you began: and tightly with subtlety and wisdom, until it does not move completely: and let your constriction be where you tighten the thread, near the roots of the teeth, so that it does not move.
Deinde incide extremitates fili superfluentes cum forficibus: et aggrega utrumque, et conuerte eas cum gesti: et occulta ipsas inter dentem sanum et dentem motum, ut non laedat linguam: deinde dimittatur ita strictum dum remanet.	Then cut off the excess ends of the thread with the pincer: and gather both sides, and turn them towards each other: and hide them between the healthy tooth and the moted one so that they do not hurt the tongue: then let it be loosened in such a way that there is left only a small amount.
Si autem soluitur, aut inciditur, stringe eos cum filo alio, et stabit cum eo taliter tempore toto.	If however it loosens or cuts, tighten them with another thread and let it stand with it in such a way for a whole time.
Et haec est forma Dentium, et figura retationis duorum dentium sanorum, et duorum dentium motorum, sicut uides.	And this is the form of the teeth, and the shape of the retention of two healthy teeth and two moted teeth as you see them.
Et quandoque fit, ut redeat dens unus, aut duo post casum urriusque in locis suis, et retentur sicut narrauimus, et remaneant: et non facit illud nisi artifex, prudens, et expertus.	And sometimes, when one tooth falls and heals again in its place, and the retainers remain as we have described, and do not hurt it - this is done only by a skilled, prudent, and experienced artisan.
Et quandoque aptatur aliquod ex ossibus uaccinis: et fit ex eo sicut forma dentis, et ponitur in loco, ex quo munitur dens et stringitur, sicut diximus: et remanet, et seruitur cum eo tempore longo.	And sometimes a bone is broken by a jab: and it is made like the form of a tooth, and put in place, from which it is protected and tightened, as we have said: and remains, and stays with it for a long time.
¶ De incisione ligamenti quod accidit sub lingua, et prohibet loquelam.	Regarding the incision of the ligament that happens under the tongue, and prevents one from talking.
Caput XXXIIII.	Head 34.
Quandoque ligamentum hoc quod accidit sub lingua, est aut naturale, cum quo nascitur homo, aut accidentale, a uulnere quod iam consolidatum est.	Sometimes this ligament that happens under the tongue is either natural with which man is born, or accidental due to an arrow that has already healed.
Et operatio in eo est, ut aperias os infirmi in capite eius in sinu tuo, et eleua linguam eius: deinde incide illud ligamentum neruosum per latitudinem, donec soluatur lingua a retentione sua.	And the operation is, so that you open the mouth of the patient on his head in your bosom, and relieve his tongue: then cut this neural ligament across its width, until the tongue is released from its retention.
Quod si in eo fuerit quiddam duriciei et nodationis, et fuerit illud ex consolidatione uulneris: tunc proiice in illud uncinum, et finde illud per latitudinem, donec incidas ligamentum, et soluatur nodatio.	If there is something hard and rigid in it and it is a result of injury and the wound is healed: then insert a hook into it and cut across its width until you reach the ligament, and release the rigidity.
Et caue, ne sit fissura in profundo carnis, et incidas arteriam illic, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	And do not make a cut at the bottom of the flesh, and do not cut an artery there, and do not cause blood to flow.
Deinde colluatur in uestigio incisionis cum aqua rosata, aut cum aceto, aut aqua frigida.	Then wash the incision with pink water or vinegar or cold water.
Deinde pone sub lingua licinium ex lino, quod teneat infirmus in omni nocte: ut non consolidetur secundo.	Then place under the tongue a lymph from linen, which holds the sick one every night: so that it does not become consolidated again.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis, tunc pone super locum zegi tritum.	But if there is blood flow, then place on the spot a lump of dried clay.
Si uero uincit te sanguis, tunc cauteriza locum cum cauterio lentiginoso, quod conuenit ad illud: deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	But if you are pricked by blood, then cauterize the spot with a burning coals, which suits it: then take care of yourself with the rest of the cure, until it heals.
¶ De extractione Ranulae quae fit sub lingua.	The Extraction of a Wound That Occurs Under the Tongue
Caput XXXV.	Head XXXV
Quandoque accidit sub lingua apostema quod assimilatur Ranae paruae, prohibens linguam ab operatione sua naturali: et fortasse magnificatur adeo, donec implet os.	When a little pustule forms under the tongue that absorbs the small wound, preventing the tongue from its natural function: and perhaps it increases so much, until the bone is filled up.
Et operatio in eo est, ut aperias os infirmi coram sole: et considera apostema.	And the operation is, to open the jaw without pain by the sun: and consider the pustule.
Si ergo uides ipsum fusci coloris, aut nigri, durum, cui non inuenit infirmus sensum: tunc non tangas ipsum, quoniam est cancer.	But if you see that the color of it is dark or black, and hard, and the sick person does not have a feeling: then do not touch it, for it is cancer.
Et si est decliue ad albedinem, in quo est humiditas, tunc proiice in ipsum uncinum, et incide ipsum cum spatumili subtili, et libera ipsum ab omni parte.	And if it declines to whiteness, in which there is moisture, then insert into it a hook, and cut it with a very fine scalpel, and free it from all parts.
Quod si uincit te sanguis in hora tuae operationis, tunc pone super ipsum zegi tritum, donec abscindatur sanguis: deinde redi ad operationem tuam, donec extrahas ipsum cum complemento eius.	If you are pricked by blood during your operation, then place on the spot a lump of dried clay, until the blood stops: and then resume your operation, taking off the skin with its appendages.
Deinde colluatur cum aceto et sale: et cura ipsum reliqua curatione conueniente ad illud, donec sanetur.	Then wash with vinegar and salt: and care for that wound with suitable cure until it heals.
¶ De curatione apostematis duarum Amigdalarum.	¶ On the treatment of abscesses of the two amygdaloids.
Caput XXXVI.	Chapter 36. On the treatment of abscesses of the two
Quandoque accidunt inter guttur godad, id est, glandulae, quae similantur algodad, quae accidunt deforis: et nominantur duae Amigdalae: quas quando curas cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et non sanantur, tunc considera.	When abscesses occur between the tonsils, that is, glands which resemble abscesses and occur in the jaw: they are called the two amygdaloids; when treated as described in the division, and yet do not heal, then consider.
Si ergo est apostema durum, fusci coloris, pauci sensus: tunc non tangas ipsum cum ferro.	If then there is an abscess that is hard, of a pale colour, with little sensation: then do not touch the abscess with iron.
Et si est rubei coloris, et radix eius est grossa: tunc non tangas ipsum etiam cum ferro, timens fluxum sanguinis, imo dimitte ipsum, donec maturetur.	And if it is of a red colour, and the root is thick: then do not touch it with iron, fearing that there will be a flow of blood; but leave it, until it has grown dry.
Et tunc aut perforabis ipsum: aut rumpetur per se.	And then either you pierce it: or it will burst of itself.
Et si est albi coloris, rotundum, et est radix eius subtilis: tunc oportet ipsum incidi.	And if it is of a white colour, round, and its root is thin: then the wound should be allowed to bleed.
Et operatio in ipso est, ut consideres ante operationem suam, si quieuit apostema eius calidum quiete completum, aut imminuitur quadam diminutione: tunc ergo fac sedere infirmum coram sole, et caput eius sit in sinu tuo: et aperi os eius, et accipiat seruiens inter manus suas, et premat linguam eius inferius cum instrumento, cuius haec est forma.	And the operation on it is such, that you should consider before the operation itself, if its abscess is hot, and has become quiet and complete, or is somehow imminent: then therefore make the person sit in front of the sun, and place his head in your lap: and open the mouth, and let him take hold of the tongue from below with an instrument, which has this form.
Fiat ex argento, aut aere, quod sit subtile sicut cultellus.	Let it be made of silver, or of brass, that it is fine like a knife.
Cum ergo premis cum eo linguam, et ostenditur tibi apostema, et cadit super ipsum uisus tuus: tunc accipe uncinum, et fige ipsum in amigdalam, et extrahe eam ad exteriora quantum potes, praeter quod trahas cum ea aliquid ex tunicis.	When then you press with it on the tongue, and it shows itself to you, falling on your side: then take a hook, and fasten it in the amygdaloid, and pull it out as far as you can, pulling off some of the skin with it.
Deinde incide eam cum instrumento, cuius haec est forma quae sequitur.	Then cut it with an instrument, which has this form following.
Assimilatur forficibus: uerumtamen extremitates eius sint curuatae, ita quod orificium cuiusque earum est in directo alterius acute: unde cura ut sit ex ferro indo, aut alfuled imbibitum.	It is joined with ligatures: however, its ends are curled up, so that the opening of each of them is on the acute side of the other: wherefore it should be so made of iron, or of a felled skin, that it may absorb.
Si autem non est praesens hoc instrumentum, tunc incide ipsum cum spatumili, cuius haec est forma.	If it is not present this instrument, then cut it with a chisel, whose this is the shape.
Sit acutum a parte una, non acutum a parte altera.	Let it be sharp on one part, not sharp on the other.
Et postquam incidis amigdalam unam, incide alteram secundum hanc eandem speciem incisionis.	And having cut one side of the amigdalon, cut the other second to this same form of incision.
Deinde post incisionem gargarizet infirmus cum aqua frigida, aut cum aceto et aqua.	Then after the incision gargle the sick with cold water, or with vinegar and water.
Si autem accidat ei fluxus sanguinis, gargarizet cum aqua in qua bulliti sunt cortices granatorum: aut folia myrti, et similia illis ex stipticis, donec abscindatur fluxus sanguinis: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	But if it happens that there is a flow of blood, gargle with water in which the skins of apples are boiled: or leaves of myrtle, and such like from stypics, until the flow of blood has stopped: then take care of the wound, until it heals.
Et quandoque nascuntur in gutture apostemata alia, praeter amigdalas duas.	And when ever there arise in the throat lumps, except two amigdalons.
Incide ergo ea secundum quod dixi in incisione duarum amigdalarum aequaliter.	Then cut them as I said above for the cutting of the two amigdalons.
Et ego quidem iam medicatus fui mulierem ex apostemate, quod natum erat inter guttur eius, quod trahebat ad fuscedinem, pauci sensus, quod iam fere clauserat guttur: et mulier respirabat a meatu stricto, et iam prohibuerat ei comestionem, et potum aquae: et iam peruenerat ad mortem, si remansisset uno die, aut duobus diebus.	And I too have already treated a woman from an apostematous lump that was born between her throat and which she would put out into froth, little feeling, which had almost closed up her throat: and the woman breathed through my mouth, and had stopped eating, drinking water, and had come close to death, if it had remained one day, or two days.
Et apostema tantum ascenderat, quod emiserat duos ramos, donec exierant super duo foramina nasi.	And the lump had risen so much that it had thrown up two sprigs, until they had come out at two holes in the nose.
Properaui ergo festinanter, et fixi in unum eorum uncinum.	So I ran faster, and fixed my hook into one of them.
Deinde traxi ipsum, et tracta ex eo est portio magna.	Then I pulled it out, and a big piece came out with it.
Deinde abscidi eam, ubi comprehendi ex foramine nasi.	Then I cut it off where it was caught in the hole of the nose.
Deinde feci illud ei quod processit ex foramine nasi altero.	Then I made it come out of the other hole of the nose.
Deinde aperui os eius, et pressi linguam eius: et postea fixi uncinum in ipsum apostema: deinde abscidi ex eo partem eius, et non cucurrit ex eo nisi sanguis paucus: absolutum est ergo guttur mulieris, et incepit statim bibere aquam, deinde accepit ex cibo.	Then I opened her mouth, and pressed her tongue: and then I fixed my hook into it: then cut off a part of it, and there was not much blood coming out: so the woman's throat is entirely stopped, and she began to drink water right away, and then took food to eat.
Non ergo cessaui incidere ex illo apostemate multotiens tempore longo: et apostema succedebat loco eius quod incidebam, donec prolongatum est nimis et cum ea illud.	Therefore I have ceased to strike at that place for a long time; and the scar which I struck has given way to another, until it was too late and was joined to that one.
Ingeniaui ergo, et cauterizaui apostema inter guttur.	I therefore used cautery on the scar between the teeth.
Stetit ergo ab additione: deinde ambulaui a parte, et non sciui quid fecit Deus cum ea post me.	So it stood firm from the addition; then I walked away from that part, and did not know what God did with it after me.
¶ De incisione apostematis uuulae.	On the scar of the wound on the mouth.
Caput XXXVII.	Chapter 37 (head)
Quando descendit catarrus ad uuulam, et apostematur, et est long: tunc ipsa nominatur perpendicularis: et si est in inferiori parte grossa, rotunda, tunc ipsa nominatur uua.	When the discharge comes down to the lip, and is scarred, and is long; then it is called a vertical scar; and if it is on the lower part and thick, round, then it is called a mole.
Quando curatur cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio: et uides quod apostema calidum quieuit ab ea, et est subtilis: tunc oportet ut incidas eam.	When cauterizing with it as we have said in the division, and the cure does not manifest itself; and you see that the scar has become cold from it, and is thin; then you should strike at it.
Et quae ex ea est aggregata rotunda, et non est ei longitudo, et est sanguinea, aut fusci coloris, aut nigri, et non est ei sensus: tunc oportet ut deuites incisionem eius.	And what is joined to it that is round and has no length, and is bloody or dark-colored or black, and has no feeling; then you should strike off its scar.
In ea enim est timor super infirmum.	For fear is in the scar on the sick.
Oportet ergo quando uides eam secundum modum quem dixi ex albedine, et longitudine sua, ut facias sedere infirmum coram sole: et premas linguam eius cum instrumento, cuius praecessit narratio: deinde fige uncinum in uuam, et trahe eam inferius: et incide eam cum uno duorum instrumentorum quae dixi in incisione duarum amigdalarum.	So you should do when you see it like the way I have described from whiteness and its length, so that you set the sick person before the sun; and press his tongue with an instrument which has gone before in narration: then fasten a hook into the lip, and pull it down: and strike it with one or two instruments which I have mentioned in cutting the two palates.
Et oportet ut non incidas ex ea, nisi illud quod additur super naturalem terminum sine additione.	And you should not strike from it, unless it is added to the natural term without addition.
Nam si tu incidis ex ea plus, laedes uocem et sermonem.	For if you strike from it any more, you will hurt speech and conversation.
Deinde post incisionem utere eo quod narrauimus in incisione duarum amigdalarum: et cura eam, donec sanetur.	Then after the scar has been struck from it, use that which I have described in cutting the two palates: and take care of it until it is healed.
Si autem terretur infirmus ab incisione: tunc oportet ut utaris ingenio in cauterizatione eius absque timore et pauore.	But if the sick person trembles from the scar; then you should use your skill in cauterizing it without fear and worry.
Et modus cauterii in ea non est, nisi cum aqua acuta: et est, ut ponas caput infirmi in sinu tuo.	The mode of cautery with her is not, unless with sharp water: and it is, that you put the head of the nurse in your bosom.
Deinde preme linguam eius cum instrumento quod diximus.	Then press her tongue with the instrument which we have said.
Deinde accipe ex aqua quam dixi tibi in capitulo cauterizandi, et confice cum ea calcem non extinctam, et pone eam non spissam, neque subtilem, et imple ex ea concauitatem huius instrumenti, cuius haec est forma.	Then take from the water which I have told you in the chapter of cauterizing, and mix it with her foot not extinct, and put it not thick, nor thin, and fill it with this instrument, whose is this shape.
Sit extremitati eius in qua ponitur medicina concauitas, sicut concauitas cochlearis radii.	Sit at the end of her where the medicine is placed, as placed on the cochlea of the radius.
Et pone instrumentum cum medicina super uuulam ipsam: et infirmus sit iacens super latus suum, ut currat saliua ex ore eius ex intrinseca medicina, ut non descendat ex ea ad guttur ipsius aliquid, et laedat ipsum.	And place the instrument with the medicine on her uvula: and the sick lie on his side, so that the salve comes from her mouth from within the medicine, so that it does not go down from it to his throat, and hurts him.
Deinde tene manum tuam cum medicina.	Then take your hand with the medicine.
Et tu ex primas eam super uuulam quantitate medietatis horae, donec uideas eam iam denigratam, et sedatam mordicationem medicinae.	And you from the first put it on her uvula of half-dose hour, until you see it has become blackened, and has calmed its itching with the medicine's mordication.
Et si uis ut accipias cotum, et inuoluas ipsum super extremitatem radii, et infundas cotum cum medicina, et intromittas radium cum coto in cannulam desuper, donec adhaereat cotum super uuulam.	And if you want to take the cup and roll it on the end of the radius, and pour the cup with the medicine, and insert the radius with the cup into the tube from above, until it adheres to the uvula.
Fac illud multotiens, donec consequaris quod uis de cauterizatione uuae.	Do this many times, until you get what you want of the new cauterizing.
Deinde dimitte eam: ipsa namque arescit et cadit post tres dies, aut quatuor.	Then let go of her: for she will heal and fall after three days, or four.
Quod si indiges ut iteres medicinam, itera ipsam: et post cauterizationem absterge in circumitu uuae cum coto imbibito in butyro, et mundifica cum eo quod est in circumitu eius ex medicina: et colluatur cum aqua frigida.	That if you want to drink the medicine, repeat it: and after cauterizing wash around her with a new cup dipped in butter, and clean with it what is in around her from the medicine: and let it sit with cold water.
Et curetur extrinsecus cum embrocis, et deintus cum gargarismis, donec sanetur.	And be cured from outside with embrocations, and inside with gargles, until he is healed.
Haec ergo species curationis est salubrior incisione et longinquior a timore.	This then species of cure is more beneficial than the incising and further distant from the fear.
Et quandoque curatur uuula etiam cum eo quod est subtilius quam cauterium et incisio: curatur enim cum suffumigatione, secundum hunc modum.	And sometimes it is also cured with a sound that is finer than cautery and incision: for this reason it is cured with suffumigation, in this way.
Sume calamentum, et hyssopum, et origanum, et rutam, et sseah, et chamomillam, et abrotanum, et similia eis ex herbis: et aggrega ea omnia, aut quaedam eorum in olla, et submergantur cum aceto, et bulliant: et olla sit lutata cum luto decenter: et sit in medio ollae foramen, super quod componatur instrumentum concauum secundum hunc modum.	Take sumac, hyssop, oregano, rue, sseah, chamomile, abrotanums, and other herbs like them; put all of these together in a bowl, and add some vinegar and boil it: the pot should be well covered with litter: and there should be an opening in the middle of the pot above which a fine instrument is placed, as follows.
Fiat ex argento, aut aere: et intromittatur extremitas, in qua est granatum, in os infirmi, donec ascendat uapor ad uuulam super cannulam, donec obscuretur uuula multum.	Let it be made of silver or brass; and the end, in which is the grain, should be inserted into the opening of the tube, until the steam ascends to the edge of the tube, until it is much obscured.
Deinde itera super ipsam multotiens, donec arescat.	Then repeat this many times, until it is healed.
Et caue, ne facias hanc curationem in principio aduentus apostematis.	And if there is a wound, do not begin this cure at the very beginning.
Plaerumque enim addit in apostemate: et non oportet ut facias illud nisi apud declinationem apostematis eius calidi.	For it adds something to the wound: and you should not do this cure unless it is near the time of the warmth of the wound.
Si autem non est praesens tibi hoc instrumentum, tunc accipe cannam, et compone in extremitate eius corticem oui: ut non comburatur os infirmi: quoniam cortex oui prohibet uaporem comburere os: et haec est ex bona curatione cum salute.	But if you do not have this instrument with you, then take a tube and fit a bit of wood to the end of it, so that the smoke does not burn the opening: for the wood prevents the steam from burning; and this is good cure with health.
¶ De extractione spinarum, et ossium de gula.	Regarding the extraction of spine, and bone from the stomach.
Caput XXXVIII.	Chapter 38 (on) surgery.
Multotiens adhaeret in gutture os, aut spina piscis, aut aliud.	Many times an object like a tooth or a spine attached to the stomach, or some other foreign body.
Oportet ergo ut extrahas quod ex eis est apparens super quod cadit uisus, postquam premis linguam cum instrumento apud solem, et declaratur tibi quod est in gutture.	Then, so that what is extraneous to it appears on the surface where the bite has taken place, having pressed the tongue with an instrument at the sun, and shown you what is inside,
Et quod non apparet tibi et occultatur in gutture, oportet ut facias uomere infirmum antequam digeratur cibus in stomacho.	And that which does not appear to you, or is hidden in the stomach, must be taken out before the food is digested in the stomach: for this will be effective with health.
Fortasse enim egredietur res annexa per uomitum.	Perhaps, however, it will come out through the bile.
Aut deglutiat infirmus frustum napi, aut radicem lactucae, aut deglutiat buccellam panis sicci: aut accipiat frustum spongiae marinae siccae lenis: et liga ipsum in filo, deinde deglutiat ipsum.	He should swallow the end of a rope, or the root of a lettuce, or chew dry bread; or he should take the end of a sea sponge that is dry and soft; and bind it with a string, then swallow it.
Cum ergo peruenit ad locum ubi sunt spinae, aut os, et extrahitur, tunc egreditur.	When therefore he has come to the place where there are spines or an oss, and is drawn out, then he goes out.
Si ergo non egreditur cum eo quod diximus: tunc utere instrumento ex plumbo secundum hanc formam.	But if he does not go out with it as I have said: then use the instrument of lead in this form.
Sit grossius quam Radius parumper, et in extremitate eius sit curuitas, quam intromittat in guttur suum cum facilitate: et ipse habeat caput suum eleuatum sursum.	Let it be thicker than the radius somewhat, and let there be a curved end at its end, which he may introduce into his throat with ease: and let him hold his head raised up.
Et caueat a tactu suae epiglotis, ut non accidat ei tussis, et impellat cum eo os, aut spinam, aut intromittat ipsum medicus manu sua.	And let him beware that he does not touch his epiglottis with his tongue, so that it should not give rise to a cough, and drive out the bone or the spine, or introduce the medicine into himself with his own hand.
Verum quod infirmus intromittat, hoc est melius: propter scientiam suam de loco rei annexae: et impellat inferius, aut trahat manum suam cum instrumento sursum, totum illud secundum quantitatem quae praeparatur ei, donec egrediatur.	But as for the sick person who is to be examined, this is better: through his knowledge of the site of the wound; and let him push below, or lift up his hand with the instrument upwards, all this according to the quantity that has been prepared for him, until he has gone out.
¶ De extractione Sanguisugae.	On the Extraction of Blood-Sucker.
Caput XXXIX.	CHAPTER XXXIX.
Quando medicatur sanguisuga cum eo quod dixi in diuisione ex curatione cum medicinis, et non confert, tunc considera in gutture infirmi coram sole, siue apud solem postquam premis linguam eius cum instrumento quod narraui tibi.	When you are treating with the blood-sucker, and he does not yield, consider whether there is a sore throat before the sun, or after it, when you press his tongue with the instrument that I have told you of.
Si ergo cadit uisus tuus super sanguisugam, extrahe eam cum uncino paruo, aut cum gesti subtilibus decenter.	But if your yawning falls on the blood-sucker, extract it with a small hook, or with subtle movements, and turn away from it.
Quod si non est possibile cum eis: tunc accipe cannulam concauam, et intromitte eam in guttur infirmi usque prope guttur: deinde intromitte in concauitatem cannulae ferrum ignitum cum igne.	But if it is not possible with them: then take a tightly-coiled tube, and introduce it into the throat as far as the throat; and then introduce into the coiled tube an iron that is ignited with fire.
Fac illud multotiens: et abstineat infirmus ab aqua tota die.	Make this many times over: and let the sick person refrain from all water for a whole day.
Deinde accipiat uitreatam plenam aqua frigida, et aperiat os eius in ea: et colluat os suum cum ea, et non deglutiat ex ea aliquid: et moueat aquam una hora post aliam cum manu sua.	Then let him take a full wash with cold water and open his mouth into it; and let him put his own jaw into it and swallow nothing from it; and let him moisten the water with his hand for an hour after another.
Sanguisuga enim ilico cum sentit aquam cadit.	For a frog immediately falls when he feels the water.
Si autem non egreditur cum eo quod narrauimus, tunc suffumiga infirmum cum cimicibus, aut cum asa cum instrumento quod narraui in suffumigatione uuulae.	But if he does not leave with him as we have said, then let him smoke the sick with ants or with an axe as a tool that we have used in smoking with it.
Fac illud multotiens, quoniam ipsa cadet.	Do this many times, because he will fall himself.
Et modus operationis in suffumigatione est, ut accipias ollam, in qua sint prunae uiuae cum igne: et olla sit cooperta cum coopertorio, in cuius medio sit foramen: et componatur in illo foramine extremitas instrumenti.	And the method of operation in smoking is that you take a pot in which are fire-roasted frog legs and cover it with a lid, and make a hole in that lid, and fix the end of the tool in that hole.
Deinde proiice suffumigationem, et ponat infirmus os suum in extremitate cannulae, et claudat os suum, ut non egrediatur suffumigatio, donec scias quod suffumigatio iam peruenit ad sanguisugam.	Then throw the smoking, and let him put his own jaw on the end of the tube, and close it so that he does not come out from smoking until you know that smoking has reached the frog.
Nam sanguisuga statim cadet.	For a frog immediately falls.
Quod si non cadit, tunc itera suffumigationem multotiens.	If he does not fall, then repeat the smoking many times.
Et toleret infirmus sitim, et comedat salsa, et allia, et non bibat aquam.	And let the sick appetite endure, and eat sauce and other things, and do not drink water.
Necesse est ergo ut egrediatur cum hoc regimine.	It is therefore necessary that he should go out with this regimen.
Et haec est forma instrumenti cum quo extrahitur sanguisuga ex gutture, quando cadit super ipsam uisus.	And this is the form of the tool from which the frog is taken out of its throat when it falls on it.
Est simile forcipibus, sicut uides: nisi quia est ei haee curuitas quae intromittitur ad guttur.	It is like a claw, as you see: unless because of the agility that enters into the throat.
Et extremitas eius similis ori auis quae nominatur ciconia, in quo est asperitas limae: quando comprehendit aliquid, non dimittit ipsum omnino.	And the end of it is like an egg-shaped bird called a kikonis, in which there is a sharpness of chisel: and when it catches anything, does not let it go at all.
¶ De apertione Apostematum, et eorum sectione, et cura in genere.	Regarding the opening of the Apotomates, and its sectioning, and care in general.
Caput XL.	Chapter 40.
Apostematum species sunt multae, multorum modorum, secundum quod uenit rememoratio eorum, scilicet unius, et unius in hoc libro: et sunt diuersae in perforatione eorum, et sectione ipsorum ex duobus modis.	There are many species of Apotomates, many ways, according to the memory of them, that is to say, one, and there is one in this book: and they differ in their perforation, and in the cutting of them from two kinds.
Quorum unus est ex specie apostematis in seipso, et eo quod comprehendit ex humiditatibus.	There is one from the species of aphemia within itself, and because it comprehends from the humidity.
Et modus secundus est propter loca, in quibus accidit ex corpore.	And the second way is because of the places, in which it happens from the body.
Quoniam apostema accidens in capite, est aliud ab apostemate accidente in ano: et apostema accidens in loco carnoso, est aliud ab apostemate accidente in iuncturis: et unicuique eorum est iudicium suum ex operatione.	For aphemia happens in the head, it is different from the accident of aphemia in the anus; and the aphemia that happens in a fleshy place, it is different from the accident of aphemia in joints; and each of them has its own judgment according to the operation.
Et ex apostematibus sunt quae non oportet ut perforentur, nisi post maturationem saniei in eis, et complementum eius: et ex eis sunt, quae oportet ut perforentur, dum sunt cruda, et non maturantur secundum complementum.	And from the aphemia are those that do not need to pierce, unless they have matured blood in them, and its completion; and from these are those that need to pierce when they are raw, and do not mature according to the completion.
Sicut apostemata quae sunt propinqua iuncturis.	As aphemia that is near joints.
Quoniam apostema quando accidit prope iuncturam, et prolongatur esse eius, donec putrefit quod est in circumitu eius fortasse corrumpuntur ligamenta, aut nerui illius iuncturae: quare est caussa propior contractionis illius membri.	For when aphemia happens nearby a joint and its length is prolonged until it rots what is around it, perhaps the ligaments rot, or the nerve of that joint: so it is the cause of the closer contraction of that limb.
Aut est apostema apud membrum principale: quoniam si tu tardas perforationem eius, donec maturetur, nocebit uel illi, uel per illud membro principali.	Or is an aphemia in a main member; for if you delay the piercing of it until it matures, it will hurt or damage it or through that main member.
Aut est prope anum, perfora ergo ipsum immaturum: et non oportet, ut perfores, apostema crudum, non completae digestionis, nisi quod est prope anum, ut non putrefiat profundum, et longetur ad interiora ani, et fiat fistula, aut fiat in termino eius quod non sanatur.	Or is nearby a nail, so pierce it when it is immature: and do not need to pierce, the raw aphemia, that is not complete digestion, unless it is nearby a nail, lest it rot deeply, and extends to the inside of the anus, and becomes a fistula, or forms in its term that does not heal.
Oportet ut scias horam perforationis apostematis, quod maturatum est secundum complementum: et est apud sedationem doloris, recessionem febris, et diminutionem rubedinis, et pulsationis, et acuitatem capitis apostematis: et reliqua signa.	You need to know the time of piercing the aphemia, that is mature according to its completion; and it is at the rest from pain, the withdrawal of fever, and the decrease of redness, and pulsation, and the sharpness of the head of the aphemia: and the other signs.
Et oportet, ut facias eandem perforationem in inferiori loco apostematis, et uehementioris eminentiae: et sit perforatio uadens in longitudine corporis, si apostemata sunt in partibus manuum et pedum, et locis lacertorum, et chordarum, et neruorum, et arteriarum, et ad ultimum in omnibus locis aequalibus, quibus non est reflexio.	And you need to make the same piercing in the lower place of the aphemia, and more prominent; and let the piercing go in the length of the body, if the aphemia is in the parts of the hand and foot, and the places of the fingers, and the chords, and the nerves, and the arteries, and up to the last in all equal places, where there is no reflection.
In illis autem quae reflectuntur, uade cum perforatione secundum illud membrum.	And in those that are reflected, go with the perforation to that member.
Quando uero apostema est in locis carnosis: tunc melius est ut dimittas perforationem eius, donec confirmetur eius digestio, sicut diximus secundum complementum.	When, however, there is a hematoma in fleshy places: then it is better that you should desist from perforating it until its digestion has been confirmed as we have said according to the complement.
Quoniam si tu perforas ipsum ante illud, prolongatur cursus uirus ex eo, et est multae sordis et sordiciei, et fortasse indurantur labia eius, et profunditas eius.	For if you perforate it before that, the course of the virus will be prolonged from it, and there will be much pus and corruption, and perhaps the lips will become thicker, and its depth.
Et quaedam apostemata perforantur secundum latitudinem corporis apud necessitatem: aut secundum illud quo indiget membrum.	And some hematomas are perforated according to the width of the body in case of necessity: or according to that by which the member is stretched.
Et oportet, ut administres in apostematibus paruis perforationem paruam, et in apostematibus magnis perforationem amplam: aut sectiones multas per similitudinem magnitudinis apostematis.	And it is necessary that you administer a small perforation in small hematomas and a wide perforation in large hematomas: or sections of different sizes of hematomas.
Et sunt ex apostematibus, in quibus oportet ut concauetur cutis: et incidatur quando iam facta est sicut pannus, et facta est in termino, quod iam mortua est: sicut illud quod accidit in multis, ut dubelet, et bubonibus.	And there are hematomas from which the skin must be closed together: and it happens when it has already been done like a cloth, and has reached its term, for it is dead: such as happened to many, such as the poultices, and boils.
Et ex eis sunt quae secantur sectione habente tres angulos.	And there are those that cut off by section having three angles.
Et ex eis est, ex quo inciditur sicut figura folii myrti.	And there is one in which it incises like the figure of a myrtle leaf.
Sicut apostema inguinum.	Like a hematoma of the groin.
Et ex eis sunt in quibus administratur sectio rotunda, et sectio lunaris: et similes eis ex sectionibus.	And there are those in which a round section is administered, and a lunar section: and similar ones from sections.
Illud uero cui non est caput, sicut sunt apostemata lenia superficialia, oportet ut perfores ipsum perforatione superficiali, uel plana tantum.	In fact, in those that have no head, such as are the small superficial hematomas, it is necessary to pierce them with a superficial perforation, or simply flat.
Et oportet, quando apostema est grossum, et iam collegit saniem multam, et perforas ipsum, ut non properes et extrahas pus totum in illa hora: imo extrahe ex ipso partem eius.	And it is necessary that when the hematoma is thick, and has already gathered a lot of blood, you pierce it so that it does not flow out and throw all of it out at once: but take off a part from it.
Deinde opila apostema usque ad diem alium.	Then dust the hematoma until another day.
Deinde extrahe quiddam ex pus iterum.	Then remove some pus again.
Fac illud multotiens secundum gradationem, donec egrediatur: praecipue si infirmus est debilis uirtutis, aut mulier praegnans, aut puer paruus, aur senex decrepitus: spiritus enim animalis ab animali multotiens resoluitur cum egressione saniei: et fortasse moritur infirmus, et tu non percipis.	Then do this many times according to the degree, until it comes out: especially if it is a weak animal, or a pregnant woman, or a young boy, or an old man: for the animal spirit often dissolves from the animal with the exit of blood: and perhaps the sick one dies, and you don't notice it.
Caue ergo hoc capitulum cautela magna.	Then this chapter therefore with great care.
Et post perforationem tuam, qua ista perforas apostemata, oportet ut abstergas uulnus: et considera.	And after you have made the incision, as you make those incisions that are in front of you, it is necessary that you wipe away the sweat: and consider.
Si ergo est uulnus apostematis paruum, aut est sectio plana, tunc administra licinia ex lino, aut coto antiquo.	But if there is a small wound in front of the incision, or it is a flat section, then he should administer a liniment made from linen, or an old poultice.
Et si est apostema magnum, et fissurae perforationis multae sunt, oportet tunc ut intromittas in omnem fissuram licinium, donec perueniant adinuicem.	And if there is a large wound, and there are many holes made by the incision, then he should put liniment into all the cracks, until they are closed up together.
Et si in apostemate abscidisti partem cutis, aut in circumitu concauasti eam: tunc oportet ut impleas eam coto ueteri, aut sicut quando texitur pannus, aut raditur lanugine lini absque humiditate: et stringe ipsum usque ad tertium diem.	And if you have cut off part of the skin in the wound, or if it has been torn around the circumference: then he should fill it with an old poultice, or as when the fabric is smooth, or is rubbed with a layer of hair without moisture: and tighten him up until the third day.
Deinde proiice ipsum, et cura illud cum eo quod oportet ex unguento, donec sanetur.	Then you should pour it out, and care for that with him as you need to from an ointment, until it heals.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis in hora tuae operationis, tunc administra aquam frigidam, et acetum, postquam imbibitur in eis pannus: et ponis ipsum super locum fluxus sanguinis multotiens.	But if blood flows in your hour of operation, then he should administer cold water, and vinegar, after it is soaked up by a cloth: and you should place him over the site of the flow many times.
Si autem perseuerat fluxus sanguinis, tunc oportet ut administres regimen, et curationem, et pulueres, quae narraui in locis multis huius nostri libri, et ex diuisione.	But if the flow of blood persiste, then he should administer a regime, and cure, and powders, which I have narrated in many places of our book, and from a division.
Si autem est in tempore hyemis, et locus apostematis est multorum neruorum: tunc oportet ut infundas puluillos cum uino, et oleo calidis: et ponas eos super loca.	But if it is in the time of winter, and the location of the wound has many nerves: then you should pour in powders with wine, and hot oil: and place them on the places.
Et si fuerit in aestate, et loca sunt carnosa: tunc oportet ut ponas puluillos imbibitos in aqua, et oleo, aut eum uino et oleo, et totum illud frigidum.	And if it is in the summer, and the places are fleshy: then you should pour in powders soaked in water, and oil, or in wine and oil, and all of that cold.
Donec quando erit dies tertius, sicut diximus, tunc oportet ut soluas apostema, et abstergas ipsum, et administres in curatione eius quod ei conuenit, donec sanetur.	Until the third day, as we have said, then you should remove the wound, and wipe him clean, and administer to him whatever cure is appropriate for him, until he heals.
Hoc est ergo quod necessarium est ex cognitione curationis apostematum uniuersaliter.	This is why it is necessary to know about the treatment of different types of wounds universally.
Secundum semitam uero distinctionis, iam dixi de omni apostemate, qualiter est uia ad curationem eius capitulatim singulariter.	However, as for the halfway point of the distinction, I have already said regarding all kinds of wounds, how to treat each one separately.
¶ De sectione apostematum quae accidunt in cute capitis.	[On the section dealing with wounds that occur on the scalp.]
Caput XLI.	[Head]
Accidunt in cute capitis apostemata parua, et sunt ex speciebus Nodorum, quos continent tunicae, quae sunt eis sacci: quasi ipsa sint hausolati gallinae.	Wounds that occur on the scalp are small, and they are of two kinds: nods, which are surrounded by a membrane, which is like a bag for them; as if they were little hens' nests.
Et ipsorum species sunt multae.	And there are many kinds of these wounds.
Ex eis sunt pingues: et ex eis sunt quae continent humiditatem similem limo: et ex eis quae continent humiditatem similem frisatis et pultibus: et eis similibus, et ex eis sunt, quae sunt lapidea dura.	Of these wounds, some are small; and of these wounds, there are those that contain moisture similar to lime; and of these wounds, there is moisture similar to rain and pus; and there are similar ones, and among these there are hard stones.
Et in sectione omnium, et ipsorum extractione non est timor, dum apud ipsorum sectionem non facit contrarietatem arteria.	And in the cutting of all of them, nor is there any danger in their extraction, provided that you do not make any difference when cutting at the site of the wound itself, where the arteries are opposed.
Et operatio in sectione eorum est, ut experiaris ea cum instrumento, cuius forma uenit post haec, quod nominatur Intromissum, donec scias quid contineat.	And the operation on these wounds is that you test it with an instrument, whose form has come after these things, which is called the "intromission", until you know what it contains.
Nam si est illud quod continet humiditas, tunc seca ipsum sectione secundum longitudinem sectione superficiali: secundum hanc formam.	For if that is what contains moisture, then dry up the section at right angles to the surface of the wound: in this form.
Et incipe cum sectione ex linea b. ad lineam, g. Cum ergo euacuatur humiditas, tunc excoria kistin quae continet illam humiditatem, et non dimittas ex ea aliquid penitus.	And begin the cutting from line B to line G. When therefore the moisture is drained out, then remove the skin that contains that moisture, and do not leave any of it behind.
Multotiens enim redit, si remanet ex ea aliquid.	Many times it will return if some of it remains.
Deinde submerge cotum in unguento aegyptio, si est praesens: et si non, in aqua et sale: et imple cum eo uulnus, et dimitte ipsum usque ad diem alium.	Then dip the cloth in Egyptian ointment if it is present: and if not, in water and salt: and fill it with oil, and leave it until the next day.
Ipsum enim corrodet quod remansit ex kisti.	That ointment will corrode what remains of the skin.
Deinde itera super ipsum cotum cum aegyptio secundo, et tertio, et si indiges illo, donec confidas quia non remanserit ex kisti aliquid, tunc enim cura uulnus cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then repeat the application of the Egyptian ointment a second and third time, and if you find it tolerable, until you are confident that nothing remains in the skin, then, since you are comfortable with it, apply the oil with ointment, until the wound heals.
Quod si apostema continet nodum pinguem: tunc seca ipsum secundum hanc formam, sectione habente formam crucis: et proiice uncinos inter duolabia sectionis, et excoria ipsum ab omni parte: et conare uirtutem tuam in extractione tunicae quae continet ipsum.	If the abscess contains a pimple: then dry it up according to this form, having the section in the form of a cross; and throw away the hooks between the clefts of the section, and scrub it off entirely; and try your skill in extracting the tunica that contains it.
Si autem contrarietatem facit tibi arteria, tunc fac illud quod narrabo tibi post.	But if it contradicts you, then do as I shall tell you after.
Et similiter fac in apostemate, si est lapideum, ex sectione, et curatione eadem, secundum quod diximus.	And also do the same in an abscess, if it is rocky, from the section, and cure in the same way, as we have said.
Et sectio super apostema lapideum est facilior: quoniam est pauci sanguinis et humiditatis.	And the section on a rocky abscess is easier: for there is little blood and moisture.
Et quandoque sunt quaedam horum apostematum quae sunt in capite in quibusdam hominibus, cum quibus penitus non est humiditas.	And sometimes some of these abscesses are in the head of certain men, where there is no moisture within.
Quod est: quia ego secui super apostema in capite mulieris uetulae, et inueni apostema sicut lapis solidus et durus, asper, albus, qui non poterat frangi: et si percuteretur cum eo aliquis proiiciendo, uulnerat ipsum.	That is: because I followed on an abscess in the head of a married woman, and found it like a solid stone hard, sharp, white, which could not be broken: and if anyone struck it with a punch, he wounded the flesh.
In aliis uero apostematibus accidentibus in capite, praeter haec scilicet apostemata quae accidunt in capitibus puerorum, et apud radices aurium, sectio eorum omnium sit sectio superficialis.	But in other abscesses of accidents in the head, aside from these abscesses that occur in the heads of boys, and at the roots of the ears, all of them are superficial sections.
Vel pone perforationem eorum semper ab inferiori parte eorum, ut alleuietur cursus saniei ad inferiora.	Or put a hole in them always from their lower part, that the course of the juice may run to the bottom.
Deinde cura ea cum eo quod conuenit eis ex curatione.	Then take care for these with what is fitting when they are cured.
¶ De sectione Strophularum in collo.	On the section of Strophulus in the neck.
Caput XLII.	Head 42.
Multotiens acccidunt ista apostemata in collo, et sub assellis, et inguinibus: et quandoque accidunt in reliquo corpore.	These abscesses often occur in the neck, and under the cheeks, and in the groin, and sometimes in the whole body.
Et super illa quae ex eis accidunt in collo, sunt unum, et multa: et generantur ab inuicem: et omnis Strophula ex eis est intra tunicam propriam ei, sicut est in nodis et apostematibus capitis, sicut narrauimus.	And above those which occur from them in the neck, there is one kind, and many: and they spring from a common source; and all Strophulus comes from its own tunica, as we have said.
Et species harum Strophularum sunt multae.	And the kinds of Strophulus are many.
Et ex eis enim sunt lapideae: et ex eis sunt quae continent humiditates: et ex eis sunt malignae, quae non obediunt curationi.	And from these are the leaves; and from these are those that retain moisture; and from these are the evil ones, which do not obey cure.
In illa ergo quam ex eis uides bonae dispositionis in tactu, cuius manifestum est propinquum colori cutis, et mouetur ad omnem partem, et non est annexa cum neruis colli, neque cum guidegi, neque cum arteria, neque est profunda: oportet ut seces eam sectione superficiali a superiori parte ad inferiorem partem corporis ex linea, b. ad lineam, g. et excoria eam ab omni parte: et extende duo labia cutis cum uncino, aut cum uncinis multis, si indiges illo, sicut diximus in apostematibus capitis, et extrahe eam paulatim.	For from these are the leaves; and from these are those that retain moisture; and from these are the evil ones, which do not obey cure.
Et est super cautelam, ut non incidatur uena, aut neruus.	And it is on guard that it should not strike the vein or nerve.
Et sit spatumile non acutum ualde: ut non addat tibi manum tuam cum incisione, aut inquietet infirmum, et incidas quod non est necesse.	And let it not be sharp; so that it should not cause your hand to tremble or trouble you in any way, and let you fall down, for this is not necessary.
Si autem incidis uenam, aut arteriam, aut prohibet te ab operatione, tunc pone in uulnus zegi tritum, aut quosdam pulueres qui abscindunt sanguinem, et stringe uulnus, et dimitte ipsum, donec quiescat acuitas apostematis, et mollificetur uulnus: uel incipit et uult putrefieri.	But if you strike a vein or an artery, or prevents you from carrying out the operation, then put a wooden stake and some powder that stops the blood, and tighten the stake and let go of it, until the edge of the wound has healed, and the wood has become soft: or else it begins to rot.
Nam sanguis abscinditur tuncia Redi ergo ad operationem tuam, donec compleas.	For blood is stopped by powder; so that you can put yourself back in the preparation for your work, until you are finished with it.
Deinde inquire digito tuo indice, si remansit aliquid ex Strophulis aliis paruis: ergo incide eas, et munda eas.	Then examine with your index finger whether there is anything left of the stitches; so that you can cut them off and clean them out.
Quod si est in radice Strophulae uena magna: tunc oportet ut non incidas illam Strophulam ex radice sua: imo oportet ut liges eam cum filo duplato forti, et dimittas eam donec cadat per se absque nocumento.	If there is a large vein at the base of the stitch; then it should not be cut from its root; but it should be tied with strong thread and let go until it falls out by itself without doing any harm.
Deinde imple uulnus coto ueteri, quod iam submersisti in unguento aegyptio.	Then fill the stitch with old cotton that you have already soaked in Egyptian ointment.
Deinde cura ipsum.	Then care for the wound.
Si inciditur Strophula tota, tunc oportet ut aggreges labia duo uulneris: et suas ipsum statim, postquam uides quia prorsus non remansit superfluitas.	If the whole stitch has been cut, then you should collect two leaves of the wound; and clean it immediately, as soon as you see that there is no excess remaining.
Si autem uides quod remansit superfluitas propter magnitudinem Strophulae, tunc oportet ut intendas ad incidendam radicem eius, et extrahendam eam: et administra suturam quam diximus.	If you see that there is excess because of the size of the stroma, then it is necessary that you understand to cut off its root and extract it: and administer the suture which we have mentioned.
Et quae ex Strophulis continet humiditates, perfora illam perforatione superficiali: ut appareat tibi locus maturitatis eius: et pone perforationem ab eo quod sequitur inferius corporis, sicut diximus.	And which of the stroma contains moisture, pierce it with a superficial puncture: so that you see the place of maturity of it: and put the puncture from there because it follows below the body, as we have said.
Deinde administra post perforationem licinia cum unguento, et similia eis, ut corrodat quod remansit ex corruptione, donec quando uides uulnus iam mundatum esse: tunc cura ipsum cum unguento generatiuo carnis, donec sanetur.	Then, after the puncture, administer the licking with ointment and similar things so that it corrupts what remained from corruption, until when you see the scar already healed: then take care of it with a generate ointment of flesh, until it heals.
¶ De sectione Epiglotis ab apostemate intra guttur accidente.	§ On the section of the epiglottis from the hernia inside the throat by accident.
Caput XLIII.	CHAPTER XLVIII.
Dixerunt antiqui hanc sectionem in Epigloti, et non uidi aliquem in terra nostra, qui eam fecerit: et haec est scriptura sermonis eorum.	The ancient ones said that this section of the epiglottis, and no one in our land has done it, and this is a writing of their speech.
In habentibus autem synanchiam, oportet ut deuitetur sectio Epiglotis: cum non fiat iuuamentum per illud: propterea, quod omnes uenae et pulmo sunt infirmi.	But in those who have a synachium, the section of the epiglottis should be removed: not to do it because of the following thing: for all nostrils and lung are feeble.
In illis uero qui habent apostema calidum in ore, aut gutture, aut duabus amigdalis, quando non est aegritudo in cannali, oportet uti sectione Epiglotis, ad fugiendum ex perditione quae fit ex praefocatione.	In those, however, who have a hot hernia in the mouth or throat or both the walnuts, when there is no disease in the canal, it is necessary to use the section of the epiglottis, to avoid the destruction that is done by pre-condensation.
Oportet ergo quando uolumus illud, ut secemus Epiglotim sub tribus circulis Epiglotis, aut quatuor, sectione parua per latitudinem, in eo quod est inter duos circulos per quantitatem, quod sit sectio in sifac, non in cartilagine: et iste quidem locus est conueniens sectioni, quoniam est priuatus carne, et uasa sanguinis ab eo sunt longinqua.	It is necessary, therefore, when we want to do that thing, that we remove the epiglottis under a circle of the epiglottis, or four, small section by its length, which is the section in the sifil, not in the cartilage: and this place is suitable for the section, because it is separated from flesh, and the blood vessels are far away from it.
Quod si medicator est timidus, tunc oportet ut extendat cutem gutturis cum uncino.	If the doctor is a timid one, then it is necessary that he extends the skin of the throat with a hook.
Deinde findat cutem, donec quando peruenit ad cannalem: deuitet uas sanguinis, si uidet ex eis aliquid.	Then he finds the skin, until when it reaches to the canal: remove the blood vessel, if he sees any from it.
Deinde secet sifac quod narrauimus: et significatur super sectionem cannalis ex phlegmate quod egreditur ex ea, cum eo quod disrumpitur, et abscisione uocis.	Then cut away the skin that we have described: and it signifies upon the section of the canal from the phlegm which comes out of it, with that which is cut off, and the ablation of the voice.
Et dimitte uulnus apertum tempore aliquo.	And let the raw area be left open for some time.
Cum ergo remouetur hora in qua timetur praefocatio, aggrega duo labia uulneris cutis, et sue ipsam solam absque cartilagine.	When therefore the place is moved by the hour, in which there is a fear of hernia, the two lips of the wound of the skin are gathered together and are sutured alone without the cartilage.
Deinde administra medicinas quae faciunt nasci carnem, usquequo sanetur.	Then apply medicines that make the flesh grow again until it is healed.
Inquit Albucasis.	Says Albucasis.
Summa huius sermonis quem narrauimus, expositio non est, nisi quando uident, quod aliquod horum apostematum iam opilauit guttur infirmi: et sublimatus est infirmus super mortem, et uult intersecari anhelitus eius: uadunt ad secandum Epiglotim, ut respiret infirmus super locum uulneris quadam respiratione, et saluetur a morte: et propter hoc praeceperunt dimittere uulnus apertum, donec consumatur malicia aegritudinis, et est malicia eius tribus diebus, et quasi ipsa: tunc ergo praecaeperunt suere uulnus, et curare ipsum, donec sanetur.	Says Albucasis. The summary of this speech that we have described is an exposition, unless it is clear that one of these lumps has already been drained by the throat being infected: and the sick person has risen up higher than death, and his hernia has grown larger between the larynx and the windpipe, so that he can breathe more freely, and save himself from death: and for this reason they have ordered to leave the lump open, until the malice of the illness is consumed, and it is a malice of three days, and almost the same: then they order to put a lump on it, and to take care of him, until he is healed.
Et illud quod uidi per me ipsum est, quod una ancilla accaepit cultellum, et misit cum in guttur suum, et incidit cum eo partem cannalis pulmonis.	And that which I saw myself, that a servant took a knife, and put it into his throat, and cut off with it a part of the canal of the lung.
Et uocatus sum ad curationem eius, et inueni eam mugire, sicut est mugitus mortui.	And I was called to cure him, and I found it gurgling, as it is the sound of a dead person.
Detexi ergo a uulnere, et inueni sanguinem qui egressus fuerat ex uulnere paruum.	I therefore took away from the lump, and I found blood that was coming out of the small wound.
Confisus ergo sum, quod ipsa non absciderat uenam, neque guidegi: et uentus egrediebatur ex uulnere.	I therefore confessed, that he had not cut off any part, nor sewed it up: and the wind came out from the wound.
Properaui ergo, et sui uulnus, et curaui ipsum, donec sanum est: et non accidit ancillae aliquid, nisi raucedo in uoce: et rediit post dies ad meliorem dispositionum suarum.	I therefore took away the lump, and I cured him, until he was well: and there happened to the servant nothing, except that his voice became hoarse: and after a few days he recovered to better health.
Hinc ergo dico: quod in sectione Epiglotis non est timor.	Thus I say: for there is no fear in the epiglottis.
¶ De sectione Herniae gutturis.	De the section of the hernia of the throat.
Caput XLIIII.	Chapter LXXIV.
Hoc Apostema nominatum Hernia gutturis, est apostema magnum, secundum colorem corporis: et est in mulieribus multum.	This hernial growth, named hernia of the throat, is a large one, second in size only to the color of the body; and it occurs frequently in women.
Et est secundum duos modos: aut enim est naturale: aut est accidentale.	And it has two causes: either it is natural or, on the other hand, it is accidental.
In naturali certe non est ingenium.	Certainly there is no talent in the natural one.
Accidentale uero est secundum duos modos: quorum unus est similis nodis pinguibus.	The accidental one, on the other hand, has two causes; one is similar to the nodules and pus, and the other is...
Et modus alter, est similis apostemati quod fit ex nodatione arteriae.	And the other mode, is similar to an aphtem that is formed from the knotting of a blood vessel.
Et in ipso est timor, et non oportet ut praesumptio fiat ad ipsum cum ferro, nisi in eo quod est paruum: et tu proba ipsum, et inuestiga ipsum cum Intromisso.	And there is a fear in it; and one should not dare to make an incision on it unless it is small; and you should test it and investigate it with the probe.
Si ergo inuenis ipsum simile nodo pingui, et non est suspensum cum aliqua uenarum: tunc seca ipsum, sicut secantur nodi: et extrahe ipsum cum eo quod continet ex kisti, si est in kisti: et si non, tunc perscrutare totum eius.	If then the aphem is similar to a large nodule and is not suspended with any veins: then dry it up as you do nodules; and take it out with it if it is contained in a sack, for if it is not, then inspect it all over.
Deinde cura locum cum eo quod oportet ex curatione, donec sanetur.	Then care for the place with what needs to be done in curing, until it heals.
¶ De sectione super species Nodorum.	De the section on the types of nodules.
Caput XLV.	Chapter L.
Nodorum multae sunt species, et ego iam dixi omnes species eorum in diuisione: et oportet ut narrem hic differentiam inter Nodum, et Exituram: cum sit dubitationem faciens.	There are many types of nodules, and I have already spoken about their various types; and it is necessary for me to describe the difference between a nodule and an excrescence when there is doubt.
Dico ergo, quod cum Exitura est caliditas, et febris, et dolores uehementes, donec sedatur ebullitio superfluitatis, et completur putrefactio: tunc enim quiescunt febris et calor.	I say, then, that when there is heat and fever and acute pain, until effusion subsides and putrefaction is complete; for then the fever and the heat subside.
Cum Nodo uero non est caliditas, neque febris, neque dolores, et continet eos kistis sifachin, qui est eis saccus proprius, et est secundum colorem corporis: et est incaeptio eorum sicut cicer, et fit sicut batecha, et maior et minor.	But when there is no heat or fever or pain, and they are contained in sacks of their own sinuses, which are like beans, and resemble a plumskin, and are larger and smaller: this is how nodules begin.
Et sunt secundum duas species: aut pingues: aut continent humiditatem.	And they are according to two species: either they are thin: or they retain moisture.
Et colores humiditatis sunt multi, secundum quod dixi in diuisione.	And the colors of moisture are many, as I have said in the division.
Oportet ergo, quando peruenis ad curationem Nodi, ut experiaris eum, et inquiras ipsum in primis cum instrumento quod nominatur Intromissum, secundum quod ueniet forma eius in capitulo quod est post hoc.	Therefore, when you apply the poultice to the wound, so that you may feel it and examine it, use the instrument called the intromissor first, according to what will come about from its form in the following chapter.
Et modus inquisitionis apostematum, et Nodorum omnium est, ut accipias hoc instrumentum, et intromittas ipsum in humidiorem locum, quem inuenis in apostemate: et tu reuolue digitos tuos cum eo paulatim, donec scias quod instrumentum iam penetrauit cutem.	And the method of examining abscesses and all kinds of boils is, when you take this instrument, to introduce it into a moist place which you have made in the abscess: and you shall move your fingers with it slowly, until you know that the instrument has penetrated the skin.
Deinde ultima manum tuam secundum mensuram magnitudinis apostematis.	Then take the last hand according to the size of the abscess.
Deinde extrahe Intromissum, et considera illud quod egrediur in uestigio eius.	Then remove the intromissor, and see what comes out into the hole.
Si ergo egreditur humiditas currens, quicunque color sit: tunc seca ipsum sectione superficiali, secundum quod dixi in reliquis apostematibus.	If therefore it comes out running with moisture, whatever its color is: then dry him by a superficial cut, as I have said for the rest of the abscesses.
Et si non egreditur humiditas in uestigio Intromissi, tunc scias quia est pinguis: seca ergo super ipsum sectione habente formam crucis, secundum formam hanc, sicut docui te: et suspende ipsum cum uncinis, et excoria cutem ab omni parte cum facilitate: et custodi kistin si potes super illud, ut extrahas ipsam sanam cum Nodo.	And if the intromissor does not bring out moisture in the hole, then you will know that it is fat: so dry him over the top with a V-shaped cut, according to this shape, as I have taught you: and suspend it by hooks, and scrape off the skin from all parts with ease: and if you can keep a box over it, so take out the healthy flesh with a nodule.
Si autem disrumpitur kistis apud operationem, et non est possibile extrahere ipsam sanam, multotiens enim accidit illud, tunc extrahe ipsam frustatim, donec non remaneat ex ea aliquid.	If however the skin ruptures during the operation, and it is not possible to take out the healthy flesh, often because this happens: then take it away hastily, until nothing remains of it.
Nam si remanet ex ea aliquid parum, aut multum, redit Nodus secundum plurimum.	For if there remains a little or much of it, the nodule returns according to most of them.
Quod si uincit te, et remanet ex eo parum: tunc imple uulnus apud completionem tuam, quibusdam pulueribus corrosiuis acutis: et stringe uulnus, et pone supra ipsum quod sedet apostema calidum, et cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	For if it hurts you, and there remains a little of it: then fill the wound with some powdered caustic substance sharp: and tighten the poultice, and place it over the abscess that sits warm, and take care of the rest of the wound with the usual cure, until it heals.
Si ergo est Nodus magnus, tunc sue duo labia eius, et cura ipsum cum eo quod incarnat.	If then there is a large knot, then cut it in two, and take care that what is incorporeal remains with it.
Si autem est tibi contraria uena pulsatilis, aut non pulsatilis: tunc propera, et imple locum zegi trito, et dimitte ipsum strictum duobus diebus, aut tribus, donec putrefiat uulnus, et quiescat ebullitio sanguinis: deinde redi ad incidendum illud quod remansit ex Nodo.	If however you have a new swelling that pulsates, or does not pulsate: then approach it and fill the space with three-fold powder, and leave it strict for two days, or three, until the pus has putrefied and the fever has subsided: then return to incision of what is left from the knot.
¶ De foris instrumentorum pro sectione et perforatione.	¶ Of external instruments for section and piercing.
Caput XLVI.	Chapter LVI.
EX Eis sunt formae Intromissorum, et sunt trium specierum.	From these are the forms of intromissions, and they are of three kinds.
Ex eis enim est magnum, et ex eis est medium, et ex eis est paruum.	For there is a large one, and there is a medium one, and there is a small one.
Fiant ex ferro alfulud quadratarum extremitatum decenter, ut festinent introitum in apostemate.	Let there be made of iron four-squared extremities deviated, so that they may make the entrance into an apotome.
Et istae sunt formae Experientium, et no, id est, perforantia: et unum eorum nominatur beris, idest, peforans: et sunt trium specierum.	And these are the forms of exsertions, and there is one, that is to say, piercing: and it is of three kinds.
Ex eis enim est magnum, et medium, et paruum.	For there is a large one, and a medium one, and a small one.
Conueniunt, ut inuestigentur per ea apostemata, et exiturae, et fistulae, et bubones ab eo quod inter ea est ex ossibus.	Let them be made to project through the apotomes, and the exits, and the tubes, and the abscesses from him who is between them of the bones.
Et aliis fiunt rotunda, tersa, lenia, sicut acus magnae quibus subsellia suuntur, ex citrino scilicet, aut ex aere, aut ferro, aut argento.	And others are round, and sharp, and smooth, such as the large needles with which the backs of the ears are pierced, made of citrine, or of brass, or of iron, or of silver.
Et meliora eorum sunt quae fiunt ex citrino.	And better ones are those made of citrine.
Et fiunt Experientia etiam de plumbo nigro, quae conueniunt ut per ea experiantur fistulae, quarum concauitate sunt reflexiones, ut reflectantur cum lenitate sua cum illis reflexionibus.	And there are also exsertions of black lead which are made to project so that the tubes may be examined by it; for with its softness they reflect with mildness to themselves those reflections.
Et sunt iterum trium specierum.	And again they are of three kinds.
Quoniam ex eis sunt longa, ex eis media, et ex eis breuia, secundum quantitatem amplitudinis fistulae et stricturae eius.	For there are long ones, and medium ones, and short ones, according to the quantity of the width of the tube and its strictness.
Forma Vncinorum, et sunt multarum specierum.	Form of the coracoi, and they are of many kinds.
Quoniam ex eis sunt simplices, scilicet quibus est curuitas una: et sunt trium specierum sicut uides, Magni, Medii, et Parui.	For they are simples, that is to say, those in which there is one length: and they are of three species as you see, great, medium, and small.
Et ex eis sunt Vncini caeci: et sunt trium specierum.	And out of these are the blind Vincess: and they are of three species.
Et ex eis sunt uncini habentes duas curuaturas, et sunt trium specierum: et ex eis sunt uncini habentes tres curuaturas, et sunt trium specierum: et omnes isti sunt necessarii in loco suo.	And out of these are the hooks having two lengths, and they are of three species: and out of these are the hooks having three lengths, and they are of three species: and all of these are necessary in their place.
Et istae sunt formae Scalpellorum, quibus secantur et excoriantur Nodi, et apostemata: et sunt trium specierum: quoniam ex eis est magnum, medium, et paruum.	These are the shapes of Scalpels, with which they cut and scarify nodes and abscesses: and they are of three species: for out of these is great, medium, and small.
Eorum extremitates quibus fit sectio sunt acutae, extremitates aliae sunt non acutae: et non ponuntur taliter, nisi ut cum eis fiat iuuamentum in excoriatione Nodorum apud timorem incisionis uenae, aut nerui: et ut sanetur per ea infirmus, et inueniat tranquillitatem parumper ex adustione quam inuenit apud excoriationem apostematis.	Their extremities with which they make the section are acute, other extremities are not acute: and they are not placed so, unless it is done with them that makes incision in a nodule out of fear of wound of the skin, or in a nerve: and to heal him who is ill through the heat which he has received less than that which heals by scarification of abscesses.
Istae sunt Magda, et sunt specierum trium.	These are the magdas, and they are of three species.
Fiunt ex aere, et sunt similia Radio, cum quo fit alcohol: et in extremitate lata est puncta Spatumilis occultata: et in ea currit ad interiora, et ad exteriora quando uis, sicut uides.	They are made of brass, and they are similar to the wire by which is made the alcohol: and in the long end there is a concealed pin-head: and in it runs towards the inside, and towards the outside when you wish, as you see.
Forma Spatumilium quae absconduntur inter digitos apud perforationem apostematum: et non percipiunt ea infirmi: et sunt trium specierum, magnum, medium, et paruum.	The form of the pin-head which is concealed between the fingers at the perforation of abscesses: and do not feel it with the touch: and they are of three species, great, medium, and small.
Fomae Ventosarum cum quibus abscinditur fluxus sanguinis: et sunt trium specierum, magnae, mediae, et paruae.	The forms of Wind-pockets with which the flow of blood is cut off: and they are of three species, great, medium, and small.
Fiant ex aere, aut citrino, rotundae, ad longitudinem parumper, sicut uides: et sint ad subtilitatem.	Let them be made of brass, or of copper, round, a little long, as you see: and let them be delicate.
Et oportet ut sint istae species Ventosarum apud te magnae, et paruae: ut abscindas per eas sanguinem cum uelocitate apud necessitatem, et tunc quando non est tibi praesens medicina.	And let these species of wind-pockets be with you great, and small: that you may cut off the blood with them at speed when you are in need, and then when medicine is not present with you.
Verumtamen non utaris eis in abscisione sanguinis in omni loco corporis, et non utaris nisi in locis carnosis: sicut lacertis cruris, et coxae, et lacertis brachiorum, et mammillarum, et uentris, et inguinum, et similibus eis, ex lacertis carnosis, humidis.	Indeed, you should not use them for ablation of blood in any part of the body, and you should not use them unless in meaty places: such as the legs, pelvis, arms, breasts, palms, ankles, and similar, from meaty places, moist.
Et quandoque fiunt ex eis instrumenta parua alia similia corticibus fisticorum, secundum suam formam: quibus abscinditur sanguis quando fluit ex loco phlebotomiae, aut apud incisionem uenae, aut arteriae: et quandoque fiunt ex eis rotundae secundum hanc formam.	And when they are made from them small instruments like the blade of a chisel, in accordance with their shape: which ablate blood when it flows from a phlebotomy site, or at a cut to a vein or artery: and sometimes they are made round in this form.
¶ De cura Mammillarum hominum quae mammillis mulierum assimilantur.	Now concerning the care of the mammary glands in men which resemble the mammary glands of women:
Caput XLVII.	Chapter 57: The Care of the Breast
Quandoque inflantur Mammillae quorundam hominum apud complementum somni (id est, cum incipiunt pollui in somno) donec similantur mammillis mulierum: et remanent apostemosae foede.	When and if the breasts of some men swell at the time of sleep (that is, as they begin to become erect in sleep) until they resemble the breasts of women: and remain soft to the touch.
Qui ergo abhorret illud, oportet ut secet super mammillas sectione lunari, secundum hanc formam ex linea, b. ad lineam, g. Deinde excoria pinguedinem totam.	Whoever then dislikes this, should tie a bandage over the breasts with the moon shape, according to this form from a line, to a line, and so on. And then scrape the whole of the swelling.
Postea imple uulnus ex medicamine incarnatiuo.	Then fill up the breasts with an ointment made from the ink of the murex shell.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris cum sutura, et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then attach two strips of skin to the nipples with a stitch, and look after it until it heals.
Si autem declinat mammilla ad inferiora, et mollificatur propter magnitudinem suam, sicut accidit mulieribus: tunc oportet ut findatur in duobus lateribus suis superioribus duabus sectionibus similibus figurae lunari, quarum unaquaeque continetur cum altera apud fines utriusque, donec sit linea maior continens minorem, secundum hanc formam ex linea, b. ad lineam, g. Postea excoria cutem quae est inter duo labia, et aufer pinguedinem, et administra quod diximus de sutura et pulueribus, quod est necessarium ex curatione, donec sanetur.	If however the nipple sways downward and softens because of its size, as is the case with women: then let it be found in its two sides on top in two sections like the moon shape, and each one is held by another at the ends like this line from a line to line, g. Then scrape the skin that is between the two lips, and remove the swelling, and apply what we have said about the stitch and the powders, which is necessary in the treatment, until it heals.
Si autem non comples incisionem eius quod oportet te incidere, propter inquietudinem infirmi, aut propter fluxum sanguinis: tunc oportet ut impleas uulnus coto submerso unguento corrosiuo, et dimitte ipsum, donec corrodat illud quod remansit ex pinguedine.	If however you do not like the incision that needs to be made on it because of the unease of the disease or the flow of blood: then let you fill the breasts with a submerged cotting ointment that is corrosive, and let go of them, until what remains of the swelling is corroded.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then the care for him, until he is healed.
¶ De perforatione apostematis, quod accidit sub Titillico.	Regarding the perforation of the abscess, which occurred during the reign of Titus.
Caput XLVIII.	Chapter 58.
Ista apostemata quae accidunt sub Titillico, sunt ex speciebus Strophularum dura, quae continet kistis, et ex eis sunt quae continent humiditates.	These abscesses that occur during the reign of Titus are of a hard species of staph, which contains blisters and from them emerge fluid.
Quae ergo sunt ex eis quae continent humiditates, oportet ut secentur sectione lunari, secundum hanc formam, ex linea b. ad lineam, g. cum ergo euacuatur totum quod est in apostemate ex sanie, tunc imple ipsum coto ueteri, et dimitte ipsum usque ad diem alium.	Since these are of the type that contains moisture, they should be cut open with a lunar section, according to this form, from line B to line G; and when all that is in the abscess has been drained out of its fluid, then fill it with old skin, and leave it until the next day.
Deinde auferatur cotum, et curetur cum unguento conueniente ad illud, donec sanetur.	Then the dressing is removed, and care is taken with the ointment suited to it, until it is healed.
Quod si apostema fuerit ex specie nodorum Strophularum, tunc scinde super ipsum, sicut diximus in sectione super Strophulas aequaliter.	If the abscess is of the species of nodules of the staph, then cut it over the top, as we have said in the section on how to cut staphylae equally.
Si autem extenditur uulnus in hoc ut emittat pus, tunc administra in eo cauterium, secundum quod diximus in eo quod praemissum est.	But if it extends a knuckle, so that it spits out pus, then administer cauterization to it, as we have said in the preceding passage.
¶ De sectione apostematis quod accidit propter Arteriam et Venam.	Regarding the section of an abscess that occurs due to an artery or a vein.
Caput XLIX.	Chapter 59.
Quando disrumpitur Arteria, et consolidatur cutis quae est supra eam, tuno multotiens accidit inde apostema: et similiter accidit Venae etiam, ut accidat in ea apostema et inflatio.	When an artery is interrupted and the skin that is above it hardens, it often occurs that a abscess develops there: and likewise it happens with veins, so that a abscess and swelling occur there.
Et signa quibus cognoscitur, quod apostema et inflatio sint propter Arteriam et Venam, sunt: quoniam, quando apostema est propter arteriam, est longum, aggregatum in profundo corporis: et quando impellis apostema digits tuis, sentis quasi sit ei stridor.	And the signs by which it is known that an abscess and swelling are due to an artery or a vein are these: for when an abscess is due to an artery, it is long and gathered in the depths of the body; and when you press your fingers upon the abscess, you feel as if there were a hissing sound.
Et illud quod est propter Venam, est rotundum in manifesto corporis.	And that which is due to a vein is round in appearance on the surface of the body.
Et sectio super hoc apostema est error, et praecipue quod est sub ascellis, et inguinibus, et collo, et in locis multis corporis: et est magnum ualde.	And the section upon this abscess is an error, especially if it is under the armpits, and in the groin, and on the neck, and in many other places of the body; and it is great to a remarkable degree.
Oportet ergo ut deuitetur eius cura cum ferro, et quod ex eis etiam est in extremitatibus, aut in capite, oportet ut deuitetur.	Therefore, so that his care may be with iron, and that which is also from them in the extremities, or in the head, let it be made.
Super illud ergo quod ex eis est ex inflatione orificii Arteriae, finde in cute sectione in longitudine.	So therefore, since it is from them, that which is from the inflammation of the opening of the artery, find on the skin in a section in length.
Deinde aperi sectionem cum uncinis, postea Arteriam: et libera eam ex tunicis, donec detegatur.	Then open the section with the hook, then the artery: and free it from the tunics, until it is detected.
Deinde intromitte sub ea acum, et fac eam penetrare usque ad latus aliud, et stringe Arteriam cum filo duplo in duobus locis, secundum quod docui te in extractione duarum Arteriarum quae sunt in timporibus.	Then introduce it under it, and let it penetrate as far as another side, and tighten the artery with a double thread at two places, according to what I taught you in the extraction of two arteries which are in the temples.
Deinde punge locum, qui est inter duo ligamenta cum spatumili, donec egrediatur sanguis qui est in eo totus, et soluatur apostema.	Then pierce the place, which is between the two ligaments with a scalpel, until all the blood that is in it comes out, and dissolve the hematoma.
Deinde administra curationem quae generat pus, donec cadant ligamenta: postea cura illud cum unguentis conuenientibus ad illud, donec sanetur.	Then administer the cure which generates pus, until the ligaments fall: then treat that with ointments suitable for it, until it heals.
Quod si fuerit apostema propter sectionem Venae, tunc oportet ut teneas manu tua quod tibi possibile est ex apostemate cum cute.	If it is a hematoma because of the section of a vein, then you must hold your hand so that you can get it from the hematoma with the skin.
Deinde intromitte acum sub loco quem tenuisti manu tua, et fac eam penetrare: et sit in ea filum duplum, donec extrahas ipsum ex latere altero.	Then introduce the hook under the place which you held with your hand, and let it penetrate: and let it be in it a double thread, until you draw it out from the other side.
Deinde liga cum ipso apostema ligamento bono: secundum quod dixi tibi in ligamento uuae, a duabus partibus cum duabus extremitatibus fili.	Then bind with it the hematoma with a good ligament: according as I told you in binding a ligament, from the two parts with the two extremities of the thread.
Si autem times quod extrahatur filum, tunc intromitte acum aliam cum filo alio sub apostemate toto apud incisionem acus: preme, et stringe fila tua in quatuor locis.	If however you should suppose that a thread is to be extracted, then introduce another hook with another thread under the hematoma from all around the incision of the hook: press, and tighten your threads in four places.
Deinde seca apostema in medio sui, donec quando egreditur quod in eo est: tunc incide superfluitatem cutis, et dimitte quod ligatum est ex ea.	Then dry up the hematoma in its middle, until when it comes out what is in it: then make an incision on the skin, and let go what was tied from it.
Deinde pone super ipsum puluillum quem submersisti in uino, et oleo.	Then put on the top a little wool which you immersed in wine, and oil.
Deinde administra curationem, quae fit cum liciniis et unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then apply the cure, which is done with liniments and unguents, until it heals.
¶ De apostemate quod accidit ex torsione Neruorum.	That which happens from a twist of the neck.
Caput L.	The head.
Sicut accidit apostema in Arteria et Vena, similiter accidit apostema in Neruis: quod accidit in eis percussio, aut accidit a labore superfluo, et similibus: et fit plurimum illis in locis adiutoriorum, aut calcanei, et in omni loco in quo mouentur iuncturae: et est apostema graue.	As has happened with the artery and vein, so has also happened with the nerves: which has happened from a beating, or from excessive work, and in like manner: and it is very useful for them in places of support, or heel, and in any place where the ligaments move: and it is a dark spot.
Similatur color eius reliquo corpori, et est in pluribus dispositionibus absque dolore: et quando stringitur cum uehementia, sentit in eo infirmus simile stupori.	It resembles the color of the rest of the body, and is present in many dispositions without pain: and when it is held with a vibratory movement, it feels in it a similar stupor.
Et non est apostema aggregatum in profundo corporis, imo est sub cute, et ipsum mouetur ad omnem partem, et non uadit ad anteriora, uel ante, neque retro ad posteriora.	And is not an aggregate pustule under the skin, but lies beneath the skin, and moves itself to all parts, and does not affect toward the front, or before, nor behind:
Quod ergo ex eis est in iuncturis, non oportet ut inuadatur cum ferro.	That which then is present in the ligaments does not need to be pricked with a needle.
Fortasse enim accidet contractio.	Perhaps, however, it may happen that contraction occurs:
In illo autem quod ex eis est in capite, aut in fronte, finde cutem cum spatumili.	In that, however, which is present in the head or forehead, find skin with a bristle.
Si ergo est apostema paruum, tunc tene ipsum cum forficibus, et abscinde ipsum a radice.	If then it is a small pustule, then hold it with tweezers and cut it off at the root.
Et si est magnum, tunc suspende ipsum eum uncino, et excoria ipsum: deinde aufer ipsum, et aggrega uulnus cum sutura: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	And if it is large, then hang it by a hook and scrub it off: then remove it, and add the suture: and care for it, until it heals.
¶ De sectione apostematis, quod accidit in uentre.	On the cutting of the pustules, which happens in the belly.
Caput LI.	The head.
Accidunt quibusdam hominibus multotiens in uentribus eorum, et in reliquis corporibus ipsorum, thelil, quae nominantur Fungalia, per similitudinem ipsorum cum fungis.	To some people often happens again and again in their bellies, and in the rest of their bodies, a kind of fungi, which they call "fungii", on account of the similarity of these to fungi.
Quorum radix est subtilis, et ipsorum caput est grossum, et conuersa sunt labia eorum.	The root of these is fine, and their heads are thick, and their lips are turned down.
Et est ex eis paruum: et est ex eis quod magnificatur ualde.	And there are some who grow very large: and there are some who become very thin.
Et ego quidem iam uidi uirum, et in uentre eius erant duo thelil, quae erant magis quam rebus aliis similia fungis: non erat differentia inter ea, alba, minutae radicis, et inuersabantur labia eorum, et findebantur, et humiditas currebat ex eis semper.	And indeed I have already seen a man, and within his abdomen there were two small things, which were greater than other similar fungi: there was no difference between them, white, with minute roots, and their lips were intertwined, and they ended, and moisture always ran out of them.
Incidi ergo ea, et inueni in pondere unius quasi X et VIII uncia et in altero quasi VI uncia Et operatio in incisione eorum est, ut consideres tunc, si infirmus est humidus, et color thelil est albus, humidum, subtilis radicis: tunc incide ipsum cum spatumili lato, et sint in praesentia tua cauteria in igne.	So I have cut them open, and I found in weight one as if ten and eight ounces and the other as if six ounces; And the operation of cutting them is so that you consider then, if he is weak, moist, and the color of the fungus is white, moist, with a thin root: Then cut him with a broad chisel, and let cauterization be in your presence on fire.
Multotiens enim expellitur apud sectionem eius sanguis multus: propera ergo si te uincit sanguis, tunc cauteriza ipsum.	For many times blood is discharged during the incision: so then if you are overcome by blood, then cauterize him.
Quod si uides infirmum pauidum et timidum ab incisione cum ferro, tunc accipe filum ex plumbo decenter factum, et stringe cum eo athelul: cuius modus est quem diximus, et dimitte ipsum duobus diebus.	That if you see him weak, trembling because of the incision with iron, then take a wire made from lead that is made to waver, and hold it with him: whose way is what we have said, and let him go after two days.
Deinde adde in strictura plumbi.	Then add to the constriction of lead.
Non ergo cesses stringere plumbum, quotiens imprimit in thelil, donec abscindatur, et cadat per se absque labore.	So do not cease to constrict lead, whenever it presses on the fungus, until it is cut off, and falls of itself without work.
Si autem thelil grossae fuerit radicis, tunc in incisione eius est quiddam timoris et pauoris: praecipue quod est in uentre.	If the fungus is large in root, then there is some fear and trembling in the incision: especially since it is in the abdomen.
Verumtamen possibile est, ut incidas medietatem eius.	However, it is possible that you cut off half of it.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum, ut non redeat.	Then cauterize him, so that he does not shed.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur uulnus.	Then care for the wound, until it heals.
Et caue ne praesumas incidere thelil quod est fusci coloris, pauci sensus, foedi aspectus: ipsum enim est apostema cancerosum: et ego ueniam cum rememoratione Cancri post hoc.	And do not suspect that the fungus which is of a dark color, little sense, and an appetizing appearance: for it is an ulcerous cancer: and I come with a remembrance of Cancer after this.
¶ De cura eminentiae Vmbilici.	On the care of the eminence of the umbilicus.
Caput LII.	Head II.
Fit eminentia Vmbilici ex caussis multis.	Emancipation of the umbilicus is due to various causes.
Aut ex fissuris sifac, quod super uentrem est: et exit ex eo althub, aut intestinum, secundum quod accidit in reliquis rupturis.	It comes out from the fissures that are above the navel: and it issues forth from it, either as anus or intestine, according to what happens in the other ruptures.
Aut ex sanguine qui fluit ex Vena, aut ex Arteria, secundum quod praemissum est.	Or from the blood that flows out of a vein, or from an artery, according to what has been said above.
Aut ex uentositate coartata in eo.	Or from the windiness confined within it.
Si autem est propter fissuram sifac, et exitum thirbi: tunc est color apostematis similis colori corporis: et est lene, absque dolore: et apparet diuersi situs.	But if, on the other hand, it comes out through a fissure that is sifac, and the discharge is dirty: then it is like the color of bloody pus: and it is slimy, without pain: and it seems to be in different locations.
Et si est propter egressionem intestini, tunc est situs eius, cum eo quod narrauimus, uehementioris diuersitatis.	And if, on the other hand, it is because of the exit of the intestine: then its site is with that which we have described, more varied in character.
Cum ergo tu premis ipsum digitis tuis, occultatur: deinde redit, et fortasse est cum eo sonitus: et magnificatur multum apud introitum balnei, et laborem uehaementum.	When you press it with your fingers, it is hidden: but then it returns, and perhaps there is a sound with it: and it makes a lot of noise at the entrance to the wind, and a rumbling noise.
Si uero est propter humiditatem, est lene, tunc non occultatur quando premis ipsum manu tua, neque constringium, neque additur.	But if, on the other hand, it is because of humidity, it is slimy, then it does not hide when you press it with your hand, nor does it become tighter, nor does it get added.
Quod si est propter sanguinem, tunc cum istis signis apparet apostema ad nigredinem de cliue.	If, on the other hand, it is because of blood, then with these signs appears a swelling that turns black at the edge.
Si autem est propter carnem natam: tunc est apostema graue, grossum, durum, et figitur secundum quantitatem unam.	But if it is because of a born flesh: then it is a grayish, thick, hard swelling, and it forms one unit in quantity.
Si uero est propter uentositatem, tunc tactus eius est lenis.	But if it is because of windiness, then the touch of it is gentle.
Et operatio in illo est, ut consideres tunc, si eminentia umbilici est propter sanguinem Arteriae, aut Venae, aut uentositatem: tunc oportet ut prohibearis a curatione eius.	And the operation in it is this: if you note that the prominent umbilicus is because of blood from an artery, or vein, or windiness: then you should refrain from treating it.
Nam in illo est timor et pauor, sicut docui te in capitulo, in quo dixi apostemata propter arteriam et uenam.	For there is danger and fear in it, as I taught you in the chapter where I said that swelling comes because of an artery or vein.
Quod si eminentia umbilici est propter intestinum, aut zirbum: tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmo, quatenus teneat anhelitum suum, et stet stans extensus.	If the prominent umbilicus is because of an intestine or a hernia: then you should order the sick person to hold his breath and stand with his arms extended.
Deinde signa cum encaustro in circumitu umbilici totius.	Then the signs with caustic around the navel of the whole.
Postea praecipe ei, ut resupinetur inter manus tuas super dorsum suum.	Then order him to lie down on his back between your hands.
Deinde circunda cum spatumili lato in circumitu umbilici super locum quem signasti cum encaustro.	Then surround the navel with a hot iron knife at the place you marked with caustic.
Postea extende medium apostematis ad superiora, cum uncino magno.	Then extend the middle part of the skin from above, with a large hook.
Deinde liga eum in circumitu forti cum filo, aut cum chorda de serico ligamento firmo: et sit nodus ligamenti alenxotati.	Then tie him tightly around the navel with a strong thread or silk cord: and let the knot of the tied cord be attached.
Deinde aperi medium apostematis extensum supra ligamentum.	Then open the middle part of the skin that has been extended above the ligment.
Si ergo inueneris ipsum iam captum a ligamento: tunc extrahe alenxotati, et intromitte in ipsum digitum indicem, et impelle intestinum ad interiora uentris: et si inueneris zirbum, tunc accipe ipsum cum uncino, et incide superfluitatem eius.	If you have already found the navel caught on the ligment: then remove the ligment and push it into the navel with the index finger: and if there is a hernia, then take it with the hook and cut off its excess.
Si autem contraria est tibi arteria, aut uena: tunc circunda ipsum multum.	If, however, the opposite side is a blood vessel or an artery: then surround it very much.
Deinde redi ad operationem tuam.	Then turn to your own operation.
Et accipe duas acus, et intromitte in eis duo fila fortia: et intromitte duas acus in circumitu quem fecisti circa apostema in modum crucis, quas facis penetrare.	And take two needles and introduce two strong threads into them: and introduce the two needles around the one you have made around the swelling in the form of a cross, which you make penetrate.
Deinde stringe apostema in quatuor locis super acus: et si uis, aufer acus, et dimitte locum, donec putrefiat caro extensa: et cadat per se: aut incide ipsam quando subtiliatur et putrefit.	Then tighten the swelling at four places on the needles: and if there is a vein, remove the needle, and let it rest until the flesh has rotted away: and let it fall of itself: or cut it off when it becomes thin and rotten.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod oportet ex unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then take care of the swelling with the ointment as needed until it heals.
Quod si eminentia umbilici est ex carne nara in eo, aut ex humiditate: tunc oportet ut concaues apostema, sicut diximus.	That if the prominence of the navel is from flesh inside or from moisture: then you should seal up the swelling, as we have said.
Et extrahas sanguinem, aut humiditatem, quam inuenis in eo.	And draw out the blood, or the moisture that has entered it.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod solidat locum.	Then take care of the swelling to make the place solidify.
¶ De cura CANCRI.	Of the treatment of cancer.
Caput LIII.	Chapter LIII.
Iam diximus in diuisione species Cancri, et qualiter est uia ad curationem eius cum medicinis: et cauendum ab eo cum curatione eius cum ferro, ut non ulceretur: et diximus Cancrum generatum in matrice, et cautelam a curatione eius.	We have already spoken at some length about the types of cancer and how to treat it with medicine: and how to beware of treating it with iron so that it does not ulcerate: and we spoke about cancer generated in the womb, and about caution in its treatment.
Et dixerunt antiqui, quod quandoque Cancer est in loco, ubi possibilis est eius eradicatio: sicut Cancer qui est in mammillis, aut in coxa, et eis similibus, ex membris locatis ad extrahendum totum eius: praecipue quando est incipiens paruus.	And the ancients said, that whenever cancer is at a place where its eradication is possible: such as cancer that is in the breast, or in the thigh, and those similar to it, from the member located to extract all of it: especially when it is beginning to parous.
Quando uero antiquatur, et est magnus, non oportet ut appropinques ei.	When, however, the cancer has been long established, and is great, it is not necessary that you approach it.
Ego enim non potui sanare ex eo aliquem: neque uidi alium ante me qui peruenerit ad illud.	For I cannot heal from it myself: nor did I see anyone else who has recovered from it.
Et operatio in eo, quando est locatus sicut diximus, est, ut praecedas, et soluas infirmum ex cholera nigra aliquotiens.	And the operation in it, when it is located as we have said, is, as it were, to go before and to loosen the sick from black cholera sometimes.
Deinde phlebotoma ipsum si inuenis cum repletione manifesta.	Then phlebotomy itself if it is with evident swelling of the venes.
Deinde praepara infirmum praeparatione, in qua locetur cum operatione.	Then prepare the sick with preparation, in which he is located with the operation.
Deinde proiice in Cancrum uncinos qui conueniunt ei.	Then throw into the cancer the hooks that suit it.
Postea concaua ipsum ab omni parte cum cute, secundum perscrutationem, donec non remaneat aliquid ex radicibus eius: et dimitte sanguinem currere, et non abscindas ipsum uelociter, imo exprime loca, et absterge sanguinem grossum totum manu tua, aut cum quo possibile est ibi ex instrumentis.	Then wrap up the whole with skin, according to the examination, until there is nothing left of its roots: and let not the blood flow, and do not tear it away quickly, except you express the places, and wipe off the gross blood entirely by hand, or with whatever is possible there.
Si autem contrarietatem facit tibi fluxus sanguinis grossi ex incisione arteriae, aut uenae: tunc cauteriza uenam, donec abscindatur sanguis.	If, however, the opposite makes you flow of gross blood from the incision of an artery or a vein: then cauterize the vein until the blood is separated.
Deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then take care of the cancer with the remaining cure, until it heals.
¶ De cura Hydropisis.	§ On curative hydropesis.
Caput LIIII.	CHAPTER LII. ON THE TREATMENT OF WATER IN THE B
Iam narrauimus in diuisione species Hydropisis, et qualiter fit aggregatio aquae: et signa omnis speciei, et curationem eius cum medicinis.	I have spoken so far on the division of species of hydropesis and how the aggregation of water is made: and the signs of each species, and its cure with medicines.
Et illa quae curatur cum ferro, non est nisi species asclitis sola: et non approximatur cum ferro speciei timpanitis: neque speciei hyposarcae penitus: nam illud mortale est.	And those that are cured by iron do not approach except a single species of asclepius: and does not approach the iron of the hyposarcis species: for this is deadly.
Quando tu iam medicatus es hanc speciem Hydropisis timpanitis cum medicinis, et non contulit medicatio tua: tunc considera.	When you had begun to treat with this species of hydropesis as a tympanic with medicines, and your treatment did not succeed: then reflect.
Nam si infirmo iam consecuta est debilitas, aut est cum eo infirmitas alia praeter Hydropisim: sicut si sit cum eo tussis, aut uentris solutio, et similia illis: tunc caue ne mediceris ei cum ferro: quoniam est timor illud.	If the disease has already advanced and there is a concomitant weakness or other infirmity besides hydropisis: as if there is a cough with him, or a loosing of the eye, and things like these: then beware that you do not meddle with him with iron: for there is fear in this.
Si autem uides infirmum exuberantis uirtutis, neque est cum eo aegritudo praeter Hydropisim solam: et non est puer, neque senex: tunc modus operationis in eo est, ut tu eleues infirmum stantem inter manus tuas, et minister post ipsum exprimat uentrem eius manu sua impellendo aquam ad inferiorem partem pectinis.	But if you see a person with an abundance of vigor and strength who is not sick except for hydropisis: and he is not a boy, nor an old man: then the method of operation in him is, that you stand him between your hands, and let him squirt the fluid from his hand toward the lower part of the chest.
Deinde accipe spatumile spinosum, secundum hanc formam.	Then take a small piece of wood with thorns, shaped like this.
Sit duarum partium acutarum, longum, acutae extremitatis sicut Spatumile.	Set the two sharp ends, one long, and the acute extremity like a sputumile.
Verumtamen in eo sit quiddam breuitatis paulatim, ut non pertranseas cum eo apud operationem usque ad intestinum, et laedas ipsum.	But in him there should be something that opens gradually, so that you do not harm him with the operation up to the intestine, and you leave him alone.
Deinde considera.	Then consider.
Nam si est generatio Hydropisis ex parte intestinorum, tunc oportet ut elongeris cum sectione ab umbilico quantitate trium digitorum, ad inferiora in directo eius supra pectinem.	For if the generation of hydropisis is from the part of the intestines, then it should be extended with a section of three fingers' length from the navel directly below the chest.
Si uero generatio Hydropisis est propter aegritudinem epatis: tunc sit sectio tua sinistra ab umbilico tribus digitis.	But if the generation of hydropisis is due to liver disease: then your section should be on the left from the navel by three fingers' length.
Et si generatio eius est propter splenem, tunc sit sectio in latere dextro: et non oportet etiam ut sit sectio in latere super quod uult iacere infirmus, ut non currant superfluitates ad illum locum debilem.	And if the generation of it is due to the spleen, then your section should be on the right side: and it should not also be that the sick person lies on his back, so that fluids do not run to that weak place.
Deinde perfora cum instrumento cutem totam.	Then pierce the skin with a tool all around.
Deinde intromitte in illam sectionem, et eleua manum tuam cum Spatumili inter cutem, et sifac, quasi tu excories ipsum: et sit quantitas quae excoriatur quantitas unguis, aut circiter ilud.	Then introduce into that section, and squeeze with your hand with the sputumile between the skin, and rub it as if you were cleaning him out: and let the amount that is squeezed be the amount of a nail, or around that area.
Deinde perfora sifac, donec perueniat Spatumile ad locum uacuum: et est locus aquae.	Then pierce the skin until the sputumile reaches a vacuum spot: and that is a place of water.
Deinde extrahe ipsum, et intromitte in foramen instrumentum, cuius haec est forma.	Then extract the flesh, and insert an instrument into this opening.
Et est simile cannulae: fit ex argento, aut aere, aut aurichalco, lene, tersum: cui in inferiori parte sui est foramen paruum, et in lateribus eius sunt tria foramina, duo ab una parte, et unum a parte altera: et facia est extremitas eius incisa, secundum modum incisionis calami, sicut uides: in extremitate eius superiore est armilla.	And it is similar to a tube: it is made from silver, or brass, or gold, or linden wood, or tin: and in its lower part there is a small opening, and on the sides of it there are three openings, two on one side, and one on the other side: and the end of it should be sharpened according to the way that a penknife is sharpened, as you see; and at the top of its end there is an armlet.
Nam quando instrumentum peruenit ad aquam, tunc ipsa descendit statim super instrumentum, ergo euacua ex aqua in hora quantitatem mediam.	For when the instrument reaches the water, it descends immediately on top of the instrument; therefore it drains from the water at a medium rate of quantity.
Quoniam si tu euacuas ex ea plus quam oportet, in hora fortasse moritur infirmus per resolutionem spiritus sui animalis: aut accidit ei syncopis quae appropinquat morti.	For if you drain from it more than is necessary, perhaps a weak person may die through the loss of his animal spirit: or something may happen to him that approaches death.
Verum euacua ex ea secundum quantitatem uirtutis eius, et secundum quod significant tibi dispositiones infirmi ex uirtute pulsus eius, et ex bonitate eius.	But drain from it according to the strength of its power, and according to what you are instructed by its pulsation, and by the goodness of its nature.
Deinde extrahe instrumentum, et retine aquam.	Then remove the instrument and retain the water.
Quod est, quia retinetur statim propter cutem quae retinet foramen quod est super sifac: de quo narraui, ut perfores ipsum secundum illum modum.	That is, because it retains immediately by reason of the skin which retains the opening that is above the syphons: of which I tell you, so that you perform it according to that method.
Deinde itera instrumentum die altero, si uides infirmum tolerare illud: et extrahe etiam ex aqua quantitatem paruam.	Then repeat the instrument on the other day, if you see that it can bear that treatment: and remove also from the water a quantity of water that is small.
Fac illud diebus aliquot sine timore, et custodi te ab errore: donec non remaneat ex aqua nisi parum.	Do that for some days without fear, and guard yourself against error: until there remains in the water only a little.
Si autem times super infirmum, et dimittis ex aqua rem multam: tunc cura ipsum cum sepultura in harena calida, et sudore multo in balneo et sole, et expectet super sitim: et cura ipsum cum medicinis exiccatiuis, donec sanetur: et cauteriza super stomachum, et epar, et splenem, post extractionem aquae: secundum quod narraui in eo quod praecessit.	But if you are treating a weak person, and you let go of a great deal of water: then take care of him with a grave disease in warm sand, and with much sweat in a bath and in the sun, and wait for hunger: and take care of him with dried-up medicines, until he is healed; and cauterize his stomach, and his entrails, and his spleen, after removing the water: following which I tell you that preceded it.
¶ De cura infantium qui nascuntur locis urinae eorum non perforatis.	Of the care of infants who are born with their bladder places not pierced.
Caput LV.	Chapter LVI.
Quando egreditur aliquis infantium ex uentre matris suae, et caput mutonis eius est non perforatum, aut est foramen strictum, aut in non suo loco.	When any baby is born from the womb of its mother, and the head of its penis is not pierced, or the foramen is closed, or is not in its place.
Oportet ergo succurrere cum perforatione eius statim cum nascitur cum Spatumili subtili ualde, secundum hanc formam.	Therefore it is necessary to help with the piercing of it immediately when it is born with a delicate needle, according to this form.
Deinde pone in foramine clauum subtilem ex plumbo, et liga ipsum: et tene ipsum tribus diebus, aut quatuor.	Then put on the hole a thin plug of lead, and bind it: and hold it three days, or four.
Quando ergo uult urinam emittere, remoueatur, et mingat.	When then he wants to emit urine, let it be moved, and let it go away.
Deinde reduc ipsum.	Then reduce the penis.
Et si tu non ponis plumbum, iam possibile est, ut urina quae incedit super locum, non permittat ipsum claudi.	And if you do not put lead on, it is possible that urine which runs over the place, does not allow the penis to be closed.
Ille autem cuius foramen est strictum, medicatur cum plumbo, sicut diximus, diebus multis, donec amplificetur.	But he whose foramen is closed, is treated with lead, as we have said, for many days, until it is enlarged.
Illi autem in quibus est foramen in non suo loco, laeduntur.	But those in whom the foramen is not in its place, are wounded.
Quod est, quia ex eis qui nascitur, foramen est apud finem capitis uirgae: quare non potest mingere ad anteriora, donec eleuat uirgam manu sua ad superiora.	Which is, because from the one who is born, the foramen is at the end of the penis head: why it cannot urinate in front, until it raises its penis with its hand to the top.
Neque est ei generatio, propterea, quod sperma non potest peruenire ad matricem secundum rectitudinem: et est aegritudo foeda ualde.	And there is no generation for him, therefore semen cannot reach the womb according to its straightness: and it is a bad disease.
Et modus operationis in illo est, ut resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum.	And the mode of action in that is, so that it lies down on its back.
Deinde extende caput uirgae eius manu tua sinistra extensione uehementi, et incide caput capitis uirgae ex loco priapi, cum acumine, aut spatumili acuto: sicut est incisio calami, aut sicut tu radis aliquid, ut medium eius ueniat simile capiti uirgae: et ut cadat foramen in medio secundum quod oportet.	Then extend the penis head with your left hand by a forceful extension, and cut the head of the penis from the right place with an edge, or a sharp needle: like the cut of a pen, or like you cut something, so that it resembles the head of the penis in shape: and let the foramen fall in the middle according to what should be.
Et caue tibi apud operationem tuam a fluxu sanguinis.	And cause yourself to be near to the flow of blood during your operation.
Multotiens enim accidit illud.	That often happens.
Oppone ergo ei cum eo quod abscindit sanguinem, et cura uulnus, donec sanetur.	Therefore, I did not go with him when he cut off his blood, and healed the wound, until it healed.
¶ De Albather quae accidunt in praeputio et capite uigae, et corruptione, nigredine, et adhaerentia.	Regarding the wounds on the foreskin and scalp, and their putrefaction, blackening, and adherence.
Caput LVI.	The head.
Multotiens accidunt istae Albather in uirga, et est eminentia carnis foedae.	Often such wounds occur on the penis, and there is an abundance of foul flesh.
Et ex ea alia est maligna, et alia non maligna.	And from it one kind of wound is evil and another not evil.
Non malignam ergo oportet ut suspendas cum uncino subtili, et abscindas eam, donec mundes eam totam.	So you should not hang the non-evil one with a small hook, and cut it off, until you have completely removed all of it.
Deinde pone super eam cotum submersum in unguento aegyptio.	Then put on top of it a vat submerged in Egyptian ointment.
Deinde cura ipsum post illud cum unguento dyafinicon, donec sanetur.	Then care for the wound with daphnic acid after that, until it heals.
Quod si Albather est maligna, foedi coloris, tunc oportet ut administres in ea cauterium post incisionem eius et ipsius rasionem.	If the wound is evil and of a foul color, then you should administer cauterization to it after cutting it and rasping it.
Si autem Albather est in praeputio captiui, non circumcisi, et est pars Albather inter praeputium, et pars eius extra: tunc oportet ut auferas Albather, quae est intus in primis, donec quando consolidatur, tunc cura ipsum exterius: quoniam quando tu curas eam simul, non securatur praeputium quin preforetur.	But if the wound is on the foreskin, which has not been circumcised, and a part of the wound is inside the foreskin and another outside it: then you should remove the wound that is inside the foreskin first, until it is properly healed, then care for the outside wound: because when you care for it at the same time, the foreskin does not heal securely without perforating it.
Et iam accidunt etiam in testiculis, et praeputio nigredo et corruptio.	And now I will also say about wounds that occur on the testicles and on the foreskin, blackness and putrefaction:
Oportet ergo, ut tu concaues totum quod iam denigratum est, et quod uult corrumpi, aut iam corruptum est.	Then you should bring together everything that has been blackened so far, and what seeks to corrupt, or what is already corrupted.
Deinde line super ipsum post illud cum melle quod iam concussum est cum farina corticum granatorum, et herbi tritorum cribellatorum.	Then put a line of honey on top of it that has already been crushed with wheat flour and dried with the crisping tongs.
Deinde cura illud cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then care for that one with the remaining cure, until it heals.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis, tunc administra cauterium cum cauterio lunari, secundum hanc formam.	But if blood flow occurs, then administer cauterization with lunar cautery, according to this form.
Cauterium enim est iuuatiuum ad duas dispositiones simul, scilicet ad fluxum sanguinis, et uulnus quando corrumpitur.	For cauterization is of two dispositions at the same time, namely to the blood flow and to the wound when it corrupts.
Quod si corroditur caput uirgae, et destruitur totum in hora: tunc oportet ut intromittas in meatum priapi cannulam ex plumbo, ut mingat infirmus super eam.	If the head of the vagina is corroded and it is completely destroyed in an hour: then you should insert a suitable tube of lead into the meatus so that the sick person urinates on it.
In adhaerentia uero praeputii cum capite uirgae, et haec quidem adhaerentia non accidit, nisi in eo cuius praeputium est sanum, et non exigitur super ipsum circumcisio: et quandoque accidit adhaerentia propter uulnus, aut apostema: oportet ergo ut excories eam cum Spatumili obtuso, donec soluatur ligamentum, et liberetur caput uirgae ab omni parte.	But in reality the prepuce adheres to the head of the vagina, and this type of adhesion does not occur unless the prepuce is healthy, and circumcision is not required on it; and when an adhesion occurs due to a wound or hematoma, then you should cut it with a dull chisel until the ligament is dissolved and the head of the vagina is freed from all parts.
Quod si est difficile discernere ea exquisite, tunc oportet ut excories aliquid ex capite uirgae, et ex praeputio.	If it is difficult to distinguish it well, then you should cut a little from the head of the vagina and from the foreskin.
Quod est, quia praeputium quando est subtile, fortasse perforatur propter subtilitatem suam uelociter.	Because the foreskin is thin, it may be pierced quickly due to its thinness.
Deinde separa inter praeputium, et caput uirgae cum panno lini subtili, qui iam madefactus est in aqua frigida, ut non adhereant iterum.	Then separate the foreskin and the head of the vagina with a thin linen cloth, which has already been soaked in cold water so that it does not adhere again.
Deinde curetur cum uino stiptico, donec consolidetur.	Then treat with wine containing Styphle, until it hardens.
¶ De mundificatione infantium, et curatione ex errore eis accidente.	For the purification of infants and treatment from an accident by mistake.
Caput LVII.	Chapter LVII.
Circumcisio non est solutio continuitatis, sicut reliqua uulnera: uerumtamen cum sit ex operatione nostra, uoluntate nostra, et usus eius sit in pueris proprie, est necesse ut signemus in ea operationem meliorem, et uiam leuiorem perducentem ad salutem.	Circumcision is not a cure for continence, as are the other wounds; however, it is an improvement on our wish and its use in young people is beneficial. We must mark this operation as better and more likely to lead to health.
Dico ergo, quod antiqui non dixerunt circumcisionem in aliquo suorum librorum: quoniam non utuntur in legibus suis, et non est nisi quod acquisiuimus per experimentum.	I say, the old people did not say anything about circumcision in any of their books: because they do not use it in their laws, and it is only what we have acquired through experimentation.
Quod est, quia ego inueni maiorem partem artificum, et phlebotomatorum uti mundificatione, circumcidendo cum nouacula, et cum forficibus: et utuntur alfecati, et ligaudo cum filo, et incisione cum ungula.	That is because I have discovered most of the arts, and the use of leeches and bloodletting for purification, circumcision with a blade and with forceps: they use them to remove the skin, and bind with thread, and incise with a nail.
Et ego quidem iam probaui omnes istos modos, et non inueni meliorem mundificatione cum forficibus, et ligamento cum filo.	I have already tested all these methods and found that there is no better way to clean with forceps and thread than ligation.
Quoniam in mundificatione cum nouacula, multotiens effugit cutis.	For when it comes to cleaning with forceps, the skin often heals well.
Quoniam cutis praeputii duas habet tunicas: ergo forsitan inciditur cutis superior, et temanet tunica inferior: cogitur ergo ad incisionem ad incidendum alteram, et dolorem futurum.	Since the foreskin has two layers of skin, it is possible that one layer may be incised and the other left intact; consider then that the lower layer may be incised as well, causing pain.
Et cum mundificatione quae fit per alfecati, id est, digitalis, quo utuntur sutores, non securatur incisio extremitatis uirilis membri: quoniam fortasse ingreditur in foramen eius.	And since the cleaning done with the finger, that is, the digital method used by surgeons, does not secure the incision at the tip of the male member, it is possible that it may be inserted into a cavity.
In mundificatione autem cum ungula, fortasse euadit ferrum, et corrumpit operationem tuam: et cutis quidem pueri est breuis natura, et multotiens nascuntur taliter, quod non indigent mundificatione: et iam uidi illud.	But in cleaning with nails, there is a risk of breaking the iron, and ruining your operation; and since the skin of the boy is short by nature, and often grows so that it does not need cleaning; I have already seen this.
Mundificationis autem cum forficibus, et ligamento cum filo, bonum experimentum detexit mihi: quoniam forfices sunt proportionalis incisionis: propterea, quod acuitas quae est superius, est sicut acuitas quae est inferius.	But in cleaning with forceps and thread, I have found by experimentation that this is good; since the forceps are of a proportion to make the incision, so that the sharpness above is like the sharpness below.
Cum ergo premis manum tuam, proportionantur duae acuitates, et incidunt secundum operationem unam in tempore uno: et fit compressio simili figura, continens cutem uirgae ab omni parte, cum qua non cadit error omnino.	So when you press your hand, the two sharpnesses are proportioned, and they incise one second at a time in the same operation; and it forms a compression of a similar shape, containing the skin of the penis from all sides, so that there is no mistake at all.
Et modus operationis propriae est, ut facias extimare, puerum praecipue, si est ex eis qui intelligunt parumper, quod tu non facis, nisi quod ligas filum in uirga sua tantum: et dimittas ipsum usque ad diem alium.	And the method of operation is special, so that you can make a quick decision, especially if he is from those who understand somewhat, which you do not do unless you tie the thread on his penis only: and let him go until the next day.
Deinde fac eum gaudere et laetari omnimodo quo possibile est tibi illud, ex eo quod recipit intelligentia sua.	Then let him be happy and enjoy himself in all ways possible for you, since he accepts his understanding.
Deinde fac eum stare inter manus tuas praeparatae staturae, et non sit sedens: et occulta forfices in manica tua, aut sub pede tuo, ne uideat eos puer omnino, neque aliquid ex instrumentis.	Then let him stand between your hands prepared to stand, and not sitting; and conceal the forceps in your sleeve or under your foot, so that the boy does not see them at all, nor any of the instruments.
Deinde intromitte manum tuam ad uirgam eius, et suffla in cutem, et trahe eam sursum, donec egrediatur caput uirgae.	Then put your hand on his penis, and blow into the skin, and pull it up, until the head of the penis comes out.
Deinde mundifica ipsam ex eo quod aggregatur in ea sordicie.	Then clean yourself from that which has gathered there in filthiness.
Deinde liga locum signatum cum filo duplo.	Then bind the marked spot with a double knot.
Postea liga inferius eo parumper ligamentum secundum.	Then bind below it to the same extent as the second ligature.
Deinde tene cum indice tuo, et pollice locum ligamenti inferioris retentione bona, et incide inter duo ligamenta.	Then hold with your index finger and thumb between the two ligatures where the lower one is held in place, and cut between them.
Deinde eleua cutem sursum uelociter, et extrahe caput uirgae.	Then wash the skin quickly upwards, and pull out the head of the penis.
Deinde dimitte sanguinem currere paulatim (est enim melius) et pone puluerem desuper: et super puluerem pannum in quo expansus est uitellus oui decocti in aqua rosata, concussum cum oleo ros recenti bono: et dimitte eum super ipsum usque ad diem alium: et cura ipsum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then let the blood run away little by little (for it is better) and put on top of the powder: and over the powder a cloth in which the bandage has been expanded, washed with rosin-oiled water, crushed with fresh rosewater: and leave it on itself until another day: and take care of the rest by curing, until it heals.
Forma autem forficis ad mundificationem haec est.	The shape of the clamp for cleaning is like this.
Sint hebetes duae extremitates, et sint incidentes: ne egrediatur in eis ramus claui: et sit longitudo duarum acuitatum, sicut longitudo duorum manubriorum aequaliter.	The two ends should be even and not project, and the length of the sharp points should be equal to the length of the two hands.
Error uero cadens in mundificatione est: quoniam fortasse effugit cutis intrinseca tota, aut pars eius apud incisionem.	But a mistake in cleaning is this: for it may well avoid all skin, or some part of it near the cut.
Ergo oportet, ut extendas eam ex hora tua cum ungue tuo ante apostemationem loci: et incidas eam secundum aequalitatem.	So you should spread it out from your own time with your nail before examining the place: and cut it to equality.
Quod si non potes tenere eam cum ungue tuo, tunc extrahe eam cum uncino, et incide eam.	If you cannot hold it with your nail, then take it out with a clamp, and cut it.
Si autem praeterierint ei tres dies, et remanet quod est sub uirga inflatum, apostematum: tunc dimitte illud, donec sedetur apostema calidum, et excoria illud cum facilitate, et incide illud secundum quod praeparatur tibi: et caue tibi a capite uirgae.	But if it has passed three days and what is under the penis inflated, infected: then let it go until the infection subsides, and wash it well, and cut it as you prepare yourself: and make sure that you do not hurt yourself with the head of the penis.
Non enim nocebit ei illud.	That will not harm him.
Cura ergo illud cum eo quod consolidat uulnus ex pulueribus, quos narrauimus in tractatu de pulueribus: et si inciditur ex cute supra mensuram, et euadit ad superiora, non nocet ei illud etiam.	Take care that the powder does not harden on him which we described in the book about powders: and if it cuts into the skin above the line, and runs upward, it does no harm to him either.
Cura ergo illud cum eo quod diximus, donec sanetur.	Therefore treat this with what we have said, until it is healed.
¶ De extractione Vrinae retentae in uesica.	On the extraction of a retained wren from the bladder.
Caput LVIII.	Head LVIII.
Urinae retentio in uesica, fit ab opilatione facta ex lapide, aut sanguine congelato, aut pus, aut carne nata, et similibus illis ex eis quae diximus ex modis curationis in diuisione.	Retention of urine in the bladder is due to an operation carried out because of a stone, blood congealed, pus, or meat grown, and similar conditions from those we have spoken of in the division of treatment.
Et si non soluitur Vrina, et uides retentionem eius esse propter Lapidem, qui iam est in collo uesicae: tunc oportet ut sit infirmus super genua sua curuatus.	And if the wren is not resolved, and you see that the retention is because of a stone which is now in the neck of the bladder: then it is necessary that the patient be cured lying on his knees.
Deinde componantur pedes eius super dorsum eius, et extendat uentrem suum ex superiori parte dorsi eius, et stringat infirmus anhelitum suum quantum possibile est ei.	Then they shall arrange his feet on his back, and he shall extend his belly from the upper part of his back, and the patient shall restrain his desire to defecate as much as is possible for him.
Cogitur ergo cum collo uesicae ad expulsionem Lapidis ad posteriora: quare absoluitur Vrina.	Therefore it is calculated with the neck of the bladder for the expulsion of the stone to the rear: why is the wren resolved.
Quod si non soluitur cum eo quod diximus, et uehemens sit res super infirmum: tunc oportet ut administres extractionem eius cum instrumento, quod nominatur siringa, cuius haec est forma Sit ex argento, et sit subtile, lene, concauum sicut cannula pennae auis in subtilitate radii, longum in similitudine palmi unius et medii: cui sit cannula subtilis in capite eius.	That if it is not resolved with what we have said, and the pain is continued on the patient: then it is necessary that you administer the extraction with an instrument which is called a syringe, which has this shape: it is of silver, and it is fine, smooth, and sharp like the cannula of a bird's feather in its subtility, long like the palm of a hand and the middle one; and which has a subtile cannula on its tip.
Et modus exitus Vrinae per ipsum est, ut accipias filum duplicatum, et liges in extremitate eius lanam, aut cotum, ligatura bona: et intromittas extremitatem fili in inferiori parte Siringae: et incide cum forficibus si superfluit aliquid ex lana, uerum intromitte in cannulam cum uehementia, sicut alzer.	And the mode of exit of the wren through it is so that you take a double thread, and tie it at its end with good knot: and insert the end of the thread into the lower part of the syringe: and strike with forceps if there is anything excessive of wool; but truly insert it in the cannula with care, as it were a twig.
Deinde inunge siringam cum oleo, aut cum butyro, et albugine oui: et fac sedere infirmum super sedem, et embroca uesicam, et ipsius uirgam cum oleis humidis, et oleo oliuae, et aqua tepida.	Then dip the syringe in oil, or in butter, and in Alba (white) wool: and make the patient sit on a chair, and introduce the bladder, and his thread with moist oils, and olive oil, and warm water.
Deinde intromitte siringam in uirgam cum facilitate, donec perueniat ad radicem uirgae.	Then introduce the syringe into the penis with ease, until it reaches the root of the penis.
Deinde dupla ipsam superius a parte umbilici.	Then double the string over the top part near the navel.
Deinde impelle siringam intra ipsam, donec perueniat ad Vesicam, et sentiat eam infirmus iam peruenisse ad rem uacuam: et non fit hoc secundum hunc ordinem, nisi quoniam meatus, in quo uadit, est in quo est tortuositas.	Then push the syringe inside itself until it reaches the bladder, and let him feel that he has already come to an end of relieving himself: and do not make this second order unless the meatus, in which you urinate, is bent.
Deinde extende filum cum lana paulatim.	Then extend the string with a wool slowly.
Vrina enim sequetur lanam.	For the wool follows the thread.
Deinde extrahe eam, et fac currere Vrinam per uiam urinae: et itera siringam, et non cesses facere illud, donec euacuetur uesica, et inueniat infirmus alleuiationem.	Then draw it out, and let the scrotum run along the penis-hole: and again introduce the syringe, and do not cease doing that, until the bladder is emptied, and you feel relief of pain.
¶ De qualitate clisterizationis uesicae cum Clepshydra.	Of the quality of washing the bladder with a clepsydra.
Caput LIX.	Chapter LIX.
Quando accidit in uesica ulcus, aut sanguis in ea congelatur, aut coartatur in ea pus, et uis distillare in eam aquas et medicinas: tunc fiat cum instrumento quod nominatur Clepshydra, et haec est forma eius.	When there is an ulcer in the bladder, or blood congeals in it, or pus is gathered in it, and water and medicines are to be distilled into it: then make use of an instrument called a clepsydra, and this is its shape.
Est enim surda, id est, clausa.	It is an opaque vessel, that is, closed.
Et in eo sunt tria foramina, duo ex parte una, et unum ex parte altera, sicut uides.	And in it are three holes, two on one side and one on the other side, as you see them.
Et locus concauus, in quo est illud quod impellit, sit secundum quantitatem quod opilet ipsum sine additione, donec quando trahitur cum eo aliquid, ex humiditatibus attrahatur: et quando impellitur, cum eo expellatur ad longinquum: secundum quod facit clepshydra, qua proiicitur naphta, id est, ignis graecus in praeliis martis.	And the concave place, in which is placed the thing that pushes it without addition, until when it is drawn out with it something is attracted from the moistures: and when it is pushed, together with it, at a distance: according to which the clepsydra drops naphtha, that is, Greek fire in battles on the field.
Cum ergo uis proiicere humiditates in uesicam, intromitte extremitatem clepshydrae in humiditatem, et trahe cum eo quod impellit ad superiora, humiditas enim trahitur in concauitatem clepshydrae.	When you wish to pour waters into the bladder, introduce the extreme end of the clepsydra into the water, and draw it out with what pushes it upwards, for water is drawn into the concave place of the clepsydra.
Deinde intromitte extremitatem eius in uirgam, secundum quod narrauimus in siringa.	Then introduce the extreme end of it into the penis, according to which we have described the syringe.
Deinde impelle humiditatem cum eo quod impellit illa namque humiditas peruenit ad uesicam statim, ita quod sentit eam infirmus.	Then push moisture with it as it pushes that, for that moisture goes to the dryness at once, so that the sick person feels it.
Forma clisteris subtilis quo clisterizatur uesica.	Form a thin clistere which moistens the bladder.
Fiat ex argento, aut auricalco: cuius caput altius sit simile alcama paruo, et sub eo sinus inter quem cadat ligamentum.	Let it be made of silver or brass; its head should be higher than the lower part and a loop should be placed under it.
Deinde accipe uesicam arietis, et pone in ea humiditatem, qua uis clisterizare uesicam.	Then take the bladder of a ewe, and place moisture in it, which you will use to moisten the bladder.
Deinde liga eam inter duos sinus ligatura forti cum filo duplo: et calefac illam humiditatem parumper super ignem.	Then tie it between two loops with strong thread and heat it slightly over a fire.
Deinde intromitte extremitatem clisteris in uirgam, postea stringe manum tuam super uesicam cum humiditate strictura decenti, donec sentiat infirmus, quod illa humiditas iam peruenit ad uesicam.	Then insert the end of the clistere into the penis, then tighten your hand around the bladder with the moisture as it becomes tighter, until the sick person feels that the moisture has already reached the bladder.
Si autem non est tibi praesens uesica, tunc accipe frustum pergameni, et fac ex eo circulum, et perfora ipsum ab omni rotunditate sua.	If you do not have a present bladder, then take an end of parchment, and make it into a circle, and pierce it from all its roundness.
Deinde intromitte filum forte in illis foraminibus, sicut reuoluuntur.	Then insert a strong thread into those holes, as they rotate.
Deinde aggrega circulum, sicut aggregatur alsofratu: postquam tu ponis in eo illud quod uis ex humiditatibus, et oleis, et aquis.	Then gather the circle, as is gathered for sewing; when you have placed that which you use for moisten, oil, and water.
Deinde liga ipsum in instrumento: et fac cum eo sicut fecisti cum uesica ex expressione cum manu tua, donec perueniat humiditas ad uesicam.	Then tie it to the instrument; and do with it as you did with the bladder from expression with your hand, until the moisture reaches the bladder.
¶ De extractione Lapidis.	The Extraction of Stone.
Caput LX.	ヘッド
Iam diximus in diuisione species Lapidis, et curationem eius cum medicinis: et dixi differentiam inter Lapidem generatum in renibus, et uesica, et signa illius totius: et dixi Lapidem in quo cadit operatio cum manu et sectio: et est Lapis generatus in uesica proprie: et ille qui figitur in uirga: et ego sum narrans illud cum expositione manifesta et abbreuiatione.	We have already spoken in the division of the species of stone, and the cure of it with medicines; and we have also distinguished between stone generated in the kidneys, bladder, and other parts, and that is operated on by hand or section: and this is stone properly generated in the bladder: and that which is generated in the kidney is that which grows on the stalk: and I am now speaking of it with manifest illustration and abbreviation.
Dico ergo, quod Lapis generatus in uesica, plurimum accidit pueris.	I therefore say, as for stone generated in the bladder, it often happens to boys.
Et ex signis eius est, quod urina egreditur ex uesica similis aquae in subtilitate sua: et apparet in ea harena alba, et fricat infirmus uirgam suam, et laborat cum ea, et multotiens pendet.	When a person's urine flows out of his penis like water, and it is thin, and there appears to be white sand in it, and the man's penis hurts when he moves it, and he suffers with it, and often hangs down:
Deinde erigitur, et egreditur cum eo anus in multis eorum.	Then it becomes erect, and is discharged with the anus in many of them.
Et est facilis sanatio puerorum, ex eo usquequo consequuntur quatuordecim annos.	And the cure of boys is easy from that age until they are fourteen years old.
Et est difficilis in senibus.	And it is difficult in the elderly.
In iuuenibus autem est media, in eo quod est inter illud: et eius cuius Lapis est maior, curatio facilior: et si paruus, est econuerso illius cura.	But in young men it is half-way between the two; and the cure is easier if the man' s stone is large; and if it is small, then the cure is difficult for him.
Cum ergo peruenimus ad curationem, oportet in primis, ut mundificemus infirmum cum clisteri, quod extrahat totum stercus quod est in intestinis suis: ipsum enim quandoque prohibet inuentionem Lapidis apud inquisitionem.	When we come to the cure, it is necessary first of all that we should clean out the sick man with a clister, which he should remove all the dung that is in his intestines: for sometimes he prevents the discovery of the stone in the inquiry.
Deinde accipiatur infirmus cum pedibus suis, et concutiatur, et moueatur ad inferiora: ut descendat Lapis ad profundum uesicae, aut saliat de loco alto aliquotiens.	Then the sick man should be taken with his feet, and shaken up, and moved down: that the stone may go down into the depths of the rectum, or sometimes come out from a high place.
Deinde fac eum sedere inter manus tuas praeparatum, et manus eius sint sub coxis ipsius, ut fiat uesica tota decliuis ad inferiora.	Then make him sit between your hands, prepared like this, and let his hands be under his heels, so that the entire rectum may decline towards the bottom:
Deinde perquire eum, et tange eum extrinsecus.	Then inquire about it, and feel it from the outside.
Si ergo sentis Lapidem in spacio, tunc propera statim cum sectione super ipsum.	If then you feel a stone in the space, immediately turn yourself towards the section above it.
Quod si non cadat sub tactu tuo omnino, tunc oportet ut abstergas digitum indicem cum oleo manus sinistrae, si infirmus est puer: aut digitum medium si est iuuenis completus: et intromittas ipsum in anum suum, et perquire de Lapide, donec stat sub digito tuo: et conuerte eum paulatim ad collum uesicae.	If it does not fall under your touch at all, then you should wipe the index finger with the oil of your left hand, if the sick boy is a boy; or with the middle finger if he is a full-grown man: and put him in some part of his anus, and feel the stone until it is under your finger: and turn him slowly towards his anus.
Deinde preme super ipsum cum digito tuo, et impelle ipsum ad exteriora aduersus locus, cuius sectionem uis: et praecipe ministro, ut premat uesicam manu sua, et praecipe alii ministro, ut extendat testiculos manu sua dextra ad superiora: et alia manu sua, ut remoueat cutem, quae est sub testiculis in parte a loco in quo est sectio.	Then press on it with your finger, and push it towards the outside against the section which you have found; and let one minister rub his hand on the anus, and another minister stretch out his right hand to the top: and let him moisten the skin, which is under the testicles in that part where the section is.
Deinde intromitte Spatumile incidens, cuius forma haec est.	Then introduce the spatumil incidens, whose form this is.
Et finde in eo quod est inter anum et testiculos, et non in medio, ad latus natis sinistrae: et sit sectio super ipsum lapidem, et digitus tuus sit in ano: et fiat sectio transuersa, ut sit sectio exterius ampla, et interius stricta, secundum quantitatem quod sit possibile egressio Lapidis ex ea non maior.	Then find in it what is between the anus and the testicles, and not in the middle, to the left of the birth: and let the cut be made above it, and your finger be in the anus: and let the cut be made transversely, so that it is wide outside, and tight inside, according to the quantity that it is possible for the stone to come out from there without being bigger.
Fortasse enim comprimit digitus, qui est in ano Lapidem apud sectionem, et egreditur absque difficultate.	Perhaps the finger, which is in the anus at the time of the cut, will press against the stone during the cutting, and will come out without difficulty.
Et scias, quod ex Lapide est cui sunt anguli et margines, quare fit difficilis exitus eius propter illud.	And you should know that from the stone there are angles and edges, for this reason it is difficult to get out.
Et ex eo est lenis, similis glandulae, et rotundus: et fit facilis egressus eius.	And from it there is something smooth, similar to a gland, and round: and the exit of it is easy.
Ei ergo cui sunt anguli, et margines, adde in fissura.	So then to those who have angles and edges, add a groove.
Quod si non egreditur ita, tunc oportet ut ingenies super ipsum: aut stringas super eum cum gesti decenter, cuius extremitas sit sicut Luna, quae stringat super Lapidem, et non euadat ab ea: aut ut intromittas sub eo instrumentum subtile, curuatae extremitatis.	If it does not come out in this way, then you should make use of: or stretch yourself over it with a wobbly gesture, whose end is as the Moon, which stretches over the stone and does not slip from it: or you should introduce under it a slim instrument, with curved ends.
Si autem non potes super cum, tunc amplifica foramen parumper.	If you cannot stretch on top of it either, then slightly enlarge the hole.
Quod si uincit te aliquid ex sanguine, abscinde ipsum cum zegi.	That if something from the blood wins over it, cut it off with a scalpel while it is bleeding.
Si uero lapis est plus quam unus, tunc impelle in primis magnum ad os uesicae.	If the stone is more than one, then push into the first big one towards the anus.
Deinde incide super ipsum.	Then cut on top of it.
Postea impelle paruum post illud: et similiter fac si sunt plures duobus.	Then push a little after it: and do likewise if there are more than two of them.
Quod si magnus est ualde, tunc ignorantia est ut seces super ipsum sectione magna.	That if it is very big, then the cut on top of it will make it come off.
Quoniam accidit infirmo una duarum rerum, aut ut moriatur, aut accidit ei distillatio urinae assidua: proptera, quia non consolidatur locus omnino.	Since this thing has happened to a man of the two things, or that he should die, or that he should have frequent urine passing: soon afterwards, because the place does not consolidate at all.
Verum administra expulsionem eius, donec egrediatur: aut ingenia in fractura eius cum forficibus, donec extrahas eum frustatim.	But give it an expulsion, until it comes out: or devices in the split of it with pincers, until you pull it out quickly.
Cum ergo compleueris operationem tuam, tunc imple uulnus thure, et aloe, et sanguine draconis: et stringe ipsum, et pone super ipsum pannum infusum oleo et uino, aut oleo rosato, et aqua frigida: ut sedetur apostema calidum.	When you have finished your operation, then fill the ulcer with thure, and aloe, and dragon's blood: and bind it well, and place over it a cloth dipped in oil and wine, or in rose-oil, and cold water: that so the pustule may be dried up by heat.
Deinde resupina infirmum super collum suum, et non soluas ligamentum, usque ad diem tertium.	Then wrap the wound around the neck, and do not sever the ligature until the third day.
Cum ergo solueris ipsum, embroca locum cum aqua, et oleo multo.	When you have severed it, then smear the place with much oil and water.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento dyafinicon, et unguento basilicon, donec sanetur.	Then care for the wound with the ointment of dye-fungus, and with the ointment of basilicon until it heals.
Si autem accidit in uulnere apostema calidum additum, et corrosi, et illi similia: sicut si congeletur sanguis in uesica, et prohibeatur ex eo urina: et cognoscitur illud ex egressione sanguinis cum urina.	But if a warm pustule has been added to it, and it has corroded and there are similar things: for example, if blood has congealed in the bladder, and urine is prevented from flowing out of it: and it is known by the exit of blood with urine.
Intromitte ergo digitum tuum in uulnus, et extrahe illum sanguinem.	Then insert your finger into the ulcer and extract the blood.
Nam si remanet, prouocat ad corruptionem uesicae, et putrefactionem eius.	For if it remains, it provokes corruption of the bladder and putrefaction of its contents.
Deinde ablue uulnus cum aceto, et aqua, et sale: et oppone omni speciei cum eo quod conuenit ex curatione, usquequo sanetur.	Then wash the ulcer with vinegar, and water, and salt: and oppose to it all kinds of things that come with the cure, until it is healed.
Et oportet in horis curationis totius, ut liges duas coxas, et aggreges, caussa medicinarum quae ponuntur super locum.	And in the hours of the cure, two legs should be bound together and gathered up, because medicines that are laid on the spot should not be moved.
Quod si lapis est paruus, et sit in meatu uirgae, et figitur in eo, et prohibetur urinae exitus: tunc cura ipsum cum eo quod narro antequam peruenias ad sectionem.	That if the stone is small and lies in the meatus of the urethra and is embedded in it, and prevents urine from flowing out: then care for the stone with it when you come to a section of it.
Multotiens enim a sectione excusaris per hanc curationem, iam enim probaui illud.	For often after this cure, there will be no more difficulty in passing water, because I have tried it out many times.
Et est, ut accipias Perforatorium ex ferro alferico, cuius haec est forma, triangulatae extremitatis, acutum, fixum in ligno.	And this is how you take the iron perforator, whose form is as follows: a sharp-pointed triangle, fixed firmly on a piece of wood.
Deinde accipe filum, et liga cum eo uirgam sub lapide ut non redeat ad uesicam.	Then take a thread and tie it to the penis under the stone so that it does not return to the bladder.
Deinde intromitte ferrum perforans in uirgam cum facilitate, donec perueniat Perforatorium ad ipsum lapidem: et reuolue Perforatorium manu tua in ipso lapide paulatim: et coneris perforationem eius, donec facias ipsum penetrare a parte altera.	Then introduce the piercing iron into the penis with ease, until it reaches the stone; and draw back the piercing iron by your hand on the stone little by little; and examine the piercing, until you make him pierce from one side to the other.
Urina namque absoluitur statim.	You shall urinate immediately after this.
Deinde preme manum tuam super illud quod remansit ex lapide ab exteriori parte uirgae.	Then press your hand on what remains of the stone from the outside of the penis.
Ipse enim frangitur, et egreditur cum urina, et sanatur infirmus.	It is itself broken, and emerges with the urine, and heals the wounded part.
Si autem non praeparatur tibi haec curatio, propter aliquid quod prohibet ab illo: tunc liga filum sub lapide, et filum aliud supra lapidem.	But if this remedy is not suited to you for some reason that prevents it: then bind a string under the stone, and a string above the stone.
Deinde seca super lapidem in ipsa uirga inter duas ligaturas.	Then dry up on the stone in the penis between the two ties.
Deinde extrahe ipsum.	Then pull out the stone.
Postea solue ligamentum, et mundifica sanguinem congelatum, qui fit in uulnere.	Then loosen the tie, and clean up the frozen blood, which has accumulated in the wound.
Et non est necessarium ligamentum fili sub lapide, nisi ut non redeat ad uesicam: et ligamentum aliud desuper, nisi ut quando soluitur filum post egressionem lapidis, redeat cutis ad locum suum, et cooperiat uulnus: et propter illud necesse est tibi illud quando ligas filum superius, ut eleues cutem ad superiora, ut redeat apud complementum tuum, et cooperiat uulnus, sicut diximus.	And it is not necessary to tie the string under the stone unless you want to return it to the skin at your side: and the other string from above, unless when the string is loosened after the stone has come out, does not return the skin to its place, and closes the wound, as we have said. For this reason, you must tie the upper string so that the skin returns to its place, and covers the wound, as we have described.
¶ De extractione Lapidis mulierum.	The Extracting of the Stone in Women.
Caput LXI.	Chapter LXI.
Parum generatur Lapis in mulieribus.	The Stone does not form much in women.
Si autem accidat alicui earum lapis, tunc difficilis est curatio, et prohibetur propter modos multos.	But if any of them should have a stone: then the cure is difficult, and is prohibited on account of many things.
Vnus eorum est: quod mulier fortasse est uirgo.	One of them is this: that the woman may not be a virgin.
Et secundus est, quia tu non inuenis mulierem quae detegat seipsam medico, quando est casta, aut ex habentibus maritos.	And a second is that you do not examine a woman who takes medicine when she is chaste, or one who has husband.
Tertius est, quia tu non inuenis mulierem bene scientem hanc artem, praecipue operationem cum manu.	A third is that you do not examine a woman who knows this art well, especially the operation with the hand.
Et quartus est longinquitas a loco lapidis: quare indiget sectione profunda, et in illo est timor.	And fourth is the distance from the stone's place: why does it need deep sectioning, and there is fear in it.
Quod si necessitas prouocat ad illud, tunc oportet ut accipias mulierem medicam, bene scientem: et parum inuenitur.	That if necessity compels to that, then you should take a woman doctor, well-versed in: and it is not often found.
Si uero priuaris ea, tunc quaere medicum castum, subtilem, et praesenta mulierem obstetricem bene doctam in re mulierum, aut mulierem quae in hac arte innuit partem artis: fac ergo eam praesentem, et praecipue ei, ut faciat totum quod praecipis ei ex inquisitione super lapidem.	But if you truly want her, then ask for a chaste doctor, subtile, and present a woman obstetrician well-versed in the matter of women's business, or a woman who has an interest in this art part: so make her present, and above all, that she does everything that you command her from inquiry about the stone.
In primis quod est, ut aspiciat si mulier est uirgo: tunc oportet ut intromittat digitum in anum eius, et quaerat lapidem.	In first place that is, that she inspects if a woman is virgin: then it is necessary that she puts her finger in an anum of her, and asks about the stone.
Si ergo inuenit ipsum, coartet eum sub digito suo, et tunc praecipe obstetrici, ut intromittat digitum suum in uuluam infirmae, et inquirat super lapidem, postquam ponit manum suam sinistram super uesicam, et comprimit eam compressione bona.	But if she finds it, let her grasp it under her finger, and then command the obstetrician, that he puts his own finger in the vulva of the unclean one, and asks about the stone, after he has put his left hand on the hair of the patient, and squeezes it with a good pressure.
Si ergo inuenit lapidem, tunc oportet ut gradatim moueat eum ab orificio uesicae ad inferiora cum summa uirtutis suae, donec perueniat cum eo ad radicem coxae.	But if she finds the stone, then it is necessary that she moves it gradually from the orifice of the vulva to the lower part with all her might, until she reaches it with him up to the root of the pelvis.
Deinde secet super eum apud oppositionem medietatis uuluae apud radicem coxae, ex quacunque parte praeparatur ei, et sentit lapidem in illa parte: et digitus eius non remoueatur a lapide, coartans sub eo: et sit sectio parua in primis.	Then she shall cut on him at the opposition of the middle orifice of the vulva near the root of the pelvis, from whichever side it is prepared, and feels the stone in that part: and her finger should not remove from the stone, grasping under it: and let there be a small section first.
Deinde intromittat radium super illam sectionem.	Then she shall put the root on that section.
Si ergo sentit lapidem, tunc addat in sectionem secundum quantitatem proportionatam quod lapis egreditur ab ea.	But if she feels the stone, then she shall add to the second section a quantity proportional to what the stone is exiting from her.
Et scias, quod species lapidis sunt multae.	And you know that the types of stones are many.
Ex his enim est paruus, et magnus, lenis et asper, longus, et rotundus habens ramos.	For from these there is a small one, and a great one, smooth and rough, long and round having branches.
Scias ergo species eius, ut significetur tibi per hoc super illud quod uis.	Know his nature, so that he may be known to you through this that you see.
Si ergo uincit te sanguis, tunc adde in loco zegi tritum, et tene ipsum hora una, donec abscindatur sanguis.	If therefore blood is making you sick, then add three drops of the place of poultice, and hold it for an hour, until the blood has dried up.
Deinde redi ad operationem tuam, donec egrediatur lapis: et fac, ut praepares tecum ex instrumentis, quae dixi in extractione lapidis in uiris, ut adiuueris per ea in operatione tua.	Then turn to your work again until the stone is discharged: and make ready for yourself from the instruments which I have said in the extraction of the stone out of the bladder, so that you may support yourself by means of them in your operation.
Quod si uincit te fluxus sanguinis, et scis quod expulsio sanguinis est ex arteria quae incisa est: tunc pone puluerem super locum, et stringe eum cum puluillis strictura decenti: et non mutes illud: et dimitte lapidem, et non extrahas ipsum.	That if blood is making you sick, and you know that the flow of blood comes from an artery which has been cut: then put powder over the place, and tighten it with the powder as it dries up: and do not change that: and let go of the stone, and do not extract it.
Fortasse enim morietur mulier infirma.	Perhaps, however, the woman will die who is weak.
Deinde cura uulnus.	Then take care of the wound.
Cum ergo sedatur acuitas sanguinis post dies, et putrefit locus, tune redi ad operationem tuam, donec egrediatur lapis.	When, however, the sharpness of the pain has passed after a few days and the place is putrefied, then turn to your work again until the stone is discharged.
¶ De sectione suiper Herniam aquosam.	Regarding the cutting above the hernial opening with water.
Caput LXII.	Head LII.
Ramex aquosa non est, nisi aggregatio humiditatis in sifac albo, quod est sub cute testiculi continente ouum: et nominatur sifac.	Ram's water is not, unless a gathering of moisture in the alfalfa plant, which is under the skin of the testicle wrapped up in one piece: and it is called alfalfa.
Et quandoque est in panniculo proprio sibi, quem praeparauit ei natura in parte oui, donec putetur: quod est ouum aliud, et est cutis testiculi inter sifac album, quod diximus: et non fit illud nisi raro.	And when it is in a sheet of its own nature, which has been prepared by nature on the skin: that is another thing, and that is the skin of the testicle between the alfalfa plant, which we have said: and that does not happen except rarely.
Et generatio quidem huius ramicis, est ex debilitate quae accidit testiculis: quare effunditur ad eos haec materia.	And the generation of this ramification comes from the weakness which happens in the testicles: why it is discharged towards them this substance.
Et quandoque accidit ex percussione super testiculos.	And when it comes to a blow on the testicles.
Et haec humiditas est habens colores multos.	And this moisture is having many colors.
Aut enim est color eius decliuis ad citrinitatem, aut est sanguineus rubeus, aut faeculentus, niger, aut est aquosus albus, et est illud quod est plus.	Or, on the other hand, the color of it is veiled towards yellow, or is red, or green, black, or white, and that which is more is this.
Et signa quibus scitur ubi sit aggregatio aquae, sunt ista.	And signs by which it is known where the aggregation of water is, are these.
Nam si est in sifac albo quod diximus, tunc apostema est rotundum ad longitudinem parumper sicut figura oui: et non apparet testiculus, quoniam humiditas continet eum ab omni parte.	Nam si est in sifac albo quod diximus, tunc apostema est rotundum ad longitudinem parumper sicut figuraoui: et non apparet testiculus, quoniam humiditas continet eum ab omni parte.
Et si est humiditas in panniculo proprio sibi, tunc apostema est rotundum cum parte oui, et propter hoc extimat homo quia est ouum aliud.	And if there is moisture in the skin itself, then the hernia is round with a part like this, and therefore a man is estimated to be another one because it is round; [but] if there is humidity in the skin of the testicles, then the hernia is not round but flat, and therefore a man is estimated to be himself.
Et si humiditas est inter cutem testiculorum et sifac album, tunc cadit sub sensu.	And if there is moisture between the skin of the testicles and the white skin (scrotum), then it hangs down.
Quando ergo uis cognitionem coloris humiditatis, tunc experire colorem humiditatis in apostemate cum Intromisso quadrato, cuius forma praecessit.	When therefore you wish to know the color of the moisture, then feel for the color of the moisture in the hernia with the square insertion, whose shape preceded it.
Secundum illud ergo quod egreditur in uestigio Intromissi, iudica de illo quod est inter ipsum.	According to this, when it comes out into the fold of the insertion, judge about it that it is between itself.
Cum ergo uenimus ad curationem cum ferro, tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmo, ut phlebotometur si possibile est ei illud, et uides corpus eius plenum.	When we come to the cure with a iron nail, then it is necessary that you order the sick person to have his blood let if it is possible for him to do so, and you will see his body full of blood.
Deinde resupinetur super dorsum suum super rem altam parum, et pone sub eo pannos multos.	Then he should lie down on his back on a high bed, and place many blankets under him.
Deinde sede tu super sinistram eius, et praecipe ministro, ut sedeat a dextra eius, qui extendat uirgam eius ad unum duorum laterum cutis testiculorum, et ad partem mirach uentris.	Then sit down on his left side, and order the minister to sit down on his right side, who will stretch out his thigh towards two sides of the skin of the testicles, and towards the part of the pubic bone.
Deinde accipe spatumile latum, et seca cutem testiculorum ex medio per longitudinem, usque prope pectinem: et fiat sectio secundum rectitudinem aequedistantis lineae quae diuidit cutem testiculorum, donec perueniat ad sifac album comprehendens: et excoria ipsum et obserua, uel caue ex hoc, ut seces ipsum: et sit excoriatio tua qua ipsum excorias, ex parte quae suspenditur cum ouo plus: et subtiliter scrutare cum excoriatione secundum quantitatem quod tibi possibile est.	Then take a wide spatula and dry the skin of the testicles from the middle by its length, up to the breastbone; and make a section second by the equidistant line that divides the skin of the testicles, until it reaches the white skin (scrotum), and observe the scar, or gently cut it away so as not to cut it, and then examine the scar carefully according to its amount that you can do.
Deinde perfora sifac plenum aqua perforatione ampla, et extrahe totam aquam.	Then pierce the sinus with a wide bore hole and extract all the water.
Deinde separa inter duo labia sectionis cum uncinis, et extende sifac ad superiora, et non tangas cutem testiculorum comprehendentem: et incide sifac qualitercunque est possibile tibi incidere ipsum, aut cum totalitate sua, aut frustatim, praecipue latus eius subtile.	Then separate the two lips of the incision with a hook and extend the sinus up to the top, and do not touch the skin that covers the testicles: and cut the sinus however it is possible for you to cut it, whether entirely or in part, especially its thin side.
Nam si tu non exquisite perscrutaris, in incisione eius non fit securitas, quin aqua redeat.	For if you do not examine it carefully, there will be no security in the incision, except that the water runs off.
Si autem procedit ouum exterius a cute sua in hora operationis tuae: tunc quando compleueris sectionem sifac, reduc ipsum.	But if one of them comes out from under his skin during your operation: then, when you have finished the incision of the sinus, reduce it in.
Deinde aggrega duo labia cutis testiculorum cum sutura.	Then bring together the two lips of the skin of the testicles with a stitch.
Deinde cura ipsum sicut reliqua uulnera, donec sanetur.	Then take care of the wound as you do with the other wounds, until it heals.
Quod si inuenis ouum corruptum ex nigredine alia, tunc oportet ut liges uasa, quae sunt suspensorium, timens fluxum sanguinis.	Which if one of the balls becomes corrupted from another color, then you should bind the organs that are suspended, fearing the flow of blood.
Deinde abscinde testiculum cum suspensorio, et extrahe ouum: postea cura illud cum eo quod diximus.	Then cut off the testicle with the suspender and extract it: then take care of it as we have said.
Si uero aqua est aggregata in duabus partibus, tunc scias quia sunt duae ramices: seca ergo partem aliam secundum quod fecisti in altera aequaliter.	But if the water is collected on both sides, then you should know that there are two branches: so dry one side equally as you have done with the other.
Et si aequatur tibi, ut sit operatio una, tunc fac: deinde absterge sanguinem.	And if it is even for you, so that the operation is one, then do so: then wash away the blood.
Et intromitte in sectiones lanam submersam in oleo, aut in oleo rosato: et pone deforis lanam aliam quam submersisti in uino et oleo, et expande eam super duos testiculos, et mirach uentris: et pone desuper pannos duplicatos, et sunt puluilli: et liga eos desuper cum ligamento, quod est habens sex secundum hanc formam.	And introduce a wet wool into the incision, or an oiled wool: and place another dry wool that you dipped in wine and oil over the two testicles, and spread it out under the ball: and place two double cloths on top of them, and they are soft: and bind them together above with a thread, which has six turns according to this shape.
Deinde sumantur duo panni, et suantur, et impleantur la na carminata, secundum hanc similitudinem: et fiant extremitates quibus premitur ex coto, aut lana humida: et aggregentur cum strictura in lumbari bracharum: et una extremitatum accipiat super anum usque ad dorsum, et secunda accipiat ad partem pectinis: et duae extremitates super duas coxas inferius, et duae extremitates aliae super duo inguina, et aggregetur strictura tota in lumbari bracharum.	Then two cloths are taken and inflated, and filled with crimson wool, according to this similarity: and the ends which are pressed by a bandage, or wet wool: and are joined together with a strap that runs between the shoulders of the arms: and one end takes hold on top of some bone up to the back, and the other end takes hold on the side of the pelvis: and both ends take hold on each side of the hips, and the whole bandage is joined in the lumbar brachium.
Et, quandoque artificialiter medicatur haec ramex cum cauterio loco sectionis cum ferro: et est, ut accipias cauterium cultellare subtile, et seces cum eo cutem testiculorum: et est ignitum, secundum quod narrauimus: donec quando detegitur sifac album continens aquam: tunc accipe cauterium, secundum hanc formam.	And, sometimes with an artificial knife and a cautery at the place of the cut with iron: and it is, that you take the cautery with a small razor, and separate with it the skin of the testicles: and it is ignited, according to what we have told: until such time as it finds the white sifac which contains water: then take the cautery, according to this form.
Assimilatur literae graecae.	It assimilates Greek letters.
Deinde perfora cum eo illud sifac, et est ignitum, donec egrediatur humiditas tota.	Then pierce with it that sifac, and it is ignited until all the moisture has gone out.
Deinde extende sifac cum uncinis, et excoria cum cauterio subtili ignito, et incide ipsum secundum quod possibile est tibi, donec eradices totum eius.	Then spread out that sifac with a hook, and scrape with the sharp cautery and cut it as well as you can, until you have cut all of it off.
Et caue ex ouo, ne tangat ipsum ignis.	And let the fire not touch him.
Et scias, quod haec operatio est saluior, et longinquior a fluxu sanguinis, et melior quam operatio cum sectione.	And you should know that this operation is more salutary, and further from the flow of blood, and better than the operation with a cut.
Si uero contrarietatem tibi facit in hora sectionis, aut in hora cauterii apostema calidum, aut fluxus sanguinis, aut aliquid aliud: tunc oportet ut cures quod contrarietatem tibi facit ex illo cum curatione quae conuenit ei, secundum quod praemissum est.	But if it causes you a contradiction in the hour of the cut, or in the hour of the cautery, hot or cold flow of blood, or anything else: then you should do what is opposite to that contradiction which you suffer with the cure which suits him, according to what has been said.
Si autem infirmus est timidus, et non expectat super hanc operationem, propter horribilitatem suam: tunc administra perforationem secundum quod ego narro illud: et est.	But if he is timid and does not await this operation, because of its horror: then administer the piercing according to what I have told you: it is done.
Quando certificatur tibi apud te per illud quod diximus de significationibus, quod ramex est aquosa: tunc oportet quod facias sedere infirmum super sedem eleuatam.	When you are certain of yourself with that which we have said about the meaning of the knife being moist: then you should make the sick person sit on an elevated chair.
Deinde perfora apostema in inferiori parte sui cum spatumili lato: et pone perforationem secundum longitudinem corporis, et sit apertio ampla, donec currat aqua tota.	Then pierce the apostema in the lower part of himself with a razor blade: and place the cut at the length of his body, and keep it open wide until all the water has run out.
Deinde pone super locum cotum, et liga ipsum, et dimitte ipsum ut currat residuum aquae: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur uulnus.	Then put a towel over the place, and tie him up, and let him run to get the water out: then care for the wound, until the sore heals.
Si autem contrarietas sit egressioni aquae in hora qua perforas ipsam: et non sit illud nisi propterea, quia panniculus albus contrarietatem facit in orificio uulneris, et prohibet exitum aquae: tunc oportet ut intromittas pennam in uulnus, aut instrumentum cum quo extrahitur aqua hydropicorum, cuius forma praecessit: aut adde in operatione uulneris parumper.	But if there is a contradiction in the discharge of water at the time when you pierce it: and there is no doing that except for this reason, because the white cloth causes a contradiction in the opening of the wound, and prevents the exit of the water: then you should put your finger into the wound, or use an instrument with which the water is drawn out, whose shape has gone before: or add to the operation of the wound.
Et scias, quod aqua redit, et aggregatur post sex menses, aut circiter eos.	And know that water returns, and is gathered after six months, or about them.
Cum ergo aggregatur, tunc pertoretur secundum eundem modum, et pertransibit infirmus dies suos.	So when it is gathered, then it returns in the same way, and the sick will pass through his days.
¶ De cura Ramicis carnosae.	On the care of the pink ramus.
Caput LXIII.	Chapter LIII. On the head.
Scias, quod in sectione super hanc Ramicem, est ex timore perducente ad perniciem in pluribus dispositionibus.	You should know that with this ramus, if it is cut across here, it leads to danger in many conditions.
Quapropter uidetur mihi eius dimissio saluari ex ea.	Therefore I remove him from this ramus, lest he be saved from it.
Et ego sum rememorans operationem in ea, et species apostematis.	And I remember the operation on it, and the appearance of aphasia.
Dico ergo, quod accidunt apostemata multa in corporibus, ex quibus componuntur testiculi: et fit illud ex caussis multis, scilicet.	I say then that many things happen in the bodies, from which the testicles are composed: and it happens for many reasons, indeed.
Aut ex superfluitate acuta, uel acri, quae effunditur ad testiculos.	Or from acute excess, or sharp, which is secreted to the testicles.
Aut ex percussione.	Or from a blow.
Et est color apostematis secundum colorem corporis, et non inuenitur ei dolor: et est apostema graue.	And the color of aphasia depends on the color of the body, and it is not felt to be painful: and the aphasia is gray.
Et fortasse est apostema lapideum, cuius color est fuscus, et non est sensus ei.	And perhaps it is an aphonia of stone, whose color is dark, and there is no feeling for it.
Et quandoque fit ex nodatione arteriarum, et inflatione earum: sicut iam praecessit eius rememoratio: aut ex inflatione uenarum.	And when it is from the knotting of the arteries, and their swelling: as I have already remembered about it; or from the swelling of the veins.
Quod ergo est ex eis ex inflatione arteriarum, cognoscitur per dispositionem apostematis, quando comprimis ipsum digitis tuis.	What is then from these, from the swelling of the arteries, is recognized by the disposition of aphasia when you squeeze your own fingers.
Et non oportet ut tangas ipsum prorsus.	And it is not necessary that you touch him completely.
Illud uero quod fit ex inflatione uenarum, non dispergitur ex eo aliquid apud compressionem cum digitis.	That which is from the swelling of the veins, does not scatter anything from it when you squeeze with your fingers.
Et iam possibile est, quod super hanc speciem fiat sectio, et super reliquas carnes: et est, ut seces cutem testiculorum.	And also it is possible that this ramus, if it is cut across here, and on the other parts of the flesh: and it is, so as to separate the skin of the testicles.
Deinde extende ouum ad sursum, et extrahe ipsum cum sifach albo: et libera suspensorium ex uasis, et liga uasa: et incide suspensorium postquam tu liberas ipsum ab omni parte ex partibus oui.	Then extend your hand upward, and pull out the skin with a siwach or a scissor: and release the suspension from the water, and tie the suspension to the limb: and cut the suspension after you have released the skin from all parts of the body.
Si ergo ouum consolidatum est cum illis carnibus natis, tunc oportet ut attrahas ouum, et incidas ipsum.	If then my bone is well healed with those living muscles, then I should draw it towards me and strike at it.
Et si adhaerentia est inter aliquid ex siphaket, aut in eo quod est inter uasa: tunc oportet ut liberes totam illam adhaerentiam, et incidas eam incisione rotunda.	And if an adhesion is between some of the sinews, or in it that is between the joints: then you should free all that adhesion and strike it with a round incision.
Si autem est natiuitas carnis in loco adhaerentiae quae est retro: tunc oportet ut incidas totum eius, et extrahas ouum, sicut diximus.	If however the birth of meat is in the place of the adhesion that is behind: then you should strike all of it and draw my bone out, as we have said.
Cum ergo completur operatio tua, tnnc imple uulnus in lana infusa in oleo rosato, et uino: deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	When then your operation is complete, then you should fill the wound with wool infused with rose oil and wine: then take care of it with the rest of the cure, until it heals.
¶ De cura Ramicis, quae est cum Vite.	The Care for the Grapevine, which is with the Vine.
Caput LXIIII.	Chapter LXIV.
Uitis est apostema inuolutum quadam inuolutione, simile botro, cum mollificatione testiculorum: et fit difficilis super infirmum motus et exercitium, et deambulatio.	It is useful to have a blister covered with some blister-fluid similar to a blister made by a worm, with the softening of the testicles: it makes it difficult to move on an invalid, and exercise, and walking.
Et in curatione huius aegritudinis est ex timore, propter illud cuius praecessit rememoratio.	And in the cure for this illness there is a fear because of the recollection of that which preceded it.
Verum oportet, ut dicamus operationem in ea secundum quod fecerunt primi.	But we should say the operation in it according to what the first did.
Dico ergo, quod oportet ut facias sedere infirmum super sedem eleuatam.	I will then say that you should make the invalid sit on an elevated seat.
Deinde impelle suspensorium testiculorum ad inferiora.	Then push the suspender of the testicles to the lower ones.
Deinde tene cutem testiculorum cum digitis tuis, cum uasis quae sunt propinqua uirgae: et teneat ea minister alius, et extendat ea extensione uehementi.	Then hold the skin of the testicles with your fingers, with the fingers that are next to the scrotum: and let him hold them a minister, and stretch them with a strong extension.
Deinde incide cum spatumili lato acuto sectione transuersa in directo uasorum, donec detegantur uasa.	Then strike with an acute blade in a transverse section through the middle of the joints, until they are detected.
Deinde excoria ab omni parte, sicut diximus tibi in extractione Arteriarum quae sunt in timporibus.	Then scrub all parts, as we have told you in the extraction of arteries that are in the temporals.
Postea fige in eis acum in qua sit filum duplum, et liga ipsum in primo locorum quibus accidunt Vites: et liga ipsum iterum in ultimo eorum.	Then fasten into them a nut where is a double filament, and tie it at the first place of the Grapes: and tie it again at the last place of them.
Deinde seca ea in media sectione recta secundum longitudinem corporis, et extrahe quod aggregatur ex humiditatibus faeculentis corruptis.	Then dry it in a direct middle section according to the length of the body, and remove what is gathered from the corrupt foul humidities.
Deinde cura uulnus cum curatione reliquorum uulnerum, in quibus uis generari saniem, ut cadant uasa quae nutriunt unum testiculorum.	Then care for the scar with the cure of the remaining wounds, in which the life-giving force should be made to grow again, so that the clothes that nurture one testicle fall off.
Non est enim malum per illud.	For this is not bad through that.
Si autem accidat Vitis omnibus uasis, tunc oportet ut extrahantur propter hoc testiculi cum uasis: ut non priuetur ouum nutrimento, propter incisionem, et tabescat, uel arescat, et non sit iuuamentum cum eis.	If, however, a vine grows in all the scabs, then it is necessary to remove them for this reason from the testicles with the scabs: so that they are not deprived of their nourishment, because of the incision, and do not wither or scar, and are not made into a wound with them.
¶ De cura Ramicis intestinalis.	As for the cure of intestinal worm.
Caput LXV.	Chapter LVI.
Euentus huius Ramicis est ex sectione, quae accidit in sifach extenso super uentrem in parte inguinum ex mirach uentris.	The end of this worms is from the section, which happens on the skin in a wide place under the groin between the testicles.
Quare descendunt intestina ex illa Ruptura ad unum testiculorum.	Why do the intestines come out from that break towards one testicle?
Et haec Ruptura est aut ex sifach, aut extensione eius.	And this break is either from the skin, or from the length of the skin.
Et accidunt istae duae species ex caussis multis: aut ex percussione, aut saltu, aut clamore, aut eleuatione rei grauis, et similibus.	And these two species arise from many causes: either from a blow, or from a jump, or from a sound, or from lifting up something heavy, and similar things.
Et signum, quando est ex extensione sifach.	And the mark, when it is from the length of the skin.
Est quod accidit paulatim in tempore longo, et non accidit subito: et est apostema aequale uersus profundum: propterea, quod sifach comprimit intestinum.	It is what happens gradually over a long period of time, and does not happen suddenly: and it is a swelling equal to the depth: because the skin squeezes the intestines.
Et signum eius quando est ex sectione sifach, quia facit accidere ex principio sui dolorem uehementem subito: et est apostema diuersum, apparens sub cute propinque: et illud est propter exitum intestini, et cursus eius ad exteriora sifach.	And the sign of it, when it is from the section of the skin, because it makes a sudden and painful pain start at its beginning: and it is a swelling different, appearing under the skin nearby: and that is because of the exit of the intestines, and their course to the external skin.
Et quandoque egreditur cum intestino zirbum: et nominatur haec Ramex intestinalis, et zirbia: et quandoque fit cum uentositate.	And when it comes out with the intestines in a twisted state: and this is called intestinal worm, and twisted one: and sometimes it happens with windiness.
Et quandoque currit in intestinum stercus, et retinetur illic: et est cum eo pernicies infirmi: quoniam facit accidere dolorem prauum, et praecipue quando premitur.	And when it runs into the intestines of dung, and retains it there: and it is with that kind of worm that sickness and injury occur: because it makes a painful pain, especially when it is pressed.
Et in curatione specierum aegritudinis huius cum ferro est timor: quare oportet ut caueatur casus in ea.	For the cure of this disease with iron there is fear: for which reason care should be taken to avoid such a case.
Et modus operationis est, ut praecipias infirmo, ut reducat intestinum manu sua ad interiora concauitatis suae, si obedit reditui.	And the method of operation is that you instruct the sick person to bring his intestines by hand into his abdominal cavity, if he obeys the return.
Deinde resupinetur super collum suum inter manus tuas: et eleua crura eius.	Then let him lie down on his back between your hands: and wash his legs.
Deinde extende cutem quae sequitur cutem ad superiora, et seca cutem testiculorum totam per longitudinem.	Then extend the skin that follows the skin to the upper part, and dry the entire skin of the testicles by its length.
Deinde fige in duobus labiis sectionis uncinos, secundum quod indiges ad aperiendum sectionem cum eis: et sectio sit secundum quantitatem, quod sit possibile, ut egrediatur ex ea ouum.	Then attach two sections of the skin with knots, according to which you open the section with them: and the section is arranged according to quantity, so that it can be removed from it.
Deinde excoria siphak, et quae sunt sub cute testiculorum, donec quando detegitur sifach album, durum ab omni parte: tunc intromitte digitum tuum indicem in eo quod sequitur testiculum, in eo quod est inter siphach album, quod est sub cute oui, et inter sifach secundum, et absolue cum eo adhaerentiam quae est in posteriori parte oui.	Then scrape the skin and what is under the skin, until when it is touched, the skin is white, firm on all sides: then insert your index finger into it that follows the testicle, in that which is between the white skin, that is under the skin, and between the second skin, and separate with it the attachment that is in the rear part of the skin.
Deinde moue cum manu dextra ad interiora cutem testiculorum: et cum hoc extende sifach album ad sursum, cum manu sinistra: et eleua ouum cum sifach ad partem sectionis: et praecipe ministro, ut extendat ouum ad sursum: et tu solue adhaerentiam, quae est retro solutione completa.	Then move with the right hand towards the inside of the testicle skin: and while doing so, extend the white skin upwards with the left hand: and wash the eggs with the skin on the side of the section: and instruct the assistant to extend the eggs upwards: and you should separate the attachment that is behind by complete solution.
Et quaere digitis tuis, ut non sit aliquid illic ex intestino inuoluto in sifach albo duro.	And examine your fingers that nothing is there in it from the inside of the intestines that has been washed in the white skin or hard.
Si autem inuenis ex eo aliquid: tunc impelle ipsum ad uentrem inferius.	If, however, something is still there: then push it towards the lower abdomen.
Deinde accipe acum, in qua sit filum grossum, factum licinium ex decem filis: et intromitte ipsam apud postremum sifach, id est, tunicae, quod est sub cute testiculorum quae sequitur sectionem: deinde incide extremitates quae eminent ex filo, donec sint quatuor fila.	Then take the acume, in which there is a thick thread made from ten fils: and insert it between the last skin, that is under the skin of the testicles that follows the section: then cut off the ends that stand out from the thread, until four fils remain.
Deinde compone quaedam eorum super quaedam cum figura quae sit in modo crucis: et liga cum eis alsifach, de quo diximus, quia est sub cute testiculorum ligamento uehementi, donec non possit aliquod ex uasis, quae nutriunt eos mittere ad eos aliquid: ut non accidat inde apostema calidum.	Then put together some of them with a figure that is in the form of a cross: and bind them with the alsifach, from which we have spoken, because it is under the skin of the testicles with a strong ligature, until they cannot send any of their sweat to them, so that no fever is transmitted to them.
Et pone iterum ligamentum secundum extra ligamentum primum, longinquum ab eo minus duobus digitis.	And place again the second ligament outside the first ligament, distant from it two fingers.
Et post ista duo ligamenta dimitte ex sifach, quod est sub cute testiculorum, quantitatem magnitudinis digiti: et incide reliquum totum secundum rotunditatem, et aufer ex eo ouum.	And after these two ligaments leave out of the fold, which is under the skin of the testicles, the size of a finger: and cut the rest all round, and take away it.
Deinde seca in inferiori parte cutis testiculorum sectione, ex qua currit sanguis, et sanies: sicut narrauimus in eo quod praemissum est.	Then dry up in the lower part of the skin of the testicles, from which runs the blood and pus: as we have said above.
Deinde administra lanam submersam in oleo, et pone in uulnus: et administra ligamentum quod narrauimus.	Then put the soaked wool in oil and place it on the scrotum: and administer the ligament that we have described.
Et quandoque cauterizatur sifach album quod diximus, post incisionem eius timendo de fluxu sanguinis.	And when the fold of white fabric which we have spoken of is cauterized, after cutting it with care from the flow of blood.
Multotiens enim accidit illud.	This often happens.
Et dimitte ligamentum, donec cadat per se.	And release the ligament, until it falls on its own.
Si autem tardatur casus eius, tunc embrocetur cum aqua calida: et pone super ipsum illud quod diximus, donec cadat.	But if this delay happens, then simmer with warm water: and place over it the one that we have spoken of, until it falls.
Deinde cura uulnus cum reliqua curatione uulnerum, donec curetur.	Then care for the scrotum with the remaining healing of the wound, until it is healed.
¶ De Ramice uentosa.	This is a recipe for ramicin.
Caput LXVI.	Chapter LVI.
IN Hac Ramice non uidi aliquem qui ausus fuerit super curationem eius cum ferro.	In this ramicin, I did not see anyone who dared to cure it with iron.
Et primi quidem dixerunt, quod fit sicut narrauimus in Ramice quae est cum Vite.	And first they said that it was done as we have spoken of the ramicin which is with wine.
Quod est, ut liges uasa post sectionem super ea cum facilitate inferius: deinde seca in medio, et cura postremo cum eo quod aperit ipsum, donec cadant uasa: et cura uulnus, secundum quod diximus, donec sanetur.	That is, so that the ligaments go down easily after cutting them from below: then dry up in the middle, and care afterwards with the opening of its own: until the ligaments fall; and care for the scrotum, according to what we have said, until it heals.
¶ De disruptione quae fit in inguinibus.	Chapter about the incision made in the groin area.
Caput LXVII.	Chapter LVII.
Quando accidit Ruptura in inguinibus, sicut diximus, et eminet locus, et non descendit ad testiculos aliquid ex intestinis: et si descendit, est illud parum, et redit in omnibus horis: uerum si prolongatur cum ea tempus, additur fissura in sifach, donec descendunt intestina in sifach.	When a rupture occurs in the groin area, as we have said, and there is an outlet, and does not go down to the testicles anything from the intestines: and if it goes down, it is little, and returns at all times: however, if it is prolonged over time, there is a rift in the fold, until the intestines come into the fold.
Et accidit illud ex extensione sifach, quod est in inguinibus, sicut diximus.	And that happens from the spread of a syph, which is in the groin, as we have said.
Quod est, quia extenditur sifach: deinde mollificatur, et apostematur locus, et eminet.	That is, because the syph spreads out: then it softens, and the spot gets redder, and it oozes.
Et cura eius est cum cauterio, sicut praecessit eius narratio.	And the cure for it is with a cauterium, as has preceded its description.
Et quandoque curatur cum ferro, secundum hunc modum: et est, ut iaceat infirmus super dorsum suum inter manus tuas.	And when he is cured with an iron, in this way: and it is so, that the sick one lies on his back between your hands.
Deinde seca locum Rupturae apostematum et eminentem, sectione per latitudinem, secundum quantitatem trium digitorum.	Then dry up the place of the rupture, the red spot, and the oozing out, with a section through its breadth, according to the quantity of three fingers.
Deinde stringe alsifak et, quae sunt sub cute, donec quando detegitur sifach album, quod est sub cute quae sequitur ipsum.	Then tighten the ligature, and what is under the skin, until when it is detected that the syph of the white, which is under the skin that follows it, has been discovered.
Tunc accipe radium, et pone ipsum super locum eminentem ex sifach, et preme ipsum ad profundum uentris.	Then take a ray, and put the person on the place where the oozing out is from the syph, and press the person down to the depth of the wrist.
Deinde sue duo loca eminentia super extremitatem radii ex sifach, et annecte cum sutura unum eorum cum altero: deinde extrahe extremitatem radii.	Then suit two places of oozing out on the end of the ray from the syph, and join them with a stitch one to the other: then take away the end of the ray.
Et non incidas alsifach omnino, neque tendas ouum, neque aliud, sicut feci te scire in curatione ramicis intestinalis.	And do not at all touch the syph, nor pull out any one, nor any other, as I have told you in the cure for intestinal worms.
Deinde cura illud curatione uulnerum.	Then the cure for this cure of a wound.
Cum ergo incidis fila, mundifica illud, et restaura uulnus, donec consolidetur.	When you have cut the thread, then clean it out, and restore the bone, until it has been hardened.
Sisach enim contrahitur, et non additur eminentia Rupturae.	The thread is broken, and no oozing out is added to the rupture.
Et cauterium est melius in hoc loco: quoniam est propinquius ad salutem.	And the cauterium is better in this place: because it is nearer to salvation.
¶ De mollificatione cutis testiculorum.	Regarding the softening of the skin of the testicles.
Caput LXVIII.	Chapter LXVIII.
Multotiens mollificatur cutis testiculorum in quibusdam hominibus, propter quod mollificantur carnes quae sunt inter ea, et foedatur aspectus eius.	The skin of the testicles is sometimes softened in some people, because the flesh that is between them becomes softened, and its appearance is changed.
Ergo necesse est ei qui rogatur in curatione eius, ut faciat iacere infirmum super dorsum suum, et incidat totam cutem quae mollificata est super cutem naturalem.	Therefore it is necessary for him who asks to be cured of it, that he lie on his back, and incise all the softened skin over the natural skin.
Deinde aggreget duo labia cum sutura: et si uis, sue in primis superfluitatem cutis mollificatae tribus suturis, aut quatuor, et firma suturam.	Then join the two lips together with a stitch: and if the eye, first of all, excess skin is softened by three or four stitches, and a firm stitch.
Deinde incide inter sututuras.	Then open between the stitches.
Deinde cura curatione reliquorum uulnerum, usquequo sanetur, et cadant fila.	Then care for the cure of the other wounds, until they are healed, and let the threads drop off.
¶ De Castratione.	§ On castration.
Caput LXIX.	Head 99.
Scias, quod Castratio in lege nostra excommunicata est: et propter illud liceret mihi, ut non rememorarer eius in libro meo isto: et non est necessaria rememoratio eius, nisi propter duos modos.	You know that castration is excommunicated by our law; and for that reason it would be well if I should not remember it in my book here; and the remembering of it is not necessary except for two reasons.
Quorum unus est, ut sit illud in scientia medici quando interrogatur de ea: et ut sciat curationem eius cui accidit.	Of which one is, that it may be in the knowledge of the physician when he is questioned about it: and so that he may know how to cure him who has had it happen to him.
Et modus alter est, quod nos multotiens indigemus castratione quorundam animalium, propter iuuamenta nostra per illud, sicut arietum, hyrcorum, et gattorum, et similium ex animalibus.	And the other mode is that we often lack castration of certain animals for our own benefit through it, such as goats, horses, and cats, and similar from animals.
Dico ergo, quod Castratio fit secundum duos modos.	I say then, that castration is done according to two ways.
Aut per attritionem.	Or by friction.
Aut per fissuram, et sectionem.	Or by a slits and sections.
In illa autem quae fit per attritionem, uia operationis est: quod nos faciamus sedere animal in aqua calida, donec mollificentur testiculi eius, et leniantur, et pendeant: deinde attere eos manu tua, donec resoluantur et non appareant sub tactu.	In that which is done by friction the course of operation is this: that we make the animal sit in warm water until his testicles become soft and loosen and hang down: then we strike them with our hand until they are completely broken and do not appear under the touch.
In castratione autem per fissuram et sectionem, oportet ut teneas animal, et premas cutem testiculorum eius cum manu sinistra.	In castration however by a slit and sections, you must hold the animal, and press the skin of his testicles with your left hand.
Deinde liga suspensorium, et seca super omne ouum sectione una, donec quando procedunt duo oua: tunc incide ea postquam excoriaueris utrumque, et non dimittas super ea ex sifaket aliquid praeter sifac subtile, quod est super uasa.	Then tie the suspenders and dry completely on all one section, until when the two balls come out: then open them after you have dried them both, and do not let slip anything except the thin skin, which is over the scrotum.
Et iste modus castrationis est melior eo qui fit per attritonem: quoniam attritio fortasse relinquit aliquid ex testiculis, quare desiderat animal coitum.	And this mode of castration is better than that which is done by friction: for friction may leave some of the testicles behind, so that the animal desires to have sex.
Deinde cura uulnus, donec sanetur.	Heal then the fracture until it heals.
¶ De cura Hermafroditae duorum modorum.	The treatment for hermaphroditism has two methods.
Caput LXX.	Chapter LXX.
Hermafrodita ex uiris est secundum duos modos.	(Hermaphrodite is from a single testicle according to two modes.)
Vnus eorum est, quia apparet in eo quod sequitur spacium, aut in cute testiculorum, in eo quod est inter duos testiculos, figura quasi uulua mulieris, in qua sunt pili: et quandoque currit urina ex eo quod est in cute testiculorum.	(The male is from one testicle because it seems to follow a gap, or on the skin of the testes, between the two testes, in the form of a small woman, with hair: and sometimes urine flows from it from the skin of the testes.)
In mulieribus autem est species una, et est uulua mulieris super pectinem sicut testiculi uiri parui omnino, eminentes ad exteriora: quorum unus est sicut priapus uiri, et duo sicut duo testiculi.	(But in women there is one form, and it is a small woman over the skin of the breast like a small testicle of the penis completely, prominent to the outside: of which one is like a penis of a man, and two like two testes.)
Et curatio trium specierum, duarum ex uiris, et speciei unius ex mulieribus, est: quia oportet ut incidas carnes additas, donec effugiat impressio earum.	(And the treatment of three forms, two of a male and one of a female, is this: because you must burn away the added flesh, until you remove the impression of them.)
Deinde cura eas curatione reliquorum uulnerum.	Then heal these wounds with care.
In specie autem secunda uirorum, ex qua egreditur urina, quae est in cute testiculorum, non est operatio, neque est eius curatio omnino.	(As for the second form of men, from which urine flows on the skin of the testes, there is no operation or cure at all.)
¶ De incisione Tentiginis, et carnis eminentis in uuluis mulierum.	On the cutting of tenting and prominent flesh in women's genitals:
Caput LXXI.	Chapter LXXI.
Tentigo fortasse additur super rem naturalem, donec foedatur et turpis fit aspectus eius: et quandoque magnificatur in quibusdam mulieribus adeo, donec expanditur sicut in uiris, et peruenit usque ad coitum.	(The tenting should perhaps be added to the natural part until it is well fed and ugly in appearance; and sometimes becomes enlarged in certain women so much that it resembles a penis, and reaches up to the bed.)
Oportet ergo ut teneas superfluitatem Tentiginis manu, aut cum uncino, et incidas: et non ultimes in incisione, praecipue in profundo radicis: ut non accidat fluxus sanguinis.	(So you should hold back the excess of the tenting by hand, or with a hook, and cut it down; and not finally in the cutting, especially in the deep root: lest there be an outflow of blood.)
Deinde cura ipsam curatione uulnerum, donec sanetur.	Then heal this wound with care until it heals.
Caro autem orta, est caro quae nascitur in orificio matricis, donec impleat ipsum: et fortasse egreditur ad exteriora secundum similitudinem caudae: et propter illud quidam primi nominant aegritudinem caudatam.	(But the central flesh is that which is born in the womb of the mother until it fills itself up: and perhaps comes out to the outside according to the similarity of a tail: and for this reason certain call it sickly tail.)
Oportet ergo ut incidamus eam sicut incidimus Tentiginem, et curemus eam, donec sanetur.	It is necessary that we cut into it as we did with Tentigine, and treat it until it heals.
¶ De cura Alratica, quae est uulua mulieris non perforata.	On the treatment of a torn and unperforated hernia in a woman.
Caput LXXII.	Chapter LVII. On the treatment of a torn and unperforated h
Alratica est, ut sit uulua mulieris non perforata, aut sit foramen paruum.	Hernia Alratica is either in a woman or a small hole.
Et est aut naturalis, aut accidentalis.	and it may be either natural or accidental.
Accidentalis est ex aegritudine quae praecessit: et ipsa quidem fit aut ex carne nata addita, aut sifach subtili, aut spisso: et fit aut in profundo matricis, aut in lateribus eius, aut in superiore ipsius, aut inferiori eius: et prohibet a coitu et impregnatione, et partu, et fortasse prohibet menstrua.	Accidental is due to an earlier illness and may itself be either of native growth added, or a small thread-like substance, or a lump: it may be in the depths of the lake, or in its sides, or in its upper part, or in its lower part; and it prohibits coitus and fertilization, and childbirth, and perhaps menstruation.
Et cognitio illius fit per aspectum obstetricis, si opilatio est apparens propinqua.	And the knowledge of this is obtained by the examination of midwives, if the swelling is apparent and near.
Si autem non est apparens, tunc quaere eam digitis tuis, aut cum radio.	If it is not apparent, then seek it with your fingers or a ray of light.
Si autem opilatio est ex sifach subtili, et est propinqua duobus labiis: tunc propera, et disrumpe ipsam.	If the swelling is caused by a small thread-like substance and is near to the two lips: then bring them together, and unravel it.
Et est, ut ponas super duo labia puluillos.	And it is, as if you place two lips on a pair of woolen balls.
Deinde pone indices tuos duarum manuum simul, et mulier sit super dorsum suum expansis cruribus suis.	Then put your fingers from both hands together, and let the woman lie on her back with her legs spread wide.
Deinde extende duo labia cum fortitudine, donec disrumpatur sifach subtile, et aperiatur opilatio.	Then open the two lips firmly, until the small thread-like substance is unravelled and the swelling opens.
Deinde accipe lanam, et imbibe eam in oleo, et pone ipsam super locum: et coeat mulier omni die, ut non consolidetur locus uice alia.	Then take a piece of wool, dip it in oil, and place it on the spot; and let the woman sit for all day so that the spot does not harden by other force.
Si autem sifach est grossum, spissum: tunc oportet ut seces ipsum cum spatumili lato simili folio myrti.	If the thread-like substance is thick and dense: then it is necessary to separate it with a flat leaf of myrtle similar to a spatulum.
Si autem opilatio est ex carne nata, tunc suspende eam cum uncinis, et incide eam: et sint tecum medicinae quae fluxum sedant sanguinis absque mordicatione, sicut acacia, et sanguis draconis, et thus aggregatum cum albugine oui.	If the swelling is of native growth, then suspend it with a hook and cut it: and let there be with you medicines that will stop the flow of blood without biting, such as acacia and dragon's blood, and such aggregate with alum and chalk.
Deinde administra cannulam ex plumbo amplam, ut non consolidetur uulnus uelociter, teneat eam diebus aliquot: et administra licinium ex lino sicco, deinde curetur reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then administer a large pipe from lead, so that the ulcer does not heal quickly, hold it for a few days: and administer lymph from dry linen, then cure the rest with the remaining cure, until it is healed.
Et quandoque nasciur in matrice natiuitas carnium aliarum: oportet ergo ut incidantur secundum hunc modum: dum non est apostema cancerosum apostemati enim canceroso quod est in matrice, non fiat contrarietas cum ferro omnino.	And when ever a birth takes place in the womb of the mother there are births of other creatures; therefore they should take place according to this method: so that there is no contrario between iron and cancerous tumor, for cancer is not born in the womb with an opposite relationship to iron at all.
¶ De cura hemorroidarum, Athehelil, et Bothor rubeae in uuluis mulierum.	On the treatment of hemorrhoids, Athelyl and Bochor's red rash on the genitals of women.
Caput LXXIII.	Chapter LIII.
Hemorroides quidem sunt apertio orificiorum uenarum, donec currit ex eis sanguis multus assidue.	The hemorrhoids are an opening of the anal orifices, from which much blood runs frequently.
Cum ergo antiquantur hemorroides, fiunt thelil: et iam dixi in diuisione species earum, et signa ipsarum: et dicam hic quae ex eis recipiunt curationem, et quae non.	Now when the hemorrhoids have been long, they become thorns; and I have already, in the division of their species and the signs thereof, said here that which receives the cure, and that which does not.
Dico ergo, quod hemorroides quae sunt in orificio matricis, et non apparent sensui: tunc non est ei curatio cum ferro.	I say, therefore, that the hemorrhoids which are in the opening of the womb, and do not appear to be sensible: then there is no cure for them with iron.
Quae autem ex eis sunt in orificio matricis super quas cadit sensus, sunt quae curantur.	But those which are out of the womb, above which there is a sense, are those which are cured.
Oportet ergo ut intromittas mulierem in domum frigidam.	It is necessary that you should put the woman into a cold house.
Deinde extende athehelil cum forficibus, aut cum panno aspero, et incide eas ex radicibus suis.	Then extend Athelyl with forceps or with a rough cloth, and cut them from their roots.
Deinde pulueriza super eas apud fluxum sanguinis ex uno puluerum incisiuorum absque mordificatione: sicut acacia, et sanguis draconis, et thus, et similia eis.	Then dust them over with a powder at the flow of blood from one that has been cut without mortifying it: as acacia and dragon's blood, and thistle, and such like to it.
Deinde impellat pedes eius ad parietem hora una.	Then push her feet against the wall for an hour.
Postea depone eam in aquam frigidam.	Then put her into cold water.
Quod si perseuerat fluxus sanguinis: tunc fac eam sedere in decoctione sumach, et corticum granatorum, et gallarum, et similium.	If the flow of blood persists: then make her sit in a decoction of sumach, and cutlar root, and gall, and such like.
Deinde accipe farinam hordei, et confice eam cum melle et aceto, et fac emplastrum cum eo super dorsum eius.	Then take flour of barley, and make it into a paste with honey and vinegar, and make a ointment with it for her back.
Si ergo abscinditur sanguis cum eo, bonum est: et si non, fac adhaerere dorso uentosas, et mammillis, absque scarificatione.	If then blood is cut with it, it is good; and if not, let the back wound heal with a furrow and without scarification.
Deinde accipe lanam, et submerge in succo tarathit, aut succo arnoglossae, aut succo ramorum alaulat, id est, aglanter, uino pontico, et fac adhaerere loeo.	Then take a cloth and soak it in taraxacum juice, or arnica juice, or oak sap juice, that is, without taste, with Pontic wine, and let the back wound heal.
Cum ergo quiescit apostema, tunc cura locum cum unguentis, donec sanetur.	When then the apotheosis has subsided, then take care of the place with ointment, until it is healed.
Albarth uero rubeum est simile capitibus alhaasse, et est asperi aspectus.	Albarth is actually similar to red caps and is rough in appearance.
Oportet ergo ut incidas quod apparet ex eo, secundum quod dixi in thelil aequaliter: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Therefore let it be known what appears from it, according to which I said in the litil equal: and take care of it, until it is healed.
¶ De perforatione Exiturae quae accidit in matrice.	Regarding the exit that happens in the womb.
Caput LXXIIII.	Head 74.
Accidunt in matrice species multae apostematum, sicut cancer, et apostema lapideum, et ulcera, et adubelati, et alekilati, id est, herpes, aestiomemus, et fistulae, et hemorroides, et ragadiae, et thelil, et apostema calidum.	In the womb there are many kinds of apotheosis, such as cancer, and a hard apotheosis, and sores, and blisters, and scabs, and worms, and warts, and roughness, and hot apotheosis.
Et ego quidem iam dixi omnes has aegritudines et species earum, et signa ipsarum, et earum curationes in diuisione: necesse est ut dicam in hoc tractatu apostema calidum quod accidit in matrice, quando est ex apostematibus quae colligunt saniem, et uis scire qualiter fit eius apertio cum ferro.	And I have already said all these diseases and their kinds, and their signs, and their cures, in a division: it is necessary for me to say in this book about hot apotheosis which happens in the womb, when it is from apotheosis that collect blood, and to know how its opening takes place with iron.
Oportet ergo ut consideres.	Therefore let it be known.
Tunc si dolor apostematis in incaeptione sua est acutus cum percussione sua, et flamma, et febre: et uides ipsum rubere: si cadit super ipsum sensus, tunc non properes cum perforatione eius: et cura ipsum cum eo eo quod iuuat super maturationem, donec quando quiescat acuitas accidentium.	Then if the pain of apotheosis in its beginning is acute with its percussion, and flame, and fever: and you see it red: if it falls on top of itself, then do not like the opening of it: and take care of it with him so that he may please on maturation, until when it has subsided acuity of accidents.
Tunc oportet ut facias sedere mulierem super sedem quae labeat duo sedilia, et reclinetur, uel appodietur super dorsum suum, et aggreget pedes suos ad partem inferiorem uentris: et sint coxae eius expansae, et ponat brachia sua sub genibus suis, et liget utraque ligamento conueniente ad illud.	Then let the woman sit on a seat that she may touch two chairs, and lean back, or lie down on her back, and put her feet towards the lower side of her body: and let her legs be spread out, and let her arms rest under her knees, and let her bind each leg with a binding that suits it.
Deinde sedeat obstetrix a latere dextro, et administra instrumentum quo aperitur orificium matricis.	Then let the midwife sit to the right rear, and let her administer the instrument with which she opens the womb's orifice.
Cuius forma uenit in eis quae sunt post.	Whose form came to those who are behind.
Et oportet quando uis administrare hoc instrumentum, ut figas cum Radio profundum matricis mulieris: ut non sit illud quod ingreditur ex instrumento plus, quam profundum matricis, et laedat infirmam.	And it is necessary when you administer this instrument that you hold it with the arm's depth towards the woman's womb, so that the thing that enters from the instrument does not enter more than the depth of the womb and hurts the weak one.
Si autem fuerit instrumentum magis quam profundum, tunc oportet ut ponas puluillos super tecturam profundi matricis: ut prohibeatur introitus instrumenti totius in profundum matricis: et oportet ut ponat uertiginem, quae currit in instrumento, ex latere superiore: et ut teneat instrumentum, et ut reuoluat minister uertiginem, donec aperiatur profundum matricis.	But if the instrument is more than the depth then it is necessary that you put the pulley on top of the depth of the womb so that the introduction of the instrument into all of the womb is prevented; and it is necessary that you hold the instrument, and turn back the pulley, which runs in the instrument, from the upper side: and that he holds the instrument, and turns back the pulley, until the womb'
Cum ergo apparet Exitura, et tangitur manu, et est lenis et mollis: tunc oportet ut seces ipsam apud caput suum cum spatumili lato.	So when it appears that it is coming out, and touches the hand, and is soft and smooth: then you must separate it from its head with a smooth edge.
Cum ergo euacuatur sanies, tunc oportet ut ponas in uulnus licinium submersum in oleo rosaceo: aut oleo uiridi, in quo sit quaedam stipticitas: et pone licinium, et extrahe sectionem in profundo matricis.	So when the pus is drained then you must put the licinus, which has been dipped in rose oil', in the oil of violet", and put the licinus, and take out a piece from the depth of the womb.
Et pone exterius super matricem, et super pectinem lanam mundam submersam in aqua, in qua bullitae sunt maluae.	And put the outside on top of the womb, and on the woollen cloth, which has been dipped in water, in which the salt has been boiled.
Deinde curetur post duos dies cum unguento quod conuenit ad illud, donec sanetur.	Then he will take care after two days with the ointment that suits it, until it heals up.
Et quandoque abluitur matrix et uulnus, ita quod clisterizatur cum aqua et melle: deinde cum aqua in qua bullita est radix lilii, aut aristolochia longa: deinde redeat ad unguentum.	And when the womb is washed and the scar is so that it can be cleansed with water and honey: then he will return to the ointment.
Quod si uulnus absconditum fuerit interius in matrice, tunc oportet ut prohibearis ex curatione eius cum ferro, imo cura ipsum cum eo quod diximus in diuisione.	Which if the scar is hidden inside the womb then it is necessary to prevent its cure with fire, indeed take care of itself with what we have said in division.
¶ Doctrinae Obstetricum, qualiter medicentur embriones uiui, secundum figuram non naturalem egressi.	Doctrines of obstetrics, how they treat the fetus of a woman, according to the form that is not natural for the exit.
Caput Lxxu.	Head 76.
Necesse est Obstetrici, ut cognoscat in primis figuram partus naturalis.	It is necessary for the obstetrician to recognize the natural puerperal form at first.
Ex signis ergo eius est, quod quando uides mulierem comprimi ad inferiora, et desiderat odorare aerem, et alleuiatur super eam quod super ipsam est de partu, et festinat exitus embrionis: tunc scias quod iste partus est secundum figuram naturalem, et est exitus eius super caput suum, et secundina cum eo: aut suspensa, uel pendens ex umbilico.	From the signs then, it is that when you see a woman compressing herself from below and wanting to smell the air and relieve herself because she feels the baby's exit on her, then you know that this birth is in the natural form, and its exit is above her head and with it the second, or suspended from the navel.
Cum ergo uides haec signa, tunc oportet ut comprimatur uenter eius, ut descendat embrio uelociter.	When then you see these signs, so it is necessary for the womb to compress, that the baby may descend quickly.
Nam quando descendit super caput suum, descendit secundina cum eo, et mundatur ex illis superfluitatibus mundificatione bona.	For when he has descended above his head, the second has descended with him, and it is cleansed from it with good purgations.
Qui autem est praeter hunc partum, est innaturalis, illaudabilis.	But if this birth is not like that, it is unnatural, unworthy of praise.
Quoniam quandoque egreditur foetus super pedes suos, et egreditur corpus eius ante caput ipsius, et pedes eius, et manus eius una, aut pes eius unus: aut egreditur caput eius et manus eius: aut egreditur uentrinus: et fortasse conuertitur super collum suum, et similia ex figuris illaudabilibus.	For when the baby has come out of his feet, and the body has come out in front of his head, and his feet and hands are one, or his foot or hand is: or when his head and hands have come out: or when the womb has come out: and perhaps it turns over on its neck, and similar signs that cannot be praised.
Necesse est ergo Obstetrici, ut sit prudens, subtilis in istis rebus omnibus, et caueat sibi ab errore et decaeptione: et ego sum ostendens omnem figuram ex eis, et qualiter est ingenium in ea, et significetur per illud, et stetur super ipsum.	It is therefore necessary for the obstetrician to be prudent and cautious in all these matters, and to beware of error and deception: and I show you all the figures from them, and how the mind works in it, and signals it through it, and calls out on it.
Quando egreditur foetus super caput suum egressione sua naturali, et uehemens fit illud super mulierem, et difficilis fit ei partus, et uides uirtutem eius iam debilitatam: tunc fac eam sedere super sedem, aut mulieres teneant eam: et uapora uuluam eius cum foenugraeco decocto, et cum oleis humidis.	When the baby has come out of his head with his natural exit, and he becomes heavy on the woman, and her birth is difficult, and you see her strength failing already: then make her sit down on a chair, or let women support her: and sprinkle her with fenugreek tea, and with wet oils.
Deinde intromittat Obstetrix inter digitos suos Spatumile paruum, et findat cum eo secundinam, et secet eam ungue suo, donec currat quod est in ea ex humiditate: et preme uentrem mulieris, donec descendat foetus.	Then the obstetrician will introduce his finger between her fingers a small spittle, and find with him the second, and dry it up with his nail until it is clean, and press the woman's womb, until the baby has come out.
Si autem non descendit, tunc oportet ut clisterizetur mulier ex mucillagine foenugraeci, cum oleo sisamino.	If it has not come down, then a woman should be made to spit out the foamgrape mucus with sesame oil.
Deinde praecipe ei post clistere, ut comprimatur: et fac eam sternutare cum condisi, et tene os eius et nasum ipsius hora una.	Then order her to compress herself after the enema, and have her sneeze with a condescending tone, and hold her nose and mouth for an hour.
Foetus enim egredietur statim.	For fear that the fetus will come out at once.
Quod si egrediantur duae manus foetus in primis, iunc oportet ut reducas eas cum facilitate paulatim.	What if two hands of the fetus come out first, then it is necessary that you reduce them with ease gradually.
Si autem non obedit in introitu, tunc pone mulierem super sedem, et eleua pedes eius sursum: deinde concute sedem super terram: et mulier teneatur, ut non cadat apud concussionem.	If she does not obey when led into, then place the woman on a chair, and raise her feet up: then push the chair down on the ground: and let the woman hold on, so that she does not fall by the jolt.
Si ergo non egrediuntur manus, et moritur foetus: tunc incide eas, et extrahe residuum foetus: et liga manum eius cum panno, et extrahe ipsum cum aequalitate: nam ipse egredietur.	If then the hands do not come out, and the fetus dies: then cut them open, and remove the residue of the fetus: and bind her hand with a cloth, and remove it with equality: for he will come out.
¶ Exitus embrionis super pedes suo.	Exit of the embryo on his own feet.
Quando egreditur foetus super pedes suos, tunc oportet ut impellat eos sursum: deinde conuertat foetum paulatim: postea aequet ipsum.	When the fetus comes out on his own feet, then it is necessary that you push him up: and gradually turn the fetus over: and then make him even.
Deinde accipiat unum pedum eius, et extendat eum paulatim.	Then take one of her feet, and stretch it out gradually.
Cum ergo egrediuntur usque ad coxas, tunc praecipe ei, ut comprimatur, et fac eam sternutare cum condisi: egredietur enim, si Deus uoluerit.	For when they have come out as far as the hips, then order her to compress herself, and have her sneeze with a condescending tone: for one will come out if God wills it.
Et si non egreditur cum eo quod narrauimus, tunc reduc foetum paulatim, donec ponas eum secundum figuram naturalem.	And if he does not come out with what we have described, then gradually reduce the fetus, until you put him back in his natural shape.
Nam ipse egredietur tunc egressu facili.	For he will come out then by an easy exit.
Quod si prohibeatur cum eo toto quod narrauimus: tunc accipe ex mucillagine alteae, et oleo sisamino, et gummi soluto: et percute totum in mortario percussione bona: deinde line cum eo uuluam mulieris, et inferius uentris eius.	What if you stop completely all that we have described: then take from the foamgrape, with sesame oil and a dissolved gum: and strike it all in a mortar with a good hammer: then let a woman's ulna hit it from below, and her feet.
Deinde fac eam sedere in aqua tepida, donec consequatur hypocundria.	Then I make him sit in tepid water until the hypochondriac becomes visible.
Cum ergo uides quod iam calefacta sunt inferiora eius, tunc fac ei sief de myrrha: et suppone ipsum.	When you see that his lower parts have already become warm, then make him sit on Myrrh and support him.
Quando ergo tenet sief hora una, tunc fac eam sedere super sedem.	When he has held the seat for an hour, then I make her sit on a chair.
Deinde fac eam sternutare: et stringe ipsius os et nasum: et preme inferiorem partem uentris compressione facili.	Then I make him sneeze: and tightening his mouth and nose, I press the lower part of his leg with a gentle compression.
Nam foeus egredietur statim.	For the heat will soon come out.
¶ Exitus foetus super genua et manus.	Exit the fetus over the knees and hands.
Quando egreditur secundum hanc formam, tunc ingeniet in intromittendo manus suas paulatim.	When it comes out in this form, then she will come by slowly inserting her hands.
Deinde resupinetur mulier super collum suum, et pendeant pedes eius ad inferiora: et ipsa sit iacens super lectum, et complicet manus suas.	Then the woman should lie on her back and hang her feet down to the ground: and she herself should lie on a bed and interlace her hands.
Deinde preme supra uentrem eius paulatim.	Then I press upon her belly little by little.
Deinde extrahe quod est sub pedibus eius ex puluinaribus, donec sit praeparata in inferiori parte.	Then I pull out what is under her feet from the armpits until it is prepared in the lower part.
Quod si non egreditur foetus, tunc accipe pedes eius, et moue eos motu uehementi.	If the fetus does not come out, then take her feet and move them violently.
Deinde preme quod est supra hypocundria paulatim, donec ascendat foetus ad superiora.	Then I press what is above the hypochondria little by little until the fetus rises to the upper parts.
Deinde intromittat manus suas, et aequet foetum paulatim: et praecipe mulieri, ut comprimatur, donec egrediatur foetus.	Then he should interlace his hands and smooth the fetus little by little: and he should order the woman to compress, until the fetus comes out.
¶ Exitus foetus latitudinaliter pendens ex manibus.	Exit the fetus hanging from the arms.
Ingenietur in reductione manus eius.	He should be prevented from reducing his hands.
Si autem non potest reducere eam, tunc eleua mulierem, et fac eam ambulare.	If he cannot reduce it, then the woman should be rubbed and made to walk.
Si uero ambulare non potest, tunc fac eam iacere super lectum: et concute crura eius concussione uehementi.	But if walking is not possible, then make her lie on a bed: and shake her legs violently.
Deinde administra linimentum quod praeparasti ex mucillaginibus.	Then administer the ointment which you have prepared from mucilaginous substances.
Quod si accipit eam partus, tunc fac eam sedere super sedem.	If she accepts the birth, then make her sit on a chair.
Deinde stude in reductione manus, et aequa foetum secundum figuram naturalem: et fac sternutare mulierem, et praecipe ei, ut comprimat se, donec egrediatur.	Then study the reduction of her hands and the fetus in a natural position: and make the woman sneeze, and order her to compress herself, until she comes out.
¶ Exitus foetus super collum suum, expansis manibus, et est facies eius ad dorsum matris suae.	The baby's head comes out above its shoulder, with its hands spread wide, and its face turned towards the back of its mother's body.
Oportet ut teneat Obstetrix manum foetus, deinde reuoluat eum paulatim, et aequet eum cum facilitate.	It is necessary that the obstetrician hold the baby's hand, then turn it gradually and easily.
Cum ergo aequatur, tunc pone super uuluam eius quod narrauimus ex oleo et mucillaginibus.	But when it has become calm, then place it on its back that we spoke of with oil and mucus.
Deinde praecipe ei, ut moueatur paulatim.	Then order him to move his arms slowly.
Cum ergo feceris illud, tunc fac eam sedere super sedem, et praecipe ei ut inclinetur ad latus dextrum.	But when you have done this, then make her sit down on a seat, and order her to lean against the right side.
Deinde praecipe ei, ut comprimatur: et fac eam sternutare cum condisi.	Then order him to compress himself: and make him sneeze with a handkerchief.
¶ Exitus foetus praeparati super latus.	The prepared baby is on the side.
Quando descendit ad orificium matricis secundum hunc modum cum secundina, tunc scinde secundinam cum ungue tuo, donec euacuetur ex humiditate.	When it descended into the mother' s opening in this way with the second, then cut the second with your finger, until it is discharged from the moisture.
Si ergo suspenditur super faciem foetus, et collum eius, tunc incide eam ex umbilico: ut non retineatur, et moriatur.	But if he should hang above the baby' s face and its neck, then cut him from the umbilical cord: lest he hold on and die.
Deinde impelle foetum ad interiora, donec ponas eam secundum quod oportet: et praecipe mulieri, ut comprimat se aliquotiens: ipse enim egredietur exitu leui.	Then push the baby into the insides, until you place it as is necessary: and order the woman to compress herself sometimes: for he will come out easily.
¶ Exitus Geminorum, aut foetuum multorum.	The exit of twins, or of many babies.
Scias, quod Gemini multotiens nascuntur: et quandoque nascuntur tres, et quatuor.	You know that twins are often born: and sometimes three, and four.
Verumtamen illud extraneum est, et raro contingit.	But that is unusual, and seldom happens.
Quinque uero est res extra naturam, et non uiuunt penitus: et continet eos, quamuis multiplicentur, secundina una: et separantur per sifach, distinguens inter eos ligatum in umbilico cuiusque eorum.	Five is a thing outside nature, and they do not live long apart: and it holds them together, however they multiply, only two at a time: and separates them by the scaph, distinguishing between them with tied cords around each of their navels.
Et quandoque egrediuntur sicut egreditur foetus unus exitu naturali, facili: et egrediuntur exitu illaudabili, sicut narrauimus.	And when they go out as does one baby from a natural exit easily: and they go out with a loud noise, as we have told.
Quod si difficiles fuerint quidam eorum apud partum, et perueniunt ad illud quod diximus ex figuris innaturalibus, tunc cura eos sicut narrauimus: et sit ob stetrix subtilis, et faciat quod facit cum facilitate et tarditate, et ingenietur secundum omnem figuram cum eo quod praeparatur ei ex ingenio ducente ad salutem.	That if any of them are difficult at the time of birth, and seek to go to that which we have spoken from unnatural figures, then take care of them as we have told: and let it sit on a soft cloth, and do what it does easily and tardily, and make it take all shapes with it as it is prepared by nature leading to salvation.
¶ Rememoratio eius quod formatur in matrice ex embrionibus, et abortiuntur.	Remembering that he is formed in the womb from embryos and is aborted.
Quandoque formatur in matrice unus, et duo, et tres, et quatuor, et quinque, et sex, et septem, et plures decem: et iam uerificatum est apud me, quod mulier abortiendo emisit septem, et alia quindecim, omnes formatos.	When he is formed in the womb one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, and more than ten: and I have already verified it with myself that a woman who aborts has emitted seven, and another fifteen, all formed.
Quod factum est mensuratione gloriosi sapientis.	That which was measured by the glorious sage.
Hoc ergo totum oportet ut sit in scientia Obstetricis.	This then is what should be understood in the science of obstetrics.
Fortasse enim perueniet ad eam simile illius: opponat ergo ei cum illo quod oportet	For it may perhaps come to that which is similar to it: then oppose it with it that which is necessary
¶ De extractione foetus mortui.	On the extraction of a dead fetus.
Caput LXXVI.	Chapter LXVII.
Quando curas foetum mortuum cum eo quod dixi in diuisione ex medicatione, et non egreditur, et cogeris uti operatione cum manu, tunc oportet ut consideres.	When you are concerned with the extraction of a dead fetus as I have said in the division on surgery and do not exit, and you urge that you use the hand operation, then you should consider.
Si ergo mulier est sanae uirtutis, et non est cum aliquo ex accidentibus, ex quibus timetur super eam perditio: tunc oportet ut resupinetur mulier super lectum, super dorsum suum, et sit caput eius inclinatum inferius, et crura eius eleuata: et ministra teneat eam a duabus partibus, aut ligetur ad lectum, ut non extrahatur corpus eius apud extractionem foetus.	If then the woman is of sound virtue and is not with any of the accidents from which she fears destruction: then it should be that the woman reclines on her bed, on her back, and has her head inclined downward, and her legs raised: and he should hold her by two sides, or tie her to the bed, so that her body is not extracted along with the extraction of the fetus.
Deinde humecta os matricis ex oleis humidis cum mucillagine alteae, et foenugraeci, et seminis lini.	Then moisten the mother's mouth with moist oil with mucilaginous althaea, and fenugrecum, and flax seed.
Deinde inungat Obstetrix manum suam cum istis oleis et mucillaginibus: deinde intromittat eam in matricem cum facilitate.	Then the midwife should wash her hands with these oils and mucilages: then she should enter the woman' s womb with ease.
Deinde quaerat cum ea locum in quo figat uncinos ex foetu, et loca conuenientia ad illud.	Then she should ask where to place the knot of the fetus, and the suitable places for it.
Considera ergo tunc, si foetus est praeparatus ut descendat super caput suum: tunc fige uncinos in oculos eius, aut in collo eius, aut in ore eius, aut in palato ipsius, aut sub barba eius, aut in furcula ipsius, aut in locis propinquis costis, et sub hypocundriis.	Then consider, if the fetus is prepared to descend over its head: then place the knot in her eyes, or her throat, or her mouth, or her palate, or under her beard, or in her neck, or in the places adjacent to the ribs, and beneath the hip bones.
Si autem descensus est super pedes eius, tunc in pectine, et costis eius mediis.	If however the descent is over his feet, then in the chest, and his ribs in the middle.
Et oportet, ut teneat uncinum cum manu dextra: et ponat curuitatem eius in eo quod est inter digitos sinistrae manus: et intromittat cum manu cum facilitate, et figat uncinum in aliquo illorum locorum quae diximus, donec perueniat ad rem uacuam.	And it should be that he holds the awl with his right hand: and lays the wound on himself between the fingers of his left hand: and inserts with ease, and fastens the awl in one of those places which we said, until he has reached the hole.
Deinde figat in oppositione eius uncinum alium, aut tertium, si indiges: ut sit contractio aequalis, et non declinet ad partem.	Then fasten on the other side of his awl, or a third, if you are able to: so that it is equal contraction, and does not decline to the side.
Deinde extendatur extensione aequali, et non sit extensio secundum rectitudinem tantum, imo moueatur ad omnem partem, ut alleuietur exitus eius: sicut fit cum dente apud eradicationem eius.	Then let it be extended with an equal extension, and does not extend only according to the rectitude, but also move on all sides, so that it relieves his exit: as happens when a tooth is removed in the process of extraction.
Et oportet in eo quod est inter illud, ut mollificetur extensio.	And should be in him who is between that, so that the extension is softened.
Quod si retineatur ex eo pars, tunc oportet ut inungat Obstetrix quosdam digitos cum oleo, et intromittat eos ex parte, ut reuoluat cum eis quod retinetur.	That if a part is retained from him, then it should be that the midwife puts some fingers with oil, and inserts them on the side, so that they rotate with it, because it holds.
Si ergo egreditur pars foetus, tunc permutentur uncini ad locum alium qui sit altior: fac hoc donec egrediatur foetus totus.	If then a part of the fetus comes out, then change the awls to another place that is higher: do this until the whole fetus has come out.
Si ergo egreditur manus ante alia, et non est possibile reducere eam, propter coartationem eius: tunc oportet, ut inuoluatur super eam pannus.	If then a hand comes out ahead of the other, and it is not possible to reduce it by coarsening: then should be that a cloth is wrapped over it.
Deinde extrahe eam donec quando egreditur tota, incide eam aut in iunctura plantae, aut in cubito: et ita oportet ut facias in manu altera, et in duobus pedibus.	Then draw it out until when all is coming out, cut it or insert it into the socket of the hand, or into the bed: and so should you do to the other hand, and to the two feet.
Si autem caput foetus est magnum, aut accidit ei coartatio in exitu, aut est in capite eius aqua aggregata: tunc oportet ut intromittat inter digitos Spatumile spinosum, et findat cum eo caput, et extrahat aquam: aut disrumpat ipsum cum instrumento quod nominatur Almisdac: cuius forma uenit cum formis reliquorum instrumentorum in capitulo quod est post hoc.	If then the head of the fetus is large, or has a coarsening during its exit, or there is water in his head: then should be that it inserts between the fingers of the Spatulimile spinosum, and finds with it the head, and draws out the water: or breaks it up with an instrument called Almisdach: whose shape comes with the forms of other instruments in the following chapter.
Similiter faciat si foetus est magni capitis natura, tunc oportet ut seces algengematu: aut extrahas ipsum cum misdach, sicut diximus.	Similarly, if the fetus has a large head, then the umbilical cord should be cut: or else it should be pulled out with the hand, as we have said.
Deinde attrahas ossa cum forcipibus.	Then, pull out the bones with forceps.
Quod si egrediatur caput, et coartetur apud furculam: tunc findatur, donec effundatur humiditas quae est in pectore.	If the head comes out, and the cord is around the neck: then cut off, until the moisture which is in the chest is let out.
Si autem non complicatur, neque obedit ad exitum: tunc incide caput frustatim, secundum quod possibile est tibi.	If it is not complicated, and does not submit to delivery: then cut off the head prematurely, as far as you can do it.
Quod si inferius uentris est apostematum, aut est in eo hydropisis: tunc oportet ut perfores ipsum, donec currat humiditas ex eo.	If the lower limb is deformed, or there is hydrops in it: then you should cut off the member, until the moisture which is in it has run out.
Si uero foetus est super pedes suos, tunc attractio eius est facilis, et directio eius ad os matricis est leuis.	But if the fetus is above its feet, then the attraction of it is easy, and the direction of it towards the mother's mouth is gentle.
Si autem coartatur apud uentrem, aut pectus: tunc oportet ut extrahas ipsum cum panno quem inuoluisti super manum tuam: et findat uentrem, aut pectus, donec currat quod est in eis.	But if the cord is around the gut, or the chest: then you should take a piece of cloth which you have on your hand, and cut off the member, until the moisture which is in it has run out.
Si autem auferuntur reliqua membra, et redit caput: tunc intromittat Obstetrix manum sinistram.	If other limbs are also taken away, and then the head comes out: then let the midwife put her left hand in.
Si ergo os matricis est apertum, tunc intromittat manum in profundum matricis, et quaerat cum ea caput, et attrahat ipsum cum digitis usque ad os matricis: deinde intromittat in eo uncinum unum, aut uncinos duos, et attrahat ipsum cum eo.	But if the mother' s mouth is open, then let the woman put her hand in deep into the vagina, and look at the head, and attract it with her fingers up to the mouth: then let her put in a hook, or two hooks, and attract it with it.
Quod si os matricis coartatur, propter apostema calidum quod accidit ei: tunc non oportet ut laboretur super ipsum, imo oportet tunc administrare effusionem rerum humidarum, pinguium: et administra emplastra: et sedeat in aquis quae mollificant et humectant.	If the mouth of the mother is closed, because of the hot swelling which has happened to it: then it is not necessary that she should work on the fetus, but rather at that time you should administer to her the flowing fluids, thick: and apply plasters: and let her sit in water which softens and moistens.
Quod si foetus est super latus suum, tunc possibile est ut aequetur: tunc administretur quod diximus in foetu uiuo.	If the fetus is above its side, then it is possible that it will be quiet: then administer to it what we have said about a single fetus.
Quod si non est possibile illud, tunc incidatur frustatim, et extrahatur.	If it is not possible to do so, then incise quickly and remove it.
Et oportet ut non dimittas aliquid ex secundina intus omnino.	And you should not leave anything inside at all after the second incision.
Cum ergo compleueris operationem tuam, tunc administra quod diximus in apostematibus calidis quae accidunt in matricibus.	Since you have completed your operation, then administer what we said in the apostemes of the hot things that happen in the wombs.
Quod si accidat fluxus sanguinis, tunc descendat in aquis stipticis, et administra reliquam curationem.	If a flow of blood occurs, then let it go down in water of rigor, and administer the remaining cure.
Et ego quidem iam uidi mulierem, in cuius uentre mortuus erat foetus: deinde impregnata est super ipsum uice alia, postea mortuus est foetus alius etiam.	And I have already seen a woman, in whose womb the fetus was dead: and then she became pregnant again on top of that same womb, after which the other fetus also died.
Accidit ergo ei post tempus longum apostema in umbilico suo, et inflatum est, donec apertum est: et coepit emittere pus.	So it happened to her after a long time that an apostema appeared in her navel, and it swelled up until it was opened, and it began to discharge pus.
Vocatus sum ergo ad curationem eius, et medicatus sum ei tempore longo: et non consolidatum est uulnus.	So I was called to her cure, and I treated her for a long time: and the wound did not heal.
Posui ergo super ipsum ex quibusdam emplastris fortis attractionis: et exiuit ex loco os.	I then placed over it some strong adhesive plasters: and it came out of place from the mouth.
Deinde praeterierunt ei dies aliquot, et exiuit os aliud.	Then a few days passed, and another outlet came out from her mouth.
Miratus sum ergo inde, cum in uentre non sit os.	I was amazed then that there is no outlet in the womb when there is an outlet in the mouth.
Cogitaui ergo, quia erant ex ossibus foetus mortui.	I thought, since there are bones of a dead fetus.
Inquisiui ergo uulnus, et extraxi ossa multa, muliere existente in melioribus dispositionibus suis: et iam uixit taliter tempore longo, et mittit ex loco pus parum.	I inquired about the wound, and I pulled out many bones, while she was in a better state of health: and now she did not live for such a long time, and she began to discharge pus from the site little by little.
Et ego non firmaui hic hoc extraneum, nisi quoniam in eo est scientia, et adiutorium ad illud, quod administrat medicus artifex cum manu ex curatione.	And I do not make this foreign to you, unless there is knowledge and aid for it, which the skilled healer can administer with his hand in the cure.
¶ De formis Instrumentorum necessariorum in extractione foetus.	On Forms Of Instruments Necessary For The Extraction Of The Fetus.
Caput LXXVII.	Chapter LXVII. On The Head.
Hic inferius est forma Strictorii, quo aequantur libri, cui aequaliter sunt duae uertigines in duabus extremitatibus duorum lignorum.	Here is the form of the Strigulator, which are joined at equal intervals to two rods, with two twines.
Verumtamen haec Vertigo oportet ut sit subtilior strictorio: et ut fiat, aut ex ebano, aut ex ligno bussi.	However, this vertigo should be made less coarse than the striga, and so it is made either of ebony or of wood from the buss tree.
Et sit latitudo omnis ligni quasi duo digiti: et margo cuiusque amborum est quasi digitus unus, et longitudo cuiusque eorum est palmus et medietas: et in medio duorum lignorum sunt duo additamenta ex genere eiusdem ligni, quae iam firmata sunt in utrisque, quorum longitudo est medietas palmi et plus parum: et latitudo utriusque est quasi duo digiti, aut plus parum.	And let the width of all the wood be as wide as two fingers: and the margin of each of them is as wide as a finger, and their length is as a palm and half; and in the middle of the two woods there are two additions of the same kind of wood, which have already been set firm on both, the length of which is the half of the palm and slightly more; and the width of each is almost two fingers, or slightly less.
Et ista duo additamenta intromittuntur in os matricis, ut aperiatur cum eis quando tu reuoluis duas Vertigines.	And these two additions are inserted into the jaw bone, so that it opens with them when you turn your two wheels.
Forma Vertiginis qua aperitur matrix.	The form of the jaw opening.
Forma alia ad simile illius, subtilior, et leuior.	There is another one similar to it, which is smaller and lighter.
Fiat ex ligno ebani, aut bussi, secundum similitudinem forcipum.	Let it be made of ebony wood, or pine wood, according to the similarity of the claws.
Verumtamen in extremitate eius sint duo additamenta, sicut uides hic supra: et longitudo omnis additamenti ex eis est quasi palmus: et latitudo utriusque est, duo digiti.	However, at the end there are two additions, as you can see here above: and the length of each of them is almost a palm: and the width of each is that of two fingers.
Cum ergo uis aperire matricem cum eo, tunc fac sedere mulierem super lectum, pendentibus pedibus eius, aperto quod est inter crura eius.	But when you open the jaw with it, then make the woman sit on a bed, her feet hanging down, open what is between her shoulder blades.
Deinde intromitte ista duo additamenta coniuncta in matricem: et tu es tenens extremitatem instrumenti inferius inter coxas eius.	Then insert these two additions joined together into the jaw: and you, holding the end of the instrument between her thighs.
Deinde aperi manum tuam cum instrumento, sicut facis cum forficibus, aequaliter secundum quantitatem quam uis ex apertione oris matricis, donec faciat Obstetrix quod uult.	Then open your hand with the instrument as you do with the claws, equally according to the quantity that you wish by opening the mouth of the jaw, until the midwife does what she wants to do.
Forma Vertiginis alterius quam dixerunt antiqui Forma Impellentis quo impellitur foetus.	The form of the second wheel, which is different from that which the ancient people spoke about, as it pushes forward the fetus.
Forma Almisdac, qua conteritur caput magnum: et assimilatur forcipi, cui sunt dentes in extremitate, sicut uides.	The form of Al-Misdar, by which the great head is turned: and resembles the claws, with teeth at the end, as you can see.
Et quandoque fit oblungum, sicut forcipes secundum hanc formam, sicut uides, cui sunt dentes sicut dentes serrae, quo inciditur et conteritur.	And when it is turned inwards, as the claw does according to this form, as you can see, with teeth like a saw, which cuts and turns inside.
Forma Almisdac quo conteritur caput paruum.	The form of Al-Misdar, by which the small head is turned.
Forma Vncini habentis spinam unam.	Form a Vncinis with one spine.
Forma Vncini habentis spinas duas.	Form a Vncinis with two spines.
Forma forcipis cui sunt dentes serrae, cum quo conteritur caput foetus.	Make a forceps which has serrated teeth and which grasps the head of the fetus.
Forma Spatumilis habentis duas extremitates ad abscindendum caput.	Form a scissor with two ends for cutting off the head.
Forma duorum Spatumilium etiam latorum.	Also form two scissors for holding open.
Ista instrumenta omnia exercentur, et quanto plus multiplicantur species eorum, et praeparata sunt apud artificem, est uelocior ad operationem suam, et altior apud homines, propter quantitatem suam.	These instruments are all used and the more their kinds multiply and they are prepared for use by artifice, the quicker they are in their work and the higher they stand among men because of their number.
Non ergo despicies ex eis instrumentum, quin sit apud te praeparatum.	Do not then despise these instruments, even if they do not exist with you; rather, have them prepared for you.
Inexcusabilis est enim necessitas eorum.	It is not excusable to need them.
¶ De extractione Secundinae.	§ On the Extraction of the Second.
Caput LXXVIII.	Head 78.
Quando retinetur Secundina apud partum, tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmae, ut retineat anhelitum suum.	When the second is retained at childbirth, then you must take care to hold back the weakling so that it does not hold its breath.
Deinde fac eam sternutare cum condisi: et stringe manum tuam super os eius, et nares ipsius.	Then make her sneeze with a squeeze; and tightly grasp your hand over her nose.
Si ergo egreditur per hoc, bonum est.	If then she comes out through this, it is good.
Si non: tunc accipe ollam, et perfora in coopertorio foramen: et pone in ea herbas aperientes os matricis, sicut calamentum, rutam, et anetum, et camomillam, et sseham, et cassiam ligneam, et centauream: accipe omnes istas herbas, aut quasdam earum, et submerge eas cum aqua, et pone eas super ignem.	If not: then take a club, and pierce through the roof; and put in it herbs opening the mouth of the mother, such as calamus, rue, aniseed, camomile, chamomile, and cassia bark, and some of these herbs; and dip them in water, and place them on the fire.
Deinde pone embulam arundinis super foramen coopertorii ollae, et extremitatem aliam in os matricis: et teneat eam donec perueniat uapor ad concauitatem matricis.	Then put a twig of hawthorn on the hole in the roof, and another end at the mouth of the mother; and let her hold it until the steam from the birth has cooled down.
Deinde fac eam sternutare, sicut diximus.	Then make her sneeze, as we have said.
Secundina enim egredietur cum facilitate.	The second is then born with ease.
Si autem remaneat post hanc curationem, et non egrediatur: tunc praecipe Obstetrici, ut submergat manum suam in oleo sisamino, aut mucillagine alteae.	If, however, it remains after this care and does not come out: then instruct the Midwife to dip her hand in sesame oil or mucilaginous aloe.
Deinde intromittat in uuluam, et quaerat cum ea Secundinam.	Then he inserted himself into her vagina and inquired about her second birth.
Cum ergo inuenerit eam, tunc accipiat eam, et extendat ipsam paulatim.	So when he found her, then he took her, and he slowly stretched her out.
Si autem fuerit annexa in profundo matricis, tunc intromittat manum, secundum quod narrauimus, donec quando inuenerit Secundinam, et extrahat eam paulatim secundum rectitudinem, ut non cadat matrix apud attractionem uehementem: imo oportet, ut permutetur cum facilitate ad latera dextra et sinistra: deinde addatur in quantitatem attractionis.	But if she is attached in the depths of the womb, then he should insert his hand, according to what we have said above, until such time as he finds the second one and gradually pulls it out according to the straightness so that the womb does not fall due to a sudden pull: at the front it should be exchanged with ease from right to left: then it is added in quantity.
Ipsa enim obedit tunc, et seruatur, et euadit ab adhaerentia.	For she will obey then and spread herself out, and she will separate herself from the adhesion.
Quod si os matricis est coartatum, sicut nos iam narrauimus: cura eam cum sternutatione, et ex medicatione ollae cum herbis.	That if the opening of the womb is constricted, as we have already related: take care of it with a sternutation, and from the medication of the wound with herbs.
Si autem non egreditur cum omnibus quae narrauimus, tunc caue ne fatigeris super eam in iteratione extractionis.	But if she does not come out with all that we have said above, then take care not to tire her out in the process of extraction.
Verum oportet, ut quod egreditur ad os matricis ex ea, liges ad coxam mulieris.	But it is necessary for what comes out at the opening of the womb from her to be tied up on the woman's thigh.
Deinde clisteriza eam cum unguento tetrapharmacon.	Then clean her with a four-part ointment.
Ipsum enim putrefaciet eam post dies, et dissoluetur, et egredietur.	For this will make her rot and dissolve after a few days, and she will come out.
Verumtamen quando putrefit, eleuatur ex ea odor malus ad stomachum et caput, et laedit illud infirmam.	But when it is rotten, a bad smell comes out of it towards the stomach and head, and it hurts that part.
Oportet ergo ut administrentur suffumigationes conuenientes ad illud.	It is necessary then that appropriate suffumigations be administered to her.
Quidam autem antiquorum iam experti sunt suffumigationem nasturtii, et ficuum siccarum.	Some of the ancient ones who have already been experienced are the suffumigations of mustard and dried figs.
Forma instrumenti quo suffumigatur mulier apud retentionem Secundinae et menstruorum.	Form a tool with which to suffume the woman during the retention of the second birth and the months.
Fiat ex uitro simile alcama, aut ex zere: et ponatur extremitas ampla super ignem: et suffumigatio sit posita super prunas: teneat eam, donec consumatur illa suffumigatio: et itera aliam.	Let it be made from a similar wool or from hemp: and let it be placed on a wide end over fire: and the suffumigation should be placed on plums: hold it, until that suffumigation is consumed: and then take another one.
¶ De curatione Ani non perforati.	As for the treatment of women who have not been penetrated.
Caput LXXIX.	Chapter LXXIX.
Nascuntur multi puerorum, et Ani eorum sunt non perforati, quos iam opilauit sifac subtile.	Many boys were born, and their hams were not pierced, which the sutures of the delicate sirocco had already opened.
Oportet ergo, ut obstetrix perforet illud sifac digito suo: et si non, perforet ipsum cum Spatumili acuto: et caueat lacertum, ne tangat eum.	It is necessary that the midwife pierce that sirocco with her finger: and if she does not, she should pierce it with a sharp spatulim: and let her beware of touching the snake, lest she be bitten.
Deinde pone super ipsum lanam infusam in uino et oleo.	Then put a woolen cloth, soaked in wine and oil, on top of it.
Deinde cura ipsum cum ungentis, donec sanetur.	Then care for the wound with ointment, until it heals.
Si autem times quod opiletur, tunc pone in foramine cannulam de plumbo diebus multis, et auferatur quando puer uult egerere.	But if you guess that he is drunk, then put a lead plunger in the hole for many days, and remove it when the boy wishes to defecate.
Et iam accidit opilatio Ani etiam ex consolidatione uulneris, aut apostematis.	And it also happened that the boys were drunk because of the concusiveness of the wine or pus.
Oportet ergo ut secetur illa consolidatio, deinde curetur cum eo quod diximus ex curatione et plumbo.	It is necessary that you remove that consolidation, and then care for it with the above-mentioned things after removing it.
¶ De curatione Fistularum quae accidunt in inferiori parte.	Regarding the cure of fistulas that occur in the lower part.
Caput LXXX.	Chapter LXXX.
Fistulae quae accidunt in inferiori, sunt Nodatio, et Grossitudo quae accidunt prope anum deforis: aut in spacio unius partium: et est Fistula una, aut plures.	Fistulas that occur in the lower part are a nodding and grossness which occurs near the anus of a particular animal: or in the space of one part: and there is one fistula, or many.
Cum ergo antiquatur illa Nodatio, aperitur, et currit ex ea humiditas aquosa alba, aut pus subtile.	When that grossness is cured, it opens, and from it issues a watery moisture of white pus or a subtle pus.
Et quandoque sunt ex istis Fistulis penetrantes.	And when they are penetrating from these fistulas.
Ergo penetrantes cognoscuntur per illud quod egreditur ex egestione, et uentositate, quando utitur infirmus egestione: et fortasse egreditur ex eis uermis.	Thus the penetrating ones are recognized by that which issues from defecation, and their wetness, when a person with an illness defecates: and perhaps they issue from them naked.
Et sunt ex eis Fistulae quando sunt in spacio penetrantes usque ad uesicam, et usque ad meatum uirgae.	And there are fistulas from which they penetrate into the space all the way to the bone, and up to the vertex of the hip.
Et sunt ex eis penetrantes usque ad iuncturam coxae, et usque ad nodum caudae.	And some of them penetrate all the way to the joint of the hip, and up to the root of the tail.
Ex eo autem quo cognoscitur Fistula penetrans usque ad anum, etiam a non penetrante, est, ut intromittas digitum tuum indicem in anum: et intromittas tentam subtilem in Fistulam ex aere, aut ferro: quando non est tortuositas.	From that one from which the penetrating fistula all the way to an animal is recognized, and also not from a non-penetrating one, is, when you put your index finger into the anus: and try to push a thin piece of metal or brass into the fistula: if there is no tortuosity.
Quod si in ea est tortuositas, tunc intromitte in eam tentam ex plumbo subtilem, aut pilum ex pilis equarum, donec sentias tentam, aut pilum in digito tuo.	If there is a twist in it, then insert into it a thin probe, or a nail from the nails of the equines, until you feel it trying, or a nail in your finger.
Quod si non sentis ipsam penitus, neque procedit ex foramine aliquid ex egestione, neque uentositas, neque uermis sicut dixi: tunc scias, quia est non penetrans: propera ergo ad curationem.	If you do not feel it thoroughly, and there is no discharge from the wound, nor any pus, nor is it as I have said: then know that it is not penetrating: therefore approach again to the cure.
Et quando Fistula est penetrans usque ad uesicam, aut ad meatum urinae: tunc significatio eius est exitus urinae ex ea, et prohibitio eius ab hoc ut consolidetur locus cum medicinis.	And when the fistula penetrates as far as the skin, or to the bladder: then the sign of it is the flow of urine from it, and its prohibition from this so that the place with the medicines consolidates.
Si uero est penetrans usque ad iuncturam coxae, aut ad os coxae: tunc signum eius est, quod perueniat tenta usque illuc, si non est in ea tortuositas usque ad os: et inuentio doloris in circumitu partis, et quod egreditur pus ex ea semper: et quod non ualeat in ea medicatio, neque consolidatur cum unguento.	If it penetrates as far as the joint of the hip, or to the jaw: then the sign of it is that it reaches with a probe as far as there, if there is no twist in it up to the jaw: and there is pain on the circumference of the part, and pus always comes out from it: and that it does not scar with ointment, and consolidates.
Et in istis Fistulis omnibus penetrantibus non est curatio omnino: et curatio earum est labor et uanitas ei, ex stultis medicis, super quem formatur.	And in all these fistulas which penetrate completely there is no cure at all: and the cure of them is work and vanity to him from foolish doctors, on whom a form is made up.
In illa autem quae non est penetrans, et non antiqua, speratur sanatio cum serro: secundum quod ego narro tibi, et ego iam probaui: et est, ut iaceat infirmus inter manus tuas super dorsum suum: et eleua crura eius usque supra coxas ipsius, et coxae eius sint inclinatae ad uentrem ipsius.	In that one, or if it is not penetrating, and is not ancient, there is hope for a cure with a knife: for I tell you, and I have tested this myself: and it is, so that the sick man lies in your hands on his back: and trim the legs of him up to above his hips, and his hips are bent towards his venter.
Deinde intromittetentam plumbi, aut aeris, si est in Fistula tortuositas, donec scias ubi peruenit tenta.	Then insert a probe or air, if it is a twist fistula, until you know where the probe reaches.
Si autem sentit eam infirmus circa anum, tunc oportet ut intromittas digitum tuum indicem in anum.	But if he feels it on a certain part, then you should put your finger on that part.
Si ergo sentis in digito tuo tentam iam penetrasse per seipsam detectam, praeter quod sentias inter digitum tuum, et inter ipsum sifac, aut carnem: tunc ergo scias certe, quia est penetrans: non ergo labores in ea, quoniam non est eius sanatio, sicut diximus.	But if you feel the probe already penetrate itself by your finger, besides that you feel it between your finger and the skin, or flesh: then know for sure that it is penetrating: so do not work on it, because its cure is not as I said.
Dixerunt tamen, quia sanatur in quibusdam hominibus caro, et ex medicatione qua ei speratur iuuamentum, est, ut ignias cauterium subtile secundum amplitudinem Fistulae, sicut praecessit, et intromittas ipsum ignitum in Fistulam, donec perueniat circa anum.	They said that he heals some people's flesh, and from the medicine which he hopes will benefit them, it is as if he sets fire to a cautery of fine fire according to the width of the fistula, as has been said before, and he inserts it in the fistula until it reaches a certain point.
Deinde itera illud bis, aut ter, donec scias, quia iam adustae sunt omnes illae carnes additae filtratae, quae sunt similes cannulae pennae auis.	Then he does this again twice or three times, until you know that all the added filtered flesh, which is like a feather, has dried up and become similar to a feather.
Deinde cura illud cum liciniis inuolutis in butyro, donec egrediantur illae carnes, quae adustae sunt: deinde cura illud cum unguentis generantibus carnem et consolidantibus.	Then he cares for that with liniments soaked in butter until the dried-up flesh comes out: and then he cares for it with ointments that generate meat and consolidate it.
Si ergo sanatur, bonum est.	If then he heals, it is good.
Et si non, tunc non sanatur cum alia curatione unquam.	And if not, then he does not heal with any other cure ever.
Et si egreditur tenta, et non peruenerit usque ad digitum tuum, qui est in ano, et est inter ipsum et tentam uelamen spissum ex carne, aut sifac: et uides Fistulam in eo quod sequitur superficiem cutis, tunc seca cutem ab initio Fistulae, et tu uadis secando cum tenta quod est in fistula, donec perueniat secatio ubi peruenit tentae extremitas, et liberatur tenta et cadit.	And if it comes out and does not reach your finger, which is in the anus, and is between it and a hard piece of flesh or a blade: and you see a fistula on it that follows the skin's surface, then dry off the skin from the beginning of the fistula, and dry out with the towel what is in the fistula, until you reach the place where the end of the towel reaches, and let the towel fall and drop.
Deinde mundifica illas carnes filtratas, quae assimilantur cannulae pennae auis, ut non remaneat ex eis aliquid.	Then clean those filtered flesh, which are like a feather, so that nothing remains of them.
Si autem uincit te sanguis, et soluit inter te et inter operationem tuam ut seces illas carnes: tunc melius quod fit, et uelocioris iuuamenti, cauterizare eam cum igne, aut cum medicina acuta.	If however the blood hurts you, and dissolves between you and your surgery so that it solves those flesh: then it is better if it happens, and quicker in its benefit, to cauterize it with fire, or with sharp medicine.
Quoniam cauterium cum igne aggregat habitudines bonas, adustionem illarum carnium additarum, et abscisionem sanguinis, et exiccationem humiditatum.	For the cautery with fire brings good habits together, to the burning of that flesh which is added, and to the stopping of blood, and drying up of moisture.
Deinde cura illud cum liciniis inuolutis in butyro, aut caulibus tritis, donec locus emittat pus, et egrediantur illae carnes adustae in pus.	Then he cares for that with liniments soaked in butter, or with crushed leaves, until the place gives off pus, and dried-up flesh comes out in the pus.
Deinde cura tunc uulnus cum unguentis consolidatiuis, generantibus carnem duram: et sunt medicinae in quibus sunt stipticitas et exiccatio.	Then the cure for the scar when the wound has hardened with ointments, producing hard flesh: and there are medicines in which are stigmatis and drying out.
Nam quando restaurantur, tunc iam sanatur: et non times iterationem.	For when it is being treated, then it is being healed: and do not put off repetition.
Si autem Fistula iam peruenit usque ad profundum ani, et elongatur a superfluitate corporis: tunc intromitte digitum tuum in anum, et inquire cum eo.	But if the fistula has reached to a great depth of the anus, and has elongated from the excess fluid of the body: then insert your finger into the anus, and feel with it.
Si ergo sentis tentam, et inter te, et inter eam est uelamen ex sifac, aut carne, et est propinqua penetrationi: tunc non est operatio in illo, nisi secundum uiam fiduciae et spei.	But if you feel a pulsatillenesse and between yourself and her is some kind of a defect, or flesh, and is near to penetration: then there is no operation in that, unless by the second time of confidence and hope.
Quod est, quia administratur in eo unus trium modorum: aut ut cauterizes ipsam, sicut diximus: aut seces eam, donec consequaris concauitatem eius, ut sit possibile tibi intromittere licinia, et curationem ex proximo.	That is, because it is done in him one of the two ways: or as it is cauterized itself, as we have said: or separate it, until the consequence of its concavity comes about, so that it is possible for you to introduce a scalpel, and cure from nearby.
Et non procedas multum cum sectione, ut non incidas lacertum continentem anum, et accidat super infirmum exitus egestionis absque uoluntate.	And do not proceed much with the incision, lest you fall into the trap of the continous anus, and happens on to a premature death of exhaustion without will.
Deinde cura illud cum eo quod diximus.	Then the cure for that with him which we have said.
Fortasse enim sanabitur: aut elonges ipsum uelamen, et mundes ipsum postquam secas ipsum usque prope anum, sicut diximus, aut cum tenta, aut cum instrumento alio acutae extremitatis.	Perhaps it will be healed: or will elongate the defect, and clean it up all the way to near the anus, as we have said, or with a probe, or with another acute end of an instrument.
Deinde mundifica illas carnes filtratas quae sunt in sectione, usque ubi potes cum perscrutatione.	Then clean those filthy meats which are in the incision, all the way to where you can with examination.
Deinde conare restaurationem uulneris totius cum sectione, et orificio superiore ubi consolidatur: et remanet Fistula aperta in interiore parte anus, et erit leuius super infirmum.	Then try to restore the wound of the whole limb with the incision, and the opening where it hardens: and remains a fistula open on the inside part of the anus, and will be lighter on to the premature death.
Et quandoque suitur Fistula secundum hunc modum: et est, quando intromittis tentam in Fistulam: et est in latere ani circa superficiem corporis cum cute et margine ani: tunc accipe tentam perforatae extremitatis, quae est sicut acus aleskef, id est, praeparantium coria, secundum hanc formam.	And when the fistula follows this way: and is, when you introduce a probe into the fistula: and is on the side of the anus near to the surface of the body with skin and the margin of the anus: then take hold of the probe's sharp end, which is like an accusative, that is, a preparative tool, according to this form.
Et intromitte in eam filum inuolutum ex quinque filis, et circiter ea.	And introduce into it a thread uncoiled from five threads, and wrap it around.
Deinde intromitte tentam cum filo in Fistulam, donec consequatur concauitatem eius.	Then introduce the thread with a hook into the fistula, until you feel its tension.
Si ergo est penetrans in margine ani interius prope, tunc extrahe filum ex illo foramine: ita ut intromittas digitum tuum in anum, et extrahas extremitatem fili, et aggreges duas extremitates simul: et stringe utramque, et dimitte illud die uno, aut duobus diebus: et quanto plus incidit filum in carne, stringe ipsum bene, donec incidantur illae carnes quae sunt inter duas extremitates fili, et cadant: deinde cura uulnus, donec consolidetur, et sanetur.	If then it is penetrating into the margin of the anus internally nearby, then remove the thread from that opening: so that you can introduce your finger in anum, and remove the end of the thread, and gather both ends together at once: and tighten both of them, and let it go one day, or two days: and to the extent that the thread bites into the flesh, tighten it well, until those muscles which are between the two ends of the thread fall down: then take care of the wound, until it hardens, and heals.
Si autem orificium Fistulae non est penetrans: tunc fac ipsum penetrare quocunque modo praeparatur tibi, nisi sit in profundo multum.	If, however, the opening of the fistula is not penetrating: then make it penetrate in whatever way you prepare it for yourself, unless it is in a deep place.
Non enim inest tibi, ut facias illud propter lacertum, ut non incidas ipsum.	For indeed it is not yours to do such a thing, so that you don't hurt yourself itself.
Deinde fac cum ea sicut diximus, donec sanetur.	Then do with it as we have said, until it heals.
Forma Spatumilis spinosi quo finditur Fistula, cuius curuitas est acuta ualde, et pars altera est non acuta, ut non incidat illud quod non est necesse, sicut uides.	The shape of the sharp needle where the fistula is found, whose curvature is acute greatly, and its other side is not acute, so that it does not hurt that which is not necessary, as you see.
¶ De sutura Hemorroidarum, ex quibus currit sanguis ex incisione earum: et cura fissurarum.	Of the suture of hemorrhoids, from which runs blood from their incisions: and take care of the fissures.
Caput LXXXI.	Chapter LIII.
Sunt Hemorroides secundum duos modos.	There are hemorrhoids according to two ways.
Aut enim sunt intra anum, similes uesicis carbonum, uel prunarum: aut quasi ipsae sint grana uuae.	Or indeed they are inside the anus, similar to charcoal, or like plums: or almost like small grains.
Et ex eis sunt paruae, et magnae: et sanguis currit ex eis semper, et est una, et sunt multae.	And of them there are some little ones and some big ones: and blood runs from them always, and there is one, and many.
Et sunt extra anum, et in extremitatibus eius.	And they are outside the anus, and at its ends.
Verumtamen istae quae sunt extra anum, sunt secundum plurimum paucae humiditatis, ex quibus currit aqua citrina, aut parum sanguinis cursu assiduo: et sunt secundum colorem corporis.	Indeed these that are outside the anus, are according to most part few of moisture, from which runs yellow water, or a little blood with constant course: and they are according to color of the body.
Et curatio eius quae est intra anum, est, ut praecipias infirmo ut assellet: et exprimatur, donec egrediatur anus, et appareant athelil tibi.	And the cure of that which is within the anus, you should instruct the sick person to straining; and it should be expressed until it comes out, and appears atheneum to you.
Propterea ergo et suspende cum uncinis: aut tene eos cum ungue tuo.	Therefore therefore and hang with hooks: or hold them with your fingernail.
Deinde incide eos apud radices suas.	Then therefore cut them at their roots.
Si autem non retinentur in eis uncini, propter humiditatem eorum et ipsorum mollificationem: tunc cape eos cum panno aspero, aut cum coto ex diploide lanea, et extrahe eos cum digitis tuis.	If however they do not retain hooks, because of their moisture and their own softness: then take them with a rough cloth, or with a twine made of double-twined wool, and pull them out with your fingers.
Deinde incide eos, et pulueriza super eos post incisionem quosdam pulueres calidos, ut stent eis loco cauterii.	Then cut them and sprinkle over them after the cut some warm powders so that they remain in place of cauterization.
Aut cauteriza eos secundum quod praecessit in capitulo cauterizandi.	Or cauterize them according to what has preceded in the chapter on cauterizing.
Deinde cura eos cum reliqua curatione, donec sanentur.	Then care for them with the remaining cure, until they are healed.
Quod si non obedit anus egressioni, tunc clisteriza infirmum clisteri in quo sit mordicatio parua, ut lauetur cum eo quod est in ano, et obediat egressioni uelociter, quando exprimit se infirmus.	That if the anus does not obey the ejection, then clench the sick with a small clister in which is a little mordicatio, so that it soothes with it what is in the ano, and obeys the ejection more quickly when it is expressed by the sick.
Si autem athelil sunt extrinseci ab ano, tunc res eorum est leuis, facilis: et est ut capias eos cum ungue tuo, aut capias eos cum uncino, et incidas eos.	If however atheneum have been taken out of the ano, then the business is lighter and easier: and it is as if you were to take them with your fingernail, or take them with a hook, and cut them.
Deinde cura eos cum eo quod diximus, donec sanentur.	Then care for them with what we have said, until they are healed.
Et qui abhorret incisionem cum ferro, tunc oportet ut administres suturam eorum secundum hunc modum.	And who hates cutting with iron, then you should administer to them a sutura in the following way.
Accipe filum inuolutum, et intromitte ipsum in acum.	Take a silk thread, and insert it into the anus.
Deinde extrahe athelil ad superiora, et fac ipsum penetrare cum acu in radice eius ex parte altera: et inuolue duas extremitates fili, in inferiori parte acus, et sint latitudinaliter: et stringe athelil strictura forti.	Then pull out the atheneum upwards, and let it penetrate with the needle into the root from the other side; and wrap the two ends of the silk thread around the lower part of the needle, and spread them out: and tighten the atheneum with a strong knot.
Deinde noda filum, et extrahe acum.	Then tie off the silk thread, and pull out the silk thread.
Fac illud cum omnibus athelil, et dimitte ex eis unum: nec suas ipsum, ut currat ex eo superfluitas sanguinis.	Do this to all the atheneum, and leave one alone: and let his own be drawn out, so that it carries away the redundancy of blood.
Deinde pone super anum pannum infusum in oleo rosato, aut caeroto, et pone ipsum super anum: et praecipe infirmo, ut quiescat.	Then put a certain cloth soaked in rose-water, or neroli-water, on the part; and put the same on the part itself; and order the sick one to lie down.
Deinde dimitte ipsum, donec cadat.	Then let him lie down until he has fallen asleep.
Cum ergo cadunt athelil, cura eos cum unguentis, et reliqua curatione, donec sanentur.	When the wound has therefore closed, take care of them with ointment, and with the other treatment, until they are healed.
¶ De cura Fissurarum.	§ On the treatment of wounds.
Multotiens enim accidunt ex exiccatione stercoris, et constrictione naturae.	For often accidents happen because of drying up of stool, and constriction of nature.
Cum ergo antiquantur, et non ualet in eis medicina: tunc oportet ut radas cum puncta Spatumilis, aut cum ungue tuo, donec fiant humidae, et auferatur ab eis cortex superior qui prohibet eas a consolidatione.	When they have been a little while wet, and do not suffer from medicine: then let them be scrubbed with the sponge of Spongia, or with your own finger, until they are moist, and let go off them the upper layer which prevents their being consolidated.
Deinde cura eas, donec consolidentur secundum quod oportet.	Then take care of them, until they are consolidated according to what is necessary.
Si autem non consolidantur: tunc itera eas cum rasione uehementiori quam prima, donec sanguinentur multum, et excorientur deinde cura eas, donec sanentur.	But if they do not consolidate: then repeat the scrape with a more rough sponge than before, until they bleed much, and then take care of them, until they are healed.
¶ De curatione Almirmar inuersorum, et non inuersorum: et Athelil siccorum, et Formicae.	§ On the treatment of putrid wounds, and not putrid ones: and on the care of sore-mouth, and of swelled lips.
Caput LXXXII.	Chapter LIII.
Scias quod Almirmar non est nisi nodus rotundus secundum colorem corporis, similis capiti claui: et fit in toto corpore, praecipue in inferioribus partibus pedum, et digitis: et accidit ex eis dolor apud ambulationem.	Know that Almirmar is only a round knot according to the color of the body, similar to a claw's head: and it happens in the whole body, especially in the lower parts of the feet and fingers: and it causes pain on walking.
Oportet ergo ut secetur quod est in circumitu claui, et teneatur cum forficibus, aut cum uncino, et eradicetur ex radice sua.	Then let it be cut off what is in the circumference of the claw, and held with forceps, or with a hook, and Root it out from its root.
Deinde cura illud: et si uis cauteriza illud secundum quod praecessit in capitulo suo.	Then take care of that one: and if you have a caustic, treat it according to what has gone before in his chapter.
Ex athelil autem siccis unus est eminentia parua, aspera, filtrata, rotunda supra superficiem corporis.	But from the sore-mouth there is only one little excellence, rough, filtered, round on the surface of the body.
Et multotiens accidunt in manibus puerorum.	And often it happens in the hands of boys.
Et curatio eius est, ut extendas athelil, et incidas ipsum: aut stringas ipsum cum filo de serico: aut cum pilo, donec cadat.	And its treatment is, that you spread out the sore-mouth, and let it fall; or that you tie it with silk thread: or with hair, until it falls down.
Et si uis, cauteriza ipsum secundum quod praemissum est cum igne, aut cum medicina acuta: et iam eradicantur athelil inuersi, et non inuersi cum instrumento quod ego dicam.	And if you see [a wound], cauterize it according to what has been said above with fire, or with sharp medicine; and now the athelias that are imposed are eradicated, and not imposed with an instrument that I call.
Formica autem est etiam eminentia parua filtrata, grossa, super superficiem corporis, uadens in profundum ualde: et quando inuenit eam frigus, sentitur in ea simile mordicationi formicae, et fit in corpore toto: et plurimum eius fit in manibus.	But the ant is also a prominent little filter, coarse, on the surface of the body, wetting it deeply; and when it comes to coolness, it feels in it a similar stinging of an ant, and becomes in the whole body; and much of it is made in the hands.
Et curatio eius est, ut accipias cannulam ex penna anseris, aut penna uulturis forti: et pone illam cannulam super Formicam, donec contineat circulus cannulae ex partibus eius.	And its cure is that you take a tube from the beak of a goose, or a strong vulture's beak; and put that tube on the ant, until it holds a circle of the tube from its parts.
Deinde reuolue manum tuam cum cannula, donec seces quod est in circumitu Formicae: et ponas eam in profundo carnis, et eradices Formicam ex radice eius.	Then you will turn your hand with the tube, until you separate what is in the circumference of the ant; and put it in the depth of the flesh, and you eradicate the ant from its root.
Et si uis, fac illud cum cannula aeris, aut ferri, secundum hanc formam.	And if you see it, do it with the tube of air or iron, according to this form.
Sit superius cannulae ad sublimitatem trahens surdum inuolutum, ut alleuietur super digitum apprehensio eius et ipsius reuolutio.	Let the tube sit on top of the palm with a small piece of skin pulled, so that it does not hurt the touch of its grip and its retraction.
Et si uis cauteriza Formicam secundum quod praemissum est in cauterizatione Athelil in capitulo de cauterio.	And if you see it, cauterize the ant according to what has been said above in cauterizing Athelil in the chapter on cauterization.
¶ De formis Instrumentorum quae administrantur ad Clisteria in aegritudinibus Ani, et solutionis uentris, et colicae.	About forms of instruments that are administered to clisters in the ailments of the bird, and the solution of the spring, and colic.
Caput LXXXIII.	Chapter Liii.
Quandoque Clistere fit ex argento, aut ex aurichalco, aut ex aere fuso, aut malleato.	When the clister is made of silver, or of gold-plated brass, or of ordinary brass, or of hammered brass.
Et quandoque fit ex istis Instrumentis paruum, et magnum, secundum illos in quibus administrantur.	And when it is made from these small instruments, and from the large ones, according to those in which they are administered.
Illud ergo quod administratur in curatione puerorum paruorum, sit paruum: et quorum ani sunt debiles, aut dolorosi, sic et clisteria eorum.	So then what is administered in the cure of young boys who are weak, or those who are sick, so that their clisters are weak too.
Clistere magnum.	The large clister.
Cistere paruum.	Cysts in the lungs.
Canna eius, id est, caput superius in quo ligatur uter, sit amplum secundum hunc modum: et sit ei distinctio ut ligetur uter sicut uides, et extremitas eius inferior quae intromittitur in anum, sit surda, id est, non aperta, lenis, ualde, trahens ad subtilitatem: et in uno laterum eius sint duo foramina, et in latere altero foramen unum.	Cistere paruum.
Et sit amplitudo foraminis secundum grossitudinem radiorum, et grossius parum, et sit uter in quo ponuntur medicinae ex uesica animalis: aut ex charta ouis, quae sit secundum formam asofrati paruae: cuius radix sit palmus unus.	The cysts in the lungs are wide and round. The opening of the cysts is wide enough for a small piece of cloth or a feather to pass through; their base is rounded. The opening of one side should be closed, that is, not open, smooth, slightly curved, and reaching down towards the hip. On one side there are two openings, and on the other side there is one opening.
Et perforetur foraminibus multis sicut reuoluitur, et sit spacium quod est inter omne foramen grossitudo digiti.	And many holes are pierced in the cysts, as it were, and there is a space that is the width of a finger between each hole.
Deinde intromitte in illa foramina filum forte ex filo crudo, quod sit ex decem filis, aut circiter ea, et aggrega cum eo utrem sicut asofrati.	Then introduce into these holes a strong thread made of raw silk, which has ten threads, or a little more, and tie it together with the same thread.
Cum ergo ponitur in eo uter, stringatur in capite clisteris inter duo distinguentia constrictione forti.	When this cloth is placed in the cysts, tighten it in the top part of the cysts with a strong knot between two distinctions.
Deinde clisteriza cum eo.	Then tighten the cloth.
Et haec est forma circuli utris hic depicta, et foraminum.	And this is the shape of a circle as it is depicted here, and the holes.
Qualitas autem clisterizandi cum eo, est: ut impleas utrem, aut uesicam ex medicina, quae sit calefacta secundum quantitatem tolerantiae infirmi: et caue ne sit calida ualde, aut frigida ualde.	The quality of tightening the cloth is this: fill it with a medicine from the pharmacy that has been heated according to the tolerance of the nurse; and do not make it too hot or too cold.
Deinde resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum, et eleuet crura sua ad superiora: et pone sub eo inthaan, id est, corium super quod iacent homines, aut linteamen.	Then the sick person should lie on his back, and raise his legs up; and place something under him, that is, a mattress above which the people sleep, or a blanket.
Deinde inunge extremitatem Clisteris cum oleo, aut cum albugine oui, aut cum mucillagine foenugraeci, aut similium.	Then dip the tip of the cloth in oil, or in alum, or in mucus of fenugreek, or like it.
Deinde intromitte ipsum in anum cum facilitate.	Then introduce it into the anus easily.
Deinde accipiat minister utrem cum duabus manibus suis simul, et exprimat ipsum cum uehementia, donec euacuet totum quod est in Clisteri in intestinum.	Then take a servant with his two hands and squeeze it hard until all that is in the cysts has been discharged into the intestines.
Deinde extrahe Clistere, et eleuet infirmus crura sua ad parietem.	Then remove the cloth, and raise the sick person's legs up towards the wall.
Quod si medicina cogit eum ad exitum, tunc teneat quantum potest.	If medicine can save him to the end, then he should hold on as long as possible.
Et si dormit cum ea nocte tota, est magis ultimum in iuuamento.	And if he sleeps with her all night, it is even more of a last resort in healing.
Si autem clisterizas eum in aegritudinibus solutionis uentris, et festinat exitus eius: tunc itera clistere, donec sanetur.	But if you enema him with a solution of the sixth water and his death is imminent: then do another enema until he is healed.
Quod si in ano sunt hemorroides, aut apostemata laedentia, tunc sit clistere subtile ualde, lene, ex clisteribus quibus clisterizantur pueri.	That if there are hemorrhoids or itching painful blisters then do a mild enema frequently, gently, from the enemas with which the boys are enema
Et haec sit forma clisteris subtilis super quod sit stricta cutis.	And this should be the form of a gentle enema over which there is a strict skin.
¶ De curatione Vulnerum capitis sine fractura ossis.	Of the treatment of head wounds without fracture of the bone.
Caput LXXXIIII.	Chapter LIII. Of the treatment of head wounds without fracture of the bone.
Iam dixi in diuisione de curatione uulnerum quod conueniebat libro, et ego dicam hic curationem eorum cum manu, et cum medicinis secundum complementum.	I have already said in the division of the treatment of wounds which concerned the book, and I say here the cure of these with the hand, and with the help of doctors according to the second aid.
Dico ergo, quod uulnera diuersificantur secundum illud quo fiunt uulnera, et secundum locum super quem cadit uulnus.	I say, therefore, that wounds differ according to the cause of their being, and according to the place on which they fall.
Res ergo quibus fiunt uulnera multotiens, sunt sicut iactus lapidis: aut incisio ensis, aut cultelli: aut percussio cum lancea, aut ligno, aut sagitta: et similibus illis ex rebus multis.	Therefore the wounds that are often caused, are like shots of stones: or cuts of a knife, or a blow with a lance, or a piece of wood, or an arrow: and similar things from many other things.
Vulnera autem quae fiunt secundum loca corporis sunt, sicut uulnus quod cadit super caput, aut collum, aut pectus, aut uentrem, aut epar: et similia ex eis membris.	But wounds that are caused according to the places of the body are, such as a wound that falls on the head, or the neck, or the chest, or the belly, or an organ: and similar ones from the members.
Et ego sum narrans curationes quorundam uulnerum, ut ponam eam ratiocinationem et regulam super reliqua uulnera.	And I am telling the treatment of certain wounds, that I may set forth the reasoning and rule for the remaining wounds.
Et ego incipiam a uulneribus capitis simplicibus: quoniam rememoratio compositorum ueniet in principio capituli tertii.	And I shall begin with simple head wounds: because the memory of the teacher will come at the beginning of Chapter III.
Dico ergo.	I say, therefore:
Quando accidit in capite uulnus simplex, et non est fractura ossis: considera tunc, si est ex iactu lapidis, aut ei similibus, et iam fregit cutem tantum: et est uulnus magnum, et times super infirmum euentum apostematis calidi: tunc propera, et phlebotoma cephalicam statim: et non tardes illud: et extrahe ei ex sanguine secundum quantitatem uirtutis eius: si non fuerit prohibens aliquid a phlebotomia, praecipue si fuerit sanguis qui egreditur ex uulnere paucus.	When it comes to a simple wound on the head, and there is no fracture of the bone: then consider if it is from a shot of stone, or similar, and has broken the skin only: and it is a severe wound, and fear about the outcome of blistering fever: then make an immediate phlebotomy on the head: and do not delay that: and draw out his blood according to the quantity of its virtue: if there is no prohibition from phlebotomy, especially if it is the blood that flows out from the wound a little.
Et sit phlebotomia ex contrario partis uulneratae.	And let the bleeding come from the opposite side of the wounded part.
Et caueat infirmus sibi a repletione, et uino, et cibis grossis.	Let the sick person avoid food, wine, and heavy meals.
Si autem minutionem prohibet aliquid, tunc minoretur ex cibo, et non appropinquet carnibus, neque uinis.	But if there is a need to restrain something, then let it be restrained from food, and not approach meat or wine.
Et pone super uulnus si accidit ei apostema calidum, cotum infusum in oleo rosato solo, aut cum uino in quo est stipticitas.	And place over the wound if there is a feverish condition, hot poultice with infused oil in rose water alone, or with wine where there is a stenosis.
Si autem securus fueris ab apostemate calido, tunc pone super uulnus, si est recens cum sanguine suo, et non mutauit ipsum aer, puluerem quem ego narrabo post paululum: et si iam mutauit ipsum aer, tunc pone super ipsum quaedam unguenta, donec sanetur.	But if you are free from a feverish condition, then place over the wound if it is new with its own blood, and has not changed its air, the powder which I will describe after a little while: and if it has already changed its air, then place over it some ointment, until it is healed.
Si autem uulnus est magnum, aut est ex incisione ensis, et similium: et non aggregantur labia eius per puluillos, tunc aggrega ipsa cum sutura, secundum quod ego narrabo in uulneribus uentris de sutura eorum.	But if the wound is large, or is from an incision of a sword, and similar: and its lips are not gathered by poultices, then gather it with a stitch, according to what I will describe in wounds of the leg about their stitches.
Si autem uulnus iam detectum est ab osse, et pendet, et non est retentio eius, nisi in suspensorio paruo: tunc incide ipsum.	But if the wound has already been detected from a bone, and hangs, and there is no retention of it, except in a small suspender: then incision that wound.
Deinde cura uulnus cum medicinis, et restaura in eo carnem duram loco cutis, et praecipe infirmo, ut alatur cibis in quibus est grossitudo, sicut sunt capita, et triticum coctum, donec sit ut puls: et eis similia.	Then care for the wound with medicines, and restore it to its place of tough skin, and order the sick person to eat food in which there is a fermentation, such as heads of animals and cooked wheat, until it becomes like a pulse: and let them eat similar things.
Quod si inuenis in cute putrefactionem, et non adhaeret ossi: tunc incide putrefactum totum, et proiice ipsum: deinde cura illud.	That if the wound is in the skin and does not adhere to the bone: then incision all that part which is putrefied, and throw it away: and then care for it.
Si autem in his uulneribus est arteria, aut uena ex qua fluit sanguis: et non abscinditur per medicinas, tunc inquire super arteriam.	But if there is an artery in these wounds, or a new one from which blood flows: and does not become separated by medicines, then inquire about the artery.
Si ergo inuenis eam non sectam, tunc seca eam cum Spatumili, aut liga eam.	But if you do not cut that wound, then dry it up with Spike-root, or bind it up.
Quod si necessitas prouocat quando non confert illud quod diximus, tunc cauteriza eam, donec abscindatur sanguis.	That if necessity forces you to do this before what I have said is done, then burn it, until blood stops flowing from it.
Si autem uulnera ista sunt parua, simplicia, tunc res eorum est facilis, leuis: ita ut puluerizes super ea hunc puluerem: quoniam consolidat ea antequam mutet ea aer.	If, however, these wounds are small and simple, then the matter is easy and light: so that the powder applied to them can be easily absorbed: because it solidifies before it changes by air.
¶ Modus Pulueris incarnatiui.	The method of the powder for healing wounds.
Recipe olibani partem unam, et sanguinis draconis partes duas, et calcis non extinctae partes tres: teratur totum multum, et cribelletur: et impleatur ex eo uulnus, et constringatur constrictione bona, donec adhaereat super ipsum bene, et coaguletur cum sanguine.	Take a part of olibanum, and two parts of dragon's blood, and three parts of non-extinguished limestone: all are to be well mixed together, and sieved: then fill it with the powder, and bind it firmly in place until it sticks well to itself and congeals with blood.
Deinde stringe ipsum desuper cum puluillis, et dimitte ipsum, neque soluas ipsum dum permanet, ita quod non apostemetur.	Then tie the powder above it, and leave it, and do not remove it until it has remained in place: so that it does not crumble.
Nam non eradicatur ab eo medicina, donec sanatur.	For the medicine will not be removed from it until it is healed.
Et quandoque facit illud calx sola, quando non sunt tibi in praesenti olibanum, et sanguis draconis etiam facit eandem operationem in multis ex uulneribus magnis, quando conuenit ut ponatur super ea et stringantur, et sunt uulnera recentia cum sanguine suo, quae non alterauit aer.	And when this lime is made alone by itself, when you do not have on hand olive oil either, and dragon' s blood also makes the same operation in many large wounds when it is put on them and bound together, and are recent wounds with their own blood, which has not been changed by air.
Quod si iam alterauit ea aer quadam alteratione, praecipue quando est in tempore aestatis, tunc non est in positione huius pulueris intentio: cura ergo ipsum cum eo quod diximus, ita ut ponas super ea quaedam unguenta digestiua: aut ponas super ea pultes ex farina hordei, factas cum aqua et melle, donec emittant pus.	That if the air has already somewhat altered it, especially when it is in the summer season, then the intention of this powder is not in place: so take care to put on it some digestible ointment that we have mentioned, or put on it a paste made from barley flour, prepared with water and honey, until pus is discharged.
Deinde cura ea reliqua curatione, donec sanentur.	Then take care of the rest with the usual cure, until they are healed.
Si uero accidat cum uulnere fractura in osse, et est parua, tunc extrahe illud cum Gesti: et ego iam dicam curationem fracturarum capitis in eo quod futurum est.	If, however, there is a broken fracture of a bone and it is small, then extract it with the help of a hook: for I will now speak about the treatment of fractures of the skull.
¶ De uulneribus Colli.	Regarding wounds in the neck area.
Caput LXXXV.	Chapter LXXXV on the head.
SI Autem uulnus accidat in Collo, tunc non est inter ipsum differentia in medicatione, et inter uulnus capitis quando est simplex.	If a wound has occurred in the neck, then there is no difference in treatment between it and a wound of the head, when the latter is simple.
Si autem iam incisus est neruus Colli, aut arteria: tunc si est neruus, non est in eo ingenium, nisi ut deuitetur curatio eius cum eo quod facit stipticitatem uehementem, sicut ziniar, et zegi, et eis similia.	But if the incision has already reached the nerve of the neck or an artery: then if it is a nerve, there is no skill in it, unless treatment with it causes a harsh constriction, like the cinchona and other such things.
Quoniam nocent neruis, et contrahunt eos.	For they harm the nerves, and turn them back.
Et non ponas super uulnus aliquid frigidum omnino: quoniam substantia neruorum est frigida, et continuatio eius est cum cerebro, quod est sublimius membrorum: et sit illud quo curatur ex medicinis lene, sicut calx lota cum aqua dulci aliquotiens infusa cum oleo, aut cum oleo rosato, et tuthia, quando abluitur etiam cum aqua dulci: et reliqui lapides minerales, secundum hunc modum, et unguenta humida.	And do not put any cold thing on a wound at all: for the substance of the nerves is cold, and their extension is with the brain, which is an exalted member of the body: and let such a one be cured with medicines of softness, as the lime, when it is poured out with sweet water sometimes infused with oil, or with rosin oil, and turpentine, when it is washed also with sweet water: and other mineral stones, in this fashion, and humid unguents.
Si autem uulnus est magnum, tunc administra suturam: aut coarta labia eius cum puluillis.	But if the wound is large, then administer a stitch: or cover its lips with dust.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then take care of yourself, until you are healed.
Si uero uulneri est profunditas, aut accidit in eo sinus in inferiori parte eius, in quo iam aggregatur pus, tunc perfora ipsum in magis depresso loco in eo.	But if the wound is deep, or has occurred a pocket of pus in its lower part, then pierce it in a more depressed place.
Quod si iam incisa est in uulnere arteria, et consecutus est sanguinem eius fluxus: tunc separa, uel seca eam, et liga ipsam: aut cauteriza eam, si prouocat necessitas ad illud.	That if the incision has already reached the nerve of an artery, and the flow of its blood is followed: then separate it, or dry it up, and bind it: or burn it, if necessity compels to do so.
Si autem iam incidit spondiles gutturis, aut totum, et saluatae sunt alhaudegi: tunc aggrega labia cutis cum sutura super cannam gutturis, et non tangas guttur, imo aequa ipsum, et reduc ipsum super figuram naturalem.	But if the incision has already reached the spine's joint, or all of it, and so on as if it were a horse's joint: then join the skin's lips together with a stitch over the joint, and do not touch the joint, but rather make it fit the natural form.
Deinde stringe ipsum strictura decenti, et dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot.	Then tighten it with a tightening that decreases gradually, and leave it for a few days.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguentis in quibus est stipticitas et exiccatio, donec sanetur.	Then take care of yourself with unguents that cause dryness and healing.
Si autem uulnus iam fecit impressionem in osse, tunc perquire ipsum: tunc si in ipso sunt fragmenta ossis, extrahe ea omnia, aut quae potes ex eis: et quod non praeparatur, dimitte illud, donec putrescat uulnus, et separetur et alleuietur egressio eius.	But if the wound has already made an impression on the bone, then examine it: then if there are any fragments of bone, remove them all, or as many as you can: and what is not prepared, leave it, until the wound decays, and separates and discharges its excrement.
Quod si uulnus fuerit recens, tunc pulueriza super ipsum puluerem quem narraui.	If the wound is fresh, then dust the powder on top of the powder that I have laid down.
Si autem uidetur in uulnere os, et fit Fistula: tunc cura ipsam cum eo cuius rememoratio uenit in capitulo suo.	But if it is a case of a broken bone and a fistula: then take care of it with the Remedy that comes in the chapter about it.
¶ De uulnere in Spatulis.	On Wounds in Spatulas.
Caput LXXXVI.	Chapter LXVIII. On wounds in spatulas.
SI Est percussio lanceae, aut cultelli: et uides eius profunditatem, tunc considera.	If the wound is caused by a lance or a knife, and you can see its depth, then examine it carefully.
Si ergo ex uulnere egreditur uentositas, quando anhelat ex eo infirmus, tunc scias, quia uulnus est mortale.	But if there is a flow of pus from the wound, and the patient groans because of it, then know that the wound is mortal.
Quod si non fuerit ei profunditas, et est recens cum sanguine suo: tunc non ponas in eo a prima hora puluerem, neque stringas ipsum, ut non retineatur sanguis in profunditate eius, et reuertatur ad cor, et interficiat infirmum: sed pone in ipso unguentum attractiuum, et solue ipsum in die bis.	But if it is not deep and is fresh with its blood: then do not put the powder on it at first hour, nor bind it up so that the blood does not hold in its depth and returns to the heart and makes him sick; but put on it a attracting ointment and undo it twice a day.
Si uero unguentum non est tibi praesens, tunc pone in orificio uulneris cotum uetustum, ut sugat illud quod egreditur de eo ex humiditatibus: et fac ut dormiat infirmus super uulnus, ut currat quod aggregatur in eo.	But if you do not have the ointment present, then put on the wound a used cloth, so that it sucks out what comes from it by moisture: and let the patient sleep on the wound so that what is gathered in it runs out.
Si uero iam praeterierint uulneri tres dies, aut plures, et non accidit infirmo spasmus, neque tremor cordis malus, neque strictura in anhelitu, et uides reliquas dispositiones eius bonas: tunc scias, quia uulnus est saluum.	But if three or more days have passed since the wound and there has been no spasms, no bad tremor of the heart, no tightness in breathing, and the other signs of it are good, then know that the wound is healed.
Cura ergo ipsum et cum liciniis, et reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Take care of it and with ease, and with the rest of the cure, until it is healed.
Si uero excusatur sanatio eius, et iam aperitur semper, tunc scias, quia iam factum est Fistula.	But if the healing of it is slow and it opens again always, then know that it has already become a fistula.
Cura ergo ipsam ex capitulo suo.	Take care of it from the chapter about it.
Et si uulnus est ex incisione ensis, aut cultelli, et est simplex in superficie pectoris, aut dorsi: tunc cura ipsum cum eo quod praecessit ex sutura, si est magnum: aut cum puluere, si est paruum.	And if the bone is from an incision of a sword or a knife, and it is simple on the surface of the back, or the back of the neck: then take care of the wound with the Remedy that preceded it from the sutura, if it is large: or with powder, if it is small.
Si autem iam fecit impressionem in osse, et incidit ex eo frusta: tunc inquire uulnus, et propera ad extrahendum illa frusta, si sunt separata.	If, however, he has already made an impression on the bone and has struck out from it a piece of fracture: then inquire about the rib, and approach towards extracting those fractures if they are separate.
Si uero non sunt separata, tunc dimitte ea, donec putrefiat uulnus, alleuiatur enim extractio eorum.	If, however, they are not separated, then let them go until the rib has putrefied, for the extraction of these will be облегчена.
Reliquorum autem uulnerum accidentium in reliquis membris iudicium in curatione, est iudicium eius quod diximus.	But as regards the remains of injuries and accidents in the remaining members, it is a question of judgment in the treatment, which I have mentioned.
¶ De uulneribus Ventris, et exitu intestini, et exitura eorum.	Regarding wounds in the belly and the exit of the intestine and the exit of them.
Caput LXXXVII.	Chapter LXXVII.
Disruptio quae accidit uentri, est magna, et media, et parua.	The rupture that has occurred in the belly is great, medium, and small.
Ex magna igitur quandoque egreditur intestinum, aut numerus intestinorum.	So then when and how often the intestine emerges, or the number of intestines.
Quare fit intromissio eorum, et eorum sutura uehementior et difficilior.	Why do they get mixed up, and their sewing is more painful and difficult?
Et disruptio parua etiam fit difficilis ex modo alio.	And the small rupture also is difficult from another mode.
Sequitur ergo, ut sit reductio eorum difficilior, si non properas in intromissione sua ad locum suum statim: quoniam inflatur, aperitur, et ingrossatur: quare fit difficilis introitus eius.	So then, in order that the reduction of them may be more difficult, if you do not hurry up to bring it back to its place: for it swells, opens, and thickens: why does entry into it become difficult?
Propter hoc ergo fit melior disruptionum disruptio media: quoniam cum ea non fit difficilis reductio intestini, sicut fit dissicilis in his duabus speciebus.	Therefore the middle disruption is better than the small one: for since the reduction of the intestine is not difficult, as it is difficult to reduce these two species.
Scias, quod sutura uenris est secundum quatuor modos.	Know that the縫合 of the belly is according to four ways.
Duae suturae communes conueniunt in sutura uentris, et in sutura reliquorum uulnerum corporis: et duae suturae aliae proprie communicant reliquis uulneribus.	The two common sutures meet in the Suture of the belly and in the Suture of the remaining wounds of the body: and the other two particular sutures communicate to the rest of the wounds.
Verumtamen sunt magis propriae cum sutura uentris: et ego narro tibi unamquamque cum expositione, et declaratione.	However, they are more proper when it is a matter of the Suture of the belly: and I will tell you one thing at a time, with an explanation.
Dico ergo, quia quando uulnus est paruum, et egreditur ex eo aliquid ex intestino, et fit difficile reducere ipsum: tunc illud est propter unum duorum modorum.	I say, that when the rib is small and has come out a little of the intestine, and it is difficult to reduce it: then it is on account of one or both of these two ways.
Aut propter paruitatem disruptionis, sicut diximus: Aut quoniam in intestino est inflatio propter frigus aeris.	Or because of the swelling due to cold air in the intestine, as we have said:
Quando ergo illud est ita, tunc oportet ut calefacias ipsum, ita ut submergas spongiam, aut pannum humidum in aqua tepida sola.	When then is this so? Then it is necessary to warm him up, so as to submerge a sponge or a wet cloth in warm water.
Aut decoquas in aqua squinantum, et cyperum, et spicam, et embroces cum ea intestinum, donec resoluatur inflatio.	Or you cook it in squirted water and cypress and garlic and simmer with it the intestines until the swelling is resolved.
Quandoque facit illud uinum in quo est stipticitas: et est melius quam aqua sola in resolutione inflationis.	When then does this wine which has fever make? And it is better than water alone in resolving the swelling.
Cum ergo uides inflationem iam resolui, tunc humecta intestinum cum aqua in qua decocta est altea, aut malua.	When then do you see that the swelling has already been resolved, then wet the intestines with the water in which it was cooked, or dry them.
Nam per illud alleuiatur introitus eius cum re parua.	For by this his entry will be eased with the small object.
Si autem excusatur reditus eius post hanc curationem, tunc finde in disruptione parum, cum instrumento quo secantur hemorrhoides.	But if his return is excused after this treatment, then find in the disruption a little, with the instrument with which they cut the hemorrhoids.
Et curatio prima est melior quando praeparatur, quam sectio: et non fit coactio ad secandum post necessitatem et defectum instrumenti.	And the first cure is better when prepared, than the incision: and it does not require a force to cut after need and want of instruments.
Sit pars eius una quae est torta, acuta, et pars eius altera non acuta, et extremitas subtilis non sit cum subtilitate Spatumilis, imo sit obtusior parumper: et est illa quae similatur caiada, sicut uides.	Let one part of it be acute and the other obtuse, and the extremities be a little sharp, rather blunt; and this is like a cauda, as you see it.
Cum ergo amplificatur uulnus, et ingreditur intestinum, tunc oportet, ut sit reductio eius secundum formam suam naturalem in loco suo sibi proprio, si possibile est super illud: quoniam est melius.	When then does the knot grow larger and enters into the intestine, then it is necessary that there be a return of him according to his natural form in his own place, if possible above it: for it is better.
Quando uero disruptio est ampla in inferiori parte uentris: tunc oportet ut facias iacere infirmum super dorsum suum, et pone crura sua altiora capite suo.	But when the rupture is wide in the lower part of the groin: then it is necessary that you let lie the sick one on his back, and set his legs higher than his head.
Et si est in superiore parte uentris, tunc pone caput eius, et pectus ipsius altiora quam eius inferiora.	And if it is in the upper part of the groin, then set his head and his chest higher than his lower parts.
Et similiter si est disruptio in una duarum partium uentris, tunc pone intentionem tuam, et tuam considerationem semper in hoc, ut pars in qua est uulnus sit altior parte altera.	And also if the rupture is on one side of the groin, then set your intention and your attention always in this, that part in which is the knot be higher on the other side.
Et ita oportet, ut admimistres illud in uulneribus magnis, et in uulneribus mediis.	And thus it should be that you administer this to large wounds and to medium-sized wounds.
In uulneribus autem paruis, pone illud secundum quod praeparatur tibi.	But regarding small wounds, place it as you have prepared it for yourself.
Deinde fac ut sit praesens inter manus tuas minister pius, qui teneat disruptionem totam manu sua: et aggrega labia eius.	Then make it present between the hands of a pious minister who holds the whole laceration in his hand: and spread out its lips.
Deinde detege ex ea ei qui sequitur suturam aliquid post aliquid: et iste est modus suturae communis unius.	Then find someone who follows who has some thread; and this is the way of a common single stitch.
Et est, ut accipias acum, aut numerum acuum secundum quantitatem amplitudinis uulneris.	And there are those who take as much as you want, or count as much as you want according to the width of the wound.
Deinde dimitte ab extremitate disruptionis quantitatem digiti anularis, id est, medici: et fige acum unam praeter quod intromittas in eam filum in duabus extremitatibuis cutis, cum duabus extremitatibus sifac quod est sub cute ab interioribus, donec facias eam penetrare ab alia parte, et tu iam aggregasti duas extremitates cutis, et duas extremitates sifac: et fiunt quatuor ordines.	Then let go from the end of the laceration by the amount of your finger, that is, the doctor: and fasten now one after you have inserted it in at both ends of the skin, with two ends of the thread that are under the skin from within, until you have made it penetrate from the other side, and you have already joined together the two ends of the skin, and the two ends of the thread: and there are four orders.
Deinde stringe cum filo duplo in circumitu acus aliquotiens a duabus partibus simul, quousque sint aggregata duo labia uulneris aggregatione decenti.	Then tighten with double thread around the needle from both sides at the same time, until the two lips of the wound have been brought together by the decreasing gathering.
Deinde dimitte grossitudinem digiti etiam, et fige in eis acum aliam: postea reta eam cum filo, sicut fecisti cum acu prima.	Then let go of the thickness of the finger as well, and fasten in them another: then make it straight with thread, just as you did with the needle first time.
Non ergo cesses facere illud cum eo quo indiges ex acubus, donec compleas constrictionem uulneris totius.	So you should not stop doing this with him as you go along from the beginning until you have completed the compression of the whole wound.
Et sint acus mediae inter grossitudinem et subtilitatem: quoniam acus subtiles ualde uelociter incidunt carnem: et grossae sunt difficilis introitus in cutem: propter illud oportet ut sint mediae in subtilitate, et grossitudine.	And there are medium needles between the thickness and the fineness: because the fine ones cut flesh quickly; and the thick ones enter difficult into the skin: therefore it is necessary that they be both of a middle size, and of a fineness.
Et non oportet, ut figatur acus in duabus extremitatibus cutis propinquae multum: ut non incidatur caro uelociter, et aperiatur uulnus ante consolidationem sui, et non elongentur etiam cum sutura, ut non prohibeatur uulnus a consolidatione.	And it is not necessary that the needle be fastened in both ends of the skin close together: so that the flesh does not quickly cut; and the wound does not open before its consolidation, and it does not elongate with the stitch, so that it does not prevent the wound from being consolidated.
Deinde incide extremitatem acuum, ut non laedant infirmum apud somnum suum: et pone eis puluillos ex pannis ab omni parte, qui teneant extremitates acuum: et dimitte eos, donec scias quod uulnus iam consolidatum est.	Then cut the end of the acute edge so that it does not hurt the sick person in his sleep; and put on them little balls made from thin cloths from all parts that hold the ends of the sharp edges; and let them go until you know that the injury has already healed.
Et haec quidem species suturae cum acubus taliter est conuenientior in uulneribus paruis.	And this type of stitch with acute points is much more convenient for small wounds.
Quoniam sufficit in sutura eorum acus una, aut duae, aut circiter eas.	Since it is sufficient in the stitch of their one, or two, or around them.
Sutura autem secunda communis est, ut aggreges cum sutura extremitates quatuor: extremitates, duas cutis, et extremitates duas sifac in uice una, cum acu in qua sit filum inuolutum aequale in subtilitate, et grossitudine.	But the second common stitch is to collect with the stitch the four ends: the ends of the two skins, and the ends of the two sfac in one thread, with an acute point in subtlety and thickness.
Deinde quando penetraueris cum acu has extremitates quatuor, reduc acum a parte a qua incaepisti eadem, ut cadat filum retatum a superiori parte uulneris: ut sit sutura, sicut sutura panni quo stringuntur panni, et pone inter omnem suturam quantitatem grossitudinis digiti minoris.	Then when you penetrate with the acute point all four ends, draw them back from the part from which you started in order for the thread to come out from the upper part of the wound: so that the stitch is, like a stitch on cloth when cloth is stretched, and place between every stitch the amount of thickness of the little finger.
Hanc autem suturam sciunt homines.	This stitch everyone knows.
Et cum hac sutura ego sui uulnus quod acciderat uiro in uentre suo, qui fuerat uulneratus cum cultello, et erat disruptio uulneris maior palmo uno: et exierat ex intestinis circiter duos palmos ex intestino medio, et erat disruptio in medio uentris.	And with this stitch I sewed a wound that occurred to a man in his belly, who had been wounded with a knife, and the injury to the flesh was large with a palm's width: and it came out from the intestines about two palms from the middle intestine, and there was an injury in the middle of the stomach.
Reduxi ergo illud postquam stetit intestinum eius extra uulnus xxiiii horis.	So I reduced that after he had stood for twenty hours.
Consolidatum est ergo uulnus in spacio quod fuit circiter XV dies: et curaui ipsum, et sanatus est: et uixit post illud annis multis, conuersatus in suis dispositionibus.	The wound was healed in a space that had been for about fifteen days: and I took care of it, and he was cured: and after that he lived for many years, thriving in his affairs.
Et medici iudicauerant, quod non sanaretur.	And the doctors judged that it would not heal.
Et ex miraculo fuit, quod non curaui illud cum unguento.	But by a miracle I did not cure that with ointment.
Quoniam fui in loco in quo non inueniebatur unguentum, neque aliquid ex medicinis.	Since I was in a place where the ointment was not found, and there was no medicine.
Posui ergo super uulnus cotum uetustum bis in die, et assiduaui ablutionem eius cum aqua mellis, donec sanatum est.	So I put on the wound a cotton cloth wetted with honey twice a day, and took care of its washing with honey water until it was cured.
Duas autem species suturae proprias dicam secundum narrationem sermonis.	Two kinds of stitches I shall call by their own names according to the speech.
Et est, ut incipias cum sutura acuta: et intromittas acum ab exteriori ad interiorem partem.	And it is as follows, beginning with an acute stitch: and insert it from the outside to the inside part.
Cum ergo penetrat acus in cutem, et in lacertum euntem secundum longitudinem et latitudinem totius corporis: dimitte extremitatem sifac in latere in quo intromisisti acum, et fac penetrare in extremitatem aliam ab interiori parte ad exteriorem in extremitate altera mirach.	When the needle enters the skin, and runs through the length and width of the whole body: let go of the end of the thread where you inserted the needle, and let it penetrate another end from the inside to the outside in an opposite direction.
Cum ergo feceris eam penetrare, tunc fac eam penetrare secundum hoc in eadem hac extremitate mirach ab exteriori parte ad interiorem: et dimitte extremitatem sifac, quae est in hoc latere, et fac penetrare acum in extremitatem alteram ab interiori parte ad exteriorem: et fac penetrare cum penetratione tua qua facis eam penetrare in sifac extremitate mirach, quae est in parte eius, donec penetret in ipsum totum.	When you have made it penetrate, then make it penetrate again at this same end from the outside to the inside: and let go of the end of the thread that is in this side, and make it penetrate another end from the inside to the outside - opposite direction - from this same end: and when you make it penetrate, then make it penetrate by your penetration, which makes it penetrate in this end, that is on the opposite side, until it penetrates all of it.
Deinde incipe etiam ab hoc eodem latere, et sue ipsum cum extremitate, quae est ex sifac in latere alio, et extrahe acum ex cute quam penetrauit.	Then also from this same side, and take it by the end that is on the opposite side, and bring out the needle where it penetrated the skin.
Deinde reduc eam in illam cutem, et sue extremitatem sifac, quae est in latere alio, cum hac extremitate mirach: et extrahe eam ex cute quae est ex parte eius, et fac illud uice una, et alia: et fac illud uice post uicem, usquequo suas extrinsecum totum secundum illud exemplum.	Then also reduce it in that skin, and take its end that is on the opposite side, and bring it together with this end where you are; and bring out from the skin that which was brought out from the opposite side: and make that one go out before the other - as many times as necessary - until they are completely outside according to that example.
Et summa huius suturae, est ut suas sutura pellipariorum qua suunt pelles: ita ut suas sifac uice una ex parte una extremitate cutis: et ut dimittas eam uice alia ex parte alia, donec compleas.	And the upper part of this stitch is as follows; it is that their stitches should be close together, like those that make the skin smooth: so that its end of the thread is brought out from one side of the skin; and let go of it on the other side until you have finished it.
Secunda species suturae propriae, quam dixit Gale nus.	The second kind of stitch belongs to Galen.
Iste eius sermo narratus est, ut suas eam secundum similitudinem, qua suunt eas quidam medicantium, ita quod aggregant omnem partem ad comparem suam conuenientem per naturam: et applicant extremitatem sifac ad eius aliam extremitatem, et extremitatem mirach ad extremitatem eius aliam.	This speech of his has been told, that their stitches should be made similar in such a way as some doctors make them, so that they gather together all the parts by their natural shape: and they bring the end of the thread to one another, and this end where it is brought together with its opposite.
Et illud fit secundum quod narro tibi.	And this I will tell you next.
Oportet ut figas acum in extremitatem mirach propinquam tibi ab exteriori parte, et facias eam penetrare ad interiorem in eo solo: et dimittas duas extremitates sifac.	You should make the incision at this point, close to the outer edge near you, and make it penetrate into the inside, in that same place only: and you shall leave two ends of the incision, rifacendo.
Deinde reuolue acum, et fac eam penetrare ab exteriori parte ad interiorem in duas extremitates sifac, scilicet utrinque.	Then turn the incision around, and make it penetrate from the outside to the inside at both ends, that is to say on each side: rifacendo.
Deinde reuolue utrasque, etiam fac penetrare utrasque ab interiori usque ad exteriorem, in duas extremitates mirach alias, quae sunt in latere opposito.	Then turn both sides around, and make them penetrate from the inside to the outside at both ends, that is to say on each side opposite: rifacendo.
Et iste modus suturae est melior sutura communi facili, et est sutura cuius praecessit rememoratio.	And this method of stitching is better than the common easy stitch, and it is a stitch which has a memory: the one before it.
Iste est ergo sermo Galeni etiam.	This is thus the speech of Galen also.
Et dixerunt quidam.	And certain ones said.
Retificatur sutura uentris cum duabus acubus.	The stitch of the hand with two needles.
Quod est, ut intromittas in eis utrisque filum unum: et incipe cum intromissione acus, ex eo quod est apud te, et fac eam penetrare usque ad latus aliud, secundum suturam eorum qui suunt coria aequaliter.	That is to say, that you should put into them both one wire: and begin with the inserting of the needle, since it is with you, and make it penetrate to the other side, from one side to another, in accordance with the stitches of those which are equal.
Et scias, quod quando disruptio est in medio uentris: tunc sutura eius est difficilior quam reliquorum locorum uentris.	And you should know, that when the break is in the middle of the hand: then the stitch of it is more difficult than at any other part of the hand.
Iudicium uero medicationis uulneris, est iudicium reliquorum uulnerum.	Judgment indeed of the treatment of wounds, is judgment of all wounds.
Quod est, quia quando tu consequeris uulnus recens cum sanguine suo, antequam alteret ipsum aer: et reducis intestinum, et suis ipsum, et aptas ipsum: tunc pone super puluerem incarnatiuum.	That is to say, because when you have made the wound clean with its own blood, before it cools itself: and you have reduced the entrails, and they themselves, and made them fit: then put on the poultice of scar.
Quod si aer iam alterauit uulnus: tunc pone super ipsum quaedam unguenta, quae sunt tibi praesentia, donec faciant pus: et cadant fila, et consolidentur sifac, et mirach.	That is to say, if the air has already altered the wound: then put on the poultice of some ointment which is near you, until it makes the pus: and let the wires drop off, and be firm on each side, and the incision close up.
Deinde cura illud sicut est curatio reliquorum uulnerum, donec sanetur.	Then take care for that wound as is taken care of all wounds, until it heals.
Si autem non sunt tibi praesentes medicinae, tunc pone super ipsum statim, exquo incipit emittere pus, cotum uetus: et permuta ipsum bis in die, sicut docui te, donec sanetur.	If you have not the medication for that wound, then put on it immediately, so that it may begin to emit pus, and change the poultice twice a day, as I taught you, until it heals.
Nam tu non indiges medicatione alia in pluribus dispositionibus, quando uulnera sunt simplicia.	But if there are no other conditions, and the wounds are simple, then there is no need for medication.
Si autem times, quod communicet uulnus membris principalibus in laesione, tunc oportet ut submergas lanam lenem in oleo temperatae caliditatis, aut in oleo rosato: et pone ipsam in circumitu locorum quae sunt inter inguina, et sub ascellas.	If, however, you should come to the conclusion that there is an injury to the main member of the body, then it is necessary to immerse the wound in a cloth dipped in oil of moderate temperature, or in rosin oil: and place it around the places that are between the hips, and under the armpits.
Quod si sentit dolorem, aut punctiones, aut putrefactionem in intestinis suis (nam multotiens accidit illud) tunc clisteriza ipsum cum uino stiptico, nigro, tepido: praecipue si putredo iam peruenit in intestino, et facta est exitura penetrans usque ad concauitatem eius.	That if it feels pain, or prickings, or putrefaction in its intestines (for this often happens), then cleanse the bowels with astringent wine, black, hot: especially if putrefaction has already reached the intestines and a penetrating gangrene has taken hold up to the peritoneum.
Et scias, quod illud quod est ex intestino grosso, est facilioris sanationis: et quod ex eis est ex subtili, difficilioris sanationis.	And know that what is from the large intestine is easier to heal: and that which is from the small intestine is more difficult to heal.
Intestinum autem quod nominatur Ieiunum, non suscipit sanationem ex uulnere quod accidit in eo omnino: et illud est propter multitudinem eius, quod est ex uenis, et magnitudine earum, et propter subtilitatem corporis eius, et propinquitatem ipsius naturae neruorum.	But the intestine which is called the jejunum does not accept healing from a wound that has occurred in it at all: and this is because of its multitude, since it is made up of loops, and because of its size, and because of its softness, and because of the closeness of its nerves.
Si autem illud quod procedit ex uulnere est zirbum, et consequeris ipsum recens: reduc ipsum secundum reductionem tuam, qua reducis intestina aequaliter.	But if the wound that has come from it is not deep, and you are able to grasp it well: reduce it according to your own judgment, reducing the intestines equally.
Si uero praeteriit ei spacium, et iam factum est uiride, aut nigrum: tunc oportet ut stringas ipsum cum filo supra locum qui denigratus est ex eo, ut non accidat fluxus sanguinis.	But if there is a space that has been passed through it, and it has already become bright or black: then you should tighten it with a thread above the place that has been discolored by it, so that blood does not flow.
In zirbo enim sunt uenae et arteriae.	For in the loop there are arteries and veins.
Deinde incide quod est praeter illud ligamentum, et pone duas extremitates fili pendentes ex inferiori parte uulneris extra ipsum: ut alleuietur super te attractio eius, et extractio ipsius apud casum zirbi, et emissionem pus uulneris.	Then cut what is beyond that ligament, and place two ends of a thread hanging from the lower part of the wound outside the body: so as to relieve its pull on you, and to extract it toward the opening of the loop, and to emit the pus of the wound.
¶ Rememoratio uulneris quod accidit in Intestino.	Remembrance of the wound that happened in the Intestine.
Quando accidit disruptio in Intestino, et est parua: tunc possibile est, ut restauretur in quibusdam hominibus: propterea, quia ego uidi qui fuit uulneratus in uentre suo cum percussione lanceae, et erat uulnus a dextra stomachi, et antiquatum est uulnus: et factum Fistula, et exiuit ex eo egestio, et uentositas.	When disruption occurs in the intestine and is slight: then it is possible to restore it in some people; because I saw one who was wounded in his abdomen with a lance, and there was an old wound on the right side of his stomach, and it had healed up; and a fistula was made, and came out of it belching and wind.
Posui ergo curationem, usque quod ego non fui confisus in sanatione eius: neque cessaui subtiliare ipsum, donec sanatus est, et consolidatus est locus.	I therefore applied the treatment, until I was confident in his recovery; and I did not cease to examine him carefully, until he was well and the site had been strengthened.
Postquam ego uidi locum iam consolidatum, timui super infirmum, quod accideret super infirmum accidens malum in uentre suo: et non accidit ei ex illo accidens malum.	Once I saw the place was now consolidated, I feared for the disease that might come upon him in his abdomen: and it did not happen to him from that accident any evil.
Et remansit in melioribus dispositionibus suis, comedens et bibens, et futuens, et intrauit balneum, et exercitatus est in dietis suis.	And he remained in better health, eating and drinking, and enjoying himself, and entering a bath, and exercising his body.
Et iam dixerunt quidam experimentatorum, quia quando accidit in Intestino uulnus, et est paruum: tunc oportet ut ligetur secundum hunc modum.	And some experimenters said, for when disruption occurs in the intestine and is slight: then it should be tied according to this method.
Et est, ut accipias formicas magnorum capitum.	And it is, that you take ants of large heads.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris, et pone formicam unam ex eis quae habeant os apertum super duo labia uulneris.	Then gather two lips of the wound, and put one ant on them which has an open mouth over the two lips of the wound.
Cum ergo capit super ea, et stringit os suum, abscinde caput eius, adhaeret enim, et non soluitur.	Then when the head is on it, and it tightens its mouth, cut off the head; for it clings to it, and does not come off.
Deinde pone formicam aliam prope primam, et non cesses facere illud cum formica post formicam secundum quantitatem uulneris totius.	Then put another ant next to the first, and do not stop doing this with the ant after the second amount of wound.
Deinde reduc ipsum, et sue uulnus.	Then reduce the wound, and tie up the wound.
Illa enim capita remanent annexa in Intestino, donec cibetur Intestinum, et sanetur, et non accidat infirmo nocumentum penitus.	Those heads remain annexed to the intestine, until it is fed by the intestine, and is healed, and does not happen to the sick person any evil inside.
Et iam possibile est, ut ligetur Intestinum etiam cum filo subtili: quod abstersum est ex intestino animalis, annexo cum eo postquam intromittitur in acum.	And it is possible that the intestine be tied also with a thin thread; which is taken from the animal's intestine, annexed to it after it enters into the nest.
Et est, ut accipias extremitatem huius fili ex intestino, et excarnetur multum.	And it is, that you take the end of this thread out of the intestine, and cut off a lot of it.
Deinde liga in extremitate eius filum lini subtile inuolutum.	Then tie his filament with a thin silk thread.
Deinde intromitte illud filum in acum, et sue cum eo intestinum.	Then insert that filament into the cavity, and sew it to the intestine.
Deinde reduc ipsum in disruptionem.	Then reduce the wound.
Et iste modus suturae cum formicis et intestino, non est nisi secundum uiam fiduciae et spei.	And this method of sewing with the awl and intestine is no more than a second opinion of trust and hope.
Scias, uulnus quod est magnum, amplum, praecipue si est in uno intestinorum gracilium: tunc non est ingenium nisi subtiliatio, neque est eius sanatio omnino.	You know, a wound that is large and broad, especially if it is in one of the thin intestines; then it is not a skill but a delicate operation, and its healing is not at all certain.
¶ De cura Zuchemen, et Fistularum.	Regarding the care for the small intestine and fistulas.
Caput LXXXVIII.	Chapter LXXVIII.
Scias, quod omne uulnus, aut apostema quando ueterascit et antiquatur, et fit ulcus, et non consolidatur, et emittit pus semper, et non abscinditur: tunc nominatur uniuersaliter in quocunque membro fuerit Fistula, et nos nominamus ipsum Zuchemen.	You should know that every wound, or suppurating sore when it has healed over and become old, and has formed a ulcer, and still discharges pus always, and does not heal: then we call it universally a fistula wherever it may be in the body; and we name it Zuchemen itself.
Et Fistula quidem est secundum ueritatem nodatio filtrata, dura, alba: cum qua non est dolor, cui est concauitas pennae auis: et propter illud nominant eam quidam Risati, id est, pennam.	And a fistula is, in fact, a kind of filiation according to the nature of the part affected; it is hard and white: there is no pain with it, but there are curly feathers: and because of this it is called by some people Risati, that is, feather-like.
Et est in quibusdam horis humida, quae emittit pus.	And it is sometimes moist, discharging pus.
Et fortasse scinditur humiditas in quibusdam horis.	And perhaps it heals by granulation in some hours.
Et quandoque est haec humiditas multa, et est pauca: et est grossa, et est subtilis.	When this moisture is much, and there is little: and when it is thick, and when it is thin.
Et ego iam praemisi in diuisione, tunc cum dixi uulnera, quod omne ulcus quod non sanatur, neque nascitur in eo caro, non est illud nisi propter unam nouem caussarum.	I have already پیش in the division, then when I said wounds, that every ulcer which does not heal, and does not form new flesh, is not a wound at all but a fistula for nine causes.
Quarum una est, aut propter paucitatem sanguinis in corpore: aut propter maliciam eius: aut quoniam inter ipsum, et super labia eius est caro dura, prohibens natiuitatem carnis: aut quia est multae sordis et sordiciei: aut quoniam ulcus in seipso est putridum, et materia quae mittitur ei est malae qualitatis: aut quoniam medicina est inconueniens in curatione eius: aut quoniam corruptio cadens in regione est genus pestilentiae, aut per proprietatem in regione, sicut accidit in Caesaraugusta: in qua fit difficilis digestio aegritudinum, et tardatur in ea sanatio apostematum per naturam: aut quoniam in eo est os unum, aut numerus ossium.	One of these causes is, or because there is a lack of blood in the body; or because of its malicious nature; or because it is between itself and over its lips hard flesh, which prevents the growth of new flesh; or because it is full of dirt and filth; or because the wound is putrid within itself, and the matter which it discharges is of bad quality; or because medicine is incompatible in its cure; or because corruption by falling into a region is a kind of pestilence, or per se in that region: for this reason digestion of ailments is difficult, and healing of ulcers by nature is delayed; or because there is only one opening, or a number of bones.
Et ego iam ostendi omnes istas caussas et signa earum, et curationes ipsarum cum medicinis in diuisione: et oportet hic ut faciam te scire curationem Fistulae et Zuken, quae fit per uiam operationis cum manu.	And I have already shown you all the causes and signs of them, and their treatments with physicians in detail; and it is necessary here that I make you know the treatment of the fistula and of thezuken, which is made by a surgical opening with the hand.
Scias ergo, quod Fistula accidit in omnibus membris corporis.	So you know that the fistula happens in all parts of the body.
Nam ex eis sunt Fistulae quae perueniunt ad uenas magnas et arterias, aut neruos, aut sifac: aut ad intestinum, aut ad uesicam, aut ad aliquam ex costis: aut ad aliquam ex spondilibus dorsi, aut ad aliquam iuncturarum compositarum compositione: sicut manus, et pedis: et ex eis sunt quae uadunt ad propinquitatem membri principalis, et similium.	For these are the fistulas that reach the large veins and arteries, or nerves, or to the intestines, or to the urethra, or to some of the ribs on the back, or to some of the joints of the body by composition: like the hands and feet: and those that flow close to the main member, and others.
Quae ergo ex his Fistulis est secundum hunc modum, est ex aegritudinibus difficilis sanationis, et non recipit curationem, et occupatio cum ea est labor et ignorantia.	Now which of these fistulas is according to this way, it is from diseases that are difficult to cure, and does not accept treatment, and the work with her is labor and ignorance.
Quod si est ex Fistulis aliqua cuius profunditas non peruenit ad haec loca quae dixi: et speras, et confidis in curatione eius, et uis peruenire ad cognitionem illius, tunc accipe tentam ex aere, aut ferro, si Fistula tendit secundum rectitudinem, et perquire eam cum ipsa.	That if there is any fistula whose depth does not reach these places that I said: and you hope, and you trust in its cure, and you seek to come to its knowledge, then you accept a trial from bronze or iron if the fistula extends according to rectitude, and you search it with itself.
Si autem in Fistula est tortuositas, tunc inuestiga eam cum tenta de plumbo subtili.	But if there is any fistula that has a tortuosity, then investigate it with a thin lead.
Quoniam plumbum cum lenitate sui corporis alleuiatur, et curuatur circa tortuositatem.	For because the lead with its gentleness softens itself to the body, and it is concerned about the tortuosity.
Quod si Fistula est habens orificia multa, non est tibi possibile ut significes super eam cum tenta.	That if the fistula has many openings, it is not possible for you to indicate on it with a lead.
Clisteriza ergo ex eis orificium ex orificiis suis.	So make a hole from its holes from its holes.
Nam humiditas qua clisterizas ipsum, uadit uersus orificia alia, et currit ex eis.	For because the moisture that clisterizes itself, runs towards other openings, and flows out of them.
Deinde exquisite inquire secundum quem modum est tibi possibile: ut cognoscas quod illic est os, aut neruus, et est Fistulae concauitas longinqua, aut propinqua: aut est Fistula una cui sunt orificia multa, et sta super totum illud, cum summa fortitudinis tuae: cum interrogatione tua, qua interrogas infirmum, et inuentione doloris apud compressionem cum manu tua super locum, et similibus ex significationibus et caussis accidentibus apostemati.	Then investigate and find out according to how you can be able to: that you may know if there is a mouth or nerve, and the fistula is hidden far away or near: or is a single fistula whose openings are many, and it is over all that with great strength of your own: with your questioning, which you ask the sick person, and by finding out the pain when compressing with your hand on the spot, and similar indications and causes of accident.
Cum ergo steteris super omnia illa statione uera, tunc uade ad curationem secundum confidentiam: et est, ut consideres tunc, si est Fistula propinqua apparens, aut in loco saluo longinquo a iunctura, aut a neruo, aut arteria, aut uena, aut uno locorum quae dixi tibi: tunc seca Fistulam secundum quod praemissum est ex narratione mea, et aufer quod est in ea ex filtratione, et carnibus corruptis, quod nascitur in orificio eius ex carne, aut thelul, et similibus: et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	Therefore, when you are standing still, stationary and stable, then turn to treatment with confidence: and it is as if you consider that, if there is a fistula that appears close by, or in a place far from the juncture, or from a nerve, or an artery, or a vein, or one of the places I told you, then dry up the fistula according to what I have previously said in my narrative, and remove what is in it from filtration, and腐敗した肉、それはその穴から生じるから、またはそれに似たもの: and cure it until it is healed.
Si autem Fistula est longinquae profunditatis, et est secundum rectitudinem: tunc oportet ut seces eam in profundo quantum est tibi possibile.	But if the fistula is of great depth, and straight: then you should separate it in the depth as much as you can.
Deinde mundifica ipsam ex omnibus carnibus eius corruptis.	Then cleanse it from all of its corrupted flesh.
Deinde administra licinia inuoluta in medicinis acutis: et intromitte ea usque ad concauitatem Fistulae quam comprehendisti cum ferro: fac cum ea illud aliquotiens, donec corrodat medicina acuta totum quod remansit in concauitate Fistulae ex corruptione.	Then apply the poultice of wet wool in acute medicines: and insert it into the fistula which you have enclosed with iron: do this several times, until the acute medicine has completely corroded what remained in the enclosure of the fistula from corruption.
Deinde restaura ipsam cum unguentis quae generant carnem sanam, donec sanetur.	Then restore it with ointment that generates healthy flesh, until it is healed.
Si uero non sanatur per illud, tunc cauteriza ipsam secundum quod narrauimus.	But if it does not heal with this, then cauterize it according to what we have described.
Si ergo caussa Fistulae est os, et certificatur apud te illud: tunc inquire ipsum, et seca ipsum secundum quod narraui tibi: si non prohibet te aliquid ex uena, aut neruo, aut membro principali, sicut diximus.	But if the cause of the fistula is an opening, and this is certifed to you: then inquire about it, and dry it up according to what I have told you: if it does not prohibit you from any vein, or nerve, or main member, as we have said.
Si ergo detegitur tibi os, et est in eo quiddam corruptionis, et nigredinis: tunc rade ipsum, donec auferatur corruptio eius tota.	But if it is discovered to you that there is an opening, and there is some corruption, and blackening: then shave it, until all the corruption is removed.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod incarnat ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then care for this person with what incarnates flesh, until he is healed.
Quod si non sanatur, et emittat pus sicut faciebat: tunc scias, quod tu non peruenisti ad totam eradicationem corruptionis.	That if it does not heal, and it discharges pus as it did: then know, that you have not achieved total eradication of the corruption.
Detege ergo super illud secundo, et exquisite fac rasionem eius, et mundificationem ipsius cum ultima fortitudine tua.	Therefore, examine it again, and carefully consider whether there is some rational explanation for its condition, and cleanse it with your last strength.
Deinde restaura ipsum.	Then restore him.
Si ergo sanatur, bonum est: et si non, tunc scias quod illa corruptio est in profunditate longinqua corporis, quam non es consecutus.	So if he recovers, it is good; and if not, then you know that that corruption is far away in the depths of the body, which you have not reached.
Non est ergo tibi in ea ingenium, nisi dimittere ipsam naturae.	So you do not have such an art, unless you let it go by nature itself.
Quod si corruptum est os paruum, et est possibile tibi, attrahe ipsum cum forficibus subtilibus quae conueniunt ad illud.	That if the corruption is in a small hole, and it is possible for you, draw it out with delicate forceps which are suitable for that.
Si autem sunt ossa multa, tunc exquisite fac attractionem eorum omnium, neque dimittas ex eis aliquid cum tua fortitudine.	If there are many bones, then inquire about their attraction, and do not let go of any of them with your strength.
Si uero contrarietatem facit tibi aliquid ex humiditatibus, et non est in incisione eorum timor, uel error: tunc incide illas humiditates et carnes, si sunt illic, et libera ossa.	If any of them make you afraid because there is a contrary moisture, and there is no fear or mistake in cutting them: then cut those moistures and the meat, if there is any, and free the bones.
Si uero non est tibi praeparatio auferendi ossa ex hora tua, tunc pone super uulnus quod putrefaciat ipsum: et dimitte ipsum, donec putrefiat quod est in circumitu illorum ossium ex carnibus et humiditatibus.	If you do not have the preparation to remove the bones from your time, then place over the wound that it may rot: and let go of it until it rots what is around those bones of meat and moistures.
Et custodi uulnus ut non consolidetur.	And guard the bone so that it does not harden again.
Et constringatur sectio quam tu secuisti in operatione tua.	And let it be constricted as you followed in your operation.
Imo pone super ipsum, si times, cotum submersum sulfure trito cum oleo: aut cotum submersum in unguento aegyptio, aut aliquo unguentorum uiridium.	At the bottom place over the wound, if you are able, a trodden-in with oil of sulfur: or a trodden-in in Egyptian ointment, or any kind of ointment.
Nam quando putrefient illae scilicet humiditates, et separantur ex eis ossa, alleuiatur ablatio eorum, et ipsorum attractio.	For when those moistures rot, and the bones separate from them, their removal is eased, and their attraction is gone.
Si autem est os unum magnum, sicut os cruris, aut os coxae, et similia illis, et quod ex eo corruptum est, est pars magna: tunc rade ipsum rasione ultima, donec auferatur illa nigredo et corruptio.	If there is one large bone, such as a thigh or hip bone, and that which is corrupted from it is part of the great bone, then cut it with the last rasp, until it is taken away by the black and corruption.
Deinde restaura uulnus.	Then restore the bone.
Si uero quod est in eo corruptum, est pars magna, et corruptio iam consecuta est medullam ossis, tunc necesse est serrare ipsum, et incidere ipsum totum usque ad locum, ubi peruenit corruptio: tunc cura ipsum, donec consolidetur.	If, however, what is corrupted in it is a large part, and the corruption has already reached the bone's marrow, then you need to cut it off, and cut all of it up to the place where the corruption reaches: then take care of it, until it hardens again.
Et ego narro tibi zuken, quae accidit uiro in crure suo: ut ponas ipsam exemplum et adiutorium super operationem tuam.	And I tell you a story about what happened to a man in his leg: that you may have an example and helper for your own operation.
Fuit uir iuuenis aetate circiter triginta annos, cui accidit dolor in crure suo, a caussa quae mota est super ipsum intra corpus, id est, ab interioribus, donec peruenerunt materiae ad crus, et apostematum est apostemate magno: et non fuit ei caussa extrinseca.	There was a young man of about thirty years of age to whom it came to pass that he had pain in his leg, through some cause which entered into him from within the body, that is, from within, until it reached his limb; and there formed upon it a great ulcer, and not for any external cause.
Extensum est ergo cum eo tempus cum errore medicorum, donec apertum est apostema, et concurrerunt cum eo materiae multae.	So then with this time of error of the doctors, until the ulcer opened up, and there came many substances to him.
Et postposita est curatio eius, donec fistulatum est crus, et facta sunt in eo orificia multa: quae omnia emittebant pus, et humiditates corporis.	And his cure was delayed until his leg had been bound up, and many openings were made in him: all of which were emitting pus, and moistures from the body.
Curauit ergo ipsum multitudo medicorum circiter duos annos, et non fuit in eo sapiens in arte manus, donec uocatus sum, et uidi crus eius, et materias quae currebant ex illis orificiis cursu magno: etiam omne uiri corpus iam tabuerat, et color eius citrinus erat.	So he was treated by a number of doctors for about two years, and there was no wise man in the art of hands, until I was called, and I saw his leg, and the matter which was flowing out from those openings in great quantity: also all of his body had become yellow, and his color was citron-like.
Intromisi ergo tentam in uno locorum orificiorum, et peruenit tenta ad os.	So then I entered into one of the openings, and came to the mouth.
Deinde perscrutatus sum orificia omnia: et inueni ea peruenire ad se inuicem ex omnibus partibus cruris.	Then I examined all the openings: and I found them coming together at a place from all parts of the leg.
Properaui ergo, et secui super unum illorum orificiorum, donec detexi partem ossis: et inueni ipsum corruptum: quod iam corrosum erat, et denigratum, et putruerat, et perforatum erat, donec penetrauerat usque ad medullam.	So then I took hold of it, and followed up on one of the openings, until I detected a part of bone: and I found it corroded: which was already corroded, and discolored, and rotten, and pierced, until it penetrated all the way down to the marrow.
Serraui ergo quod detectum est mihi, et praeparatum ex osse corrupto.	So then I broke off what had been detected by me, and prepared it from corrupt bone.
Et deputaui, quod non esset in osse nisi illa corruptio, quam abscidi, et serraui.	And I took hold of what was not in the bone but that corruption which I had broken off, and I made it sharp, and I broke it off.
Et ego iam eradicaueram eam.	So then I had already roots.
Deinde posui restaurationem uulneris cum medicinis consolidatiuis spacio longo.	Then I set about the root of the ulcer with cementing medicines in a long space.
Et non est consolidatum.	It is not consolidated.
Deinde tentaui, et detexi super os secundo supra detectionem primam: et inueni corruptionem continuam cum osse: et serraui quod apparuit mihi etiam ex illa corruptione.	And then I tried again, and grabbed the second bone above the first fracture: and I found continuous damage with the bone; and I tightened that which also seemed to me from that same corruption.
Deinde conatus sum restaurationem eius.	Then I tried to restore it.
Et non est restauratum.	And it was not restored.
Detexi ergo super ipsum iterum, et non cessaui incidere os particulatim, et conari restaurationem eius: et non est restauratum, donec incidi ex osse circiter palmum unum, et extraxi illud cum medulla sua.	I grabbed it again, and I did not stop hitting the bone in detail, and tried to restore it: and it was not restored until I hit a little palm of the bone and pulled it out with its medulla.
Deinde restauraui ipsum cum medicinis, et consolidatum est uelociter, et sanatum: et non fuit necessaria haec iteratio in operatione eius, et sectione ipsius, nisi propter dispositionem debilitatis infirmi, et paucitatem tolerantiae eius, et timorem meum super ipsum de morte: quoniam accidebat ei in omnibus horis ex superfluitate euacuationis syncopis mala.	Then I restored it with the help of physicians, and it was quickly consolidated, and healed: and this repetition in its operation, and section, would not have been necessary, except for the weakness of the nurse, and her lack of tolerance, and my fear of it from death; because it happened to him at all times from an excessive bad syncopis.
Sanatus est ergo sanatione integra: et nata est in loco ossis caro dura, et bona facta est dispositio in corpore suo, et rediit uirtus eius: et conuersatus est in dispositionibus suis: et non fecit ei contrarietatem in ambulatione nocumentum omnino.	He was therefore completely healed: and new bone grew in place of the old one, and good order was restored in his body, and his strength returned: and he recovered his health, and returned to his habits: and he did not experience any harm at all during walking.
Si autem os eminens in loco corporis iam fractum est: tunc oportet ut serres ipsum, secundum hunc modum: et est: ut accipias ligamentum, et stringe ipsum in extremitate ossis eminentis: et praecipe alicui, qui extendat ipsum ad sursum: et pone ligamentum aliud ex lana grossius ligamento primo.	If however a prominent bone is already broken in the place of the body: then it should be fixed like this: you take a ligament, and tighten it on the end of the prominent bone: and order someone who will stretch it upwards: and put another grosser ligament on the first ligament.
Deinde liga ipsum super carne, quae est suh osse: et extende extremitatem eius, ut trahas carnem ad inferiora: et tu detegis carnem super locum quem uis serrare, ut non laedat Serra carnem.	Then you fasten the ligament on top of the meat that is the bone: and extend its end so that you pull the meat downwards: and you cover the meat over the place that you want to fix, so as not to hurt it when you cut the meat.
Pone lignum, aut tabulam sub osse inferius decenter: quoniam quando facis illud, non prohibetur quin secet carnem corruptam.	Place a ligament, or a board under the bone below to the side: for when you do that, you should not stop to cut the corrupted meat.
Et oportet ut sit Serratura super locum corruptum parumper, ut non sit in concauitate ossis corruptio: et non appareat in apparitione sua sensui, et cogat ad Serraturam sui uice alia.	And it should be fixed on the place of corruption slightly, so that there is not the risk of the bone's fracture: and it does not appear from its appearance to the sense, and compels to the force of its own fixing.
Quod si os est corruptum, et non est eminens, imo continuatur pars eius cum parte: et corruptio est in medio eius, aut in parte ipsius: tunc detege carnem ab omnibus partibus totam.	If the jaw is corrupted and is not prominent, then a part of it continues with another part: and corruption is in the middle of it, or in some part of it: then discover flesh from all parts altogether.
Deinde pone lignum inferius.	Then put wood below.
Postea serra illud ex parte prima, ubi est corruptio, donec continuetur Serratura ex parte altera: et sit Serratura secundum longitudinem a corruptione parumper, secundum quod diximus.	Then tighten that from the first part where there is corruption until it continues with the lock from the other part: and tighten the second according to the length of corruption just a little, as I said.
Quod si corruptio est in iunctura, incide ipsam iuncturam corruptam, et serra os ubi continuatur ex parte altera.	If the corruption is in the joint, then cut that joint that is corrupted, and tighten the jaw where it continues from the other part.
Si uero corruptio est in continuatione duarum iuncturarum, tunc non est in ea ingenium nisi abrasio.	But if the corruption is in the continuation of two joints, then there is no skill in that except for abrasion.
Quod si corruptio est in pectine manus, aut in pectine pedis: tunc res in eo est difficilis ualde.	If the corruption is in the hand or foot plank: then the thing in it is difficult to do very much.
Verum oportet, ut inquiras corruptionem qualiter appareat tibi.	But it is necessary that you inquire how the corruption appears to you.
Et abradas eam, et mundes ipsam secundum quamcunque dispositionem tibi possibile est, et cum quocunque ingenio rectificatur tibi: quando non facit tibi contrarietatem Vena, aut Neruus.	And abrasion it, and make clean that according to what seems to you possible, and with whatever skill you can correct it: when it does not give you a contrary vein, or nerve.
Et scias quod incisoria, et Serrae ad incidendum ista ossa sunt multa, secundum situm ossium, et praparationem eorum, et ipsorum grossitudinem, et subtilitatem eorum, et magnitudinem, et paruitatem ipsorum, et duriciem ipsorum, et eorum raritatem.	And know that there are many saws and drills to cut these bones according to the position of the bones, and their preparation, and their thickness and lightness, and their size and smoothness, and their magnitude and hardness, and their rarity.
Quapropter oportet, ut praepares omni speciei operationis instrumentum conueniens ad illam operationem.	Therefore it is necessary that you prepare for each kind of operation a tool suitable to that operation.
Et scias, quod operationes istae significant tibi super speciem instrumenti quo indiges, quando tecum est studium longum.	And know that these operations require your attention to the instrument with which you work, when you have a long study.
Et cognitio modorum huius artis, testimonium modorum aegritudinum: tunc enim iam inuenies per teipsum illud quod conuenit ei ex instrumentis ad omnem infirmitatem.	And the knowledge of the ways of this art is a witness to the way of sickness: for then you will find that which suits him out of instruments to every disease.
Et ego sum firmans tibi in ultimo huius capituli numerum instrumentorum, quae pones exempla super quae incides, et probationem qua experiaris super alia.	And I am confirming to you at the end of this chapter the number of instruments, which you may put as examples of what you cut, and proof of what you experience on others.
Forma Serrae.	Surgical instruments.
Forma alterius Serrae.	The shape of a serrated blade.
Forma Serrae alterius.	The shape of a serrated blade of another kind.
Forma Serrae alterius.	The shape of a serrated blade of another type.
Haec forma Serrae depicta, sit decenter facta.	This illustration shows the shape of a serrated blade that is slightly off-center.
Fiat arcus eius superior, acuitas eius ex ferro: et manubrium eius ex buxo, et sit pyramidale decenter factum.	Let his bow be made of steel; let its sharpness be from a whetstone; and let its handle be made of boxwood and slightly pyramid-shaped.
Forma Rasorii iuncturarum.	The shape of the razor's blades are joined together.
Sit caput huius Rasorii, secundum formam capitis claui stellati: et puncta eius sint secundum formam punctorum elischetfegi.	Let the head of the razor follow the form of a star-shaped claw; and let its cuts follow the shape of a star's points.
Et non conuenit, nisi ut fricentur cum eo capita iuncturarum, quando corrumpuntur, aut os amplum, et magnum est.	It does not fit together unless the heads of the razor blades touch and move together when they are closing; it has a large and wide mouth.
Forma maioris Rasorii.	The shape of the larger of the two razor blades.
Forma medii Rasorii.	The shape of the middle razor blade.
Forma Rasorii lati.	The shape of the wider razor blade.
Forma Rasorii in quo est concauitas.	The shape of the razor blade that is closed together.
Forma Rasorii alterius subtilis.	The shape of the other thinner razor blade.
Forma Rasorii alterius curuatae extremitatis.	The shape of the curved extreme end of the other razor blade.
Forma Rasorii parui, subtilis tentae.	The shape of a small and thin blade for the tongue.
Forma Rasorii cum quo inciduntur ossa.	The shape of the razor blade that cuts bones.
Forma etiam Rasorii magni.	The shape of the larger razor blade as well.
Hoc similatur Radio, et extremitas est sicut Serra: exhibetur in locis multis ex rasione ossium.	This is similar to a ray and the end is like a serrated knife; it is shown in many places of the skull's bone-cutting.
Forma Rasorii quod conuenit ad rasionem eius quod perforatum est ex ossibus.	The shape of the razor blade that closes onto the cuts made by the other razor blades through the bones.
Extremitas eius triangula, acutarum est extremitatum.	Its end is triangular and its angles are acute.
Fit ex Indi.	It comes from India.
Et similiter oportet, ut fiant omnia quae diximus ex Rasoriis, et Incisoriis, et Serris.	And likewise it should be so that all that we have said about the razors, the incisers, and the serrations should be applied to them.
¶ De incisione extremitatum, et Serratura ossium.	Regarding the cutting of bones and the serrations on them.
Caput LXXXIX.	Head 89.
Putrefiunt extremitates, aut ex caussa extrinseca, aut intrinseca.	The ends putrifiy, either because of an external cause, or for an internal one.
Cum ergo medicatus fueris illam corruptionem curatione medicinarum, et non confert curatio: et uides corruptionem incidere in membrum, quam non repercutit aliquid: tunc oportet ut incidas illud membrum usque ubi consequitu corruptio, ut euadat infirmus per illud a morte, aut a malicia quae est maior defectu membri.	But when you have cured the disease with medicine, and there is no benefit from the cure; and you see corruption affect a limb, but it does not spread to any other part of the body; then you should cut off that limb all the way up to the place where the infection stops; so that the sick person may be saved from death or from a greater disease by means of this limb.
Et signum cui accidit illud est, quod denigratur membrum, donec putetur: quod ignis combussit ipsum, aut putrefit post nigredinem: donec inciditur illa putredo usque ad illud quod sequitur illud membrum, et serpit in totum corpus.	And the sign that this happened is that the limb is disfigured until it is healed; either it has burned itself up or rotted after yellowing; until this putrefaction comes to that part which follows the limb, and creeps all over the body.
Propera ergo cum incisione eius, et similiter si caussa corruptionis est a percussione quorundam uenenosorum: sicut scorpionis marini, et uiperae, et rutellae, et similium.	Therefore, when it is incised like this, and similarly if the cause of corruption is from the beating of certain fruits: as in the case of the sea scorpion, and the wasp, and the nettle, and others like them.
Si ergo corruptio, aut percussio est in extremitate digiti, tunc incide digitum, et non des spacium corruptioni, ut incedat usque ad reliquam manum.	If then corruption or a blow is in the extreme part of the finger, then cut the finger, and not leave room for corruption, so that it may be incised all the way to the remaining hand.
Et similiter si accidit in manu, tunc incide eam ex radice focilis, et non des spacium corruptioni, donec capiat in focili brachii.	And likewise if it happens in the hand, then cut it from the root with fire, and not leave room for corruption, until it is taken in the arm of fire.
Et si inuadit in eo, tunc incide brachium apud cubitum in iunctura sua.	And if a wound has happened in it, then cut the arm at the hip where it joins.
Si autem pertransit corruptio, et uides eum circiter cubitum: tunc in illo est mors infirmi.	But if corruption has passed over, and you see it all around the hip: then death is in that person.
Et administrare praeter illud ex curatione, est quantitas uirtus.	And to add to this cure, there is a quantity of virtue.
Et similiter fac de pede, quando inuadit corruptio in digito, tunc incide ipsum apud unum nodorum: et si capit in pectine pedis, tunc incide pedem totum.	And likewise do for the foot, when a wound has happened in the finger, then cut it near one of the joints: and if it enters into the shank, then cut the whole foot.
Si autem ascendit ad genu, tunc incide crus apud iuncturam genu.	But if it ascends to the knee, then cut the leg at the knee joint.
Quod si corruptio iam peruenit supra genu, tunc non est in ea ingenium, nisi dimissio, et relinquere infirmum morti.	Which if corruption has already reached above the knee, there is no remedy but to cut it off and let go of the sick one to death.
Et modus incidendi membrum, aut serrandi ipsum est, ut stringas ligamentum in inferiori, quem uis incidere: et stringe ligamentum aliud supra locum.	And the way to cut a limb or to bend it is, so that you stretch the ligament in the lower part, which you want to incise: and stretch another ligament above the place.
Et extendat minister ligamentum unum ad inferiora: et extendat minister aliud ligamentum superius ad sursum.	And let one minister of the ligaments stretch to the inferiores: and let another minister of the ligaments stretch upwards to the superior.
Et tu separa carnem quae est inter duo ligamenta, cum Spatumili lato, donec detegatur caro tota.	And you separate the flesh which is between the two ligaments, with a sharp instrument, until all the flesh is seen.
Deinde incidatur, aut serretur.	Then it should be incised, or stretched.
Et oportet, ut ponas ab omnibus partibus pannum lini, et non tangat Serra locum sanum: et accidat infirmo laesio addita, et apostema calidum.	And it is necessary that you place a linen cloth on all sides and not touch the sound place with the saw: and happen to the sick person a wound added, and a poultice hot.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis interius dum operaris, tunc cauteriza locum uelociter: aut pone super ipsum quosdam pulueres abscindentes sanguinem.	If, however, a flow of blood occurs inside while you are working, then quickly cauterize the place: or put on it some powder that stops the blood.
Deinde redi ad medicationem tuam, donec compleatur.	Then turn your attention to your own medication until it is complete.
Deinde liga membrum uulneratum cum ligamento conueniente ei, et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then bind the injured member with a suitable bandage and take care of him, until he recovers.
Et ego narro tibi quod accidit uiro in pede suo, hoc idem accidens quod narro tibi.	And I will tell you what happened to the man in his foot, this same accident that I am telling you.
Quod est, quia accidit in pede suo nigredo, cum adustione quae assimilatur combustioni ignis: et corruptio illa in primis accidit in digito suo, donec coepit pedem totum.	That is, because it happened in his black foot, with a burn that resembles fire; and that corruption first occurred in his toe, until it began to affect the whole foot.
Properauit ergo uir ex seipso, postquam uidit corruptionem incidere in membro cum uehementia eius, quod inuenit ex dolore, et adustione eius: et incidit ipsum apud iuncturam, et sanatus est.	Then the man from his own fever, after he saw the corruption enter into his limb with its violence, which he felt in pain and burning; and because of that infection he cut himself where it joins, and was healed.
Et postquam praeteriit ei tempus longum, accidit ei illa eadem corruptio in digito manus suae indice.	And after he had passed a long time, the same corruption happened to him again in the first joint of his hand.
Venit ergo ad me, et conatus sum recuperare illam superfluitatem cum eo quod posui super manum ex medicinis post mundificationem corporis eius: et non repercussa est superfluitas, et coepit incedere in digitum alium: donec coepit coruptio in manum.	So he came to me, and I tried to remove that excess with him when I put on the hand from the medicines after purifying his body: and the excess did not respond, and began to affect another finger: until it started to affect the hand.
Vocauit ergo me, ad incidendum manum eius: et nolui illud, sperans ex me super repercussionem illius superfluitatis: et timui etiam super ipsum apud incisionem manus eius mortem.	So he called me to cut off his hand; and I did not want to do so, hoping for a response from within to that excess: and I was afraid also of causing death to him by cutting off his hand.
Quoniam uirtus uiri erat super casum.	For the strength of the man was above his destruction.
Postquam ergo desperauit de me, reuersus est ad terram suam: et peruenit ad me de eo, quia properauit, et incidit manum suam totam: et sanatus est.	Then, when he was disappointed with me, he turned back to his land; and he came back to me, because he hoped for healing, and he cut off all his hand: and he was healed.
Et non attuli hanc narrationem, nisi ut sit adiutorium super illud quod cadit de genere huius aegritudinis: et ut sit significatio qua significetur, et secundum quam agatur.	I did not bring this story forward unless it should serve as an aid to what concerns this kind of sickness; and so that it should make clear what is made clear, and in accordance with what is relevant.
¶ De cura Sinuum, et qualitate clisterizationis cum medicinis.	On the treatment of ulcers and the quality of poultices with medicines.
Caput XC.	Chapter X.
Quando accidit apostema in quibusdam membris carnosis, et prolongatur spacium apostematis, donec collectionem facit saniei: deinde rumpitur, aut perforatur, et egreditur quod in eo est ex sanie, et remanet locus uacuus quasi sit uas: et cutis quae est super ipsum sicut pannus qui iam subtiliatus est: et non peruenit ad ultimum in corruptione sua, neque imprimit in os, neque in neruum, neque in ligamentum: meretur ut nominetur Sinus: et non nominatur Fistula: uerumtamen si prolongatur spacium eius, donec imprimat corruptio in aliquid horum membrorum, tunc nominatur Fistula, aut zuken.	When an aphma occurs in some fleshy member and the space of the aphma is prolonged until it forms a collection: then it bursts, or pierces, and what is contained within it comes out, leaving a hollow place like a wound, and the skin above it, as though it were a thin cloth; and does not spread to the last extent of corruption in itself, nor prints into the mouth, nor into the nerves, nor into the ligaments: it deserves to be called a sinus: yet if it prolongs the space, until it impresses corruption on some of these members, then it is called a fistula, or a pudenda.
Et cura eius est, ut incidas illam cutem totam sicut reuoluitur: et praecipue quando subtiliata est, et facta sicut pannus: et confidis quia non aaehaeret cum loco, propter corruptionem suam.	And the care of it is that you should strike all the skin off as though it were burned up; and above all when it has become thin, and is like a cloth: and be confident that it would not stick to the place because of its own corruption.
Si autem speras quod adhaereat cutis, et non consequitur ex eo corruptio illa ultima consecutione: et si in cute est spissitudo ex carne, tunc cura ipsum cum Clisteri: et est, ut consideres ad Sinum.	If, however, you hope that the skin will adhere, and does not bring about the last corruption: and if there is a thickness of flesh on the skin, then care for it with poultices; and you are to consider in regard to a sinus.
Tunc si est magnus, et pus quod emittitur ex eo est foetidi odoris: tunc clisteriza ipsum cum medicamine aegyptio, quod est aceti, et olei, et ziniar, partes recipiens aequales, aggregentur in uase: et decoquantur super ignem, donec rubeat medicamen: et ueniat in spissitudinem mellis.	Then if it is large, and the pus that is discharged from it has a foul odor: then poultice it with Egyptian medicine, which is acid, and oil, and myrrh, parts equal, blended together in water: and let them boil on the fire until the medicine turns red: and let it come to a syrup.
Deinde accipe ex eo quod tibi necesse est: et dissolue ipsum cum aqua et melle, et clisteriza cum eo Sinum: et stringe orificium eius, et dimitte medicinam in eo ad quantitatem duarum horarum.	Then take from it what you need: and dissolve it with water and honey, and poultice it with the sinus: and tighten the opening of it, and let the medicine flow into it for two hours.
Deinde extrahe ipsum cum expressione: fac illud diebus tot, donec mundificetur Sinus, et remoueatur foetor.	Then draw it out with expression: make those days until the sinuses are cleaned and the smell is gone.
Et quandoque clisterizatur cum aqua cineris, quando non est tibi praesens hoc medicamen: et est, ut accipias cinerem lignorum uitis, aut cinerem ex lignis ilicis: et proiicias super eam aquam.	And when it is sometimes clotted with blood and water of ash, when this remedy is not present with you: and it is, so that you take the ash of dried wood, or the ash of oak wood: and you pour over it water.
Deinde cola eam, et clisteriza cum ea, donec confidas quod Sinus iam ablutus est.	Then wrap it up, and clatter it with it until you are confident that the sinuses have been washed away.
Quod si infirmo non est tolerantia super medicamen aegyptium, neque aquam cineris, tunc clisteriza ipsum cum aqua et melle, cui iam permixtum est aliquid ex ziniar contrito.	That if the tolerance of the Egyptian remedy is not good, and neither the water of ash, then clatter it with water and honey, to which has been added some crushed zircon.
Aut clisteriza ipsum cum melle et uino permixtis, quoniam de proprietate mellis est, ut mundificet, et abluat: et uinum facit adhaerere Sinum, praecipue quando in uino est superfluitas stipticitatis et siccitatis.	Or clatter it with honey and wine mixed, because the property of honey is to clean and wash away: and the wine makes it adhere to the sinuses, especially when there is an abundance of astringency and dryness in it.
Cum facis illud aliquotiens, et confidis quod Sinus corruptio iam remota est: tunc clisteriza ipsum cum eo quod facit nasci carnem in eo.	When you do this occasionally, and are confident that the corruption of the sinuses has already been removed: then clatter it with it so that flesh is born in it.
Et est, ut accipias ex emplastro dyafinicon: et dissoluas ipsum cum oleo rosato, et uino stiptico: aut clisteriza ipsum cum quibusdam medicinis, et unguentis aliis, quorum proprietates scripsi in tractatu unguentorum.	And it is so that you take the dyophin from plaster: and dissolve it with rose oil, and wine astringent: or clatter it with some other remedies, of which I have written about their properties in the treatise on ointments.
Quod si orificium Sinus est strictum, in quo non capit cannula clisteris: tunc amplifica ipsum cum ferro parumper: aut pone in ipso licinium inuolutum in unguento aegyptio, aut in unguento basilicon, donec amplificetur.	That if the orifice of the sinus is tight, in which the cannula of the clister does not enter: then enlarge it with iron a little: or put in it the lyme-tree that is stirred in Egyptian ointment, or in basilic ointment until it is enlarged.
Et similiter si est orificium etiam amplum, tunc aggrega labia eius cum sutura: et dimitte ex eo quantitatem in quam ingrediatur clistere sine additione.	And likewise if the orifice is also wide, then join the lips of it with a stitch: and let go from it as much as is added to the clister without any addition.
Et similiter si orificium eius ex quo currit pus, est eleuatum ad superiora: tunc seca ipsum in depressiori loco qui est in ipso, ut currat ex eo pus usque inferius: quoniam pus quando coartatur in profunditate Sinus, prohibet carnem generari in eo.	And likewise if the orifice of it from which the pus runs is raised upward: then dry it out in a lower place where it is located, so that the pus runs from it downward: because when the pus is held back in the depth of the sinus, it prevents flesh from being born in it.
Quod si non est tibi possibile secare Sinum circiter inferius eius secundum quod uis: tunc conare, ut praepares membrum praeparatione qua currat ex eo pus cum facilitate secundum quod praeparatur tibi.	If it is not possible for you to cut around the bottom of the sinus, according to what you wish: then try to prepare the member in such a way that a pus comes out easily, according to how it prepares itself for you.
Conare, ut non retineatur in eo aliquid ex pus omnino: et accipe medicinas consolidatiuas quae ponuntur super signum, conuenientes ad illud quod uis.	Try not to leave anything behind in it at all: and take the solid medicines that are placed over the mark, fitting for what you wish.
Et extende eas super pannum lini.	And extend them over the fabric of linen.
Et sit pannus tantae quantitatis, qua fiat communicatio totius Sinus.	And let there be such a quantity of cloth so that it communicates with all of the sinus.
Deinde incide cum forficibus in directo orificii Sinus foramen, amplius orificio Sinus parumper.	Then cut with forceps into the direct opening of the sinus hole, making a slightly larger opening in the sinus.
Deinde extende ex unguentis lenibus super pannum alium, secundum quantitatem foraminis: et pone eum super ipsum positione longinqua ab orificio Sinus, ut alleuietur exitus pus ex eo: et non auferas pannum magnum, nisi post dies aliquos uice una.	Then extend with linen pads from another cloth, according to the quantity of the opening: and place it on the body in a distant position from the hole, so that the exit of pus from it is facilitated: and do not remove the large cloth, unless after a few days a single sheet.
Ille autem qui est super orificium Sinus, est ille quem remoues in omni hora, ut egrediatur quod aggregatur in eo ex pus: et ut scias, an illud quod currit ex eo uirus, est multum, aut parum: aut digestum, aut indigestum.	But the one who is on the sinus opening is the one whom you remove at all times, so that it comes out what is accumulated in it from pus: and know, that which runs out of it virus, is very much, or little: or digested, or undigested.
Et cum hoc iterum considera locum Sinus ipsius, an in ipso sentiat dominus eius dolorem, aut non sit in eo dolor, et an sit in eo apostema, aut non sit in eo apostema.	And with this repeatedly consider the place of the sinus itself, whether the master feels pain there, or not have pain in it, and whether it is in it a swelling, or not: and if it is in it a swelling, great or small; and if it is hard or soft.
Cum ergo protenditur medicatio tua taliter, et uides materiam quae egreditur super orificium Sinus, tunc scias, quod Sinus iam adhaeret, aut approximat adhaerentiae: tunc ergo solue ipsum in mane, aut in tertio die: et quando soluis uulnus, tunc permuta pannum alium, et renoua unguentum.	When then your medicine is extended thus, and you see the material that comes out over the sinus opening, know that the sinus has already come together, or is approaching coming together: so then loosen it in the morning, or on the third day: and when you loosen the knot, then change the linen cloth, and rub with unguents.
Si autem egreditur ex Sinu post spacium longum uirus subtile, tunc non desperes de adhaerentia eius, nam sanatio eius appropinquat, quoniam ex hominibus sunt qui tardant generationem carnis in uulneribus suis, et ex eis sunt qui agunt econtrario illius.	If however comes out from the sinus after a long space a subtle virus, then do not despair about its coming together, for its cure approaches, because there are those who delay the generation of flesh in their wounds, and there are those who act in the opposite way.
Si autem egreditur ex Sinu post dies multos pus indigestum, tunc scias quod sinus non adhaeret.	If it has come out of the sinuses after many days of being indignant, then you will know that the sinus does not adhere.
Si ergo tardatur adhaerentia Sinus, et prolongatur res eius: tunc adde in exiccatione medicinarum, uerum faciant medici, ut sint medicinae in substantia sua humidae, et in uirtute sua siccae: sicut unguentum dyafinicon, quando additur in eo superfluitas additionis ex zegi.	If, then, the adhesion of the sinus is delayed, and its duration is prolonged: then add to the exiccation of medicines, it is true that physicians make them so that they are in their own substance of moisture, and in their own strength dry: like unguentum diacuminicon when added thereto an excess of addition by zeyi.
Et ex magis ultimo quo curatur, est, ut accipias unguentum dyafinicon, et soluatur cum oleo rosato, et roretur super ipsum uinum antiquum aequale in substantia sua.	And from the last, because it is cured when you take unguentum diacuminicon and dissolve it with rose oil and return to the same old wine in its substance.
Deinde confice ipsum cum eo, et utere ipso.	Then bind it to it, and use it.
Et iam facit simile huic actioni, quando non est tibi praesens unguentum dyafinicon, mel, quando decoquis ipsum, donec ingrossetur, et uteris eo.	And now it does the same action when you do not have with you unguentum diacuminicon, honey, when you cook it, until it thickens, and use it.
Aut accipe myrrham, et aloen, et olibanum: tere totum, et pulueriza illud super mel dum est super ignem.	Or take myrrh and aloe and olive oil: all of them, and grind them into powder and sprinkle it over honey while it is on fire.
Deinde line super ipsum pannum, et stringe ipsum super Sinum: et line cum melle quod decoquisti, donec ingrossatum est: et pulueriza super ipsum species, et pone super ipsum pannum, et stringe eum.	Then bind a strip of cloth over the sinus and tie it: and bind the strip with honey that you have cooked until it thickens: and sprinkle the powder on the strips, and put it on the cloth, and tie it up.
Et quandoque administratur in illo aristolochia longa, et radices lilii coelestis, et est lilium: et farina herbi, et centaurea.	And when you administer to it long aristochaus, and the roots of the sky lily, and the lily itself: and the herb powder, and the daisy.
Utere eis simplicibus, aut aggregatis, tere ea, et cribella ipsa: et pulueriza super mel quod narraui, et utere eo.	Use them simple, or mixed together, stir it up, and strain it: and sprinkle the powder over the honey that you have cooked, and use it.
Quod si prolongatur res Sinus, et non sanatur hac curatione: tunc scias, quod in profundo eius est corruptio: aut iam facit impressionem in ossibus, aut in reliquis membris duris, aut ligamentis: tunc cura ipsum curatione Fistularum, secundum quod praemissum est.	If the sinus is prolonged and does not heal with this cure: then you will know that there is corruption in its depth: or it already makes an impression on the bones, or on the other hard members of the body, or on the ligaments: then care for the sinus with Fistularum cures, according to what has been stated.
¶ De cura Panaritii et unguis attritae, et incisione digiti additi, et sectione.	Regarding the cure of Panăritus and the grinding of a fingernail and incising a finger and cutting it off:
Caput XCI.	Chapter LXXI.
Panaritium est apostema quod nascitur sub ungue pollicis manus, aut pedis: et fortasse nascitur in reliquis digitis.	The finger nail grows from under the thumb of the hand or foot, and possibly also from the other fingers.
Cum ergo prolongatur res eius, et negligitur curato eius, et apostematur apostemate calido: aut corrumpitur, et emittit pus, donec corrodit radicem unguis: et fortasse corrumpit eam totam, et fortasse peruenit corruptio ad os, donec est ei odor foetidus: et fit extremitas digiti lata, et fit color eius fuscus.	When it is then allowed to grow on and neglected with regard to its care, and is made an ulcer with heat: or if it is corrupted, and discharges pus, until it corroded the nail's root: and perhaps it corrupts all of it, and possibly the corruption reaches the mouth, until it has a foul smell: and makes the end of the finger large, and makes its color dark.
Quando ergo tu curas ipsum, cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio tua: tunc oportet ut incidas cum ferro totam superfluitatem quae remansit ex ungue.	When then you shall care for it, with what concerns the above-mentioned, and your treatment does not benefit it: then you must cut away the whole superfluity that remains from the nail.
Deinde cauteriza uulnus post illud.	Then cauterize the wound after that.
Cauterium enim iuuatiuum est ualde.	For the caustic of the wound is very hot.
Si uero os est sanum, et est unguis etiam sana, et additiones uacuae unguis iam comprimunt carnem ad interiora, et incipiunt pungere ipsam, et laedunt eam: tunc oportet ut ponas Radium subtilem sub angulo unguis quae pungit carnem, et impelle eam sursum: et incide eam carnem cum facilitate, et pone super illud quod remanet de carne ex medicinis comburentibus, corrosiuis, donec remoueatur totum eius.	But if the mouth is healthy, and the nail also is healthy, and the nail's additions of thin blood press on the flesh towards the inside, and begin to sting it, and hurt it: then you should put a small radium under the edge of the nail that stings the flesh, and push it upwards: and cut the flesh easily, and put on what remains of the flesh from the medicines burning, and corroding, until it has all fallen away.
Deinde cura illud cum unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then care for that with the nail-oil, until it is healed.
Si autem corruptio iam imprimit in os, tunc oportet ut incidas illud os, et extrahas ipsum: non enim sanatur unquam dum permanet in eo os corruptum.	But if the corruption has already imprinted itself into the mouth, then you should cut away that mouth, and take it out: for it is not healed at all while it remains in it.
Quod si uides corrosionem et corruptionem incedere in digitum, tunc incide eum in uno nodorum, secundum quod praemissa est eius rememoratio.	If you see that the corruption and ulcer are running down the finger, then cut it off at one of its ends, according to what has been said above in regard to the reminder.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then care for the wound, until it is healed.
Si autem accidat ungui attritio, aut percussio: et contingit in ea dolor uehemens, tunc oportet ut phlebotomes infirmum in primis.	But if a nail is broken or struck: and there is sharp pain with it, then you should take away the blood first.
Deinde seca unguem cum Spatumili acuto sectione transuersa de sursum ad uisum.	Then dry the nail with a sharp spatula, cutting across from top to bottom.
Et custodi, ne sectio perueniat ad carnem quae est sub ungue, nam tu facies accidere per illud super infirmum dolorem uehementem, et erit caussa ad natiuitatem carnis additae in loco.	And be careful so that the cut does not go down to the flesh that is under the nail, for then you will cause a very painful sore to arise, and it will be a reason for the birth of flesh in that place.
Deinde cura locum cum eo quod sedat dolores.	Then care for the place with the same ointment that soothes pain.
Digitus uero additus qui nascitur in quibusdam manibus hominum, fortasse est carnosus totus: et fortasse sunt in quibusdam eorum ossa, et fortasse est in eo unguis: et quidam eorum nascitur in radice iuncturae, aut est natiuitas eius in quibusdam nodis digiti.	The finger that is added which is born in some hands of men, perhaps is fleshly all over; and perhaps there are bones in it, and perhaps a nail is born in it: and perhaps its birth is in the root of the joint, or its birth is in some nods of the finger.
Ille ergo qui nascitur in quibusdam nodis digiti, non mouetur: et ille qui nascitur apud iuncturam digiti, fortasse mouetur.	So then who is born in some nods of the finger does not move; and who is born next to a joint of the finger, perhaps moves.
Eius ergo qui ex eis est carnosus, sectio eius facilis est.	But of that which is fleshly there is an easy way to cut it.
Quod est, ut incidas ipsum apud radicem suam cum Spatumili lato.	That is, so that you strike yourself at the root with a sharp spatula.
Eius autem cuius natiuitas est in radice iuncturae curatio, est difficilis.	But of that which its birth is in the root of the joint, there is a difficult treatment.
Abstine ergo ab incisione eius.	So then abstain from cutting it.
In illo uero qui nascitur in digito apud ultimum nodorum, tunc oportet ut incidas in primis carnem eius incisione rotunda usque ad os.	But in that which is born in the finger up to the very nods, then it is necessary so that you strike the first flesh of its round incision all the way to the mouth.
Deinde serra os cum una illarum Serrarum conuenientium ad illud.	Then tighten the mouth with one of those sharp things that are suitable for it.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then care for the flesh so that it heals.
Consolidatio autem quae accidit digitis adinuicem, multotiens accidit aut ex natiuitate hominis, id est, nascitur cum eo, aut a consolidatione uulneris, aut combustione ignis, et similibus.	But the healing that happens to fingers from one side to another, often happens because it is born with man, that is, it is born with him; or from the healing of a wound, or from burning of fire, and similar things.
Oportet ergo ut seces illam consolidationem, donec redeant digiti secundum formam suam naturalem.	So then let there be separation of that healing so that fingers grow back to their natural form.
Deinde pone inter eos licinia, aut pannos infusos in oleo rosato: ut non consolidentur uelociter, et separa inter eos: aut pone inter eos laminam plumbi subtilem, donec consolidetur locus secundum quod oportet.	Then place between them a leather strip, or rags soaked in rose oil: so that they do not quickly come together and separate them: or place between them a thin lead strip, so that the place heals as it should.
Et similiter si accidat consolidatio quibusdam digitis cum palma, tunc seca illam consolidationem, secundum quod praeparatur et conuenit figurae membri.	And likewise if some fingers with the palm are consolidated, then dry out that consolidation, according to how it is prepared and suits the figure of the member.
¶ De incisione Vitium.	¶ On Incision.
Caput XCII.	Chapter LII.
Uites sunt Venae inuolutae, grossae, plenae superfluitatibus melancholicis quae accidunt in pluribus membris corporis: et plurimum euentus earum est in cruribus, praecipue in cruribus iter agentium et laborantium, et portantium.	Wounds are veins that are swollen, thick, and full of melancholic excesses which occur in many parts of the body; and most of them are found in the legs, especially in those who walk a lot or work hard, and those who carry heavy loads.
Oportet ergo ut administres excussionem corporis ex cholera nigra aliquotiens excussione forti.	Therefore, you should provide for the discharge of the body from black cholera by a strong expiration sometimes.
Deinde phlebotoma patientis eas basilicam.	Then take blood from the patient with a large blade.
Curatio uero earum cum ferro, est secundum duos modos.	The treatment of these wounds with iron is according to two methods.
Vnus eorum est, ut secentur, et extrahatur sanguis niger.	One is that they sit and black blood is drawn from them.
Et modus alter est, ut eleuetur Vena, et extrahatur tota.	And the other method is that a vein is lifted and all of it is drawn out.
Sectio uero eius est secundum hunc modum.	But the sectioning thereof is according to this manner.
Embroca crus in primis cum aqua calida multum, donec resoluatur sanguis grossus faeculentus.	Wrap the leg first with warm water until the thick, foul blood resolves.
Deinde stringe crus infirmi a superiori parte coxae eius, usque ad inferiorem partem genu cum uitta.	Then tie the leg of the patient by an nurse from the upper part of the thigh up to the lower part of the knee with a string.
Deinde seca uenam in loco uno, aut duobus, aut tribus sectione ampla.	Then dry a vein in one place, or two, or three wide sections.
Deinde eleua, id est, extrahe sanguinem in manu tua ab inferiori parte cruris, usque ad sursum, et a superiori oportet ut phlebotomes infirmum in primis.	Then draw blood from the lower part of the leg up to the top and at the top it should be that the phlebotomist draws blood from the patient first.
Deinde seca unguem cum usque inferius: donec egrediatur ex sanguine quantitas quam uides sufficere, et quam tolerat uirtus infirmi.	Then dry the nail down to the tip: until it exits with an amount of blood that you see sufficient to meet its strength and endurance.
Postea liga eam: et praecipe ei, ut abstineat a cibis generantibus choleram nigram: et itera euacuationem et phlebotomiam, quando implentur Venae, et nocet illud infirmo.	Then tie it up: and command him not to abstain from foods that cause black cholera: and repeatedly draw blood and bleed when the veins are filled, and let the patient suffer.
Eleuatio autem eius est secundum hunc modum.	But the lifting thereof is according to this manner.
Rade crus infirmi, si in ea sunt pili multi.	Cut the leg of the patient if there are many hairs.
Deinde intromitte ipsum in balneum: aut embroca ipsum in crure eius cum aqua calida, donec rubeat, et exuberentur Venae: aut exercitetur exercitio forti, si non est ei praesens balneum, donec calefiat membrum.	Then introduce yourself into the bath; or apply a warm damp cloth to his leg, until it turns red and the veins swell; or exercise him strongly, if there is no bath present, until the limb warms up.
Deinde seca cutem in directo uenae sectione per longitudinem: aut in ultimo eius apud genu, aut in inferiori parte eius apud calcaneum.	Then dry the skin with a towel along the course of the vein; or at the heel of his leg, or at the lower part near the heel.
Deinde aperi cutem cum uncinis, et excoria uenam ab omni parte, donec appareat sensui: et est apud apparitionem eius, quod uides eam rubeam ad nigredinem decliuem.	Then open the skin with a hook, and scrape the vein from all sides until you feel it; and at its appearance, that is when you see it turn red from black to white.
Cum ergo uadit ex cute, uides eam albam quasi sit chorda.	When therefore you remove the skin, you will see it white as a string.
Deinde intromitte sub ea Radium, donec quando eleuatur et egreditur de cute: suspende eam cum uncino caeco, leni.	Then introduce underneath it the hook with a blunt point, until it comes out and leaves the skin; hang it by the blade of the hook, soft.
Deinde seca sectionem aliam prope illam sectionem tribus digitis.	Then dry another piece of skin next to that piece of skin with three fingers.
Deinde excoria cutem a superiori parte uenae, donec appareat.	Then scrape the skin from the upper part of the vein, until it appears.
Deinde eleua eam cum Radiis sicut fecisti, et suspende eam cum uncino alio, sicut fecisti in primis.	Then rub it with rays as you did before, and hang it by another hook as you did at first.
Deinde seca sectionem aliam, aut sectiones plures, si indiges illo.	Then dry another piece of skin, or more pieces if you can endure it.
Deinde eleua, et incide ipsam ultima sectione apud calcaneum.	Then rub it and cut it at the heel.
Deinde extrahe eam ad sectionem quae est supra eam.	Then pull it out to the piece that is above it.
Et fac illud, donec extrahas eam ex sectione quae est superior, uel altior sectionibus omnibus, donec quando egreditur tota: tunc incide eam.	And do this, until you pull it out from the upper part; or higher parts of the skin, until it comes out all the way; then cut it.
Si autem non obedit tibi ad extrahendum, et eleuandum: tunc intromitte acum cum filo forti duplo, et liga eam, et extrahe ipsam: aut intromitte sub ea Radium: et reuolue manum tuam ad omnem partem, donec egrediatur.	If, however, it does not obey you in being pulled out and rubbed: then introduce a sharp wire into it, bind it, and pull it out; or introduce a hook underneath it: and rotate your hand around all its parts, until it comes out all the way.
Et caue, ne incidatur.	Then caustice, lest it cut.
Nam si incidatur, fit difficile tibi eleuare eam ualde, et ingreditur super infirmum ex ea nocumentum.	For if it cuts, it will be difficult for you to rub it well; and introduce yourself into the wound with a needle.
Cum ergo extraxeris eam totam: tunc pone super locum uulnerum lanam submersam in uino et oleo rosato, aut oleo: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	So when you have drawn it all out: then place it on the wound, soaked with wine and oil, or just oil, and care for it, until it is healed.
Quod si Vitis est contracta, habens tortuositatem cui sit inuolutio ad partes, et non est sicut diximus secundum rectitudinem: tunc oportet ut findas super eam ad omnem partem tortuositatis eius, et loca inuolutionis ipsius.	If the vine is contracted, and has twists to it which require stretching out towards the ends, and is not like what we have said according to its straightness: then you must find out over it to all parts of its twisting, and the places of its stretching out.
Deinde suspende eam cum uncinis, donec eleues eam totam: et caue apud sectionem tuam super eam ne incidas uenam, aut uulneres: nam difficile fiet super te eleuare, uel extrahere eam.	Then hang it up with hooks until you have completely stretched it out: and be careful when you cut your piece above it so that you do not hit a vein, or wound: for it would be difficult to stretch it out over you, or to draw it out.
Conserua ergo prudentiam tuam.	Therefore preserve your wits.
Forma Incidentis quo sanatur Vitis.	The shape of the incision when the vine is healed.
Forma Vncini caeci.	The shape of the incision when the vine is blind.
Non est ei curuitas sicut reliquis Vncinis, neque est acutae extremitatis, ut non uulneret uenam: et est grossae flectuositatis, lenis: quoniam si esset subtilis, incideret uenam subtilitate sua: imo sit ei superflua grossitudo, sicut diximus.	It is not a gentle curve like the rest of the vine, and it does not have a sharp extreme, so that it does not hurt the skin: and it has a coarse flexibility, soft: for if it were thin, it would bump into the skin with its thinness: but its coarse flexibility makes it suitable, as we have said.
De extractione Venae cruris.	Of the extraction of a vein from the leg.
Caput XCIII.	Head 83.
Haec Vena generatur in cruribus in terris calidis, sicut Alizegi, et terra Arabum, et in terris aridis, calidis, paucae teneritatis, id est, in quibus non nascitur herba, neque arbor.	This vein is born in the legs in warm countries, like the alnet, and the land of the Arabs, and in arid, warm lands, scarce of tenderness, that is, where no grass grows, nor trees.
Et fortasse generatur in locis aliis corporis praeter crura.	And perhaps it is born in other parts of the body besides the legs.
Et generatio quidem eius est a putrefactione quae accidit sub cute, sicut accidunt intra corpora serpentes et uermes ascarides, et uermes generati inter cutem et carnem.	And its generation is from decay which happens under the skin, like what happens inside the bodies of snakes and worms, and worms are generated between the skin and flesh.
Et signum incaeptionis euentus huius Venae est, quod accidit in crure inflammatio uehemens.	And the sign of the beginning of this vein is that which happens in the leg: there is a violent inflammation.
Deinde uesicatur locus.	Then the spot becomes sore.
Deinde incipit Vena exire ex loco illius uesicationis, quasi sit radix plantae, aut animal.	Then the vein begins to come out from the spot of its sore, like a root of a plant, or an animal.
Cum ergo apparet ex ea extremitas eius, tunc oportet ut inuoluas super ipsam frustum plumbi, cuius pondus sit ex drachma keil, usque ad drachmas II et noda ipsam: et dimitte plumbum suspensum ex crure.	When this extreme end therefore appears from her, then you should fasten a lead screw on it, the weight of which is from a drachm to two drachms and a mark; and let go the lead that is suspended in the leg.
Quotiens ergo egreditur ex ea aliquid ad exteriora, inuolue illud in plumbo, et noda illud.	Whenever anything therefore comes out of her to the outside, fasten it in lead, and mark it.
Quod si prolongatur multum, tunc incide partem eius, et inuolue residuum.	That if it is prolonged for a long time, then cut off a part of it, and fasten the remainder.
Et non incidas eam radicitus antequam egrediatur tota.	And do not cut her off by the roots before she has come out all at once.
Quoniam si incidis, contrahitur, et ingreditur in carnem: et facit accidere apostema, et putredinem in loco, et ulcus malum.	For if you should cut it, it will contract, and go into the flesh; and it will cause a boil, and decay in the place, and a sore wound.
Quapropter oportet, ut suauiter tractetur, et extrahatur paulatim, donec egrediatur ex ultimo sui, et non remaneat ex ea aliquid in corpore: et ex hac quidem Vena egreditur in quibusdam hominibus quod est in longitudine sua quinque palmorum et decem.	Therefore it should be handled gently, and taken out little by little, until it has come out from the last of its own; and nothing remains in the body from it: and from this vein comes out in some men who are five palms long and ten fingers wide.
Et iam peruenit ad me, quia exiuit uiro ex XX palmis.	And already has come to me, for she has brought forth a son from twenty palms.
Si autem inciditur tibi in hora medicationis tuae: tunc intromitte radium in foramine eius, et perfora eam foramine longo, cum corpore, donec euacuetur totum quod est in ea ex materia: et administra putrefactionem loci cum medicinis diebus aliquot.	If however you should cut yourself in the time of your treatment: then drive in a lead screw into the hole, and pierce her through the length, with the body, until all that is in her comes out from that matter; and administer decay to the place with medicines for several days.
Deinde cura ipsum curatione apostematum.	Then take care of this cure for boils.
Et haec quidem Vena quandoque habet ramos multos, praecipue quando apparet in iunctura pedis, aut in pede ipso: et accidunt ei orificia multa, et egreditur ex omni orificio ramus.	And this vein sometimes has many branches, especially when it appears in the ankle of the foot, or in the foot itself: and it has many openings, and comes out from every opening a branch.
Cura ergo ipsam, sicut diximus in diuisione, et cum eo quod praemissum est.	Take care therefore for this cure, as we have said in the division, and with what follows that which has been mentioned.
¶ De sectione super Vermes generatos sub cute, et dicitur Aegritudo bouina.	Regarding the section on worms that are generated under the skin, and it is called Boona Disease.
Caput XCIIII.	Chapter 82
Haec Aegritudo nominatur in quadam terra apud nos Aegritudo bouina: propterea, quia multotiens accidit bouibus, et est uermis paruus unus, qui nascitur inter cutem et carnem.	This Disease is called in some country Bouina Disease; because it often happens to the worms, and it is a scaly one-sided skin: it is born between the skin and flesh.
Et uadit in corpore toto, ascendendo et descendendo: et ostenditur sensui apud ambulationem eius de membro ad membrum, donec disrumpit ubicumque disrumpit in cute locum, et egreditur.	And he felt all over the body, ascending and descending; and his sense was shown to him by his walking with a member from one part of the body to another, until he stopped wherever he should stop on the skin, and left it.
Et generatio eius est ex putredine quorundam humorum.	And his progeny is from the decay of some of the humors.
Sicut accidunt uermes et serpentes, id est, lumbrici, et ascarides in uentre.	As happen worms and snakes, that is, lombrics and roundworms in the belly.
Et timetur ex malicia eius.	And they fear his wickedness.
Quia quando ipse uadit in corpore, et eleuatur ad caput, et peruenit ad locum: tunc fortasse aperit in eo, et egreditur, et destruit oculum: et accidit illud multotiens.	For when he himself felt all over the body and went up to the head and came to a place: then perhaps it opens within him and leaves, and destroys his eye: and this happens many times.
Cum ergo uis curare eum, et extrahere ipsum, tunc non fit illud nisi apud ambulationem eius, et apparitionem ipsius sensui.	But when you are to treat him, and take him out, then it is not done except by his walking and showing of his sense.
Oportet ergo, ut stringas quod est supra eum, et quod est sub eo cum ligamento constrictione forti.	Therefore, it should be that you hold back what is above him, and what is under him with strong constriction by a ligament.
Deinde seca super ipsum, et extrahe eum.	Then dry up on top of him, and take him out.
Quod si profundatur in carne, et non inuenis ipsum: tunc pone super locum cauterium cum igne, donec moriatur.	That if it penetrates into the flesh, and not into his body: then put on the place a caustic with fire, until he dies.
Et maius quod timetur, est corruptio eius, qua corrumpit oculum, sicut diximus.	And greater than that which is feared, is his decay, which corrupts the eye, as we have said.
Si autem uides eum iam peruenisse in capite prope oculum, tunc stringe sub eo supercilium strictura bona.	But if you see him already coming to a head near the eye, then tie under him a good superciliary constriction.
Deinde seca super ipsum, et extrahe eum.	Then dry up on top of him, and take him out.
Et oportet ut utatur infirmus mundificatione sui corporis, cum medicinis soluentibus humores putridos malos.	And it should be that the sick one uses his own body purification, with physicians dissolving bad putrid humors.
Et caueat sibi a cibis generantibus putrefactionem.	And let him guard himself from foods that generate decay.
¶ De sectione super aegritudinem Nakir.	On the division above infirmity of Nakir.
Caput XCV.	Head 105.
Haec aegritudo nominatur in terra nostra Nakir: et est dolor qui accidit in quibusdam membris: deinde permutatur de membro ad membrum.	This infirmity is called in our land Nakir, and it is a pain that happens in some member; then it changes from one part of the body to another.
Et ego quidem iam uidi ipsum, secundum quod narro tibi.	And I myself have already seen him, according as I tell you.
Vocatus sum ad mulierem infirmam in quibusdam uillis.	I have been called to attend a sick woman in some trouble.
Et detexit brachium suum, et uidi inflationem paruam in uena funis brachii.	And he felt the arm and saw the swelling of the lung in the rope of the forearm.
Et postquam remansi hora una, uidi unam inflationem incedere cum focili, sicut incedit uermis, ascendendo ad humerum eius uelocius quam esse potest: ut sit sicut argentum uiuum, quando currit de loco ad locum.	And after a while I saw one swelling rise with a feverish heat as if it were a wound, going up to his shoulder faster than he could run: so that it looked like silver running from place to place.
Recessit ergo dolor ex illo loco, et fixus est in humero.	So the pain left that spot and was fixed in the shoulder.
Deinde sedi hora una, et cucurrit in reliquum corpus, donec perueniret in brachium aliud.	Then he sat for a while, and then he ran all over his body until he reached the other arm.
Deinde narrauit mihi, quia reuoluebatur in toto corpore suo, secundum quod uidi.	Then he told me that he was shaking all over his body, according to which I saw it.
Miratus sum ergo de uelocitate permutationis eius de membro ad membrum.	So I was amazed at the speed with which he moved from one limb to another.
Et ego quidem ante illud non uideram hanc aegritudinem oculis meis taliter secundum hunc modum.	And I too had not seen this illness with my eyes before, moving in such a way.
Verumtamen uidi multos, qui inueniunt dolorem permutari de membro ad membrum: et non uidi ipsum oculis, sicut uidi eum in muliere.	However, I saw many who suffered from one limb to another: and I did not see him with my eyes as I saw it in the woman.
Et ego non cogito illud esse, nisi quod est propterea, quod mulier fuit ex illis qui sunt ex uillis sicci corporis detectarum uenarum: hinc ergo apparet sensui illa uentositas permutata.	And I do not think that was because it is so, that he was from those who are afflicted with dry gangrene of the skin: hence this seems to indicate the windiness that is moved.
Et est necesse, ut non appareant secundum hanc rationem in illis qui sunt deliciosi, et corporibus humidis, occultarum uenarum.	And it is necessary so that it does not appear in this way in those who are delicate and have moist bodies, hidden gangrene.
Cum ergo uis curationem eius, et sentit patiens illud dolorem: tunc si est apparens tibi oculo, sicut diximus, tunc stringe supra ipsum, et sub ipso uelociter: et seca supra ipsum, donec egrediatur illa uentositas coartata: et cauteriza locum.	Then when you are treating his cure and the patient feels pain: then if it appears to you with your eye as we have said, then tie him down tightly on top of it and quickly dry him off under it until this windiness is driven away: and burn the spot.
Si autem non uides ipsum oculis tuis: tunc cura ipsum cum excussione corporis, et cum eo quod expellit uentositates, et carminat eas cum pillulis foetidis, et pillulis de serapino, et similibus.	But if you do not see the spot with your eyes: then take care of the body with the scrubbing and with it driving out the windiness, and dyeing them red with bitter herbs, and with herbs of serapina, and others similar to these.
¶ De extractione Sagittarum.	On the extraction of arrows.
Caput XCVI.	Chapter LVI. On the extraction of arrows.
Sagittae diuersificantur secundum species suas, et secundum loca in quibus cadunt ex corpore.	Arrows differ according to their kind and the places in which they enter the body.
Earum uero diuersitas est: quoniam ex eis sunt quae habent cuspides magnos, et paruos: et concauae, et surdae.	Indeed there is a difference between them, since some have large points, and some small; and some are curved, and some straight.
Et ex eis sunt quae habent tres angulos.	And of these there are three-angled ones.
Et ex eis quibus sunt linguae.	And of these there are language arrows.
Et ex eis quibus sunt astellae.	And of these there are tethers.
Illae uero quae sunt secundum membra in quibus cadunt, est secundum duos modos.	Indeed the ones that enter the limbs fall according to two modes.
Aut enim membra sunt ex membris principalibus concauis, sicut cerebrum, et cor, et epar, et pulmo, et renes, et intestina, et uesica, et eis similia.	Or if they enter the principal limbs, such as the brain, and heart, and liver, and lung, and kidneys, and intestines, and bladder, and those like them.
Quando ergo cadit in aliquo horum membrorum, et apparent tibi signa mortis, quae ego narro tibi post, tunc oportet ut deuites extractionem illius sagittae ex eis, nam mors consequitur illum in quo est, in pluribus dispositionibus.	When therefore it falls into one of these limbs, and you see signs of death, which I will describe to you afterwards, then you should extract the arrow from it, for death follows it in many dispositions.
Et quando non apparent tibi ista signa mala, et sagitta non est absconsa in profunditate membri, tunc extrahe ipsam, et cura uulnus.	And when you do not see these bad signs, and the arrow does not appear to be embedded deeply in the limb, then you should extract it, and take care of the wound.
Ex signis enim cerebri quando cadit in eo sagitta, et penetrat os, et egreditur siphac quod est super cerebrum, est: quoniam accidunt ex illo soda uehemens, et scotomia, et uertigo, et rubedo in oculis, et inflatio, et rubedo linguae, et spasmus, et permixtio intellectus, et uomitus cholerae.	For when the arrow falls into the brain and penetrates the skull and exits through a sinus that is above the brain, it causes a violent fever, and opacities in the eyes, swelling, dizziness, redness of the eyes, blushing, spasms, confusion of thought, and loss of memory, and cholera.
Et fortasse egreditur sanguis ex naribus, aut auribus.	And perhaps it will exit blood from the nose, or ears.
Et fortasse abscinditur sermo, et destruitur uox.	And perhaps speech is severed, and language is destroyed.
Et egreditur ex loco uulneris humiditas alba similis pulti.	And it will exit from the wound a white moisture similar to spittle.
Et exit ex eo simile aquositati carnis.	And it will exit from it a liquid-like meat.
Si ergo apparent tibi ista signa, tunc abstine a curatione, et extrahe sagittam si non egreditur.	If you see these signs, then refrain from treatment, and extract the arrow if it has not already exited.
Signa autem sagittae quando cadit in corde, sunt: quod ipsa est prope mammillam sinistram: et sentit cum ea quasi ipsa sit fixa in re dura, non in re uacua.	The signs of an arrow that falls into the heart are: it is close to the left nipple; and feels as if it were fixed in a hard object, not in a soft one.
Et fortasse sagittae est motus similis motui pulsus: et currit ex uulnere sanguis niger.	And the arrows move in a way similar to the pulsation; and black blood runs from the ulnar bone.
Et sequitur illud frigus extremitatum, et sudor frigidus, et syncopis.	And then follows the cold of the extremities, and cold sweat, and fainting.
Scias ergo, quod mors descendit procul dubio.	So know that death has come near.
Et signum sagittae quando uulnerat pulmonem, est exitus sanguinis spumosi ex uulnere: et uasa quae sequuntur collum, apostematur, et mutatur color infirmi.	And when the arrow hits the lung, there is a spray of dark blood from the ulnar bone; and the veins that run along the neck, turn pale, and change color in the nurse's hands.
Et expirat spiritum magnum, altum: et quaerit attractionem aeris frigidi.	And he breathes out great breath, deep; and seeks the coolness of air.
Quod si cadat sagitta in uelamen, quod est in pectore: tunc est prope costas paruas: et fit anhelitus magnus cum dolore uehementi, cum suspirio: et mouentur omnia membra humerorum.	That if the arrow falls into a hole, which is in the chest: then it is near the back for a few inches; and it causes great pain with a sharp ache, with a sigh: and all the arms of the shoulders move.
Et si cadat sagitta in stomachum, tunc fortasse egreditur ex uulnere ex cibo aliquid indigestum.	And if the arrow falls into the stomach, then it is likely that something undigested has come out of the ulnar bone from food.
Et si cadit sagitta in Ventrem, et figitur in eo: egreditur aliquid stercoris ex uulnere, aut zirbum, aut intestinum quod iam disruptum est.	And if the arrow falls into the stomach and remains there: then something like dung comes out of the ulnar bone, or a knuckle, or an intestine that has already been broken.
Non est ergo spes in curatione eius, neque in extractione sagittae.	So there is no hope for his cure, nor for the extraction of the arrow.
Quod si sagitta cadat in Vesicam, et egrediatur urina: et procedit ex ea aliquid ad exteriora, et fortior sit dolor super infirmum: tunc scias, quia est mortale.	That if the arrow falls into the bladder and comes out as urine: and it proceeds from it something that goes outside, and the pain is stronger on the sick person: then know that it is fatal.
Reliqua autem membra, sicut facies, et collum, et guttur, et spatula, et adiutorium, et spondiles dorsi, et furcula, et coxa, et crus, et eis similia ex membris saluantur secundum plures dispositiones: quando non inuenit sagitta arteriam, aut neruum: et non est sagitta uenenosa.	The rest of the limbs, such as the face, and the neck, and the tongue, and the spatula, and the aid, and the spine, and the fork, and the hip, and the leg, and those similar to the limbs are healed according to many dispositions: but if the arrow does not hit an artery or a nerve; and there is no deadly arrow.
Et ego narro tibi quod uidi de esse harum sagittarum, ut significes per illud super curationem tuam.	And I tell you what I saw of these arrows, that you may understand with regard to your own cure.
Quod est, quia cuidam uiro cecidit sagitta in lachrymali oculi eius, in radice nasi.	That is, for a certain man, an arrow fell into his eye, into the lacrimal eye, at the root of his nose.
Extraxi ergo eam ipsi ex parte altera, sub adipe auris eius: et sanatus est, et non accidit ei in oculo eius nocumentum.	Therefore I removed it from him on one side, below the fat of his ear; and he was healed, and there was no injury to his eye.
Et extraxi sagittam aliam Iudaeo, quae cecidit ei in adipe oculi sui sub palpebra inferiori: et sagitta iam occultata erat, et non consecutus sum ex ea nisi extremitatem paruam eius, cum qua adhaeret in ligno suo: et erat sagitta magna ex sagittis arcuum Turcorum, cum ferro leni, in qua non sunt aures.	And I took out another arrow from the Jew, which had fallen to him in the fat of his eye below his lower eyelid; and the arrow was already hidden, and I did not succeed in taking it out except for its end, which touched his skin, having been wedged in his wood: and this was a great arrow of Turkish arrows, with a soft iron, in which the ears are not.
Sanatus est ergo Iudaeus, et non accidit in oculo eius accidens malum.	So the Jew was healed, and there was no harm to his eye.
Et extraxi sagittam aliam ex gutture Christiani.	And I took out another arrow from the throat of a Christian.
Et erat sagitta arabica, et est illa cui sunt aures.	And this was an Arabic arrow, and it had ears.
Secui ergo super ipsam inter duas guidegi: et iam submersa erat in gutture eius.	So I followed up on top of him between two teeth: and it was already submerged in his throat.
Subtiliatus sum ergo cum ea, donec extraxi eam: et sanatus est Christianus.	I was delicate when I took it out, until I took it out: and the Christian was healed.
Et extraxi sagittam aliam uiro quae ceciderat in uentre eius: et cogitauimus, quia moreretur ex ea.	And I took out another arrow from a man which had fallen to him in his belly; and we thought that he would die from it.
Postquam ergo praeterierunt ei triginta dies, et non mutatum est super eum aliquid ex dispositionibus eius, secui super sagittam: et ingeniaui super eam, et extraxi eam: et sanatus est, et non accidit ei accidens malum.	Then after forty days I passed on behind him, and there was nothing changed in his appearance from his habits, so I followed up the arrow; and I carefully considered it over, and took it out: and he was healed, and there was no harm to him.
Et uidi uirum cui cecidit sagitta in dorso eius, et consolidatum est uulnus super eam.	And I saw a man to whom the arrow had fallen on his back, and a piece of wood had been set over it.
Postquam ergo fuit post septem annos, exiuit sagitta in radice coxae eius.	Then after seven years the arrow came out at the root of his thigh.
Et uidi mulierem cui cecidit in uentre suo sagitta, et consolidatum est uulnus super eam, et remansit sagitta intra ipsam: et non mutata est ex dispositionibus eius aliqua, et mulier non inuenit ei nocumentum in aliqua ex operationibus suis naturalibus.	And I saw a woman to whom an arrow had fallen into her belly, and a piece of wood had been set over it, and the arrow remained within her; and she did not change from her habits in anything, and the woman did not find any harm in him from his natural operations.
Et uidi uirum alium, cui cecidit sagitta in facie sua: et consolidatum est uulnus, et remansit, non inueniens ei multum dolorem: et similia istis multa.	And I saw another man to whom an arrow had fallen on his face; and a piece of wood had been set over it, and it remained, not finding much pain in him: and there were many similar things like this.
Et extraxi sagittam uiro ex principibus Regis, quae ceciderat ei in medio nasi sui, et iam declinauerat ad partem dextram parumper: et occultata erat sagitta tota.	I extracted a arrow from the king's face, which had fallen on his middle nose, and had already inclined towards the right side by about as much: and the whole arrow was hidden.
Vocatus sum ergo ad curationem eius post casum sagittae usque ad tres dies.	So I was called to cure him after the arrow fell for three days.
Inueni ergo uulnus sagittae strictum ualde.	Then I found a sturdy arrow shaft.
Inquisiui ergo eam cum tenta subtili, et non sensi eam: et ipse quidem inueniebat punctionem et dolorem sub aure sua ex parte dextra.	So I examined it with a careful touch, and did not feel it out: and he himself felt the prick and pain on his right side.
Speraui ergo, quod erat illa punctio ex extremitate sagittae.	I hoped that was a prick from the end of the arrow.
Emplastraui ergo locum cum emplastro in quo erat uirtus attractiua, et digestiua, confidens apud me, quod apostemaretur locus, et appareret mihi signum sagittae, ut secarem super eam: et non accidit in loco accidens significans quod sagitta consecuta sit locum.	I plastered over the place with a plaster that attracts and draws on its strength, and assured myself, that if the place were to heal up, I would show you a sign of the arrow, so that I might cut off what followed it: and no such accident happened, meaning that the arrow had gone straight.
Assiduaui ergo cum emplastro super eum diebus multis: et non accidit accidens, et consolidatum est uulnus interim: et remansit infirmus de extractione eius spacio dierum, donec sensit sagittam die quodam intra nasum suum.	I applied the plaster over it for many days: and no accident happened, and the bone was consolidated in between: and he remained weak because of having had the arrow extracted from him for a space of days, until one day he felt the arrow within his nose.
Et narrauit mihi illud.	And he told me about that.
Posui ergo super illud uulnus medicinam acutam, corrosiuam diebus multis, donec apertum est: et cum tenta tentaui ipsum, et sensi extremitatem sagittae subtilem quae adhaeret in ligno.	So I put on the bone an acute medicine, which I kept for many days, until it was open: and when I examined him, I felt a slight bump of the arrow that clung to the wood.
Deinde addidi in apertione uulneris per illam medicinam acutam, donec apparuit nobis uisibiliter extremitas sagittae: et praeteriit mihi cum eo spacium temporis circiter quatuor menses.	Then I added to the opening of the wound with that acute medicine, until we could see clearly the end of the arrow: and there passed away from me with that space of time about four months.
Deinde postquam amplificatum est uulnus, et possible fuit mihi intromittere forcipes in ipsam, et mouere ipsam, et non obediuit ad exitum: tunc non cessaui subtiliare, et ingeniare super eam cum modis ingeniorum, donec coepi super eam die quodam cum forcipibus decenter factis, secundum quod ueniet forma eorum in fine capituli, donec extraxi eam.	Then after the bone had grown bigger, and might possibly have been inserted into it with a fork, and moved it back and forth: then I did not cease to be careful, and devised ways for it, until one day I came upon it with a pair of forks made shorter, according to which their form became at the end of the chapter, so that I extracted it.
Deinde restauraui uulnus.	Then I healed the fracture.
Et medici quidem iudicant, quod cartilago nasi non restauratur.	And the doctors say that if the nasal cartilage is not restored, the nose will be disfigured.
Restauraui ergo ipsam, et consolidatum est uulnus, et sanatus est infirmas sanitate integra: nec nocuit ei aliquid omnino.	I then restored it, and the fracture was consolidated, and the broken part was healed with complete health: nor did it cause him any harm at all.
Et ego narro tibi qualitatem extractionis quarundam sagittarum: ut ponas illud regulam et significationem super illud quod non dixi.	And I will tell you the quality of a certain type of incision: so that you may place that rule and meaning over it, which I have not said.
Quoniam partes huius artis et distinctiones earum non comprehenduntur cum narratione: neque comprehendit illud liber, et artifex prudens comparat cum pauco super multum: et cum eo quod est paesens, super illud quod est absens: et inuenit operationem nouam, et instrumentum nouum apud descensus rerum extranearum huius artis quando accidunt.	For the parts and distinctions of this art are not contained in the telling: nor does that book contain them, and the crafty workman compares little with much: and when he describes what is present, he makes mention of what is absent: and he discovers a new operation, and a new instrument, on account of the descent of foreign things of this art when they occur.
Dico ergo, quod sagittae non egrediuntur ex membris quibus sunt fixae, nisi secundum duos modos.	I say then, that the arrows do not come out of the member from which they are fixed, except according to two ways.
Aut per attractionem ex loco ex quo intrauit.	Or by being drawn out of a place into which it entered.
Aut contrario partis alterius.	Or by being drawn on the contrary side of another part.
Et illa quae egreditur unde intrauit, aut est sagitta procedens in loco carnoso: et attrahitur, et egreditur.	And that which goes out from where it entered, or is an arrow going into flesh: and being drawn, it goes out.
Quod si non obedit ad exitum ex hora in qua cadit: tunc oportet ut dimittas ipsam aliquot diebus, donec putrefiat caro quae est in circumitu eius: et alleuietur attractio eius, et eius egressio.	That if it does not yield to the exit at the time when it falls: then you must leave it for a few days until the flesh which is around it rots: and the attraction of it will be allayed, and its exit will be eased.
Et similiter si figitur in osse, et non obedit tibi ad exitum, tunc dimitte ipsam etiam aliquot diebus: et itera eam cum attractione et motione omni die, donec egreditur.	And likewise if it is broken into a bone, and does not yield to you at the exit, then leave it for several days: and again and again with attraction and motion every day until it goes out.
Quod si non obedit tibi ad exitum post dies, tunc oportet ut perfores in circumitu sagittae in ipso osse ab omni parte cum terebro subtili, donec amplificentur sagittae.	That if it does not yield to you at the exit after several days, then you must cut around the arrow in the bone with a sharp knife, until the arrows become larger.
Deinde attrahe eam, et extrahe ipsam.	Then attract it, and take it out.
Si autem sagitta est fixa in capitis osse, et iam processit in uno uentrium cerebri, et apparent ex infirmo quaedam illorum accidentium quae dixi: tunc abstine ab attractione sagittae, et dimitte eam, donec aequetur esse eius post dies.	But if the arrow is fixed in one of the bones of the skull, and has already gone into one of the vents of the brain, and there appears to be some of the accidents I have mentioned: then abstain from attracting the arrow, and leave it until it has grown used to being after several days.
Nam si sagitta peruenit ad sifach, tunc mors non prolongatur ei.	If the arrow has struck the liver, then death should not be prolonged for him.
Et si sagitta non est fixa, nisi in corpore ossis tantum, et non penetrat usque ad sifach: et remanet infirmus aliquot diebus, et non accidit ei ex illis accidentibus aliquid: tunc ingenia in attractione sagittae et extractione eius.	If the arrow has not become fixed, but remains only in the body of bone and does not penetrate as far as the liver: and he remains weak for several days, and nothing happens to him from these injuries: then the skill lies in attracting the arrow and extracting it.
Si autem est fixa ualde, et non obedit tibi ad attractionem: tunc administra terebella in circumitu sagittae, sicut narraui tibl: deinde cura locum, donec sanetur.	But if it is very fixed, and does not submit to you for attraction: then administer lead weights around the arrow, as I told you: then take care of the place until it heals.
Si autem Sagitta iam absconsa est in loco corporis, et occultatur et absconditur a sensu: tunc inquire eam cum tenta.	But if the arrow is now buried deep in the body, and hidden and concealed from sensation: then feel for it with your hand.
Si autem sentis eam, tunc attrahe eam cum quibusdam instrumentis quae conueniunt attractioni eius.	But if you feel it, then attract it with some instruments suitable for attracting it.
Si autem non potes super eam, propter constrictionem uulneris, et propter longitudinem sagittae in profundo: et non est illic os, neque neruus, neque uena: tunc finde super eam, donec amplificetur uulnus, et sit possibile extrahere sagittam.	But if you cannot bring it to the surface because of the constriction of the wound, and because of the length of the arrow deep inside: and there is no bone, nerve, or vessel there: then look for it until the limb becomes bigger, and it becomes possible to extract the arrow.
Quod si sunt ei aures quibus teneatur, tunc libera carnem fixam in eis ab omni parte, omni ingenio quo potes illud, et ingenia, si non potest super euasionem carnis in fractura aurium, et contorsione earum, donec euadat.	That if they are ears which it holds fast, then free the flesh that is fixed to them on all sides, with all the skill you can muster, and the skill of others also: but if it cannot be brought to bear on the ears, or their distortion, until he is healed.
Et tu quando administras extractionem Sagittae, in quocumque loco est, tunc utere contorsione manus tuae, cum forficibus ad partes omnes, donec facias eam euadere: et subtilia ultima subtilitate, ut non frangatur Sagita, et fiat difficilis tibi attractio eius, et ipsius extractio.	And you, when you perform the extraction of the arrow, wherever it is, then use your twisted hands with forceps to all parts, until you make it bleed: and the smallest detail, so that the arrow does not break, and it becomes difficult for you to attract it, and to extract it.
Quod si non potes super eam ex hora una, tunc dimitte eam diebus aliquot, donec putrefiant quae sunt in circumitu eius.	That if you cannot bring it out all at once, then leave it for a few days, until what is around it begins to rot.
Deinde itera eam: alleuietur enim tuncia Si uero contrarietatem tibi facit fluxus sanguinis, tunc administra quod diximus ex curatione in capitulo suo: et custodi uirtutem tuam ab incisione uenae, aut nerui, aut chordae.	Then repeat the extraction: for surely bandages ease pain: but if you feel opposition from the flow of blood, then administer what I have said in my book on healing: and guard your skill from cutting into bone, or a nerve, or a vessel.
Et administra ingenium omni modo quo tibi possibile est euasionis Sagittae: et sit illud cum facilitate, et tranquillitate, uel tarditate, et firmitate, sicut narraui tibi.	And employ skill in every way that you can to heal the patient of the arrow wound: and let it be with ease, and quietness, or slowness, and steadfastness, as I have told you.
Et oportet, ut facias cum trahis Sagittam, ut infirmus sit secundum figuram, secundum quam fuit apud casum Sagittae in ipso.	And it is necessary that you bring the bowstring with care, so that the patient is in the shape of the arrow, according to what was at the time of the fall of the arrow on itself.
Quoniam est magis iuuatiuum.	For it is more sure.
Si autem non est tibi possibile illud, tunc administra quod tibi est possibile ex figuris.	If it is not possible for you to do this, then employ what you can out of the shapes.
Sagitta autem quae egreditur ex contrario partis alterius, aut iam procedit ex ea aliquid ad exteriora: aut facit gibbositatem extremitas Sagittae per sensum ex superiore parte cutis propinquae, et uides eam eminentem: seca ergo super eam, et sit sectio secundum quantitatem quod capiant in ea forcipes.	But the arrow which comes from the opposite side, or has already gone out a little towards the outside: or makes a protuberance on the extreme end of the arrow by sensation from the upper part of the skin nearby, and you see it sticking out: so cut off above it, and let the section be according to the quantity that they hold in it the bowstring.
Deinde attrahe eam: ipsa namque fit facilis ad exitum.	Then attract it: for it becomes easy to come out.
Si uero retinetur in osse, tunc torque manum tuam secundum rotunditatem, donec imprimat Sagitta in osse, et amplificet sibiipsi: deinde trahe ipsam.	But if it is held in the bone, then turn your hand according to the roundedness, until it presses on the arrow in the bone, and makes it more strong for itself: and then pull it out.
Et si non: dimitte eam diebus aliquot: deinde itera eam, donec egrediatur.	And if not: dismiss it with days: and then try again, until it comes out.
Quod si lignum Sagittae est in ea, tunc impelle ipsam cum eo.	That if the arrowwood is in it, then push it out with that.
Si autem cecidit lignum, et uis administrare impulsionem: tunc intromitte ad eam instrumentum concauum, ut ingrediatur concauitas eius in caudam Sagittae: deinde impelle eam cum ipso.	If it has fallen on the wood, and you are able to give a push: then introduce an instrument into it, so that the hole of it goes into the end of the arrow: and then push it out with that.
Si autem Sagita est concaua, tunc impelle eam cum instrumento intrante in ipsam.	If the arrow is closed up, then push it out with an instrument which enters into it.
Sagitta enim alleuiatur per illud.	For the arrow is made light by that.
Quod si Sagitta est toxicata, tunc oportet, ut concaues carnem totam, in qua est uenenum: si est tibi possibile illud.	That if the arrow is poisoned, then it is necessary that you should put on meat all over which is the poison: if you are able to do this.
Deinde cura eam cum eo quod conuenit ad illud.	Then take care of it with that which comes into contact with it.
Quod si Sagitta est cadens in pectore, aut in uentre, aut in uesica, aut in latere: et est propinqua ex eo quod tangis cum tenta, et possibile est tibi secare super eam: tunc seca, et caue ab incisione uenae, aut nerui, et extrahe eam.	If the arrow is lodged in the chest, or in the belly, or in the urethra, or in the side: and it is near to you because you feel pain when you press upon it, and it is possible for you to cut above it: then cut, and take care not to wound the vein, or the nerve, and draw it out.
Deinde sue uulnus, si uides, et cura illud, donec sanetur.	Then saw off the limb, if you see it, and be careful about that one, until it heals.
Et haec est forma Forcipum, quibus extrahuntur Sagittae.	And this is the form of the hooks with which arrows are drawn out.
Sint extremitates similes rostro auis, quae factae sunt sicut ferra: quando capiunt super Sagittam, non dimittunt eam.	Let them be made similar in length to the point, which are made like iron: when they grasp the arrow, they do not let go of it.
Et fiunt ex eis species multae, magnae, et paruae, et mediae, secundum quantitatem magnitudinis Sagittae, et paruitatis eius, et amplitudinis uulneris, et constrictionis eius.	And there are many kinds of them, large and small, medium, according to the quantity of the arrow, and its size, and the width of the wound, and the contraction of it.
Forma Impellentis concaui.	This is the form of the hooks for driving out an arrow.
Et forma Impellentis surdi.	And this is the form of the hooks for driving out an arrow but they are thick.
Hoc est surdae extremitatis sicut Radius, ut alleuietur introitus eius in sagittam concauam, et impellatur cum eo.	This is the end of a hook like a radium, so that it may direct its entrance into the conjoined arrow, and push with it.
Huius extremitas impellentis concauae est concaua sicut penna auis: ut alleuietur introitus sagittae in ipsam et impulsio eius.	This end of a hook for driving out an arrow is conjoined like a feather, so that it may direct its entrance into the conjoined arrow and push with it.
¶ De phlebotomia Venarum.	Regarding phlebotomy (bloodletting) from veins.
Caput XCVII.	Head 57.
Uenae phlebotomandae, quarum cucurrit consuetudo in corpore, sunt triginta.	The veins which are phlebotomized, of which custom runs in the body, are thirty.
Ex quibus in capite sunt sexdecim: duae Venae pulsatiles, quae sunt post aures, dictae duae Herbae: et duae Arteriae, quae sunt in duobus timporibus apparentes: et duae Venae quae sunt in duobus lachrymalibus duorum oculorum, quae dicuntur Aspicientes: et Vena praeparata in medio frontis: et uena quae est in extremitate nasi.	Of these in the head are sixteen: two pulsating veins, which run behind the ears, called the two herbs; and two arteries, which appear in two tempi; and two veins, which run in two nostrils of two eyes, called the two ASPECTIVE; and a vein prepared in the middle of the forehead; and a vein at the end of the nose.
Et duae Guidegi, quae sunt in collo.	And two guide-veins, which are in the neck.
Et duae uenae quae sunt in labio superiore oris.	And two veins, which are in the upper lip of the mouth.
Et duae uenae quae sunt in labio inferiore.	And two wounds that are in the lower lip.
Et istae sunt uenae quae dicuntur Algecherich.	These are wounds which are called Algecirich.
Et duae uenae quae sunt sub lingua.	And these two wounds that are beneath the tongue.
Venae autem quae phlebotomantur in brachiis, sunt quinque uenae in omni brachio.	But the veins which are phlebotomized in the arms, are five wounds in the whole arm.
Vna earum est Cephalica, et est ex latere syluestri: et nominat eam uulgus uenam capitis.	One of them is Cephalica, and it is from the lateral forest; and it is called by the common name a wound of the head.
Et Fusca.	And Fusca.
Et est Media uena, et est composita ex ramo Basilicae, et ramo Cephalicae: et nominat eam uulgus uenam corporis.	And the middle wound, and it is composed of a branch of the Basilical and a branch of the Cephalical: and it is called by the common name a wound of the body.
Et Basilica, et est posita in latere domestico: et nominatur etiam Titillicaris.	And the Basilical, which is placed on the lateral domestic: and it is also called the Titillicaris.
Et nominat eam uulgus uenam uentris.	And this one is called a wound of the leg.
Et Funis brachii, et est posita super focile: et est illa in qua phlebotomatur, et est illa quae apparet supra pollicem appatitione manifesta.	And theFunis brachii, and it is placed on the back; and this one is that which appears above the little finger by a visible indentation.
Et Saluatella: et est uena quae est inter annularem et minimum: et sunt ei duo rami.	And the Salutatella: and this one is between the ring finger and the little finger; and these two are the branches.

¶ De phlebotomia uenarum Algeberich.	As for the phlebotomy of Albigeric.

¶ De phlebotomia Venae sub lingua post Cephalicae phlebotomiam.	As for the phlebotomy of Veins under the tongue, after the phlebotomy of the head.
Duarum uero Venarum quae sunt sub lingua phlebotomiae iuuamentum: est, quod phlebotomia Cephalicae est ad praefocationes quae sunt in gutture, et aegritudinem uuulae, et aegritudines oris.	The two veins which are under the tongue have a rule: that is, the phlebotomy of the head is for those pre-occupations which are in the throat, and the sickness of the throat, and the sicknesses of the mouth.
Et qualitas phlebotomandi eas est, ut sedeat infirmus inter manus tuas coram sole: et eleualinguam eius, et aspice sub lingua a latere eius uno uenam, et a latere eius alio uenam: et color utriusque decliuis ad nigredinem.

¶ De tribus Venis in cubito.	Of the three veins on the bed.
Venae autem tres quae phlebotomantur in cubito, sunt in quarum phlebotomia cucurrit consuetudo in omnibus hominibus.	And the three veins that are phlebotomized in the bed, are in which the custom of phlebotomy runs in all men.
Et phlebotomia earum fit secundum duos modos.	And phlebotomy is done on them according to two ways.
Aut pungendo cum phlebotomo myrtino lato: aut oliuari ad subtilitatem decliui: aut secando cum phlebotomo cultellari, et est Alnesil.	Or with the prick and the phlebotomist's needle on the side: or oiling at the point of decline: or drying with the phlebotomist's knife, and it is Anaesthetizer.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form.
Sic Alnesil est, quod conuenit ad sectionem.	Thus Anæsthesizer is, that he may be useful for the cutting.
Et ex eis sunt species latae, et subtiles secundum amplitudinem uenarum et stricturam earum Forma phlebotomi myrtini sit lata, sicut uides.	And of them are species broad, and subtle according to the length of the veins and their narrowness: and the form of phlebotomy'a needle is broad, as you see it.
Et conuenit ad aperiendas uenas concauas, plenas, procedentes, apparentes, grossas, et illas quae continent sanguinem grossum, turbidum.	And it is useful to open closed veins, full, coming from the body, apparent, thick, and those which contain blood thick, turbulent.
Et iste phlebotomus est minoris latitudinis, et subtilioris extreminatis.	And this phlebotomist is of less latitude, and more subtle at the extremities.
Et conuenit ad phlebotomiam uenarum subtilium, quae continent sanguinem subtilem citrinum	And it is useful to phlebotomize veins that contain blood thinner, citrin-colored
¶ De phlebotomia Basilicae.	Of the phlebotomy of the Basilica.
Basilicae autem quae est una harum trium uenarum phlebotomiae iuuamentum est.	But that which is one of the three veins to be phlebotomized, it is a helpment.
Quia extrahit sanguinem ex aegritudinibus, quae sunt sub gutture et collo, ex eo quod sequitur pectus, et uentrem: et conuenit phlebotomatori cum phlebotomat eam, ut caueat, et sit super timorem ex ea nam sub ea est arteria.	Because he draws blood from the diseases that are under the throat and the neck, from which comes to the chest and the belly: and it is useful for the phlebotomist to pass over them with care, since an artery lies under them.
Si ergo errat, et addit in punctura phlebotomi, incidet illam arteriam, et accidet fluxus sanguinis.	If he makes an error and adds to the puncture with phlebotomy, he will cut the artery and cause a flow of blood.
Quapropter oportet, ne phlebotomet eam cum phlebotomo pungente: imo sit secans cum Alnesil.	Therefore, when puncturing with phlebotomy, it is necessary to cut through the vein: with Alne's knife, cut only a little.
Quod si non apparet Basilica apparitione manifesta, tunc oportet, ut alienes ipsam, et permuteris ad aliam, aut quaeras aliquem ramum eius: aut phlebotomes loco eius Funem brachii.	If the church does not appear with a visible apparition, then you must remove it and change it to another one, or ask someone else's opinion: or if he cannot find anyone, he will make a knot in his thread of the brachial artery.
Ipsa enim est manifesta, et seca eam cum phlebotomo Anesil, sicut diximus.	For it is evident, and cut it with Alne's knife as we have said.
Si autem uis phlebotomiam ipsius eiusdem, tunc oportet ante stricturam brachii, ut tangas locum, donec cognoscas locum pulsus.	But if you want to make a phlebotomy in his own hand, then you must touch the spot on the brachial artery before it is tightly tied up, so that you know where to cut.
Deinde signa super locum cum encaustro, postea brachium, et seca uenam sectione concaua cum phlebotomo Alnesil, sicut diximus.	Then mark the spot with caustic powder, and afterwards the arm, and cut the thread in a closed section with Alne' knife as we have said.
Et caue ne cadat percussio per spacium a loco arteriae.	And so that the knot does not fall through the space from the spot of the artery.
Et quando uides, cum tu stringis ligamen, inflationem in loco quem signasti cum encaustro, tunc illa inflatio est inflatio arteriae: deuita ergo eam.	And when you see it, as you tighten the knot, the swelling in the spot that you have marked with caustic powder, then this swelling is an swelling of the artery: so remove it.
Quod si uides sanguinem apud phlebotomiam salire, sicut urina pueri, et est sanguis subtilis, rubeus: tunc scias, quia est ex sanguine arteriae.	If you see blood rise during phlebotomy, like a boy's urine, and it is thin blood, red in color: then you will know that it is from the artery's blood.
Tunc ergo propera, et pone digitum tuum super ipsum spacio longo, deinde aufer digitum tuum.	Then therefore place your hand on the spot and let it rest there for a long time, and then remove your hand.
Si ergo abscinditur sanguis (multotiens namque abscinditur) tunc stringe brachium, et dimitte ipsum: et caueat infirmus a motione eius: et sit super timorem eius.	If therefore blood is separated (for it is often separated) then tighten the arm and let go of it: and let him be careful to move his hand: and place it on his fear.
Et non moueat ipsum diebus aliquot, donec sanetur.	And let him not be in pain for several days, until he is healed.
Si autem non abscinditur sanguis, et uincit te: et non est tibi praesens in momento tuo medicina, tunc incide arteriam, si apparet tibi.	But if the blood does not separate and it hurts you: and there is no present remedy for you in your moment of need, then cut the artery, if it appears to you.
Nam extremitates eius contrahuntur, et abscinditur sanguis.	The extremities of it are cut off, and blood is shed.
Aut accipe corticem fistici, et finde eum: accipe medietatem unam, et stringe eam super locum uenae strictura decenti, cum ligamento et puluillis usque ad diem alium.	Or take the fistula at its extremities, and cut it off; or take half of it, and tightly bind it to the place where the stricture is, with a ligament and powder until another day.
Tunc si abscinditur sanguis, est bonum.	Then if blood is shed, it is good.
Et si non: tunc cura ipsum cum eo cuius praecessit rememoratio ex loco puluerum abscindentium fluxum sanguinis: et abscisio sanguinis eius non est difficilis in pluribus dispositionibus, propter locum paruum uulneris, et possibilitatem ligamenti ex brachio.	And if not: then the care of him with that which preceded his memory from the place of the flux of blood, from which he is cut off: and the cutting off of his blood is not difficult in many dispositions, on account of the small wound, and the possibility of a ligament from the arm.
¶ De phlebotomia uenae Fuscae.	A phlebotomy of the veins of the foot.
Venae autem Fuscae phlebotomiae iuuamentum est, quod trahit sanguinem ex superiori parte capitis, et inferiore corporis: propterea, quia est composita ex ramo Basilicae, et ramo Cephalicae, sicut diximus.	But the phlebotomy of the veins of the foot is a remedy, which draws blood from the upper part of the head and the lower part of the body: for this reason, it is composed of a branch of the Basilica, and a branch of the Cephalica, as we have said.
Et conuenit phlebotomanti eam, ut sit super timorem ex phlebotomia eius, nam sub ea est neruus.	And it belongs to the phlebotomist that he should be on his guard against phlebotomy of him, for under it is a nerve.
Si ergo addit in punctura phlebotomi, et inuenit neruum, accidit in ea stupor, et difficilis fit sanatio eius, et fortasse non sanatur penitus.	But if he adds anything to the piercing of the phlebotomy, and finds a nerve, there occurs in it an stupor, and a difficult cure is made, and perhaps a thorough cure does not take place.
Et iste neruus multotiens apparet sensui.	And this nerve often appears to the sense.
Si autem occultatur in quibusdam hominibus, et est subtilis, et non ostenditur: tunc oportet ut ponas phlebotomiam tuam qua eam phlebotomas, sectionem cum Alnesil, et deuita neruum cum fortitudine tua.	But if it is concealed in some men, and is subtle, and does not show itself: then you should put your phlebotomy so that the phlebotomist may make a section with the Alnesil, and remove the nerves with your strength.
Quod si uena est inter duos neruos, tunc finde uenam in longitudine.	That if the vein is between two nerves, then find the vein in its length.
¶ De uena Cephalica.	Of the cerebral vein.
Phlebotomiae autem uenae Cephalicae iuuamentum est, quia attrahit sanguinem ex capite, et confert ad aegritudines oculorum.	But the phlebotomy of the cerebral vein is a remedy, for it draws blood from the head, and is applied to the diseases of the eyes.
Et oportet in hac uena proprie, si uis, ut phlebotomes eam pungendo cum phlebotomo oliuari, aut cum phlebotomo myrtino: quoniam est saluior uenarum omnium, quoniam non est subea arteria, neque neruus.	And it is necessary in this vein to use an oil-phlebotomy, or a myrrh-phlebotomy, for it is salutary for all veins, because it is not under an artery, nor a nerve.
Verumtamen conuenit tibi apud phlebotomiam, ut deuites cum phlebotomo caput lacerti tantum, et quaeras locum leniorem: et non nocet ei, si non inuenitur cum percussione prima, ut iteretur super eam cum phlebotomia aliquotiens.	Yet it is fitting that you should go to the phlebotomist's house, so that you may have the head lacerated only, and inquire about a milder place; and it does no harm to him, unless it is discovered upon his body with a first punch, so that he may return to it from time to time with phlebotomy.
Verumtamen fortasse apostematur in quibusdam hominibus quando non phlebotomatur in percussione prima, sed non nocet ei illud apostema in aliquo.	Yet perhaps you should avert your eyes from certain people when they are not phlebotomized in the first punch, but it does no harm to him if that aversion is in some measure.
¶ De utilitate Phlebotomiae, et cautelis in ea obseruandis.	On the Benefit of Phlebotomy and Care to be Taken with It.
Qualitas autem Phlebotomiae, et accidentia eius ex ea, in cuius rectificatione oportet te cogitare.	The Quality or Advantage of Phlebotomy, and the Consequences of It; by which You Should Take Thought for Correction.
Primum ergo illius est de quo oportet ut scias, quod phlebotomia non administratur, nisi in conseruatione sanitatis, et perseuerantia eius, et cautela ab aduentu aegritudinum.	Then first of all you should know that phlebotomy is not performed except for the preservation of health, and its perseverance, and the care to avoid any illness.
Et ut fiat phlebotomia in una uenarum trium quae sunt in cubito, scilicet Cephalica, et Fusca, et Basilica.	And so that phlebotomy may be performed on one of the three which are in a bed, namely the Cephalica, and the Fusca, and the Basilica.
Et ut fiat phlebotomia in principio Veris super ieiunium, in uere, et aestate: et autumno, et hyeme post comestionem, quando apparent significationes repletionis.	And so that phlebotomy may be performed at the beginning of spring on a fast, and during the summer, and autumn after a meal, when there are signs of fullness.
Et fiat phlebotomia in die primo, aut in tertio, postquam praeterierint de die tres horae.	And so that phlebotomy may be performed on the first or third day after having passed three hours since the last day.
Phlebotomia autem quae administratur in aegritudinibus, non habet horam determinatam: sed quando prouocat conuenientia et necessitas ad illud, in nocte, aut die, et in omni hora, et in omni tempore.	But phlebotomy which is performed in illness has not determined time; but when it occasioned convenience and necessity to it, at night, or by day, and at all times, and in all places.
Et non oportet, ut phlebotomentur pueri, donec ueniant super eos quatuordecim anni.	And it is not necessary that boys should be phlebotomized until they are fourteen years old.
Neque phlebotometur mulier praegnans, nisi a mense quarto usque ad septimum.	Nor should a woman who is pregnant be phlebotomized until the fourth month up to the seventh.
Neque phlebotomentur senes, qui iam pertransierunt sexaginta annos.	Nor should elderly people who have passed sixty years be phlebotomized.
Cum ergo aliquis uult phlebotomari propter quemcumque modum sit: oportet, ut mundificet intestina sua ante phlebotomiam cum clisteri leni, si in eis est stercus multum retentum: ut non attrahant uenae apud phlebotomiam ex intestinis superfluitates putridas nocentes membris principalibus.	When then whoever desires to be phlebotomized for any reason should wash his bowels well before phlebotomy with a laxative, if there is much feces in them: so that the fresh blood does not attract the eyes of the phlebotomist from the intestines when it flows, which injures the chief parts.
Neque phlebotometur patiens toctina, id est, satietatem nauseatiuam: neque crapulatus, neque euadens ab ebrietate, donec remoueatur illud ab eis.	Do not let the patient suffer from fainting, that is, nausea; nor do they have a cramp, nor does their sweat come from drunkenness until they get rid of it themselves.
Neque infirmus cum hydropisi.	Nor is the patient ill with hydrops.
Et caueatur phlebotomia iterum post colicam passionem, et uomitum, et fluxum uentris, et multiplicationem coitus, et laboris, et exercitii, et uigiliarum, et ieiunii, et omnis quod dissoluit uirtutem ex re corporea aut animali.	And let the phlebotomy be repeated after a colic passion, and vomiting, and flow of blood, and increase of sexual intercourse, and work, and exercise, and vigils, and fasting, and any that dissolves virtue out of the bodily or animal realm.
Deinde considera in subtilitate humorum ante illud, si sanguis est grossus cum cibis et potibus, et medicinis: si possibile est ei illud.	Then consider with subtlety the humors before that, if the blood is thick with food and drink and medicines: if it can be made possible for him.
Deinde introeat balneum, si non prohibet ipsum aliquid: aut exercitetur aliquo exercitio, ut subtilietur sanguis.	Then let him bathe in cold water, if he does not forbid anything: or let him exercise himself in some kind of exercise, that the blood may be refined.
Et pone phlebotomiam eius in pectore, circa tertiam diei, sicut diximus: et conare, ut euacuetur pectus eius illa die ex omnibus accidentibus animalibus malis: sicut angustia, et ira, et timor: et ex omnibus accidentibus corporeis, sicut labor, et poena, et superfluicoitus, et illis similia.	And let his phlebotomy be placed in his chest, about the third day as we have said: and be careful so that his chest is emptied of all animal bad accidents on that day: such as anger, fear: and all body accidents, such as work, punishment, excesses, and the like.
Et sedi suae faciat esse praesentes res cum quarum usu cucurrit consuetudo hominum ex aromaticitate, et odoramento, et tripudio et similibus illis per quantitatem possibilitatis.	And let him make his own presence of such things with which custom of men runs according to the use: from aromatizing, and fragrance, and revelry, and similar things through quantity of possibility.
Deinde sedeat phlebotomator super puluinari, quod sit altius quam puluinar phlebotomandi: postea extrahat brachium suum, et fricet ipsum phlebotomator manu sua bis, aut ter.	Then let the phlebotomist sit on a raised chair, that it may be higher than the one where phlebotomy is done: then he shall take his arm out and rub it with his own hand twice, or three times.
Deinde stringat ligamentum cum corrigia, et inuoluat eam bis.	Then let him tighten the ligature with a strap, and turn it two times.
Et sit strictura temperata, quoniam strictura quando est inaequalis, aut per superfluitatem in strictura, tunc prohibet cursum sanguinis: aut in mollificatione, tunc etiam prohibet cursum sanguinis.	And let the constriction be of moderate tension, for a constriction that is uneven, or by excess in the constriction, then it forbids the course of blood: or in softening, then also it forbids the course of blood.
Deinde post stricturam oportet, ut fricet phlebotomandus manus suas simul adinuicem, donec inflentur uenae, et declarentur sensui.	Then after the constriction, let the phlebotomist rub his hands together, face to face, until they are warmed, and present a sensation to the sense.
Deinde abstergat phlebotomator phlebotomum cum pauco oleo, antiquo proprie.	Then the phlebotomist dried off the bleeding with a little oil, according to custom.
Deinde ponat digitum suum indicem manus sinistrae super ipsam uenam sub loco cuius phlebotomiam uult, parum: ut non fugiat uena, et cassetur percussio.	Then he put his index finger of his left hand on the vein where he wanted to take the bloodletting, a little: so that the blood doesn't run away, and so that the pulsation isn't interrupted.
Quoniam ex uenis est quam inuenis sicut chordam fugientem apud phlebotomiam: et ex eis est quae est plena uentositate: et quando ponis phlebotomum super eam, contrahitur sub phlebotomo, et decipitur phlebotomator, et non aperit phlebotomus uenam: et si aperit eam, est stricta: propter illud ergo oportet, ut firmetur phlebotomator, et sit sollicitus in his rebus omnibus.	Since it is from the veins that bleeding takes place like a running string during bloodletting, and from those that are full of blood: and when you put the phlebotome on it, it is pressed under the phlebotome, and the phlebotomist is deceived, and it does not open the vein: and if it does open it, it is tight. Therefore it is necessary for the phlebotomist to tighten it, and be diligent in these things.
Deinde deponat phlebotomum.	Then put down the phlebotome.
Si ergo aperitur uena ex uice una, tunc bonum est.	If then one vein opens out of many, then it is good.
Et si non, tunc itera illud uice alia sub illo loco parum, aut supra ipsum cum festinatione: si non apostematur locus.	And if not, then go back to the other vein a little below that one, or above it with a rush: if not, choose a place.
Quod si apostematur, aut expauescit infirmus, tunc dimitte eum die, aut duobus diebus: et non stringat ligamentum.	Which if it is put out of joint, or causes pain to the patient, then let go of it for a day, or two days: and do not tighten the ligament.
Fortasse enim attrahet apostema calidum.	For maybe it draws the blood because of the heat.
Neque ingrediatur balneum.	And don't put it in the bath.
Deinde iteret phlebotomiam, si amat.	Then go back to the bloodletting, if he loves it.
Quod si apertio est parua, aut currit sanguis subtiliter: et times ut non egrediatur ex sanguine quantitas quam uis: tunc itera phlebotomum in foramine ipso secundum rectitudinem, et adde in operatione parum.	Which if the opening is small, or the blood runs gently: and be careful not to lose a quantity of blood which you wish to take from him: then go back with the phlebotome into that same hole, and add a little to the procedure.
Et fac illud cum festinatione, antequam apostemetur locus, apostematus enim locus est in multis hominibus apud operationem paruam.	And do it quickly, before that place is put out of joint, since this place goes out of joint in many people during the procedure.
Si ergo uides ipsum iam apostematum, tunc non iteres super ipsum omnino, non enim excusat apud te aliquid.	If then you see that he has already been bloodletting, then don' go back to that place at all, for nothing excuses you with him for anything.
Et pone super ipsum aliquid ex faece olei: quoniam alleuiat cursum sanguinis.	And put something of animal fat on the top of it: since it soothes the course of blood.
Et est melior in hoc loco quam oleum ipsum, et quam reliqua olea.	And it is better in this place than itself oil, and how other olive oil.
Et similiter administra faecem olei in omni phlebotomia tua, qua phlebotomas uenas apud prohibitionem cursus sanguinis: et faciunt illud tyriaca alfarach, et sagzenea, quando ponitur ex una earum super locum.	And similarly apply oil of olive to all your phlebotomies, when the course of blood is prohibited: and make that tyriaca alfarach, and the red sage, when it is put from one of them on the spot.
Sanguis enim subtiliatur et resoluitur, quando est grossus.	For the blood is thinned and resolved when it is thick.
Quod si accidat in loco phlebotomiae apostema magnum, nam multotiens accidit, praecipue ei qui non est phlebotomatus nisi uice illa, aut est apertio uenae parua, tunc propera et pone super locum spongiam infusam in aqua et sale, calefacta parumper: et stringe eam hora una: quoniam soluitur.	If it has happened in the spot of phlebotomy a big apostema, for many times it happens, especially to him who is not phlebotomized but only that time, or is a small opening of the vein, then put right and place over the spot a sponge steeped in water and salt, heated slightly: and tie it one hour: because it is resolved.
Et oportet, ut facias illud post exitum sanguinis ex uena ipsa, cum complemento sui, aut ex uena alia.	And it should be that you do that after the exit of blood from his own vein, with its complement, or from another vein.
Quod si remanet in loco post dies aliquid nigredinis, aut uiriditatis, non nocet illud: et si uis, pone super ipsum aliquid aloe, aut myrrhae solutorum: aut aliquid ex succo menthastri, id est, calamenti aut simile illius.	That if it remains in the place after a certain time of blackening or of the color green, it does not harm that: and if there is a vein, put over itself some oil, or of myrrh dissolved: or some juice of mint, that is, of calamus or similar to it.
Et multotiens quidem accidunt apostemata et eminentiae apud phlebotomiam Basilicae.	And many times happen apostemata and eminenties at the phlebotomy of the Basilica.
Pone ergo manum tuam super ipsam, tunc si inuenis molliciem apud compressionem tuam super ipsam, tunc illa eminentia est mala.	So put your hand over it, then if it is soft and damp when you compress it over itself, then that eminence is bad.
Caue ergo, ut ponas super eam aliquid ex eo quod diximus.	Take care so that you put over it some of what I have said.
Nam fortasse fluet ex ea sanguis arteriae.	For perhaps blood will flow from it of the artery.
Sed fac emplastrum ei cum eo in quo est stipticitas, ut induretur locus.	But put a plaster on him with what is there that stipticitas, so that the place endureth.
Deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then take care of himself with the other cure, until he is healed.
Et oportet, ut extrahas omni homini ex sanguine secundum quantitatem uirtutis suae.	And it should be that you keep from every man all his blood after the quantity of his virtue.
Et quod apparet ex colore uincente super sanguinem.	And what seems from the color shining over the blood.
Nam sanguis si est niger, tunc dimitte ipsum exire, donec rubeat: et similiter si uides ipsum grossum: tunc dimitte eum, donec subtilietur: et similiter si est acutus, donec auferatur acuitas eius.	For if the blood is black, then let him not go out, until it shines red: and likewise if you see him thick: then let him not go out, until he thins out: and likewise if it is sharp, then let its sharpness be taken away.
Et oportet ei qui est plenus, fortis, et indiget extractione sanguinis uice una, ut amplificetur phlebotomia uenae, et sit phlebotomus latus: et in eo qui est debilis, sit econtrario illius.	He who is full, strong, and inclined to the extraction of blood at once, so that the phlebotomy of the veins may be increased, and the phlebotomist be wide, should sit on his left side; but he who is feeble should sit on his right side.
Et oportet, ut extrahat ipsum in uicibus, et ut sit foramen strictum: et melius quod administratur in phlebotomia uenae est, ut sit transuersa sectio, non punctura.	And it is necessary that he should extract himself in the viscera, and that the opening be tight; and it is better if that which is administered in the phlebotomy of the veins is transverted section, not a puncture.
Et iste modus phlebotomiae est saluus a fluxu sanguinis, et ab incisione nerui: et est laudabilior, et saluior quam phlebotomia per latitudinem et longitudinem.	And this mode of phlebotomy is salutary against the flow of blood, and from incising a nerve; and it is more praiseworthy and healthier than phlebotomy by width and length.
Et cui consueuit peruenire apud phlebotomiam syncopis, oportet ut cibes ante phlebotomiam modico pane infuso in aqua granati muzi: aut secaniabin, si est calefactus: et extrahas ei ex sanguine in tribus uicibus, aut quatuor.	And he who is accustomed to falling ill after phlebotomy, let him eat a little bread soaked in grape juice water; or secernatabine, if it be warm; and let him extract the blood in three viscera, or in four.
Et si est infrigidatae complexionis, tunc accipiat ante phlebotomiam panem infusum in syrupo miua, aut in syrupo de melle aromatizato cum speciebus, aut in syrupo aromatizato odorifero.	And if his complexion is cold, then let him take before phlebotomy bread soaked in honey syrup, or in honey syrup seasoned with spices, or in syrup seasoned with odorous substances.
Quod si accidat syncopis apud phlebotomiam, et est caussa eius exitus sanguinis multi: tunc oportet, ut sumat in potu aquam carnis, et syrupum odoriferum subtilem: et utatur aromaticitate cum algalia, et liniatur pectus eius cum ea: et utatur reliquis quae diximus in diuisione in capitulo syncopis ex euacuatione.	That if it happens that syncopes occur after phlebotomy, and is a cause of the exit of blood much: then let him drink in a cup water of meat, and syrup of odoriferous things: and he should use fragrance with algalia, and rub his breast while so: and let him use the rest which we have said in the division about syncopes from discharge.
Qui autem uult euentare brachium suum, et soluere sanguinem suum secundo: oportet ei cuius phlebotomia est propter euacuationem multam, et uirtus eius est debilis, ut soluat sanguinem paulatim per quantitatem uirtutis in diebus continuis.	But he who wishes to let his arm go and let his blood flow again: it is necessary that him to whom the phlebotomy is for a great euacuation, and whose power is feeble, should let his blood flow little by little through a quantity of power in continuous days.
Qui uero uult euentare brachium suum, et soluere sanguinem suum secundo, et est corpus eius forte: tunc faciat illud post septem horas, aut nouem a phlebotomia sua prima.	But he who wishes to let his arm go and let his blood flow again, and whose body is strong: then let him do it after seven hours, or nine from his first phlebotomy.
Qui autem uult attrahere sanguinem ex corpore suo ad contrarium partis ad quam declinat: oportet ut euentetur ei in die secundo, aut in tertio.	Whoever wishes to draw blood from his own body towards the opposite part to that which he inclines should do so on the second or third day.
In cuius uero corpore est sanguis multus iam calefactus, et acuitur, et facit accidere febrem: oportet, ut egrediatur ex eo sanguis in uice una, et extrahatur ex eo quantitas multa: et amplificetur apertio usquequo accidat syncopis: postquam tu fueris conseruans omnes conditiones phlebotomiae: et ut ponas manum tuam super pulsum eius apud cursum sanguinis, ut non accidat mors loco syncopis.	But in case the body of this person has much blood that has been warmed and has become sharp and causes fever: it is necessary that he should go out of his body in one direction and draw out a great deal of blood, and increase the opening until fever occurs: after you have kept all the conditions of phlebotomy: and so that you place your hand on his pulse at the course of blood, so that death does not occur at the site of syncope.
Multotiens enim accidit illud, quando ignorat phlebotomator, et cadit negligentia.	For many times this has happened when the phlebotomist does not know and falls by neglect.
Et non oportet quando uis soluere brachium, et soluere sanguinem secundo, cum iam clausum sit orificium uenae, et fiat difficilis exitus sanguinis, ut prematur super ipsum cum uehementia, et curuatum extendatur uelociter.	And it is not appropriate when you wish to draw the arm and draw blood on the second day, while the opening of the vein has already closed, and the exit of the blood becomes difficult so that it presses on him with a sudden movement, and it bends quickly.
Nam illud est malum ualde, imo dimitte ipsum, donec phlebotometur secundo.	For this is bad to draw suddenly, far from letting go until the second day of phlebotomy.
Aut remoue cum acuitate phlebotomi illud quod coagulatum est ex sanguine in orificio uenae, et pone super ipsum aliquid salis dissoluti in aqua.	Or if you wish to move it with sharp phlebotomy that has coagulated blood in the opening of the vein, and place a little dissolved salt on him in water.
Et pone super ipsum aliquid ex tyriaca alfaroch, aut sagzenea, et pone ipsum compressione leni, donec egrediatur sanguis.	And place a little of the tarry fluid or sage green on him, and place the person under compression, until blood comes out.
Si uero iam apostemata est uena, tunc dimitte eam, et non tegas eam, donec sedetur apostema.	But if the vein has already been stretched, then let go of it, and do not press on it until it relaxes.
Quod si necessitas prouocat ad soluendum sanguinem secundo, et non est excusatio, tunc aut phlebotoma ipsum supra illum locum, aut in brachio alio in uena alia.	That if necessity forces to draw blood on the second day, and there is no excuse, then either phlebotomize him above that place or in another arm in another vein.
Funis autem brachii phlebotomatur loco Fuscae, et Basilicae, cum non inueniuntur, et sunt occultae, quoniam est composita ex eis.	But if you draw the arm of a person at the place of Fusca and Basilica, when they are not found and hidden, since it is composed of them:
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut intromittat infirmus manum suam in aqua calida, donec rubeat focile, et appareat uena manifeste.	And the quality of this phlebotomy is that he should put his weak hand in warm water until it turns red, and the vein appears clearly.
Deinde stringatur super ipsam cum ligamento parum constrictione media.	Then tie it above with a slight constriction of the ligature in the middle.
Deinde phlebotoma secundum transuersationem paulatim, non latitudinaliter, neque secundum longitudinem: et sit apertio ampla, et sit phlebotomia tua qua eam phlebotomas super iuncturam manus parumper.	Then make a second incision below, gradually and not straight across, nor along its length; and let the opening be wide and your phlebotomy shall come therewith a little over the tourniquet.
Quod si prohibetur exitus sanguinis, tunc itera manum in aqua calida, et dimitte sanguinem currere in aqua, donec consequaris necessitatem tuam.	If it is forbidden that the blood should flow out, then again put your hand in warm water and let the blood run into the water until you have eased your need.
Si autem fueris in diebus aestatis, tunc excusaris ab iteratione manus in aqua calida.	But if it were summer days, then you should be excused from putting your hand in warm water.
Et plurimum quidem ponitur cursus sanguinis in aqua calida in tempore hyemis.	And indeed the course of blood in warm water is put forward many times in wintertime.
Et phlebotomia huius uenae est saluior omnibus uenis, quoniam non est sub ea uena pulsatilis, neque neruus.	And this kind of phlebotomy is healthier for all the limbs, since there is no pulsating blood under it, nor nerves.
Phlebotomia uero Saluatellae manus dextrae, est conferens aegritudinibus epatis.	But phlebotomy of the right hand does indeed confer health on patients with liver ailments.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut stringas mahason manus cum ligamento, aut manu tua, postquam tu intromittis eam in aquam calidam, donec infletur uena, et demonsteretur sensui ualde.	And the quality of this phlebotomy is such that you should tie the hand with a tourniquet and, after you have put it in warm water, until the blood hardens, and it is clearly felt to be very hot.
Deinde phlebotoma eam transuersando.	Then make the incision across it.
Et si incidis eam totaliter, non nocebit ei illud in aliquo.	And if you cut it entirely, it will not hurt him in any way.
Et conserua, ne ultimes manum tuam cum phlebotomo.	And keep your hand away from the phlebotomy.
Sub ea enim sunt nerui digitorum denudati ex carne.	For under it are the nerves of the fingers bare from the flesh.
Deinde itera manum ad aquam calidam, et dimitte currere sanguinem in ea.	Then again put your hand in warm water and let the blood run into it.
Nam si tu non iteras eam in aqua calida, coagulatur sanguis in orificio uenae, et prohibetur a cursu.	For if you do not put it in warm water, the blood will clotted up in the incision, and it is forbidden to flow along its course.
Cum ergo extraxeris ex sanguine quantitatem necessitatis, tunc pone super uenam oleum et sal: ut non consolidetur uelociter.	But when you have extracted the quantity of blood necessary, then put on the incision oil and salt: so that it does not quickly harden.
Et similiter oportet, ut facias cum omni ramo stricto.	And likewise you should do, as you do with every tight ligature.
Iuuamentum uero phlebotomiae eius ex manu sinistra, est: quoniam est conferens ad aegritudines splenis: et similiter fac in phlebotomia eius, sicut fecisti in secunda aequaliter.	But the binding of the phlebotomy from the left hand is: for it is conferring on patients with sicknesses of the spleen: and likewise do you in this phlebotomy as you did in the second one in equal measure.
Saphenae autem phlebotomiae iuuamentum, est ad aegritudines quae sunt in inferiori parte corporis, sicut aegritudines matricum, et retentionem menstruorum, et infirmitates renum, et ulcera coxarum et crurium antiqua, et similia ex aegritudinibus.	The treatment of the saphenous vein, on the other hand, is for ailments in the lower part of the body such as those of the mother, retention of the menstrual fluids, kidney infirmities, old ulcers of the hips and thighs, and similar ailments.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut intromittat infirmus pedem suum in aquam calidam: et faciat super ipsum fricationem, donec exuberent uenae: et liga supra iuncturam pedis cum corrigia.	And the quality of phlebotomy is such that one should dip his sick foot into hot water; and he should make friction there until the blood comes up; and he should tie a bandage above the ankle with a strap.
Et uenae quidem locus est apud calcaneum, apparens uersus pollicem: et ramificantur ex ea in facie pedis rami multi.	And the place of the vein is near the heel, visible towards the thumb; and many branches sprout from it and extend on the face of the foot.
Phlebotoma ergo eam in ampliore ramo eius, aut apud calcaneum in aggregatione eius: quoniam est melius et saluius.	So phlebotomy should be done in one of its main branches, or at the heel where it originates; for it is better and more beneficial.
Quod si phlebotomas eam in facie pedis, tunc caue a neruis qui sunt sub ea super faciem pedis.	That if you phlebotomy on the face of the foot, then be careful of the nerves that lie under it on the surface of the foot.
Et pone phlebotomiam tuam qua eam phlebotomas ex transuerso, quasi tu uelis incidere eam: et sit phlebotomus Nesil.	And place your phlebotomy where you want to phlebotomy across from it, as if you didn't want to hit it directly: and let the phlebotomist be seated.
Si autem prohibetur exitus sanguinis, tunc itera pedem eius in aqua calida: et dimitte sanguinem currere in eam, donec euacuatur.	If however the exit of blood is prevented, then turn his foot again into hot water: and let the blood not run in it until it has drained.
Quod si errat uenam phlebotomator in prima uice, tunc iteret cum phlebotomia ad superiora parumper, nam locus est saluus, et non times ex eo maliciam, quando tu caues a neruis, sicut diximus.	That if the phlebotomist's vein is missed in the first attempt, then continue with phlebotomy to some degree higher, for the place is sounder; and do not wait on it with evil intent, when you are drawing from the nerves, as we have said.
Et similiter cum Saphena pedis alterius aequaliter.	And also with the saphenous vein of the other foot equally.
Venae autem Sciaticae locus, sicut diximus, est apud calcaneum ex latere syluestri.	The location of the sciatic veins, as we have said, is near the heel from the sides of the pine tree.
Et iuuamentum phlebotomiae eius est, ad dolorem anchae, quando est propter sanguinem calidum.	And the treatment of this phlebotomy is for the pain in the ankle, when there is hot blood.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut ingrediatur infirmus balneum, et festinet: et stringe crus eius a latere anchae usque supra calcaneum quatuor digitis, cum uitta subtili longa: non enim apparet nisi propter illud.	And the quality of this phlebotomy is such that one should dip his sick foot into warm water and walk; and tighten his shin with a string from the ankle up to the heel, four fingers wide, not revealing it for anything else: for it does not appear except for that reason.
Quando ergo apparet, tunc phlebotoma eam secundum quodcumque ingenium est tibi possibile, aut secundum transuersionem: et est melius, aut ut incidas eam incisione, aut seces eam sectione.	When therefore it appears, then cut off the vein in accordance with whatever ability you have, or according to transgression; and it is better, or as if you were to strike it with an incision, or sever it by sectioning.
Locus enim eius est saluior, et ipsa est in pluribus hominibus occulta ualde.	For the site of this is healthier, and itself is a great secret in many people.
Quod si non inuenis eam, et non apparet sensui omnino: tunc phlebotoma aliquem ramum eius, et est ille qui apparet in dorso pedis, et uersus auricularem: et caue a neruis, et fac currere ex sanguine quantitatem quam uis.	If it is not enlarged and does not appear at all to the sense: then cut off some of its branch, and that which appears on the back of the foot and toward the ear; and cause it to run with a certain quantity of blood that you want.
Deinde solue stricturam, et pone super locum phlebotomiae corium, et stringe locum.	Then loosen the bandage tightly, and place flesh over the site of phlebotomy, and tighten the spot.
Uelociter enim sanatur.	For it is quickly healed.
¶ De Ventosatione, et qualitate usus eius.	Regarding Ventilation, and quality of use.
Caput XCVIII.	Chapter LXXVIII.
Uentosae fiunt ex cornibus, et ex aere, et ex uitro.	The vents are made from horns, and from air, and from heat.
Et Ventosatio quidem fit secundum duos modos.	And Ventilation is made in two ways.
Cum scarificatione, et extractione sanguinis: et alter est uentosatio sine scarificatione.	When with scarring and extraction of blood: and the other is ventilation without scarring.
Et haec Ventosatio quae est sine scarificatione, est secundum duos modos.	And this Ventilation which is without scarring, is in two ways.
Aut enim est cum igne.	Or indeed is with fire.
Aut est absque igne.	Or is without fire.
Et uentosis quae administrantur cum scarificatione et extractione sanguinis sunt quatuordecim loca corporis.	And the ventilations that are administered with scarring and extraction of blood are four-십여 places in the body.
Quorum unus est, Ventosatio Alnocrati, et est postremum capitis: et Alkehel, et est medium colli: et uentosae Alhagdahim, et sunt duae laminae colli a duabus partibus simul: et uentosae menti, et est sub mandibula in inferiori oris: et uentosae duarum spatularum: et uentosae Alachosos super finem caudae: et uentosae duorum focilium, et sunt medium duorum brachiorum: et uentosae duorum crurium: et uentosae duarum cauillarum.	Of which one is Ventilation of the Crown, and it is lastly of the head: and Alkhel, and is in the middle of the neck: and ventilations of Al-Hadhdahim, and they are two layers of the neck on both sides simultaneously: and ventilations of the mind, and is under the mandible in the lower mouth: and ventilations of two spatulas: and ventilations of Al-La'il at the end of the tail: and ventilations of two fires, and they are in the middle of the two arms: and ventilations of two chaps: and ventilations of two calves.
Et Ventosatio quidem non extrahit sanguinem tibi ex uenis minutis sparsis in carne, et propter illud non cadit uirtus ex eis, sicut est casus eius ex phlebotomia.	And indeed does not extract blood from you from small sparse veins in the flesh, and because of it does not fall virtue from them, such as is the case with phlebotomy.
Neque oportet, ut administretur uentosatio siue cum igne, aut absque igne in aliqua aegritudinum quae fiunt ex repletione, donec euacuetur totum corpus.	It is not appropriate that the application of tar be done with fire or without fire in any illness that occurs from fullness until the whole body is emptied.
Quod si necessitas prouocat ad Ventosationem ex aegritudine, aut propter consuetudinem, administramus eam in omni hora in principio mensis, in fine eius, et in medio ipsius, et in quocumque tempore fuerit.	If necessity compels to the application of tar in illness or by custom, we shall administer it at the beginning, end, and middle of the month, and at any time.
Quod est, quia ex hominibus est qui quando multiplicatur in eo sanguis, donec indiget extractione eius per uentosationem, inuenit in capite suo grauedinem, et sodahan.	That is because a person becomes bald when blood multiplies within him until it needs to be extracted by tar application, and finds himself bald, and does not remain except with shaving.
Et ex eis est qui inuenit repletionem et rubedinem in facie sua, capite suo, et collo suo.	And among them is he who finds fullness and redness on his face, his head, and his neck.
Et ex eis est qui inuenit pruritum in facie sua, et fronte sua, et tenebrositatem, et hebetudinem in oculis suis.	And among them is he who finds itching on his face, his forehead, darkness, and dullness in his eyes.
Et ex eis est qui scalpit locum uentosationis suae.	And among them is he who scratches the place where he applied tar.
Et ex eis est cuius risus multiplicatur.	And among them is he whose laughter multiplies.
Et ex eis est qui inuenit gustum sanguinis in ore suo: aut apostematur lingua, et expuit sanguinem.	And among them is he who finds the taste of blood in his mouth, or who spits it out with his tongue, and does not remain except by drinking blood.
Et ex eis est cuius somnus multiplicatur.	And among them is he whose sleep multiplies.
Et ex eis est qui uidet in somno suo sanguinem et rubedinem, et interfectos, et plagas, et quae sunt similia illis.	And among them is he who sees in his sleep blood and redness, and those who have been slain, and plagues, and similar things.
Quando ergo uidemus aliquid ex illis, et proprie si est in tertia media mensis: praecipimus tunc uentosationem fieri, postquam praeterierunt de die duae horae, aut tres.	When we see any of them, and especially if it is in the middle of the third month: We order tar application to be done after two or three hours have passed from the day.
Iuuamentum autem Ventosationis nuchae, est: quoniam ipsa confert ad grauitatem in capite, et quod effunditur ad oculos.	But the application of tar on the back is this: because it brings baldness to the head, and it drips down to the eyes.
At uero oportet, ut sit illud post euacuationem totius corporis.	But it is appropriate that it be done after the whole body has been emptied.
Et haec quidem Ventosa est loco phlebotomiae Cephalicae.	And this tar is a place of phlebotomy on the head.
Et non licet, ut utatur ea qui est frigidae complexionis, aut in quo est catarrus.	And it is not appropriate that he who has a cold complexions should use it, or in whom there is a croupy cough.
Nam infert ei nocumentum magnum.	For it causes great harm.
Et propter illud non oportet, ut utantur ea senes, et in cuius capite sunt aegritudines frigidae.	Since they are not old enough to use these, nor do they have any diseases of cold in their heads.
Qui autem super eam fit assiduus, generatur super eum obliuio.	But those who become too accustomed to it, lose their memory.
Et propter illud oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ut deponat manum suam cum uentosa parumper ad inferiora, timendo ex generatione obliuionis.	And for this reason, you should tell Ventosator to put his hand down a little when he is blowing on it, out of fear of losing his memory.
Ventosatio aut Alkehel, est loco phlebotomiae Fuscae, et phlebotomiae Basilicae, et propter illud confert asmati, et constrictioni anhelitus, et fissurae instrumenti anhelitus, et tussi, et repletioni.	Ventosation or Al-Khel is the place of the phlebotomy of Fusca, and the phlebotomy of Basilica, and for this reason it confers asa-mus, and constriction of anhelius, and fissures of the instrument of anhelius, and coughs, and fulfillment.
Et oportet, ut impellatur Ventosa Alkehel parumper, quoniam si ponitur inferius, generat debilitatem in corde, et stomacho.	And it should be that Ventosator is blown a little by Al-Khel, because if it is put down, it generates weakness in the heart and stomach.
Ventosatio uero alhagdahim, confert doloribus accidentibus in capite, et obtalmiae, et hemigraneae, et perforationi, et dolori in radicibus dentium: et est loco phlebotomiae Basilicae.	Ventosation on the other hand, confers pain on accidental injuries in the head, and on the eyes, and on headaches, and on piercing, and on pain in the roots of the teeth; and it is the place of the phlebotomy of Basilica.
Et oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ne premat manum suam cum scarificatione: ut non incidat arteriam, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	And you should tell Ventosator not to touch the skin with his scarification instrument so that he does not hit an artery and cause a flow of blood.
Ventosatio autem sub mento, confert alcolae in ore, et corruptioni gingiuae, et similibus eis ex aegritudinibus quae sunt in ore: et stat loco phlebotomiae alieherich, quae sunt in duobus labiis.	But Ventosation under the chin, confers alcohol in the mouth, and corruption of the gums, and similar diseases that are in the mouth: and it is the place of a different kind of phlebotomy, which is in the two lips.
Ventosatio autem spatularum, confert ad alchafacham, quae fit ex replexione, et caliditate.	But Ventosation with the spatula, confers to Al-Khajah, which is done by a replexion and heat.
Ventosatio uero interiorum partium duorum focilium, confert iuuamentum phlebotomiae uenarum trium, Basilicae, et Fuscae, et Cephalicae: quoniam ipsa attrahit sanguinem ex omnibus illis uenis minutis, quae sunt in carne: et attrahunt illae uenae minutae ex uenis aliis grossioribus eis, donec peruenit attractio ad uenas tres.	Ventosation of the inner parts confers a favor to phlebotomy of the three veins, Basilica, Fusca, and Cephalica: because she herself attracts blood from all those small veins that are in the flesh: and these small veins attract those other larger veins until they reach the attraction of the three.
Et oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ne multum procedat in scarificatione: quoniam locus est denudatus carne, et sub eo sunt nerui et arteriae.	It is necessary that you do not let the scalpel go too far into the scarification: for the place is stripped of flesh, and under it are nerves and arteries.
Ventosa autem quae uentosatur super alchausos, confert hemorroidibus Ani, et ulceribus inferioribus.	But the ventosa which is applied to the anus, it brings hemorrhoids and ulcers of the lower parts.
Et oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ut sit uentosa magna, et ut sit ex aere: quoniam locus indiget suctione forti, et fortasse franguntur Ventosae subtiles: et scarificetur scarificatione magna.	And you should order the scalpel to be big, and that it is made of iron: because the place needs strong suction, and perhaps the fine scalpel are broken: and let the scarification be done with a big scarification.
Ventosae autem crurium minuunt diminutione manifesta: quoniam attrahunt sanguinem ex toto corpore, et conferunt doloribus antiquis in renibus, et matricibus, et uesica: prouocant menstrua, et conferunt bothor, et ademenul: et stant loco phlebotomiae duarum saphenarum, et alhorcobeni.	But the ventosa of the legs diminishes the visible reduction: because they attract blood from all over the body, and bring old pains in the veins, and membranes, and vesicles: they induce menstruation, and bring fever, and constriction: and stand in the place of phlebotomy of the two saphenous veins, and alhorcobeni.
Verumtamen debilitant corpus multum, et faciunt accidere syncopim in pluribus hominibus.	But they weaken the body very much, and make many people faint.
Et Ventosarum alhorcobeni iuuamentum est propinquum iuuamento Ventosarum duorum crurium.	And the alhorcobeni of the ventosa is a near relationship to the iuuamento of the two legs of the ventosa.
Qualitas positionis Ventosarum est, ut ponas uentosam in primis uacuam, et sugas suctione temperata: et non prolonges positionem uentosarum, sed pone eas uelociter, et remoue eas uelociter, ut ueniant humores ad locum aduentu aequali: et non cesses iterare illud et continuare, donec uideas locum iam rubere et inflari, et appareat rubedo sanguinis: tunc ergo scarifica, et itera suctione paulatim.	The quality of the position of the ventosa is that you put the ventosa in the first place, and suck with moderate suction: and do not prolong the position of the ventosa, but put them quickly, and move them quickly, so that they go to the place of exudation equally: and do not stop repeating this and continuing, until you see the place already red and swollen, and the blood appears: then therefore scarify, and repeat the suction slowly.
Deinde considera in dispositione corporum.	Then consider in the disposition of the bodies.
Nam qui ex hominibus est tenerae carnis, rarorum pororum, oportet ut scarifices ipsum semel, non plus: ut non ulceretur locus.	For he who is of tender flesh, and few pores, it should be scarified once only, not more: lest the place be ulcerated.
Et praecipe Ventosatori, ut amplificet scarificationem, et profundet parum: et temperet suctionem in facilitate, et uelocitate, et motu suaui.	And order the scalpel to make the scarification bigger, and deeper a little: and moderate the suction in ease, and speed, and smooth motion.
Quod si in sanguine est grossitudo, tunc oportet, ut scarifices ipsum bis.	That if there is grossness in the blood, then it should be that you scarify him twice.
In uice quidem prima aperitur uia subtiliationi sanguinis, et aquositati eius: et in secunda quidem perscrutationi exquisitae extractionis sanguinis grossi.	Indeed, the first incision opens the way for the subtlety of blood, and its watering; and, indeed, the second is for the exquisite examination of the extraction of gross blood.
Si uero sanguis est faeculentus ualde, tunc fiat scarificatio uice tertia: ut consequatur ultimum.	If the blood is indeed putrid, then let the third incision be made: so that the result may be the last.
Et ad ultimum, quando uolumus extrahere sanguinem paulatim, uel parumper, sufficit nobis scarificatio una.	And to the end, when we wish to extract blood little by little, or a little at a time, one incision is sufficient for us.
Quod si uolumus extractionem sanguinis multi, scarificamus scarificatione plurima.	That if we wish to extract blood many times, then let us make multiple incisions.
Et si nos mensuramus, quod sanguis est grossus: tunc oportet, ut scarificetur scarificatione profunda: et terminus aequalis in scarificatione, est profunditas cutis.	And if we measure, that the blood is thick: then it is necessary so that a deep incision should be made: and the equal term in the incision, is the depth of the skin.
¶ Quid sit illud quod oportet administrari ex oleis apud positionem Ventosarum, et quid caueat uentosandus.	What is that which needs to be administered from oils at the placement of vents, and what does it cause?
IN illo quidem cuius cutis est grossa, dura, fusca, et pori eius sunt stricti, oportet ut ungantur loca Ventosare cum oleis apertiuis, lenitiuis, resolutiuis: si est in tempore aestatis, sicut est oleum alkeiri, aut oleum uiolatum, aut oleum de amigdalis dulcibus, aut oleum de semine cucurbitae.	IN that which has the skin thick, hard, dark and whose pores are tight, one should anoint the places of the Vents with open, soothing, حل  oils: if it is in the time of summer, such as is a strong oil, or a mild oil, or an almond oil, or a seed oil of cucumber.
Et si est in tempore hyemis, tunc oleum narcissinum, aut oleum de lilio, aut oleum camomellinum, aut sarbatinum: et eis similia.	And if it is in the time of winter, then olive oil, or violet oil, or chamomile oil, or sage oil: and these are similar.
Si uero superfluitas est grossa, frigida: tunc oleum sit amaracinum, aut oleum de balsamita aut oleum alben, aut oleum anetinum: et eis similia.	If the superfluity is thick, cold: then let there be bitter oil, or olive oil, or alburnum oil, or annerbitz oil: and these are similar.
Si uero uentosandus est amplorum pororum, tenerae carnis: tunc oportet, ut prohibeatur ab oleo, et oportet ut isti abluant loca Ventosarum earum post uentosationem cum aqua rosata, aut cum aqua frigida, aut cum aqua solatri, aut cum aqua cucurbitae, aut cum aqua portulacae: et similibus eis.	If the wind is of large pores, tender flesh: then one should prohibit from oil, and it should be washed after ventilation with rosy water, or cold water, or sun water, or cucumber water, or portulaca water: and these are similar.
Ille autem cuius sanguis est multae humiditatis, abluat uentosas cum aceto, aut cum aqua myrti, et sumach: et similibus eis.	But that which has blood of much moisture, washes the vents with vinegar, or with myrtle water, and sumach: and these are similar.
Cuius autem superfluitates sunt grossae, abluat uentosas suas cum uino antiquo, aut cum aqua samsuci, aut decoctione aneti, aut camomillae: et eis similibus.	Whoseever are the fluid excesses, wash them away with old wine, or with water of samshuk, or with a decoction of aniseed, or of chamomile; and for these alike.
Et oportet, ut caueatur uentosatio in balneo, aut in uestigio balnei, imo oportet, ut administretur post exitum ex balneo per horam, aut per horas duas.	And it is necessary that the cooling should be done in a bath or in a foot-bath; and it is necessary also that an administrate after leaving the bath for one hour, or two hours.
Et non oportet, ut dormiat aliquis post uentosationem.	And it is not necessary that anyone should sleep after cooling.
¶ Quid est quo oportet ut regatur Ventosandus, aut Phlebotomatus ante uentosationem.	What is it, then, for which the treatment of cooling and phlebotomy is administered before cooling?
ET post eam oportet, ut consideres in primis: tunc si Ventosatus, aut Phlebotomatus sit cholericus, et uincunt super sanguinem eius acuitas et inflammatio: tunc oportet, ut accipiat infrigidantia, sicut granatum muzum: et etiam endiuiam cum aceto et lactuca, et secaniabin, et iuleb: et eis similia.	And after this, it is necessary that you consider first of all: if the person is bilious and his blood is sharp and inflamed, then he should take cooling things, such as granatum muzum; also vinegar and lettuce, with secani-bin and juleb; and similar things.
Et pone cibaria eius pullos, et carnes ouium sekebiget, et cibos conditos cum agresta: et eis similia.	And put before him the foods that dry up his flesh, and meat of a kind to make him thirsty, and prepared foods with grapes: and similar things.
Et cuius complexio est frigida, oportet ut sumat in potu syrupum de melle, aut de almiua, aut alsecaniabin de seminibus factum: et sumat uinum odoriferum medium, quod est inter uetus et nouum: et praecipiatur, ut utatur paucitate cibi.	And if his disposition is cold, he should take in a drink of syrup of honey, or of mulberry, or of secani-bin made from seeds; and he should take medium wine that is sharp, which is between sweet and sour; and let it be commanded that he eat sparingly.
Et pone cibum eius pullos, et canebir: et passeres, id est, paruas aues: et pullos columborum issiadebet.	And put before him the foods that dry up his flesh, and tarragon; and pigeons, that is, many birds: and let him eat pigeon-meat often baked.
Et oportet, ut potus die uentosationis et phlebotomiae plus sit quam cibus: et oportet, ut detur in potu in quibusdam hominibus in horis tyriaca alfaroch, aut medicamen de musco, id est, muscata, aut alesselithe ante uentosationem: et ante phlebotomiam, aut post: ut confortentur membra principalia, et subtilietur sanguis.	And it is necessary that the drink of the day after cooling and phlebotomy be stronger than food; and it is necessary that a medicine be given in a drink to some men containing tyrrhene or alfaroch, or a remedy made from musk, that is musca-ta, or alselith before cooling: and before phlebotomy, or after it, so as to comfort the main limbs, and subtilize the blood.
Et non oportet, ut sumant eam in potu calefacto.	They should not take it out of a hot pot.
¶ De Ventosis sine scarificatione.	On Ventosis without scarring.
Uentosae autem quae sunt sine scarificatione, sunt Ventosae quae ponuntur super epar, et splenem, et podagram, et super uentrem, umbilicum, et loca renum, et pixidem anchae: quoniam ista membra non sufferunt scarificationem super se.	But the venesections that are without scarring, are venesections that are put on the skin, and the liver, and the spleen, and on the belly, and places of the ribs, and the anus: for these limbs do not endure the scarification on themselves.
Et non quaeritur per eas, nisi aut attactio ex membro sanguinis ad membrum: sicut ponimus Ventosam super mammillas in aegritudine fluxus sanguinis narium.	And it is not sought after them, except that the blood flow from one member to another: as we put the venesection on the breasts in a flu of blood from the nose.
Et utimur eis, ut soluamus a membro uentositatem frigidam inuiscatam in membro: sicut ponimus uentosam super uentrem, et umbilicum.	And we use them, that we solve a cold venesection on one member to another: as we put the venesection on the belly, and the umbilical cord.
Ipsa enim rarificat membrum, et calefacit ipsum, et remouet dolorem propterea, quia resoluit illam uentositatem.	For it itself tightens the member, and warms it, and moves away the pain, because it has solved the venesection.
Etiam ponitur super renes, quando accidit in eis opilatio, aut lapis.	Also is put on the kidneys, when it happens to them a deposit, or a stone.
Uirtute enim attractionis suae fortasse aperit opilationem, aut eradicat lapidem ex loco suo.	For with his virtue of attraction he might perhaps open a deposit, or eradicate a stone from its place.
Et similiter facit quando ponitur super epar, et splenem apud uentositatem terendam in eis utrisque.	And also does when it is put on the liver, and the spleen next to a venesection that should heal in them both: for he moves away the pain from them.
Et istae Ventosae administrantur uacuae cum sectione tantum.	And these Venesections are administered with a sharp knife with only a slight cut.
Et quandoque administrantur cum igne.	And when they are administered with fire.
Et quandoque administrantur plenae aqua tepida in aegritudinibus pleuresis: et illud est, ut impleatur Ventosa, et sit magna, aqua calida sola, aut aqua in qua decoctae sint herbae quae conueniunt.	And sometimes they are administered full of warm water in the case of a pleural illness: and that is so, so that the venesection is large, and there is only warm water, or water in which herbs have been cooked.
¶ Forma Ventosae administratae cum igne.	Form of administration of the Venesections with fire.
Sit amplitudo orificii eius duorum digitorum apertorum, secundum quod formauimus: et quantitas eius in profundo sit medietas palmi: et sit in latere eius in loco qui est circiter medium eius, foramen paruum, secundum quantitatem quod ingrediatur ipsum acus: fiat ex aere simul, aut citrino, grossorum marginum, lenium, aequalium, tersorum: ut non laedat membrum apud positionem suam super ipsum: et sit in medio eius uirga transuersa ex aere, aut ferro, ubi ponitur candela cum igne.	Let the width of his opening be two fingers wide, according to which we made it: and let the quantity of it in the depth be half a palm: and let it be in the back of its side which is near the middle of it, small hole, second to the quantity that it is cooked inside itself: so it is made from brass, or yellow copper, large margin, soft, equal, third: so that it does not hurt the member at its position on itself: and let it be in the middle of it a wire crossing from brass, or iron, where a candle is put with fire.
Et iam fit haec uentosa magna, maior ea quam narrauimus, et parum minor illa, secundum aegritudines et aetatem eius qui utitur.	And this has also been very useful, greater than we have described, and less by a little, according to the disease and age of him who uses it.
Ventosae enim puerorum, et extenuatorum sunt aliae, quam uentosae uirorum, et grossorum corporum.	For young people, the winds are useful, and others, which weaken, greater than the winds that men use, and for those who have large bodies.
Qualitas autem ponendi hanc uentosam cum igne super membrum, est, ut accendas licinium cum igne ex lino decenter, aut candelam paruam ex caera: et pone eam super medium uirgae transuersae quae est in medio uentosae: ut sit accensus ignis circiter inferiorem partem uentosae, ut non comburatur corpus infirmi.	The quality of this wind-making when set on fire on a limb is such, that you kindle the linden wood with fire from off-center linen, or place a small candle made of wax: and put it on the middle of the arm across-way that lies in the middle of the wind-making. so that the fire all around may be lower than the wind-making, so that the body is not burned up.
Deinde ponatur super membrum: et digitus sit super foramen quod dixi, donec quando tenemus uentosam: dum indigemus, auferamus digitum, et egredietur uapor super illud foramen, et soluetur uentosa statim.	Then let it be placed on the limb: and let the finger be placed over the opening that I said, as long as we hold the wind-making: while we are holding it, let us take off the finger, and steam will come out over that opening, and the wind-making will immediately cease.
Deinde igni licinium secundum modum suum, et itera eam, si indiges illa.	Then set fire to the linden wood in the manner described, and do this again if you can bear it.
In Ventosa autem quae administratur in aegritudine pleuresis cum aqua, non est uirga transuersa, neque foramen: et non administratur, nisi quia impletur aqua, et ponitur super membrum tantum.	But the wind-making that is administered in pleural pain with water has no across-way limb or opening; and it is not administered, unless it fills with water, and is placed on the limb only.
Et haec est forma eius.	This is its form.
Et haec Ventosa quanto plus est magna, ut capiat aquam multam, est melior.	And this wind-making is the better when it is larger, so that it takes in a lot of water, for that is good.
¶ De suspensione Sanguisugarum.	Regarding the suspension of blood-sugar.
Caput XCIX.	Chapter LIX.
Sanguisugae non administrantur in pluribus, nisi in quibus membris non est possibilis positio uentosarum, propter paruitatem eorum, sicut labium, et gingiua, et eis similia.	Blood-sugar is not administered in many, unless the limbs are unable to take wind-making, because of their smallness, such as the lips, and gums, and things like them.
Aut in membro denudato a carne, sicut digitus, et nasus, et eis similia.	Or in a naked limb, like the finger, and the nose, and things like them.
Et qualitas utendi eis est: ut ueneris ex Sanguisugis quae sunt in aquis dulcibus, mundis a putredinibus.	And the quality of using these is such: that you may come from blood-sugar which are in sweet waters, clean from corruption.
Deinde dimittantur die et nocte in aqua dulci, donec famelicae sint, et non remaneat in uentre earum aliquid.	Then they are to be discharged and given sweet water to drink at night until they become hungry, and there is nothing left in their bellies.
Deinde euacuetur corpus in primis cum phlebotomia, et cum uentosis.	Then the body is to be evacuated first with bloodletting, and then with vomiting.
Deinde absterge membrum infirmi, donec rubeat.	Then the nurse washes the member with water, until it turns red.
Postea ponantur super ipsum.	Then they place them on top of him.
Cum ergo implentur, et cadunt, et est possibilis suctio loci cum uentosa, tunc est magis ultimum in iuuamento: et si non, tunc ablue locum cum aceto.	When therefore they are filled, and fall down, and it is possible to suck the place with a poultice, then it is more final in healing: and if not, then the place is to be washed with vinegar.
Deinde cum aqua multa, et fricetur, et exprimatur.	Then with a lot of water, and it is to be rubbed, and pressed out.
Quod si prolongatur cursus sanguinis post casum Sanguisugarum, et est illud resudando: tunc infunde pannum lini in aqua frigida, et pone ipsum desuper, donec abscindatur resudatio.	If the course of blood is prolonged after the fall of blood from the wound, and it is that residue: then put a linen cloth in cold water, and place him upside down, until the residue falls off.
Quod si multiplicatur sanguis, tunc pulueriza super ipsum zegi tritum, aut gallas, et similia eis ex stipticis: donec abscindatur sanguis.	If the blood multiplies, then dust is to be sprinkled on him of oak bark, or of hickory, and similar things from a styptic: until the blood falls off.
Aut ponantur super locum medietates fabarum excorticatarum: et dimittantur, donec adhaereant fabae in loco, nam sanguis abscinditur.	Or that they are placed on top of the place half with ground oak bark: and they are to be left until the oak bark adheres to the place, for the blood is shed.
Et oportet si necessaria est iteratio Sanguisugarum, quando est possibile, mutare eas.	And it is necessary if the necessity requires a change of the wound, when it is possible, to change them.
Si autem prohibentur Sanguisugae a suspensione, tunc abstergatur locus cum sanguine recenti.	If however they are prohibited from suspension, then the place is to be cleaned with recent blood.
Aut fige acum in locis, donec egrediatur aliquid ex sanguine.	Or bind them now on the places, until something exits from the blood.
Deinde ponantur, nam ipsae quando sentiunt aliquid ex sanguine, adhaerent statim.	Then they are to be placed, for when they feel some of the blood, they adhere immediately.
Quando ergo uis ut cadant, pulueriza super eas aliquid ex aloe trito, aut salem, aut cinerem: et cadent statim.	When therefore you wish them to fall down, sprinkle on them something from freshly squeezed aloe, or salt, or ash: and they fall down immediately.
¶ Partis Secundae Finis.	Second part end.

¶ Sermo uniuersalis de restauratione, et dislocatione, et curatione torsionis, et similibus.	The universal speech about restoration, displacement, cure of torsion and similar cases.
Caput I.	Chapter I.
Hoc Capitulum etiam multotiens est necessarium in arte Medicinae, et est restauratio fracturae, et dislocationis accidentium in ossibus.	This chapter is also very necessary in the art of Medicine, and it is the restoration of fractures, and dislocations of accidents in bones.
Scitote o Filii, quia iactant se de hoc Capitulo stolidi medicorum et uulgi, et qui non inspexerunt unquam antiquorum librum, neque legerunt ex eo literam.	Know, O Sons, for this chapter is stolid to the doctors and people, and they have never examined the ancient book, nor read a letter from it.
Et propter hanc caussam fit, quod iste modus ex scientiis in terra nostra est priuatus.	And for this reason, for that this way of treatment is hidden from the sciences in our land.
Et ego non obuiaui in eo unquam bono omnino, et non adeptus sum ex eo illud, quod sum adeptus nisi propter longitudinem lectionis librorum antiquorum, et studium super intellectum eorum, donec extraxi scientiam illius ex eis.	And I was not satisfied with it at all, and I have not been fully convinced by it unless because of the length of reading the ancient books, and study on their understanding, until I drew out the science of that from them.
Deinde adhaesi experimento et studio longitudine uitae meae.	Then, after I had come to the conclusion and study of a long life.
Et iam descripsi uobis ex illo in hoc Capitulo totum quod continet scientia mea: et super quod praeteriit experimentum meum, postquam abbreuiaui illud uobis, et liberaui illud ex occupatione elongationis, et abbreuiaui illud fine abbreuiationis, et ostendi illud fine declinationis: et formaui in eo formas multas ex formis instrumentorum quae administrantur in eo, cum sit ex additione declinationis, sicut feci in duobus Capitulis praecedentibus.	And then, I have described to you from that whole what contains my science: and beyond that which passed through my experiment, after I shortened it for you, and freed it from the occupation of elongation, and shortened it end by abbreviation, and showed it end by declination: and I formed in it many forms from forms of instruments which are administered to it, with the addition of a declination, as I did in two preceding Chapters.
¶ Summae, et collectiones ex esse fracturae ossium, ex eis quarum praemissio necessaria est, antequam incipiamus rememorationem membrorum fractorum, et diuersorum, si uniuscuiusque.	I will now explain from what a fracture of bones is made, out of which the premise is necessary for us before we begin to remember the members of fractures, and many, if not each one.
Caput II.	Chapter II.
Oportet, ut dicamus in prologo huius Capituli, summas sermonis, et capitula, ad quarum intellectum cogitur in primis artifex ad stationem super earum ueritatem: scilicet ut uos, et qui sunt prompti, sciant, uel addiscant hanc artem nobilem, et alii a uobis.	It is necessary that we say in the prolog of this chapter, the summary of the speech, and chapters, to which the understanding of the craftsman on the station of their health: namely, so that you, and who are eager, know, or learn this noble art, and others from you.
Dico, ergo, quod quando accidit alicui fractura, aut dislocatio, aut torsio, aut casus: tunc oportet, ut properes in primis ad phlebotomandum eum, et soluendum ipsum, aut utraque simul: si non prohibeat aliquid, sicut debilitas uirtutis: aut est ille cui accidit aliquid ex illis puer, aut senex decrepitus: aut est tempus uehementis caloris, aut uehementis frigoris ualde.	I say, then, that when it happens to anyone a fracture, or dislocation, or twist, or fall: then you should prepare first to phlebotomize him, and to solve it itself, or both at the same time: if anything prohibits this, such as weakness of virtue: or he is one whose accidebit something from the boy, or the old man's decrepitude: or is the time of a high fever, or cold very much.
Deinde sit contentus in cibo suo, oleribus frigidis, et carnibus auium, et haedorum: et prohibe uinum, et carnes grossas, et repleri ex cibis et omni cibo qui replet uenas sanguine.	Then be satisfied with his food, cold drinks, and meat of birds and beasts; and prohibit wine, thick flesh, and all food which fills the veins with blood.
Donec quando securus sis ex apostemate calido, et non times effusionem materiei ad membrum: tunc redeat infirmus ad regimen suum primum cum quo cucurrit consuetudo eius.	Until he is completely cured from his fever and does not vomit matter into the limbs: then let the sick one return to his routine care first with which his custom runs.
Cum ergo incipit os fractum restaurari, tunc oportet, ut cibetur infirmus cibis nutrientibus nutrimento multo, grosso, graui, in quibus sit uiscositas: sicut cibaria facta ex tritico cocto cum aqua, et rizum, et capita, et pedes, et uentres uaccarum, et oua, et pisces recentes: et uinum grossum, et similia illis.	When the broken jaw begins to be healed, it is necessary that the sick eat food which is very nourishing and thick, in which there is a lot of juice: such as bread made from wheat cooked with water, and rice, and heads, and feet, and livers of animals, and eggs, and recent fish: and strong wine, and similar things.
Cum hoc enim regimine fit coagulatio fracturae uelocius, et melius.	For with this regimen the clotting of the fracture is speeded up, and better.
Et scias, quod ossa fracta, quando sunt in uiris qui sunt in prima senectute, et decrepitis, non est possibile, ut continuentur et consolidentur secundum naturam suam semper, propter exiccationem membrorum eorum: et consolidantur et continuantur quae ex eis sunt in fine lenitatis, sicut ossa puerornm paruorum.	And know that bones which are broken, when they are in years of senility and decrepitude, cannot continue to heal and harden after their nature always: but they heal and become firm in the end of leniity, like the bones of young boys of few years.
Verumtamen natura annectit super os fractum ex omni parte aliquid simile glutino, in quo est grossitudo, quo adhaeret et stringit ipsum, donec conglutinantur adinuicem, et ligantur adinuicem, donec uenit in fine fortitudinis et firmitudinis, sicut fuit in primis, donec non prohibet ipsum aliquid ab operationibus suis: et propter hanc caussam est necesse, ut ponas nutrimentum infirmi cibaria, in quibus sunt grauitas, et uiscositas, et grossitudo, sicut diximus.	However, nature fixes broken bone from all parts with some kind of glue, in which there is thickness, by which it adheres and tightens to itself, until it joins together, and binds together, until it comes to the end of strength and firmness, as it was at first, until it does not prevent its functions: and for this reason it is necessary that you put nourishing food into the sick person's stomach, in which there are fats, and juice, and thickness, as we have said.
Et scias, quod fracturae species sunt diuersae, secundum diuersitatem membrorum: quoniam fractura cruris, est diuersa a fractura ossis capitis: et fractura ossis pectoris, est diuersa a fractura ossis dorsi: et similiter reliqua membra omnia diuersa existunt adinuicem: et ego ueni cum rememoratione omnis speciei fracturae expositae in Capitulo suo distinctae ab alia.	And know that the species of fractures are different, according to the difference of the limbs: for a fracture of the leg is different from a fracture of the head-bone: and a fracture of the breast-bone is different from a fracture of the back-bone: and likewise all other limbs differ from each other: and I come with a reminder of all species of fractures mentioned in their separate chapters from others.
Et diuersificantur species fracturae ossis etiam in seipsa.	They also specified the species of bone fractures and even in themselves.
Quoniam fit fractura eius arcuata, praeter quod accidant in ea astellae.	For the fracture is curved, except that which happens in it, the spines.
Et quandoque fit fractura eius secundum longitudinem ossis: et sunt fracturae eius satagiae, id est, astellae, et additiones procedentes, sicut sunt in calamo, cum aptatur cultello ad scribendum.	And when the fracture is according to the length of the bone: and are fractures of his leg, that is to say, thorns, and additions proceeding, such as are in the reed, when it is caught with a knife for writing.
Et non procedentes: et est fractura cum uulnere et disruptione in capite: et est fractura fissura parua.	And not proceeding: and is the fracture with the ulna and dislocation in the head: and is the fracture small crack.
Et omni speciei est ingenium, uel instrumentum proprium in restauratione eius, secundum quod ueniet rememoratio eius, distincta in locis suis.	And all kinds of art are there, or their own instruments for repairing it, according to the memory of it, distinct in its places.
Et ex eo quo cognoscitur fractura ossis, est tortuositas eius, et ipsius eminentia: et apparitio eius sensui, et sonitus eius quando comprimis ipsum manu tua.	And from that which is known the fracture of the bone, is its bend, and its eminence: and its appearance to the sense, and its sound when you compress it with your hand.
Quando ergo non est in loco tortuositas apparens, neque sonitus apud tactum tuum cum tangis os cum agitatione, neque inuenit infirmus magnum dolorem: tunc non est illic fractura, imo possibile est, ut sit tortuositas, aut fissura parua: non ergo oportet, ut moueas ipsum cum manu et compressione omnino, imo pone super ipsum ex medicinis, quarum uenit rememoratio, post momentum illud quod conuenit loco: deinde stringatur strictura subtili.	And when there is no bend in place, and the sound does not appear to you at your touch, when you press the bone with agitation, and it finds no great pain: then is not there a fracture, but possible that it be a bend, or small crack: so there is no need for you to move it by hand and compression at all, except put over it from among the physicians, of whose memory has come, after time it that comes to place: and then tighten it with a thin knot.
Et scias, quod locus quando arcuatur, et scinditur in duo, praeter quod accidant in eo satagiae, uerumtamen remouetur omnis pars a compari sua: tunc oportet tibi, ut incipias ab hora tua ad rectificationem eius, aequando ipsum antequam accidat ei apostema calidum.	And know that the place when it bends, and is divided into two parts, except that which happens in it, thorns: but all part is removed from its companion: then you need to begin at your hours to straighten it, making equal before it comes the apoplexy of heat.
Si autem accidat ei apostema calidum, tunc dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot, donec quiescat apoestema.	But if it happens to him the heat of apoplexy, then you abandon it for a few days, until he rests the apoplexy.
Deinde aequa ipsum secundum quemcunque modum potest ex lenitate et ingenio.	Then make equal the bone according to any way you can from its slowness and art.
Et scias, quod restauratio eius, et ipsius aequatio, est facilior quam ossis, in quo accidunt satagiae.	And know that the restoration of it, and its equality, is easier than the bones, in which happen thorns.
Deinde stringe ipsum, secundum quod ueniet tibi rememoratio eius.	Then tighten it up, according to how you want to remember it.
Si uero in osse sunt satagiae, tunc necessaria est extensio huius membri fracti ex duabus partibus, si manus sit, aut pes: aut cum manu tua, si membrum est paruum: aut cum duobus funibus, aut cum fune et manu.	If, however, the fractures are in the bones of the hand or foot, then it is necessary to extend this broken member from two sides, whether with your hand or with two strings, or with one string and one hand, or with two hands.
Et sit positio tua qua ponis membrum super locum aequalem, secundum figuram suam naturalem, donec quando extenduntur partes membri fracti: tunc conare, ut redire facias illas additiones omni ingenio, et secundum quemcunque modum potes in locis suis: et caue secundum fortitudinem tuam, ne accidat super infirmum per operationem tuam dolor, neque laesio: et conare secundum fortitudinem tuam, ut applices unum duorum ossium cum socio suo, secundum meliores formas.	And your position should be such that you place the member on an equal location, according to its natural shape, until the parts of the broken member are extended: then strive, so that you can return these additions with all ingenuity, and in any way you can in their places: and carefully, according to your strength, so that pain does not come to the weak through your operation, or injury: and strive, according to your strength, that you apply one or two bones with his partner, according to better shapes.
Et oportet in illa hora, ut tentes et tangas ipsum manu tua.	And it is necessary at that hour for you to try and touch it with your hand.
Si ergo uides illic aliquid diuersum, rectifica ipsum, et aequa illud per quantitatem tuae uirtutis.	If, then, you see something far away, straighten it out, and make it equal in length to the amount of your strength.
Et caue extensionem uehementem, et compressionem fortem, sicut faciunt multi stolidorum.	And strive for a smooth extension, and a strong compression, as many do with the stupids.
Multotiens enim faciunt accidere per operationem illam suam apostema calidum, aut contractionem in membro: sicut iam uidimus illud ex operationibus eorum multotiens.	For many times, such a thing has happened to them through their own operation, hot or contracted in the member: as we have already seen this from their operations many times.
Deinde annecte post aequationem, et decentem operationem, et stricturam illius membri, et quietem, et tranquillitatem: et mone infirmum super ipsum.	Then, after you have made it equal, and the operation is done, and tighten the member, and rest, and peace: and warn the weak about it.
Et fac ipsum cauere, ne moueat ipsum in hora suarum uigiliarum, et somni sui apud reuolutionem suam, et agitationem suam, et apud egestionem suam, et omnes motus suos ultima uirtute sua.	And let him try to calm down, so that he does not move himself at the time of his illness, and his sleep during his crisis, and his agitation during his digestion, and all his movements in his last strength.
Et ut caueat, ne sit positio membri positio cum qua sequatur dolor.	And if he tries to calm down, so that the position of the member is not a position that causes pain.
Quod est, quia quando sentit in dispositione positionis membri dolorem, aut laesionem: tunc oportet, ut permutes ipsum ad dispositionem aliam ab illa cum qua non sentiat dolorem.	That is, because when he feels pain in the position of the member's injury: then it is necessary that you change it to a different position from which he does not feel pain.
Et caue cum illo, ut sit positio eius illa aequalis, recta: ut non accidat in membro tortuositas, quando restauratur.	And care with him, that his position may be equal and straight; lest there be curvature of the member when he is restored.
Et qualitas stricturae membri fracti est, secundum quod narro.	And the quality of a broken bone's stricture is, according to which narrows.
Scias, quod membra fracta diuersificantur in paruitate sua, et eorum magnitudine, et ipsorum forma.	You should know that broken limbs differ in their healing, and in their size and shape.
Quae ergo ex eis sunt parua, sicut brachium, et digitus, et focile, et similia eis, tunc oportet, ut sit inuolutio panni mollis, subtilis.	Which of them are small, such as the arm, and finger, and foot, and the like, then it is necessary that there be a softening of the soft cloth, thin.
Quae autem ex eis sunt grossa, sicut coxa, et crus, oportet ut sit in eis inuolutio lata, dura.	Which of them are thick, such as the hip and leg, then it is necessary that there be a broad softening, hard.
Quoniam ligamentum latum, connectit membrum magnum, et stringit ipsum ab omni parte strictura aequali, ita quod non ingreditur ipsum macula.	Since a broad ligament connects the large member, and tightens it with equal stricture, so that it does not enter it spot.
Deinde incipe post euacuationem tuam ab aequatione ponere linimentum conueniens ad illud, in stuppa leni super locum fracturae ipsius.	Then begin after you have drained it to place the liniment suitable for it, in a soft spot on the site of the fracture.
Deinde incipe inuoluere ligamentum super locum fracturae ipsius tribus inuolutionibus, aut quatuor, secundum quod meretur membrum: et stringe manum tuam parumper cum ligamento.	Then begin to soften the ligament over the site of the fracture four times, or as much as the limb deserves; and grip your hand lightly with the ligament.
Deinde uade cum eo ad partem superiorem a loco fracturae, et stringe minus quam fuit strictura tua, qua strinxisti locum fractum.	Then move it with him to the upper side of the site of the fracture, and grip less than what your own stricture was, which you gripped the broken place.
Deinde elonga te cum inuolutione a loco fracturae parumper, et mollifica stricturam paulatim, donec capias ex loco sano rem magnam.	Then lengthen yourself with the softening slightly from the site of the fracture, and soften the stricture gradually, until you take hold of a large object in place of the healthy member.
Deinde accipe uittam aliam, et inuolue eam iterum super locum fractum inuolutionibus.	Then take another, and soften it again over the broken site with the liniment.
Postea uade cum inuolutione ad partem inferiorem a fractura.	Then move with it to the lower side of the fracture.
Et sit operatio tua in strictura inuolutionis, et mollificatione eius, secundum quod diximus in inuolutione prima superiore.	And let your operation work on the softening and hardening, according to which we said in the first upper softening.
Deinde pone inter inuolutiones ex stuppa leni, aut panno, cum quo aequetur tortuositas fracturae, si est in ea tortuositas: et si non, non ponas in ea aliquid.	Then place between the softings a soft cloth, or cloth, with which to equalize the curvature of the fracture, if there is any curvature in it; and if not, do not place anything in it.
Deinde inuolue super ipsam uittam aliam.	Then take off the bandage and examine the wound again.
Postea aequa super has inuolutiones astellas decenter factas statim, si non est in loco inflatio, neque apostema calidum.	Then immediately remove the bandages that were applied to the wounds, if there is no inflammation or swelling, and check for any signs of infection.
Si autem in ea est inflatio, aut apostema: tunc pone super eam quod sedet illud apostema, et auferat inflationem: et dimitte eam aliquot diebus.	If there is inflammation or a boil: then place something that will help the boil dry up and remove the inflammation; and let it go for a few days.
Deinde stringe super ipsam tunc astellas.	Then tighten the bandage on the wound.
Et sint Astellae ex medietatibus cannae latae, rasae, formatae sapienter: aut sint ex ligno unde fiunt cribra, quae fiunt ex pino, aut geraid, id est, ramis palmae, aut calingi: et sit amplitudo omnis Astellae, secundum hanc formam, et hanc eandem figuram.	And let the bandages be made of pieces of soft leather, shaped wisely; or of pieces of wood from which are made mesh-like screens, made of pine wood or of splinters, that is to say, of palm branches, or of reeds: and let the size of each bandage be according to this form and figure.
Verumtamen oportet, ut Astella quae ponitur super ipsam tracturam, sit grossior et latior parumper, quam reliquae Astellae: et longitudo Astellae sit secundum quod licet membro ex magnitudine et paruitate.	However, it is necessary that the bandage which is placed on the wound should be a little broader and longer than the others; and its length should be determined by the size of the member and its proportion.
Deinde stringe super Astellas cum uitta alia, secundum stricturam primam eandem.	Then tighten the bandages with another one, following the first one's shape.
Deinde liga desuper cum filis decenter, secundum quod diximus de strictura: et est, ut sit strictura tua super locum fracturae plus: et quanto plus elongatur a fractura sit, strictura minor.	Then tie it with loose knots at the top, as we have said before concerning the tightness; and let the tightness be greater than the broken part's location: and to the extent that the break extends, make the tightness less.
Et oportet, ut sint fila media in grossitudine et subtilitate, et sint ex lino molli.	And let the middle threads in thickness and fine be made of soft leather.
Quoniam si fila sunt grossa, sicut uidi ex operatione stolidorum ponentium fila sua ex chordis lini tortis, est error magnus: quoniam cadit strictura cum eis extra qualitatem.	For if the threads are too thick, as happens when they are made from the tendon-like cord of a sheep's belly after it has been stretched, this is a great mistake; for the tightness falls outside its limit.
Et fila subtilia iterum non conueniunt: quoniam tu non consequeris per stricturam cum eis illud quod uis.	And very fine threads do not suit either; for you will not achieve what you want by tying with such thin threads.
Et non oportet, ut sit inter astellam et astellam minus quam digitus.	And it is not right that there should be less than the distance between a finger and its tip between one bandage and another.
Quod si laeditur infirmus per extremitates astellarum post stricturam in locis sanis: tunc pone sub eis ex stuppa leni, aut lana carminata, donec nihil laedatur ex illo.	For if a sick person is bound up by the ends of the bandages after the tightness at the healthy places: then place something soft under the bandages, or red wool, until there is no pain from it.
Quando autem est fractura cum uulnere, et accidit disruptio in cute, ego ueniam cum rememoratione eius in capitulo secundum singularitatem.	When however there is a fracture with the ulna, and there occurs a rupture of the skin, I will come to it with its consideration in the second chapter on its uniqueness.
Et scias, quod non omne membrum fractum oportet ut stringatur cum astellis a primo die.	And know that not every broken limb needs to be held with splints from the first day.
Quod est, quia membrum quando est magnum, non oportet ut ponas superipsum astellas, nisi post quinque dies, aut septem, aut plus, secundum securitatem tuam ab euentu apostematis calidi.	That is, because the limb when it is big, does not need to be put on top of splints, unless after five days, or seven, or more, according to your security from the risk of oozing pus.
Et iste est modus emplastrorum, quibus restaurabant antiqui, quae ponuntur super fracturam et dislocationem.	And this is the method of splints which the ancients used, which are placed on top of the fracture and dislocation.
¶ Modus Emplastri communis abbreuiati, restaurans fracturam, conueniens pluribus complexionibus, praecipue mulieribus, et pueris: quoniam est ex eo super quod non uincit calor, neque frigus.	The common shortened method of the splint, restoring the fracture, suitable for many complexions, especially women and children; because it is not from that one which hurts heat, nor cold.
Et est, ut accipias ex puluere molendini, et est medulla farinae quae pendet in parietibus molendini apud motum molae: et conficias ipsum sicut est, praeter quod cribelles ipsum cum albugine oui: et pone confectionem eius non spissam, neque subtilem.	And it is so that you take from the meal to be ground, and there is flour that hangs on the walls of the grinder at the movement of the mill; and you put it as it is, except that you comb it with white mortar: and you put its coating not thick, nor thin.
Deinde utere eo.	Then use it.
¶ Modus Emplastri alius, restaurantis fracturam, et dislocationem, et torsionem.	The other method of the splint, restoring the fracture, and dislocation, and torsion.
Recipe almess, et laudani, et acaciae, et enulae, et mugath: et suc, omnium ana ʒ X myrrhae, et aloes amborum ana ʒ V et alethil ʒ XX terantur omnia, et cribellentur, et misceantur cum aqua alethil: aut cum albugine oui, si complexio infirmi est calefacta.	Take alum, and olive-tree, and acacia, and goat's hair, and mug; and juice of all 10 myrrh, and aloe of both sexes 5 and alethil 20 let them be mixed with water of alethil, or with white mortar, if the complexion of the wound is warmed.
Deinde utere hoc emplastro.	Then use this splint.
Nam ipsum est bonae compositionis, restaurat ossa fracta uelociter, et confert pluribus hominibus.	For this splint is good composition, restores bones quickly, and suits many people.
¶ Modus Emplastri alius, quod etiam confert fracturae et torsioni.	The other method of the splint, which also suits fractures and torsion.
Recipe mugath, et mess, et alteae albae, omnium ana ʒ X myrrhae, et aloes amborum ana ʒ V acaciae ʒ VI boli armeni ʒ XX terantur omnia contritione multa, et cribellentur, et conficiantur cum aqua, aut albugine oui: et administrentur.	Take mug, and alum, and alethia white, all 10 myrrh, and aloe of both sexes 5 and acacia 6 and bolus of Armenia 20 let them be mixed with a lot of water, or with white mortar, and let them be applied.
¶ Modus Emplastri ad iuncturas, et ossa separata ex locis suis: et sedat dolorem accidentem eis, et scissuram ossis, et fracturam.	The mode of preparing poultices for bandages, and separate bones from their places; it will soothe their pain, injury, bone-cutting, and fracture.
Sumatur lana succida, et submergatur in aceto, et oleo decocto: et ponatur super locum.	Take wet wool and dip it in vinegar and oil-infused wine; and place it on the spot.
Et in hoc quidem Emplastro non est uirtus restaurationis, sed est bonum in sedatione apostematis calidi: et expellit dolores proprie.	And in this (type of poultice) there is no virtue of restoring health, but it is good for soothing boil-like swelling: and it drives away its own pains.
¶ Modus Emplastri, quod restaurat os fractum.	The mode of poulticing, which restores a broken bone.
Sume folia fici surdi, et folia papaueris syluestris: et tere omnia, et fac emplastrum ex utrisque.	Take leaves from the oak tree and leaves from the plantain tree; and dry them thoroughly, and make a poultice out of both.
¶ Modus Emplastri abbreuiati, administrati apud restaurationem fracturae ossis: et quando tu uis resolutionem residui apostematis.	The mode of a shortened poultice, applied at the restoration of a bone fracture; and when you wish to resolve a boil-like swelling.
Recipe radicis alteae, et camomillae, et florum uiolarum, et farinae herbi, omnium ana partem unam: terantur omnia, et conficiantur cum uino, si non est membrum calefactum.	Recollect root of the aloes plant, and camomile, and flowers of violets, and herb flour; all in equal parts: dry them thoroughly, and make a paste with wine, if it is not a member that needs to be warmed.
Si uero est calefactum, tunc confice illud cum aqua coriandri humidi, aut cum aqua, et utere eo.	If it (the member) does need to be warmed, then make the paste with water and coriander seed, or with water alone, and use it.
¶ Modus Emplastri alius fortioris in resolutione, quam istud primum, quando accidit apostema durum apud restaurationem membri.	The mode of a stronger poultice for resolving a boil-like swelling during the restoration of a member, rather than this one first, when it occurs.
Recipe radicis alteae, et seminis lini, et balaustiae, et melliloti, et samsuci, et floris uiolarum, et camomillae, omnium ana, partem unam, terantur omnia, et conficiantur cum aqua salicis, aut cum aqua dulci, aut cum uino.	Recollect root of the aloes plant, and flax seed, and poplar bud, and mallows, and water-leaf plant, and flower of violet, and camomile; all in equal parts, dry them thoroughly, and make a paste with oak-water, or with sweet water, or with wine.
Totum illud secundum caliditatem membri, et quietem caloris eius.	All this depends on the heat of the member, and the relief from heat.
Hippocrates uero non dixit in libro suo, quod ponatur super membrum fractum apud restaurationem eius, nisi caerotum factum ex caera, et oleo: non aliud: et narrauit, ut sit medium inter grossitudinem et subtilitatem.	Hippocrates did not say, in his book, that a poultice should be placed on a broken member for its restoration, except one made from cerates and oil; nothing else: he related, that it should be of an intermediate nature between gruel and lightness.
Galeno autem uisum est, ut ponantur super membrum fractum apud restaurationem eius res, in quibus est exiccatio caliditatis, sicut myrrha, et aloes et olibanum, et similia eis ex eis quae narrauimus.	Galen, however, considered it essential to apply these remedies on a broken limb while restoring its function, where there is drying up of heat, such as myrrh, and aloes and olive resin, and similar substances from those which we have mentioned.
¶ Modus Emplastri quod confert ad laesionem et dolorem.	The mode of use of the plaster which is useful for wounds and pain:
Recipe mugath, et ciceris, et capillorum hominis incisorum, aut pennae auis, et alteae, et salis partes aequales: terantur, et cribellentur, et conficiantur: et fiat ex eo emplastrum.	Take myrrh, and chickpeas, and hair of men's heads, or feathers of birds, and resin, and equal parts of salt: crush them, and pound them, and form them into a plaster.
Quantitas autem secundum quam oportet, ut remaneat ligatura, deinde soluatur, est, ut consideres tunc, si non accidit infirmo dolor, neque pruritus, neque mouetur os fractum a loco suo: tunc non resoluas ipsum diebus multis.	The quantity however, according to what is necessary, so that the bandage remains on, then dissolves, is such, as you consider then, if no pain does not happen, and itching, and the broken bone does not move from its place: then do not dissolve it over several days.
Quod si accidat ei in loco pruritus uehemens, aut dolor inquietans, aut inflatio: tunc propera, et solue in hora ipsum, et aufer emplastrum ab eo: et accipe pannum lenem, aut spongiam marinam lenem, humidam: et submerge eam in aqua tepida, et ablue cum ea locum, donec quiescat pruritus, et sedetur dolor.	If however it happens to him in the place severe itching, or disturbing pain, or swelling: then proceed, and dissolve at once, and remove the plaster from him: and take a cloth of linen, or sea sponge of linen, wet with water: and dip it into the water, and wash with it the place, until the itching is calm, and the pain subsides.
Deinde dimitte membrum quiescere una hora.	Then let go of the limb for a rest of one hour.
Deinde pone super ipsum lanam succidam, submersam in aceto et oleo, aut oleo rosato: et liga super ipsum nocte una, donec sis securus ab apostemate calido, et quiescat inflatio membri, et remoueatur dolor eius.	Then put over it a cloth of linen dipped in vinegar and oil, or in oil infused with wine: and bind it on for the night, so that he does not come in contact with any hot thing, and the swelling of the limb subsides, and the pain of his member is calmed.
Deinde itera ipsum ad stricturam subtilem, et emplastrum paruum: et non stringas ipsum constrictione tua prima, et subtilia cum eo, donec sanetur.	Then repeatedly apply to him a slight tightening, and a small plaster: and do not tighten him with your own hand first, and fine things, until he is healed.
Quod si uides, quod apostema, et rubedo, et dolor, et inflatio, et omnia accidentia iam remota sunt penitus, et indiges emplastro et strictura, tunc itera illud sicut fecisti in primis aequaliter.	That if you see that the swelling, and redness, and pain, and swelling, and all accidents are completely gone away, and you do not feel either the plaster or the tightening, then again apply to him as you did before equally:
Quod si non accidit membro aliquid ex eis quae diximus, tune non soluas ipsum, nisi post tres dies, aut quatuor, aut quinque, aut septem.	If any of these things do not happen to a member, then do not remove it, unless after three days, or four, or five, or seven.
Et quando que dimittitur uiginti diebus totum illud, secundum quod apparet tibi ex solutione membri, sicut diximus, donec quando adhaeret fractura, et approximat coagulatio carnis super eam: adde etiam tunc in strictura plus quam strictura tua prima tota: et adde etiam in ingrossatione cibi infirmi, secundum quod praecessit rememoratio eius.	And when the member is removed after forty days as it appears to you from the removal of the member, as we said, until the fracture is united and the clotting of the flesh over it: add also then more than your first stricture in all its parts: and add also in the increase of food sickness, according as preceded the recollection of it.
Si autem uides locum fracturae iam exiccari, et extenuari plus quam oportet: tunc scias, quod nutrimentum prohibetur peruenire ad ipsum.	But if you see the place of the fracture already drying up and growing less than is necessary: then know that food should be forbidden to reach it.
Embroca ergo ipsum cum aqua tepida apud omnem uicem qua soluis ipsum, et sit illud in omnibus tribus diebus, et alleuia stricturam parumper.	So wrap up the member with warm water at every joint, and let it rest for three days, and allow a little bit of pain.
Per hanc ergo operationem currit ad membrum nutrimentum, et sanatur uelociter.	By this operation runs towards the member food, and heals quickly.
Illud autem quod faciunt stolidi restauratores ex fractura membri uice alia, quando non restauratur in primis, secundum quod oportet, et restauratur secundum tortuositatem, est error ex operatione eorum, et timor magnus: et si esset rectum, dixissent illud antiqui in libris suis, et operati fuissent cum eo.	But that which the stupid surgeons do from the fracture of a member, when they do not restore it first, according as it should be restored, and restore it according to the curvature, is an error from their operation, and a great fear: and if it had been right, the ancients in their books would have said so, and would have operated with it.
Et ego non uidi alicubi eorum uestigium in illo omnino, et rectius est, ut non fiat illud.	And I did not see anywhere their trace in that at all, and it is better that it should not be made.
¶ De factura accidente in capite.	On making an accident in the head.
Caput III.	Head.
Species fracturae sunt diuersae, et figurae eius multae: et caussae eius sunt distinctae.	There are various kinds of fractures and many forms of it: and its causes are separate.
Nam ex fractura est quae fit a percussione cum ense: et percussio aufert os totum usquequo peruenit ad siphac, quod est sub osse, sicut facit axia in ligno: et propter illud nominatur haec species fracturae Axialis.	For from the fracture is caused by a blow, and the blow carries away the whole bone as far as it reaches to the socket, which is under the bone, just as the ax does in the wood: and therefore this kind of fracture is called the axial fracture.
Aut ensis incidit quiddam ossis, et incidit faciem eius, et non penetrat incisio usque ad ultimum eius: et nominatur haec species fracturae Kalaan, id est, Leuatio absolute.	Or a blade cuts some bone, and cuts its face, and does not pierce the incision as far as its last part: and is called this kind of fracture the Kayan, that is, an absolute slant.
Et est uulnus duarum fracturarum, aut magnum, aut paruum.	And it is a break of two fractures, or great, or small.
Et ex fractura est, quae est contritio, aut attritio: et caussa eius est percussio cum lapide, aut casus super lapidem, aut eis similia.	And from the fracture there is a rupture, or rubbing, and its cause is a blow with a stone, or a fall on a stone, or similar things.
Et haec fractura est etiam aut penetrans, quae iam appropinquat panniculo, quod est sub osse: aut est in facie ossis: et est uulnus harum duarum fracturarum etiam aut paruum, aut magnum.	And this fracture is also penetrating, which is beginning to approach the skin, which is under the bone: or it is on the face of the bone: and it is a break of these two fractures as well, either small, or great.
Et ex fractura est, quae est occulta in osse in subtilitate capilli: et est fissura parua, et propter illud nominatur haec species fracturae Capillaris.	And from the fracture is that which is hidden in the bone in subtlety of a hair: and it is a small crack, and for this reason this kind of fracture is called a capillary fracture.
Et ex eis est fractura, quae fit a casu, aut percussione lapidis, et eis similium, quae faciunt ingredi laminam ossis ad interiora, et fit loco concauitas: sicut accidit caldariis aeris, quando occurrit eis percussio, et ingreditur pars eorum ad interiora.	And from these is a fracture which is made by a fall, or by the impact of a stone, and similar things, which makes it so that a layer of bone is crushed and crushed on the inside: as happens in the case of pot-ash, when it falls upon it and it is crushed on the inside.
Et plurimum quidem fit illud in capitibus humidorum ossium, sicut sunt capita puerorum.	And indeed this often happens to that in the heads of moist bones, as are the heads of children.
Et fiunt omnibus istis speciebus fracturae satagiae separatae, et ego ueniam cum rememoratione illius totius in loco suo.	And all these kinds of fracture separate and I remember them all together in their place.
Et cognoscimus omnes has species fracturae per detectionem super eam, et inquisitionem earum cum tentis, et ablationem carnium corruptarum, quae sunt super eas.	And we know all these kinds of fractures by detection over them, and by questioning them with probes, and by cutting away the corrupted flesh that is on them.
Species uero Capillaris cognoscitur per hoc, quod detegitur super os, et abstergitur, et linitur super ipsum cum encaustro: fractura enim apparet nigra.	Indeed this kind of Capillary fracture is recognized when it appears on the bone, and is scrubbed, and is coated on the top with caustics: for a black spot appears.
In curatione autem fracturae, considera in primis accidentia infirmi: tunc si uides ex accidentibus quod significet significatione manifesta super timorem, sicut uomitus cholerae, et extensio, et amissio intellectus, et abscisio uocis, et syncopis, et febris acuta, et egressus oculorum, et rubedo eorum, et similia eis ex accidentibus in pluribus dispositionibus, proculdubio non sanatur: et si uides accidentia non terrentia te, et speras salutem: tunc incipe curationem eius.	In the treatment of a fracture, first consider these nursing matters: if you see from these matters that which means a clear meaning on worry, such as cholera breath, and spreading, and loss of intellect, and deafness, and sudden speaking, and high fever, and red eyes, and similar things to these accidents in many dispositions, it is certainly not cured: and if you see that which does not terrify you, and you hope for healing: then begin its treatment.
Quod est, si uenit ad te uulneratus in primis cum uulneratur: et est illud in diebus hyemis, tunc oportet, ut studeas in ablatione ossis ante diem quartumdecimum secundum omnem dispositionem.	If he comes to you wounded in the beginning when he is wounded: and that it is on the half-days, then you should study in the removal of bone before the fourteenth day according to all the arrangement.
Et si est in diebus aestatis, tunc oportet, ut properes remouere os ante diem septimum, antequam corrumpatur quod est sub osse ex panniculo, et accidant illa accidentia quae narrauimus.	And if it is on the days of summer, then you should remove the bone before the seventh day before it corrupts what is under the bone from a flap, and those accidents which we have described.
Quod si fractura ossis iam peruenit ad panniculum tangentem cerebrum, et est cum minutiis, et attractione: tunc oportet, ut incidas partem comminutam, et attritam, secundum quod narro tibi.	That if the fracture of the bone has already reached the flap touching the brain, and it is with small ones, and by attraction: then you should break off the broken part, crushed, according to what I tell you.
Et est, ut radas caput uulnerati: et detege super os secundum quemcunque modum possibile est tibi: et secundum figuram uulneris, et quod leue est super infirmum.	And it is, so that you shave the head of the wounded person: and you should detect above the bone according to any possible way for you: and according to the figure of the wound, and what is light is above the weak.
Quod si accidat tibi apud detectionem ossis fluxus sanguinis, aut apostema calidum: tunc oppone ei cum eo quod oportet.	That if it happens to you in the detection of the bone, the flow of blood or warm pulp: then you should oppose it with that which is necessary.
Et est, ut impleas locum cum pannis infusis in uino, et oleo rosato: et facias quiescere uulnus, donec sedetur apostema, et sis securus a fluxu sanguinis.	And it is, so that you fill the place with rags soaked in wine, and olive oil: and make the bone rest until the pus stops, and you are safe from the flow of blood.
Deinde incipe in curatione ossis, et ablatione eius.	Then begin in the cure of the bone, and in its removal.
Et illud fit secundum unum duorum modorum.	And that should be done according to one of two ways.
Modus quidem unus est, ut incidas os cum Incisorio strictae aciei: et haec est forma eius.	The way is one, so that you break the bone with a sharp chisel: and this is the form of it.
Dende administra Incisorium aliud post Incisorum latius eo parumper: et haec est forma eius.	And there is another way, so that you administer an Incisory other after an Incisory wider by a little bit: and this is the form of it.
Deinde administra etiam Incisorium aliud latius etiam quam secundum.	Then also administer an Incisory other wider than the second.
Et modus secundus est, ut sit apud te numerus Incisoriorum diuersorum: quorum quaedam sint latiora quibusdam, et quaedam eorum breuiora quibusdam: et sint in ultimo acuitatis extremitatum suarum, et sint ex ferro indo, aut fuled: et utere facilitate in percussione super Incisorium, ut non concutiat caput, et laedat ipsum.	And the second way is, so that it is with you a number of Incisors different: some are wider to some, and some of them are shorter to some: and let there be at the end of their acuity their extremities, and let they be made of iron, or oil: and let you use convenience in striking over the Incisor, so that it does not wound the head, and hurts itself.
Si autem os est forte, durum: tunc oportet, ut perfores in circumitu eius, antequam tu administres Incisoria, cum Terebris quae nominantur Terebra non profundantia: et non nominantur ita, nisi quoniam ipsa non pertranseunt terminum ossis carnei ad illud, quod est post ipsum: propterea, quod Terebro est extremitas rotunda super illud, quod est sub capite eius acuto, similis margini, et circulus paruus prohibet submergi, et pertransire spissitudinem ossis.	If the jaw is strong and firm: then you should perform incisions around it before administering incisions with blades that do not cut deep: and they are not called so unless they do not pass beyond the bone to that which is behind it, because the temporal bone is round at its extremities, similar in shape to the tip of the jaw, and a small circle prevents it from sinking and passing through the thickness of the bone.
Et conuenit tibi, ut accipias ex istis Terebris numerum multum, quorum unumquodque conueniat quantitati spissitudinis ossis, donec praesens sit tibi omni craneo Terebrum: cuius extremitatis acutae quantitas in longitudine et breuitate sit, secundum quantitatem spissitudinis illius cranei.	And it is fitting that you take from these temporals a large number, of which each corresponds to the thickness of the bone, until you have all the cranial Temporals: the extremities of whose sharp ends are in length and brevity according to the thickness of its bone.
Et haec est forma trium specierum Terebrorum, uel Trepanorum.	And this is the shape of the three types of temporal bones, or craniums.
Qualitas autem perforandi in circumitu ossis fracti, est: ut ponas Terebrum super os, et reuoluas ipsum digitis tuis, donec scias, os iam penetratum esse.	The quality of the cut around the fractured bone is: when you place the temporal bone on the bone and rotate it with your fingers, until you know that the bone has already penetrated.
Deinde permuta Terebrum ad locum alium, et pone quod est inter omne foramen quantitatem grossitudinis radii, aut circiter illud.	Then change the temporal bone to another place, and put what is between all the pores of its thickness or around it.
Deinde incide cum Incisoriis quod est inter omne foramen ex osse: et fac illud subtilius quam potes super illud ex fine leuitatis, sicut diximus, donec eradices os, aut manu tua, aut cum aliquo alio ex quibusdam instrumentis, quae parasti ad illud: sicut tenaliae, et forpices subtiles.	Then cut with the blades between all the pores from the bone, and make it thinner than you can from its edge of lightness, as we have said, until you have cut through the bone, or with your hand, or with any other tool that you have prepared for it: such as scalpel and fine forceps.
Et oportet, ut caueas omni cautela, ne tangat Terebrum, aut Incisorium aliquid ex siphac.	And you should be careful not to touch the temporal bone or any of the blades from the skin.
Cum ergo circumieris os perforando, et separatum fuerit a siphac, si fuerit continuum cum eo, et extraxeris ipsum, oportet ut radas, et aeques extremitatem eius quod remanet in osse cum instrumento alio simili Incisorio.	When you have finished cutting around the bone and it is separated from the skin, if it is continuous with it, and you extract it: you should cut, and equalize its end that remains in the bone with another blade similar to the incisor.
Verumtamen oportet, ut sit tenuis et subtilis magis aliis Incisoriis.	However, it is fitting that it is thin and subtle rather than other blades.
Quod si remanet aliquid ex ossibus paruis, et satagiae: tunc accipe ea cum facilitate, cum eo quod est apud te ex instrumentis.	If there remains anything of the small bones, and of the sagittal bone: then take them easily, with that which is with you from the instruments.
Deinde cura uulnus post illud cum liciniis, et unguentis quae diximus.	Then care for the wound after that with linen, and with the ointment which we have spoken about.
Et modus alius operationis est facilis, prorsus longinquus a timore: quem dixit Galenus, et laudauit ipsum laude magna: et iste est sermo eius.	And another mode of the operation is easy, verily far from fear: which said Galen, and praised it highly: and this is his speech.
Necese est tibi in primis, ut incipias detegere partem ossis ex loco, in quo fractura est uehementior, et manifestior: donec quando detexeris illam partem, et posueris sub eo extremitatem huius Incisorii lenticularis, cuius haec est forma.	Necessarily it is you in the first place, that you begin to grasp the side of the bone in the place where the fracture is more severe and more manifest: until when you have grasped it, and put this lens-shaped incisor under it, whose this form is.
Et pars lenticularis, lenis non incidit aliquid: et pars acuta eius in duabus lateribus eius uadens in longitudinem, sicut uides: ut sit pars lenticularis innixa ad siphac, facie eius incidente acuta in osse.	And the lens-shaped part, gentle does not incise anything: and the acute sides of it rubbing in length, as you see: that the lens-shaped part is placed on the siphum, the face of it incidently acute into the bone.
Deinde percute super Incisorium a parte una cum malleo paruo, donec incidas totum os cum facilitate, sicut reuoluitur: et tu sis securus ex panniculo, quod non accidat in eo accidens, quod timeas prorsus.	Then strike over the incisor from one side with a little mallet, until you strike all the bone with ease, as it is turned over: and you are safe from the pannicle, which does not happen to it at all, that there does not occur in it what you fear verily.
Et si medicans non esset stultior hominum, et magis ignarus eius, nec esset dormiens, tunc si remaneret aliquid annexum ossi ex panniculo in quibusdam locis, incideret ipsum ab eo cum extremitate incisorii lenticularis ipsius, et liberaret ipsum ab eo cum facilitate.	And if the medicant is not stupider of men, and more ignorant of it, and is not asleep, then if there remained anything attached to the bone from the pannicle in some places, he would strike him from it with the end of the lens-shaped incisor, and free him from it with ease.
Liberatur enim ab eo sine nocumento, et absque timore.	Is liber is liber: et sicut diximus, non uel in uellicione, sed in locis illius, cum ossibus paruis ex panniculo:
Et si fractura ossis non penetret usque ad panniculum, et illud quod abscinditur ab osse est facies eius, et remanent in ipso asperitas et satagiae subtiles: tunc oportet, ut radas illam asperitatem, et eradices illas satagias cum rasoriis subtilibus ex quibus praeparasti numerum diuersarum quantitatum, ut sit tibi possibile administrare ex eis in omni loco conuenientiora eorum, et rectiora ipsorum, secundum illud ad quod perducit te operatio, et ipsum os fractum, et figura eius.	For it is free and without harm: and as we have said, not in the place of the incisor, but in his place, with the small bones from the pannicle: then, if the fracture of the bone does not penetrate to the pannicle, and that which is separated from the bone is the face of it, and there remain in it roughness and subtle sagittal: then it is necessary, that you rasps this roughness, and plucks out these sagittals with fine razors from which you have prepared a number of diverse quantities, so that it is possible for you to administer them in every place convenient for them, and righter for them, according to the one which leads you to the operation, and the fractured bone, and its form.
Et oportet, ut administres in rasione tua, qua in primis radis os, latius illorum rasoriorum.	It is necessary that you cut with your razors, at first, the roots of the teeth widely.
Deinde utere post ipsum subtiliore eo.	Then use a thinner razor after it.
Et non cesses facere illud secundum continuitatem, donec peruenias ad administrandum tenuius, et subtilius eorum omnium.	And do not cease doing that in succession, until you have come to cut them all with the thinner and more slender ones.
In unaquaque autem fissurarum reliquarum paruarum capillarium, et fractura subtili, oportet ut administres curam, secundum illud quod perducit ad rectificationem eius.	In each of the small gaps between the teeth, and in the slender hairs, and in the tiny crack, it is necessary that you exercise care, according to that which brings about its correction.
Et est res quae non occultatur super omnem, cui in hac arte est quodlibet studium, et stetit super illud quod scripsimus, et ostendimus in fracturis magnis.	And it is a thing that does not remain hidden over all, to which in this art is any study, and stands on that which we have written and shown in the large cracks.
Si autem panniculus detectus retinetur, quando tu eradicas os: tunc oportet, ut accipias pannum lini, secundum quantitatem uulneris, et submerge ipsum in oleo rosa, et pone ipsum super orificium uulneris.	If however a little patch is caught and held back when you cut the teeth: then it is necessary that you take a piece of linen cloth, according to the quantity of blood, and dip it into rose oil, and place it over the opening of the wound.
Deinde accipe pannum alium duplicatum, aut triplicatum, et submerge ipsum in uino et oleo rosa, et pone ipsum super pannum primum: et fac illud quam facilius potes super illud, ut non grauetur siphac.	Then take another piece of cloth, doubled or tripled, and dip it into wine and rose oil, and place it over the first cloth: and make it so that you can do it as easily as possible over it, so that it does not itch.
Deinde administra supra ipsum ligamentum latum: et non stringas ipsum, nisi per quantitatem quae teneat uulnus tantum: et dimitte ipsum cum hac cura die uno, aut diebus duobus, donec sis securus ab apostemate calido.	Then apply over it a wide bandage: and do not tighten it, unless by the quantity which holds the wound only: and let it go with this cure for one or two days, until you are free from scabs.
Deinde solue ipsum, et administra post illud medicinas cum quibus est superflua siccitas: sicut radices lilii, et farina herbi, et puluis thuris, et aristolochia, et similia eis: et est, ut facias ex istis medicinis puluerem, qui puluerizetur super uulnus sicut sunt siccae.	Then dissolve it, and apply after it the medicines with which dryness is unnecessary: such as the roots of lilies, and the flour of herbs, and the dust of thorns, and the aristicola, and others like them: and it is, that you should make from these medicines a powder, which you spread over the wound like those which are dry.
Et uniuersaliter administra in illo omnem medicinam de proprietate cuius est ut abstergat, et non mordicet.	And apply generally in it all the medicine of the property by which it cleanses and does not bite.
Et caue secundum tuam uirtutem, ut uulnus in curatione tua sit limpidum: neque sit in ea sordes unguenti, neque sordicies.	And take care, according to your power, that the wound in your cure is clear: and that it is not in it any resin of ointment, or any dirtiness.
Neque dimittas uirus aggregari in eo omnino: quoniam quando uirus aggregatur super panniculum cerebri, corrumpit eum, et putrefacit ipsum, et accidit super infirmum post illud malicia magna: et iam accidit in siphac capitis, cum mundificatur ab eo os, praecipue quando negligitur cura eius, nigredo in superficie eius.	And do not leave the virus to aggregate therein at all; for when the virus aggregates on the brain's skin, it corroded and rotten, and happened upon the sick one a great evil: and indeed it happened in the head's pit when it was opened from it a mouth, especially when its care was neglected, and blackness appeared on its surface.
Considera ergo tunc, si accidunt infirmo accidentia quae diximus, scias, quia est pernitiosum proculdubio.	Therefore, consider then, if accidents happen to the sick person which we have said, you will know that it is certainly dangerous.
Et si nigredo non accidit, nisi a medicina quae ponitur super ipsum, et est in uirtute illius medicinae, ut faciat illam nigredinem: tunc oportet, ut accipias ex melle partem unam, ex oleo rosato partes tres, et linias cum eis pannum.	And if blackness does not happen, except if a medicine is placed on it, and it is in the power of that medicine to make it black: then you should take from honey one part, from rose oil three parts, and with them a cloth.
Deinde pone ipsum super siphac: postea cura ipsum cum speciebus curationis quae conueniunt, donec sanetur.	Then put the [head] on the pit: then take care of it with cure species which are appropriate, until it heals.
¶ De restauratione Nasi quando frangitur.	Of restoration of the nose when it is broken.
Caput IIII.	Chapter III.
Scias, quod non franguntur ex Naso nisi duae partes eius superiores simul, aut una earum: propterea, quod ipse sunt duo ossa: quoniam inferius eius est cartilaginosum, non frangitur, et non accidit ei nisi attritio, et tortuositas, et simitas.	You know that the nose is not broken unless both of its upper parts break at the same time, or one of them; for it has two bones: indeed, its lower part is cartilaginous, and does not break, nor does it happen to it except for wear, and wrinkling, and stretching.
Si frangitur una duarum partium eius, tunc oportet, ut intromittas digitum paruum in foramen Nasi, et aeques illam fracturam digito tuo indice, et pollice deforis, donec redeat Nasus super figuram suam naturalem: et fiat illud arte, cum facilitate.	If one of its two parts breaks, then you should put your little finger in the nose's hole, and align the break with your index finger and thumb, until it returns to its natural shape: and do this with ease.
Et caue, ne accidat per operationem tuam illam super infirmum dolor.	And so, that the pain does not happen to him by your operation,
Quod si fractura est in superiore parte Nasi, et non perueniat ad illam digitus: tunc oportet, ut aequetur extremitate radii, in quo sit grossitudo parua.	That if the break is in the upper part of the nose, and does not reach the tip of it with a finger: then you should even out its edge, where there is little thickness.
Si uero fractura est in duabus partibus, tunc fac simile illius: et propera cum restauratione eius in die primo fracturae, si est possibile.	If, however, the break is in both of its parts, then you should make it similar: and properly take care of its restoration on the first day that it broke, if possible.
Et si non, tunc post diem septimum, aut decimum apud quietem apostematis calidi.	And if not, then after the seventh day, or tenth day by the heat of apotheosis calm.
Deinde intromitte in extremitate Nasi licinium ex panno lini, si fractura est in parte una: aut intromite duo licinia si fractura est in duabus partibus: et sit in licinio grossitudo tantae quantitatis, quae impleat foramen Nasi.	Then introduce into the nostril a licineum made of linen cloth if it has been fractured in one part; or introduce two licineums if it has been fractured in two parts: and let the thickness of the licineum be such a quantity as to fill the nostral hole.
Et dixerunt quidam antiquorum restauratorum, ut infundantur licinia in butyro, et permutentur omni die.	And some ancient restorers said, that they should be filled with licineum in butter, and should be changed every day.
Illud uero non uidetur mihi, imo oportet, ut infundatur licinium in albugine oui, confecto cum puluere molendini.	That is not the truth, but it seems to me that it should be filled with licineum in albinus when it is finely ground with powder for grinding.
Deinde dimitte licinium, donec firmetur os, et induretur cartilago.	Then let go of the licineum until the hole has closed up and the cartilage has hardened.
Et quandoque intromittitur in Nasum loco licinii penna anseris, postquam inuoluitur super ipsam pannus lenis: et fit, quod ipsa tenet fracturam Nasi uehementius, et ut non prohibeatur infirmus ab inspiratione.	And sometimes when a goose feather is introduced into the nose instead of licineum after it has been wrapped in a soft cloth; and this does so that the fracture in the nose is held more firmly together, and prevents the sick from being prevented from breathing.
Et non est haec res necessaria.	This is not necessary.
Si uis, fac illud: et si uis, fac licinia.	If you want to do this, then do so: and if you want to use licineum, then use licineum.
Quod si accidat Naso iterum dum operaris apostema calidum, emplastra nasum cum caeroto, aut cum coto infuso in oleo rosato, aut modico ex dyaquilon.	What if, while you are operating, the nose becomes hot again because of the heat of apotheosis; then fill the nose with hamamelis, or with a little oil infused with rosemary, or with a little diacetylmonosodium.
Si autem non accidit apostema calidum, tunc oportet, ut emplastres ipsum cum farina sisami, et puluere thuris confecti cum albugine oui.	But if the heat of apotheosis does not occur, then it should be filled with a paste made of sisa flour and a thuris powder mixed with albinus.
Deinde pone super ipsum stuppam lenem, et non liges Nasum cum aliquo omnino.	Then put on the nose a little wooden chip, and do not stick the nose with anything at all.
Si uero franguntur ossa Nasi fractura parua, aut comminuuntur, tunc oportet, ut scindas super ea, et extrahas ipsa cum instrumentis quae conueniunt eis.	But if the nasal bones have been broken or crushed, then you should split them open and take out the bone with the instruments that are suitable for this purpose.
Deinde sue scissuram, et cura ipsum cum eo quod incarnat, et consolidat ex emplastris conuenientibus ad illud, uel unguentis.	Then cut off the skin, and take care of the nose when it has been ingrown, and consolidated by the paste that is suitable for this purpose, or with ointment.
Quod si accidat inter Nasum uulnus, tunc oportet, ut cures ipsum cum liciniis: et administres cannulam de plumbo, donec sanetur.	If a fracture occurs between the nose and upper jaw, then it is necessary to treat the person with liniments: and administer a lead tube, until healing takes place.
¶ De restauratione Mandibulae inferioris, quando disrumpitur.	The restoration of the lower jaw, when broken.
Caput V.	Chapter V.
Quando disrumpitur Mandibula inferior, et fractura eius non est cum uulnere: conspice tunc si est fractura eius deforis tantum, et non frangitur in duo, et curuatur ad interiora: tunc cognitio eius est facilis.	When the lower jaw is broken, and the fracture is not with the ulna: examine then if it is only a fracture of the bone, and does not break into two pieces, and treat internally: then it is easy to know.
Oportet ergo, si est fractura eius in parte dextra, ut intromittas digitum indicem sinistrae in os infirmi: similiter si fractura est in mandibula sinistra, tunc intromitte indicem manus dextrae: et impelle cum eo gibbositatem fracturae deintus cum facilitate ad exteriora cum manu tua altera ab interiori parte ossis decenter, et cum eo aequa ipsam.	Therefore, if the fracture is in the right part of the jaw, insert your index finger of the left hand into the hole: likewise, if the fracture is on the left side of the jaw, then insert the index finger of the right hand: and push it towards the outside with ease from the inside with your other hand, and thus adjust it evenly.
Quod si fractura mandibulae iam separata est in duo, tunc oportet, ut administres extersionem a duabus partibus, secundum rectitudinem: donec possibilis sit aequatio eius.	If the fracture of the jaw has already separated into two pieces, then it is necessary to administer extension from both parts, according to the straightness: until the adjustment is possible.
Si autem iam accidit in dentibus commotio, aut disruptio: tunc stringe illos de quibus speras quod remaneant cum filo auri, aut argenti, aut seta.	But if it has already happened in the teeth, a movement or rupture: then tighten them with a gold wire, or silver, or silk thread.
Deinde pone super mandibulam fractam caerotum.	Then put over the broken jaw of the wound.
Deinde pone super ipsum pannum duplicatum, et pone super pannum astellam magnam decenter factam: aut frustum cutis soleae aequale, in longitudinem mandibulae.	Then put over the wound a doubled cloth, and put over the cloth a large piece of skin cut to fit: or a fragment of sole skin, equal in length to the jaw.
Deinde liga ipsum desuper, secundum quod praeparatur tibi ligatura eius, et conuenit ipsius applicatio, donec non destruitur: et praecipe infirmo, uti tranquillitate et quiete: et pone cibum eius sorbitiones lenes.	Then bind the wound from above, according to how you prepare your bindings, and the application suits him, until it is not destroyed: and instruct the sick person to use tranquillity and silence: and provide him with soft food.
Si autem estimas, quod iam alteratur aliquid figurae aliquo modorum: tunc propera, et solue ipsum in die tertio.	But if you think that something has changed in some way: then come closer, and unravel it on the third day.
Deinde rectifica quod alteratum est ex eo, et emplastra ipsum ex puluere molendini, cum albugine oui, aut cum farina sisami, postquam tu abstuleris caerotum: et pone super emplastrum lanam lenem.	Then straighten out what has been changed from it, and patch up the wound with flour ground, mixed with chalk, or with semolina, after you have removed the wound: and put over the patch wool yarn.
Dum ergo permanet annexum illud emplastrum super ipsum, et non alteratur ossis dispositio, dimitte ipsum, ne soluas, donec sanetur: aut stringe fracturam.	While that attachment remains on the wound, and the bone arrangement does not change, release it, do not separate, until healing: or hold the fracture together.
Multotiens enim stringitur haec fractura in tribus septimanis.	For this fracture is often tightened for seven days.
Quod si interim accidat apostema calidum, tunc administra illud quod diximus multotiens in sedatione eius, donec remoueatur illud apostema.	If, however, a fever arises during the time of the compression, then administer to it what I have said frequently in the sedative [treatment], until that apoplexy removes itself.
Et si fractura est cum uulnere, considera.	And if the fracture is with the ulna, consider.
Namsi iam separatur ex osse frustum, aut a satagie: tunc subtilia te in hoc, ut auferas illa frusta satagiae cum eo quod conuenit tibi in ablatione eorum ex instrumentis.	Now I separate the little fragment from the bone, or from the saw: then, with this care, remove those fragments of the saw when you have it ready for removal from the instruments.
Si uero orificium uulneris est strictum, tunc amplifica ipsum cum phlebotomo secundum quantitatem necessitatis tuae.	But if the wound opening is tight, then widen it with the phlebotome in the quantity required by your need.
Deinde quando abstuleris illa satagie, et non remanserit ex eis aliquid, sue tunc orificium uulneris, si est amplum: et si non, pone super ipsum ex emplastris quae conueniunt ad illud, et incarnant illud, donec sanetur.	Then, when you have removed those saws, and there remains none of them, then close the wound opening if it is wide; and if not, cover it with the plasters that suit it and let it be grown in until healing:
¶ De restauratione Furculae, quando frangitur.	As for the restoration of the fork, when it breaks.
Caput VI.	Chapter VI.
Plurimum quidem frangitur Furcula ab anteriore parte ex parte humeri, et fractura eius fit secundum unum trium modorum.	The fork is often broken in the front part from the shoulder, and its fracture is made in one of three ways.
Aut enim frangitur et separatur in duo, praeter quod accidant in ea satagiae: et est facilius ad restaurationem eius.	Or if it breaks and separates into two, except that they fall into the sawing: and it is easier to restore it.
Aut ita, quod accidunt in osse satagiae: et est difficilius ad restaurationem.	Or else, so that they happen in the sawed bone: and it is more difficult for restoration.
Aut ita, quod est fractura cum uulnere.	Or else, so that it is with the ulna.
Et operatio in ea quando fractura est absque uulnere, est, ut facias praesentes esse duos ministros, ut teneat unus eorum adiutorium quod sequitur Furculam fractam, et alter extendat collum uersus partem.	And the operation in it when the fracture is without the ulna, is, as you make these two ministers hold one of them as an aid that follows the broken fork, and the other extends the neck towards the side.
Deinde aequa fracturam digitis tuis, donec fiat forma eius, secundum quod oportet: et non sit in ea eminentia, neque concauitas.	Then make the length of the fracture of your fingers equal, until it has the right shape, and there is no prominence or protrusion in it;
Quod si indiges extensione plus, tunc oportet, ut ponas sub titillico infirmi spheram ex panno, aut lana: et sit magnitudo eius secundum quantitatem necessitatis tuae: et extende, et eleua Furculam, et coarta spheram manu tua, donec aeques fracturam, secundum quod oportet.	If you can bear a greater extension, then place under a tickling ball of cloth or wool; and let the size be according to the quantity of your need: and extend, and ease the fork, and grasp the ball in your hand, until the fracture is even, as it should be.
Quod si non potes trahere extremitatem Furculae ad exteriora: propterea, quia peruenit ad profundum: tunc oportet, ut resupinetur infirmus super ceruicem suam: et ponas sub humero eius puluinar medium in magnitudine, et premat minister humerum eius ad inferiora, donec eleuetur os Furculae quod est in profundo ad sursum: atque tunc rectifica fracturam, et aequa eam digitis tuis.	If you cannot bring the end of the fork to the outside because it goes deep in: then let the sick one lie on his/her side: and place under his/her armpit a pillow medium in size; and press the minister of his/her humerus towards the bottom, until he/she lifts up the jaw of the fork that is in the deep to the top: and then, correct the fracture, and make it even with your fingers.
Si autem sentis sathaiatum ex Furcula, et mouetur: tunc oportet, ut findas super illud, et extrahas ipsum alsathaiatum cum facilitate.	If you feel a bump from the fork, and it moves: then let you find on it, and pull out the bump with ease.
Si autem est retentum in osse, tunc ingenia in incisione eius cum uno Incisoriorum quae praeparasti ad illud, postquam tu posueris sub Furcula instrumentum quod seruat sifach: et est instrumentum ex ligno, aut ex ferro.	If it is stuck in the bone, then use the incision tool that you prepared for it, after you have placed under the fork an instrument to hold on to it: and this instrument is made of wood or iron.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form:
Assimilatur cochleari cui non est concauitas.	It is joined to a shell-like one that is not closed.
Et sit latitudo eius secundum illud quo indiges eo ex magnitudine ossis, et paruitate eius.	And its width is according to what you can bear from the size of the bone, and its thickness.
Longitudo uero eius etiam secundum quod possibile est tibi ad operationem.	Its length also is according to what is possible for you in the operation.
Et habeat duas extremitates, sicut uides: et extremitas una sit ampla, et altera stricta.	And it has two ends, as you see: and one end is wide, and the other is narrow.
Si autem disruptio uulneris quod scidisti quando extraxisti sathaiatum ossis, est ampla, et securaris ab apostemate calido: tunc aggrega duo labia uulneris cum sutura.	If the wound that you made when you pulled out the bump of the bone is wide, and it dries with warm exudate: then join the two lips of the wound with a suture.
Et si disruptio est parua, aut times apostema calidum: tunc imple uulnus cum pannis, et puluillis secundum quantitatem scissurae uulneris.	And if the break is small, or the exudate is not warm: then fill the wound with cloth, and dust according to the quantity of the cut of the wound.
Quod si accidat apostema calidum, tunc infunde pannum in oleo rosato, et aceto, et uino, et pone super ipsum.	If it happens that the exudate is warm, then pour on it cloth in olive oil, and vinegar, and wine, and place on it.
Strictura uero ossis quando est absque uulnere, et absque sectione, est, ut ponas super os emplastrum factum ex farina molendini cum albugine oui.	The stricture of the bone is, when it is without the ulna, and without sectioning, such that you put on a bone splint made from flour ground with white lime.
Et pone stuppam lenem super ipsum.	And place a wooden stump over the bone.
Deinde pone spheram sub titillico eius, si indiges illa.	Then place a ball under its tip, if you can endure it.
Deinde accipe himematem, id est, rotam quam tenent Saraceni, quae sit longa ualde: et sit latitudo eius palmi unius, aut circiter illud.	Then take the blood, that is, the roll which the Saracens hold, which is long and great: and let its width be that of a palm or about that.
Deinde pone puluillum duplicatum super stuppam et emplastrum.	Then place a double layer of felt over the stump and splint.
Deinde accipe astellam ex tabula subtili, cuius latitudo sit trium digitorum, et in longitudine similiter.	Then take an astil from a thin board, whose width is that of three fingers, and its length similar.
Deinde inuolue eam in panno.	Then wrap it in a cloth.
Deinde inuolue pannum illum cum astella in loco alhimemati qui cadit super fracturam et locum.	Then wrap the cloth with the astil at the Alkemist's place that lies over the fracture and spot.
Deinde pone alhimemati super fracturam sicut reuoluiur, et inuolue eam super collum eius, et sub titillico eius sano, et sub titillico eius infirmo: et reduc eam super omnem partem, et quomodo uides quod strictura tenet fracturam strictura decenti: et est illud, quod non occultatur super te, et totum, ut non remoueatur astella desuper os fractum.	Then place the Alkemist over the fracture as a roll, and wrap it over his neck, and under its tip, healthy and under its tip, sick: and bring it back to all parts, so that you see how the stricture holds the fracture together: and this is so that it does not hide on top of you, and completely, so that it does not move the astil from above the broken bone.
Et propter hoc oportet, ut aspicias infirmum in omni die.	And for this, it should be, so that you see the sick one every day.
Quotiens ergo mollificatur ligamentum, et uides astellam iam remoueri: tunc rectifica illud, et stringe ligamentum.	Whenever you see the ligament loosen and the astil move: then straighten it out, and tighten the ligament.
Deinde pone somnum infirmi super dorsum eius, et pone sub titillico eius apud somnum eius puluinar paruum in nocte, ut cum eo eleuetur adiutorium eius a latere ipsius.	Then place a pillow of medicine on his back, and under its tip put a very thin one by his side at night, so that when he turns it helps him from that side.
Eleuatur ergo fractura furculae per eleuationem humeri.	Then the fracture in the femur is healed by elevation of the shoulder.
Aut liga brachium eius ad collum ipsius: et non soluas ligamentum, si non accidat in loco accidens ex pruritu, aut ab apostemate, usque ad duodecim dies.	Or ligate his arm to his neck: and do not loosen the ligaments, unless an accident happens by scratching, or from a slumber, until twelve days.
Deinde renoua emplastrum, si uideris faciem eius ad illud.	Then cut a splint, if you see his face towards that.
Et adde in strictura, et dimitte ipsum, donec restauretur et coaguletur.	And add to the contraction, and let him go, until he is healed and coagulated.
Et fractura quidem furculae stringitur et confortatur secundum plurimum in uigintiocto diebus: et quandoque fit in quibusdam hominibus in minore illo.	And that break of the fork is tightened and strengthened according to many in twenty days: and when it comes to some people, less so.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Spatulae.	¶ Of the restoration of the fracture of the spatula.
Caput VII.	Head VII.
Raro frangitur Spatula, et in loco lato eius: et non franguntur ex ea nisi margines eius.	Rare is it that the Spatula breaks, and in its place a wide piece: and do not break from it except for the edge of it.
Quando ergo frangitur ex eo locus, et frangitur in medio eius, et non cognoscitur illud nisi per tactum: tunc secundum quod est figura fracturae conare praeparationem eius.	When therefore it breaks from that place, and it breaks in the middle of it, and is not known except by touch: then according to what its figure is, prepare the treatment of it.
Et reduc eam super figuram naturalem omni modo ingenii, quod est tibi possibile.	And reduce it over the natural form at all your skill, which is possible for you.
Deinde pone super locum puluerem molendini cum albugine oui, et stuppam lenem, et pone desuper puluillum ex panno duplato.	Then put on top of the place powder to be ground with chalk and a wooden stick, and put a flap of cloth above it.
Deinde pone super ipsum astellam latam ex tabula subtili secundum quantitatem Spatulae totius, aut ampliorem ea parum.	Then put on top of it an iron plate from a thin board according to the quantity of the whole Spatula, or wider one than that a little.
Si uero sub astella est concauitas in aliquo locorum Spatulae, tunc aequa illam concauitatem cum stuppa leni, donec descendat astella secundum aequalitatem.	But if under the plate is squeezed in some place of the whole Spatula, then make that same squeeze with soft wood, until the plate comes down according to equality.
Deinde ftringe desuper cum alhimemati longa, constrictione decenti, et firmitudine astellae, donec non remoueatur a loco suo.	Then wipe off from above with long-haired cloth, with a constricting pressure coming down, and with the firmness of the plate, until it does not move away from its place.
Et considera ligamentum in omni die.	And consider the ligature every day.
Quotienscunque ergo mollificatur ligamentum, stringe ipsum, et aequa astellam si remoueatur a loco suo: et iaceat infirmus super latus suum sanum.	Whenever that is softened, tighten it and make the plate equal if it moves away from its place: and lie on his sick side.
Et Spatula quidem restauratur in uiginti diebus, aut in uigintiquinque diebus.	And the Spatula is restored in twenty days, or in fifteen.
Quando ergo completur iste numerus, tunc solue ligamentum: et tu sis in securitate.	When therefore that number is completed, then dissolve the ligature: and you are in safety.
Nam ipsa est ex ossibus quorum communitio non timetur, neque eorum solutio.	For that itself is of bones whose connection does not fear, and is not there of their solution.
Si autem procedat ex osse frustum, et pungit sub cute: tune scinde super ipsum, et aufer ipsum.	If however it proceeds from a fragment of bone, and pierces through the skin: now cut above it, and remove it.
Et fac quod diximus in fractura furculae ex sedatione apostematis calidi, si accidat ex eo aliquid.	And do as we have said about a fracture of the jaw from the heat of apoplexy, if anything happens from it.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Pectoris.	[On the restoration of a fracture of the breastbone.]
Caput VIII.	CHAPTER VIII.
Pectus quandoque frangitur in medio sui, et raro accidit illud.	The breastbone is sometimes fractured through and through, and this rarely happens.
Extremitates eius quidem plurimum franguntur, et comminuuntur ex accidentibus eius.	Its extremities are more frequently broken, and they are destroyed by the accidents which befall it.
Quando frangitur eius medium, quod declinat ad inferiora, et accidit ei dolor uehemens, et difficultas in anhelitu, et tussis: et fortasse euomit sanguinem, et declaratur concauitas in osse fracto, et non occultatur sensui, Restauratio eius est, ut resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum: et pone inter Spatulas eius puluinar.	When the middle part is broken, which turns downward, and happens to him a violent pain, and difficulty in breathing, and perhaps he spits up blood, and it appears that there is a fracture of the breastbone, and it does not hide the sense, The restoration is this: let him lie down on his back: and put between his shoulders some feathers.
Deinde preme humeros eius, et aggrega costas a duabus partibus uel lateribus cum manibus: et subtiliare in aequatione eius, secundum omnem modum quo possibile est illud et conuenit, donec redeat figura ossis, secundum quod oportet.	Then press his shoulders together, and press his ribs from both sides with his hands: and make him even by the application of a subtle force, in accordance with all possible ways that it may be made to fit, until he has recovered his shape, according to what is necessary.
Deinde pone super ipsum emplastrum et stuppam, et pone desuper astellam ex tabula subtili ex salice, aut chalingi, et ex eis similibus in leuitate, postquam tu inuoluis eam in panno.	Then put over it a plaster and a board, and put under it an axle of a light table, or of similar material, and let it rest on that: for when you have bound it up with cloth.
Deinde subtiliare in ligando eam super os fractum, ut non remoueatur: et uade cum ligatura secundum rotunditatem ad dorsum aliquotiens, et stringe ipsum strictura decenti.	Then make him even by applying a subtle force to the bonding of it over the broken bone, that it may not move: and sometimes turn him with the binding, according to its roundness to his back, and tighten it by a tightening force.
Deinde considera ligaturam in omni hora, et quotienscumque mollificatur, stringe eam: et si necessitas eius prouocat ad solutionem eius apud pruritum, uel corrosionem quae accidit in loco, aut dolorem, aut apostema: tunc propera, et solue eam, et eradica emplastrum, et rectifica quod accidit cum modo curationis eius.	Then consider the bonding at all times, and always tighten it when it becomes soft, and if necessity provokes to solve its problem by itching, or a corruption which happens in that place, or pain, or fever: then approach, and loosen it, and remove the plaster, and set aright what has happened in the way of curing it.
Deinde reduc emplastrum, si uides ad illud faciem: et annecte ei stricturam, donec sanetur.	Then reduce the plaster, if you see to that face: and bind it tightly until it is healed.
¶ De restauratione Costarum, quando franguntur.	The restoration of the ribs when they are broken.
Caput IX.	Chapter IX.
Scias, quod Costarum fractura non accidit, nisi in locis grossis quae sequuntur dorsum, et ex extremitatibus earum ab anteriori parte.	You know that a rib fracture does not occur, unless in the places far from the back and from the extremities of them to the front.
Et non accidit eis attritio, nisi propterea, quia sunt cartilaginosae.	And they do not suffer wear and tear, except therefore, because they are cartilage.
Et cognitio ipsius non occultatur sensui apud inquisitionem cum digitis.	And the knowledge of this does not conceal itself from the sense in inquiry when the fingers touch.
Et restauratio eius fit ita, ut aeques fracturam cum digitis secundum modum possibilem, donec aequetur figura, secundum quod oportet.	And the restoration is done so that an equal fracture with the fingers in a second possible way, until it is even, because it is necessary to restore it.
Deinde emplastra, et stringe os fractum cum astella, si indiget illo.	Then apply the plaster, and tightly bind the broken jaw with the strap, if it needs that.
Et si fractura Costarum est decliuis ad interiora: tunc accidit infirmo dolor uehemens, et punctura, sicut punctura illa quae accidit illi qui habet pleuresim: propterea, quod os pungit uelamen, et etiam ei accidit difficultas anhelitus, et tussis, et uomitus sanguinis multi: et haec est difficilis curationis.	And if the fracture of the ribs is hidden toward the inside: then a severe pain occurs, and a pricking, like that which occurred to him who had pleurisy; because the jaw stings the windpipe, and also it occurs to him difficulty in breathing, and coughing, and much blood loss: and this is a difficult cure.
Et iam ingeniati sunt antiqui in ea cum ingeniis multis: et ex eis sunt qui dicunt, ut ponas cibos infirmi qui generent inflammationem et uentositatem, ut inflammetur uenter, et extendatur, et impellatur fractura ad exteriora.	And already the ancients have devised many methods for this: and among them are those who say, that you place food to generate inflammation and windiness, so as to inflame the belly, and to spread it out, and to push the fracture toward the outside.
Nos uero abhorremus, ut non fiat caussa uelox ad faciendum apostema calidum, si non accidit.	But we dislike, so that it is not made a habit of quickly doing an emetic, if it does not happen.
Si autem iam accidit, tunc addit in eo.	But if it has already happened, then add this to it.
Et dixerunt quidam eorum: ponatur super locum uentosa, deinde sugatur cum fortitudine, et est similius ratiocinationi.	And some of them said: Let him lie on a windy place, and then blow over it with force, and it is similar to reasoning.
Verumtamen timetur, quod attrahat uentosa superfluitates ad locum, propter dispositionem debilitatis.	But it is feared that the windiness will attract superficial fluid toward the place, because of the weakness of disposition.
Et dixerunt quidam eorum: oportet ut cooperiatur locus cum lana quae iam submersa est in oleo calido: et ponantur puluilli inter Costas, donec impleatur: ut sit ligatura aequalis quando inuoluis eam secundum rotunditatem.	And some of them said: It is necessary that the place be covered with wool which has already been submerged in hot oil: and let there be placed feathers between the ribs, so that it is filled: so that the binding becomes equal when it is rolled up according to its roundness.
Deinde curetur infirmus curatione pleuresis ex cibo et medicina.	The sick person will recover from pleurisy with food and medicine.
Quod si coartat infirmum res uehemens, quam non tolerat, et os pungit uelamen punctura laedente, et timemus super infirmum: tunc oportet, ut scindamus super locum, et detegamus a Costa fracta.	If the person is forced to lie on an infirm bed, which he does not tolerate, and the nose pricks with a piercing wound, hurting the patient, and we are afraid of the sick man: then it should be that we cut him off from the place, and discover the broken ribs.
Deinde ponamus super ea instrumentum quod conseruat sifac, cuius rememoratio praecessit: et incidamus os cum facilitate, et incidamus ipsum.	Then let us place over it an instrument that preserves the siffa, whose memory precedes: and we will cut through the nose easily, and we will cut out the same one.
Deinde aggregemus duo labia uulneris, si est magnum cum sutura: et curemus ipsum cum emplastris, donec sanetur.	Then let us gather together two lips of the wound, if it is great with a suture: and let us heal him with plasters, until he heals.
Quod si accidat interim apostema calidum, tunc propera, et infunde puluillos in oleo rosato, et pone super locum: et curetur infirmus cum eo quod conuenit apostemati.	If it happens during the period of feverish swelling, then let it approach, and pour oil with rose water onto the place, and put him on: and heal the sick person with it as is suitable for the swelling.
Interim etiam resupinetur super latus super quod dormit, donec sanetur.	At that time he will also recover from the side where he sleeps, until he heals.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Spondilium dorsi et colli.	For the restoration of a broken spine of the back and neck.
Caput X.	Chapter X.
Ossibus quidem colli quandoque aduenit fractura, et raro accidit eis attritio: et similiter Spondilibus dorsi etiam.	For the bones of the neck sometimes there is a fracture, and it rarely happens that they are worn out: and also for the spine of the back.
Cum ergo accidit illud alicui, et uis scire, an sanetur, an non sanetur: tunc confidera.	So when it has happened to someone, and you do not know whether he will heal or not: then trust it.
Nam si uides manus eius iam mollificatas, et stupefactas, et mortuas: et non potest mouere eas, neque extendere eas, neque constringere eas: et quando constringis eas cum digitis tuis, et pungis eas cum acu, non sentit illud, et non sentit in eis dolorem: tunc scias, quia non sanatur, et in pluribus dispositionibus est mortale.	For if you see his hands already softened, and stupefied, and dead: and cannot be moved, or extended, or squeezed together: and when you squeeze them with your fingers and prick them with a pin, he does not feel it, and does not feel the pain in them: then you know that he is not healed, and is mortal in many dispositions.
Quod si mouet eas, et sentit in eis constrictionem cum digitis et puncturam: tunc scias, quia nucha ossis salua est, et quod infirmus sanabitur cum curatione.	If he can move them and feels the constriction with your fingers and the prick: then you know that the spine of the neck is healed, and that the sick person will recover with treatment.
Quod si eueniat Spondilibus dorsi simile illius, et uis scire, an sanetur etiam, an non: tunc considera ad pedes eius: tunc si uides quod mollificati sunt, et accidit in eis illud quod accidit in manibus: deinde quando iacet super dorsum suum, egreditur uentositas et egestio absque uoluntate: et quando resupinatur super uentrem suum, egreditur egestio sine uoluntate: et quando resupinatur super dorsum suum, et uult mingere, et non potest: tunc scias, quia est mortale.	If it is similar to that of the spine of the back, and you do not know whether he will heal or not: then look at his feet: if you see that they are softened, and what happened to his hands has happened to them: then when he lies on his back, he moves and moves without volition: and when he rises on his belly, he moves without volition: and when he rises again on his back, and wants to drink, but cannot: then you know that it is mortal.
Non ergo labores in curatione eius.	So do not perform surgery on him.
Si uero non accidit ei aliquid ex illo, res est leuior.	If, however, he does not suffer from any of those conditions, the matter is less serious.
Et curatio eius quod accidit ex illo est, ut coneris sedationem apostematis calidi: ita, ut ponas super Spondilem attritam oleum rosatum solum: aut cum uitellis oui assati.	And the cure for him when he suffers from any of those conditions is such that you should bring him to a state of sedated sweat: in other words, so that you put on him only rosin-oiled cloth; or when he is bathed with warm water.
Pone super ipsam illud aliquotiens in die, donec quando sedatur apostema calidum: tum pone super locum unum ex emplastris confortantibus, exiccantibus, et stringe super ipsum cum ligamento: et praecipe infirmo, ut utatur quiete et tranquillitate.	Place over it several times a day until he sweats; then place over the site one of the supporting splints, drying and tightly wrapped around him with the bandage; and instruct the sick person to rest and remain calm.
Nec dormiat super partem cum qua inuenit dolorem, donec sanetur.	And let him not lie on the injured side until he is cured of his pain;
Quod si accidit apud attritionem ossis sathaiatum, aut aliquid quod iam separatum fit ex eo: tunc oportet, ut seces super cutem, et auferas illud.	If, however, it happens that the bone is separated from its attachment, or something that has already become detached from it; then you should remove the flesh with care and get rid of it.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris, si est magnum, cum sutura.	Then take two pieces of leather, if it is a large wound, and join them together with sutures.
Deinde cura ipsum cum aliquo incarnatiuo, ex unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then care for the person when he has an infection from the skin, with ointment, until he is cured.
Si uero frangitur postremum ossis alhausos, et est finis caudae: tunc oportet, ut intromittas pollicem manus sinistrae in anum, et aeques os fractum manu altera, secundum quod possibile est, et secunda aequatione.	If, however, the bone is finally broken at the end of the lower limb and the foot is cut off: then you should insert the thumb of the left hand into the joint, and with the right hand, according to what can be done, and by equalling it in length.
Deinde pone super ipsum, et aufer ipsum: et cura uulnus cum curatione quae praecessit, donec sanetur.	Then place over him, and remove him; and care for the wound with the cure that preceded it until he is cured.
¶ De restauratione Anchae.	For the restoration of ankle joints.
Caput XI.	Chapter XI.
Raro franguntur ossa Ancharum.	Rarely do the bones of the ankles break.
Quod si franguntur, tunc fractura eorum non est, nisi comminutio in extremitatibus ipsorum: et scinduntur in longitudine, et declinantur ad interiora: et accidit infirmo dolor in loco, et punctura: et stupescit crus quod frangitur.	If they break, then their fracture is not complete; they split at the ends of the bones and decline towards the inside: and a sick person experiences pain in that place, and a burning sensation: and the leg which breaks becomes numb.
Et restauratio quidem eius est, ut extendas manum tuam super ipsum, donec stes super fracturam qualiter est figura eius.	And for the restoration of it, you should extend your hand over it, until you stand on the fracture as though it were a pillar.
Quod si fractura est in extremitatibus eius tantum, tunc aequa illam fracturam, secundum quod praeparatur tibi ex aequatione, donec assimiletur figurae suae naturali.	If the fracture is only in its extremities, then make that fracture equal, according to how you are prepared, until it is similar to its natural figure.
Si autem fractura est in longitudine, aut iam declinat ad interiora: tunc fac iacere infirmum super uentrem suum, donec praeparetur tibi restauratio illius fracturae.	But if the fracture is in length, or has already turned towards the insides: then make the sick one lie on his stomach, until his fracture is prepared for you to restore it.
Quando ergo aequaueris ipsam, pone super ipsam emplastrum: deinde pone super ipsam astellam ex ligno, aut ex cute: et stringe strictura super quam non timeas permutationem fracturae, neque remotionem astellae.	When you have made that equal, then place a plaster over it: and then place over it a wooden or leather splint, and tighten it with such a tourniquet that you do not fear the fracture's movement, nor the removal of the splint.
Et aequa concauitatem illorum cum eo quod impleat eam, donec capiat eam strictura secundum aequalitatem: et praecipe infirmo, ut dormiat super dorsum suum, aut super latus suum sanum.	And with that equal concavity make it full, until it takes that form: and order the sick one to sleep on his back, or on his healthy side.
Si autem accidat ei apostema calidum: tunc cessa ab extensione eius, et ipsius restauratione, donec sedetur apostema calidum: et pone super ipsum quod sedet ipsum, secundum quod praecessit, deinde redi ad restaurationem eius: et stringe ipsum sicut oportet.	But if there should happen to be a heat in him: then cease from extending it, and from restoring it, until the heat subsides: and place over him who sits what sits, according to how it has preceded, and then return to its restoration: and tighten him as it should be.
Si uero accidit in osse satagie, aut comminuitur, extrahe.	But if it has happened in the bone's shattering, or has been broken, extract it.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Adiutorii.	For the restoration of the fracture, Assistant.
Caput XII.	Chapter XII.
Adiutorium est illud, quod est inter cubitum usque ad caput Spatulae.	The assistant is that which is between the trough and the head of a spatula.
Si ergo frangitur, tunc restauratio eius est secundum unum duorum modorum.	But if it is broken, then its restoration is according to two ways.
Quorum unus est: ut accipias lignum planum mediae grossitudinis, secundum hanc formam, quae sequitur.	One of which is: that you take a flat piece of wood of medium thickness, according to this form, which follows.
Et ligentur in duabus extremitatibus duo ligamenta.	And bind together in its two extremities with two ligaments.
Deinde suspendatur ex loco eleuato: et sedeat infirmus super sedem.	Then hang it from a raised place: and let the sick one sit on a chair.
Deinde proiiciat brachium suum fractum super lignum, donec perueniat ad titillicum eius, in cuius medio sit annexa curuitas ligni.	Then he will put his broken arm over the wood, until it reaches to its tiny bit, into which is attached the wood's smoothness.
Deinde suspende desuper ipsum aliquid graue, ut extendat ipsum minister ad inferiora.	Then hang it from above the sick one with something heavy, so that he extends himself towards the lower.
Deinde aequet medicus fracturam manibus suis simul, donec redeat fractura, secundum quod oportet.	Then let the physician treat both hands together until the fracture heals, as it should.
Et modus alter est, ut resupinetur infirmus super ceruicem suam: et suspende manum eius a collo ipsius cum ligamento.	And another way is that he lies down on his chest with his hand suspended from his neck by a bandage.
Deinde praecipe duobus ministris, ut teneat unus eorum illud quod est supra fracturam cum manibus suis: et ut alter teneat inferius eius, et extendat unusquisque eorum ad partem suam.	Then command two servants to hold one of them up above the fracture with their hands: and let one hold below it and stretch out his hand on each side.
Et si uis, ut sit extensio fortior, tunc stringe sub fractura cum ligamento, et supra ipsam cum ligamento alio: et extendat ea unusquisque duorum ministrorum ad duas partes suas.	And if you wish to make the extension stronger, then tie a strong bandage under the fracture and another above it, and stretch out the two servants' hands on each side.
Si ergo fractura est propinqua extremitati humeri, tunc oportet, ut ponatur unum ligamentum sub titillico, et alterum sub fractura uersus cubitum.	If then the fracture is near the edge of the shoulder, then a bandage should be tied under the collarbone, and another above the fracture towards the hip.
Et similiter si fractura est propinqua cubito: tunc oportet, ut ponatur ligamentum super illum locum, et super cubitum ipsum.	And likewise if the fracture is near the hip: then a bandage should be tied on the spot, and on the hip itself.
Deinde aequa fracturam cum facilitate absque labore, donec quando aequatur fractura secundum quod oportet, et applicatur applicatione bona: tunc stringe eam, si non accidit apostema calidum.	Then let the fracture be made equal with ease without effort, until when it is made equal as it should be, and applied with good application: then tie it up, if there is no swelling of heat.
Si uero accidit apostema calidum, tunc dimitte stricturam usque ad diem septimum.	But if a swelling of heat does occur, then let the tightening be loosened until the seventh day.
Et pone super ipsum lanam succidam imbibitam in aceto et oleo rosato, donec quando quiescit apostema: tunc stringe eam: et modus stringendi eam est, ut ponas emplastrum super fracturam.	And place on the person a woolen cloth soaked in vinegar and olive oil, until when the swelling is still active: then tie it up: and the way of tying it up is that you place a plaster above the fracture.
Deinde pone inuolutionem ex panno nouo super emplastrum.	Then put a new woolen cloth over the plaster.
Deinde aggreget brachium super adiutorium ipsum, et ponat manum suam apertam super humerum suum.	Then he will stretch out his arm above his aide, and place his hand open on his shoulder.
Et pone pannum, et stringe super adiutorium brachium, ut brachium stet loco astellarum: si non prohibet te ab illo aliquid, neque alteretur super te aliquid ex osse fracto.	And then put the cloth on, and tie it above the aide's arm, so that the arm remains in place by the stakes: if it does not prevent you from doing so, and there is no disturbance on you from any broken bone.
Quod si times, quod alteretur super te ex osse fracto aliquid, tunc utere astellis: et est, ut ponas super fracturam ipsam astellam quae sit latior et fortior reliquis astellis.	That if you wish to use stakes: and it is, so that you place on the fracture a stake which is wider and stronger than the others: and let him who does this work be skilled in using the stakes.
Et ponas inter omnem astellam latitudinem digiti: et sit longitudo astellarum secundum fracturam cum additione trium digitorum ab omni parte.	And place the width of the hand between all the stars: and let the length of the stars be according to the fracture with the addition of three fingers from every side.
Deinde stringe super astellas strictura quam dixi in principio capituli.	Then bind firmly on top of the stars the constriction that I spoke about at the beginning of this chapter.
Et est, ut sit strictura tua super locum fracturae strictior.	And let your binding be tighter than the place of the fracture by that which I have spoken above.
Et quanto plus elongatur fractura, sit strictura minor.	And as the fracture grows longer, so let the constriction become less.
Si ergo uides situm astellarum et stricturam, sicut diximus, in hora qua restauras membrum statim, tunc fac: et si times apostema calidum, tunc dimitte stricturam et astellas usque ad diem septimum, sicut diximus.	If then you see the length of the stars and the constriction, as we have said, at the time when you restore the limb immediately, then do it: and if you wish to let go of the swelling and the coldness, then leave off the constriction and the stars until the seventh day, as we have said.
Deinde considera ligamentum in omnibus tribus diebus, ut non accidat in loco pruritus, aut inflatio, aut prohibeatur cibus peruenire ad membrum, propter dispositionem superfluitatis stricturae.	Then consider the binding on all three days so that there does not remain any itching or swelling, nor does food come to the limb by way of the binding, because of the swelling's tendency to burst.
Rectifica ergo illud totum, secundum quod diximus.	So straighten out all that, according to what we have said.
Si uero es super fiduciam, ut non accidat ex illo aliquid: tunc non soluas ligamentum, nisi post tres dies, aut plus.	If then you are not confident, so that nothing comes out of it: then do not let go of the binding until after three days or more.
Et sit dormitio infirmi super dorsum suum, et manus eius super stomachum suum: et pone sub adiutorio culcitram plenam lana aequaliter.	And let there lie on his back, with his hands on his belly, and put under the pillow a bed filled with wool, even.
Et considera in omni hora noctis, aut diei, ut non soluatur figura membri fracta, aut mollificetur ligamentum.	Then consider at all times of night or day, so that the broken limb does not go loose, nor do the bindings become soft.
Rectifica ergo illud totum uirtute tua.	So straighten out all that with your skill.
Et pone cibum infirmi secundum ordinem quem praemisimus, ita ut sit cibus subtilis in primis, donec incipiat os stringi: tunc oportet, ut ingrosses cibum eius.	And provide for the nurse food according to the order that we have given, so that there be food of low quality at first, until the mouth begins to heal: then it should be provided, so that it grows heavier.
De consuetudine enim adiutorii et cruris est, ut stringatur in quadraginta diebus: tunc ergo oportet, ut soluatur, et administretur balneum, et medicetur cum unguentis quae rectificant illud.	For the custom of the binding and the arm is that it should be bound for forty days; then therefore let it be loosed, and administered a bath, and treated with an ointment that makes it right.
Quod si fractura fuerit foeda, attrita: tunc non soluas ab ea ligamentum et astellas usque ad quinquaginta dies, et usque ad duos menses.	If then the fracture were foul, ground: then do not let go of the binding and the stars until after fifty days, and until two months.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Brachii.	On restoring fractures of the brachial bone.
Caput XIII.	Chapter XIII.
Brachium est compositum ex duobus ossibus, quae nominantur duo focilia.	The arm consists of two bones called "humeri.
Quorum unum est paruum: et est illud quod sequitur pollicem.	One is small and it is the one that follows the thumb.
Et alterum est magnum, et est illud quod est positum sub paruo ab inferiori parte.	The other is large and it is the one placed below the little bone.
Fortasse ergo frangitur focile maius solum, aut paruum: et fortasse franguntur simul.	Perhaps then the larger femur alone breaks, or the smaller one, or perhaps both break at once.
Quando ergo frangitur focile paruum superius, tunc restauratio eius est facilis, et sanatio eius est facilior.	When therefore the smaller femur breaks above, then its restoration is easy, and its healing is easier.
Et quando frangitur focile inferius, est fractura eius mala, et sanatio eius difficilis.	And when the smaller femur breaks below, it is a bad fracture, and its healing is difficult.
Et deterior ea est, quando franguntur duo ossa simul.	And it is worse when both bones break at once.
Si ergo os quod frangitur est focile parum superius, tunc conuenit medico apud restaurationem eius, ut ponat extensionem paruam cum facilitate, donec aequet ipsum.	But if the bone that breaks is the small one above, then it belongs to the physician to restore it with ease by extending the small one until it is even.
Si uero focile magnum est illud quod fractum est: tunc oportet, ut ponat stricturam fortiorem ualde.	But if the broken femur is the large one: then it should be tightly bound with a strong bandage.
Et oportet, ut ponat figuram manus apud restaurationem eius, et ipsius extensionem extensam super puluinar.	And it should be done so that the hand assumes a certain position in restoring it, and that its extension extends beyond the elbow joint.
Et sit pollex manus ad superiora altior omnibus digitis: et sit articularis inferior omnibus digitis, uel reliquis: et infirmus sedens quadratus super seipsum, et sit puluinar coram eo, uel in directo eius, in altitudine, ut non incurrat infirmus laborem.	And let the thumb of the hand be placed higher than all the fingers: and let the flexor muscles be extended in full for each finger, or else not; and let the person sit on a square with his feet before him, or straight in front of it, in height so that he does not suffer any pain.
Deinde extendat minister Brachium ab inferiori parte, aut manu sua, aut cum ligamento.	Then extend the arm from below, by hand, or with a bandage.
Et minister alius extendat desuper similiter.	And another minister should extend it from above.
Deinde aequet medicus os, donec reducat ipsum secundum meliorem figuram quam potest.	Then the physician should level the bone so that he can reduce it into the best possible position.
Quod si in fractura ossis sunt satagiae, tunc conare reducere omne frustum in loco suo uirtute tua.	If there are any segments broken off in the fracture, then take care to restore them to their places with your own hand.
Si uero apparet in eo sathaiatum separatum, et pungit cutem, et non est tibi spes in restauratione eius: tunc finde super ipsum, et aufer ipsum secundum modum quem diximus in eis quae praemissa sunt.	But if it appears to you that there is a break in the bone and it pricks the skin, and there is no hope of restoring it: then find beneath it, and remove it according to the method which we have described in those preceding this.
Si autem fractura est cum uulnere, ego iam feci ad illud capitulum singulare, ergo accipe curationem illius inde.	If, however, there is a fracture with the ulna, I have already done to that chapter singularly, so take care of him from there.
Quod si accidat in principio tuae restaurationis apostema calidum, tunc line pannum cum caeroto facto ex oleo rosato, et caera alba, et sit medium inter spissitudinem et subtilitatem: et stringe pannum super ipsum strictura subtili, donec quando sedatur apostema: tunc remoue caerotum, et pone emplastrum praeparatum ex puluere molendini cum albumine oui.	If, however, there is a fracture with the ulna, I have already done to that chapter singularly, so take care of him from there.
Deinde pone astellas, et sit astella quae ponitur super fracturam ipsam latior parumper, et fortior.	Then put on the splints, and let the splint that is put on the fracture be a bit wider, and stronger.
Et scias, quod numerus astellarum Brachii est sex in pluribus dispositionibus: siue sit fractura in focili uno, aut in duobus focilibus simul.	And know that the number of splints for the arm is six in various arrangements: whether it is a fracture in one lock, or in two locks simultaneously.
Deinde pone stricturam tuam super locum fracturae fortiorem et uehementiorem, et aliquanto plus cum strictura ad superiora fracturae, aut ad inferiora eius: aut pone stricturam molliorem strictura eius parumper, secundum quod praecessit rememoratio eius in principio capituli.	Then put on your splint in a stronger and more robust place at the site of the fracture, and slightly more with the splint toward the upper part of the fracture, or toward the lower part: or put on a softer splint slightly according to what precedes the memory of it at the beginning of the chapter.
Et sint panni qui inuoluuntur super fracturam, panni lenes, humidi: et non sint duri, asperi.	And let there be cloths wrapping around the fracture, soft, wet fabrics; and not let them be hard, rough.
Et sit filum quo stringitur ex lino proprie, medium inter subtile et grossum, sicut narrauimus.	And let there be a thread that is tied with linen thread itself, between thin and thick, as we have described.
Et considera membrum et ligamentum post dies.	And consider the member and ligaments after days.
Quod si accidat aliquid cuius rectificatio sit necessaria, sicut pruritus qui accidit membro: tunc oportet, ut embroces membrum cum aqua calefacta, donec quiescat ille pruritus, et dimittas membrum non constrictum, donec quiescat, deinde itera stricturam.	If anything needs to be corrected, like an itch that occurs on a member: then one should immerse the member in hot water until the itch subsides, and remove the member not restricted, until it subsides, and then repeat the splint.
Quod si strictura iam mollificata est, et os iam remotum, et similia illis: tunc rectifica illud totum uirtute tua, et considera iterum.	If the splint is already softened, and the bone is already removed, and similar things: then correct it completely with your skill, and consider again.
Nam si nutrimentum prohibetur peruenire ad membrum, propter superfluitatem stricturae, tunc oportet, ut mollifices ipsum parumper, et dimittas ipsum aliquot diebus, donec currat ad ipsum nutrimentum, deinde stringe ipsum.	For if the nutrition is prevented from reaching the member due to an excess of splint, then one should make it slightly softer, and leave it for a few days until it heals, and then tie it up.
Si autem non accidit infirmo aliquid eorum quae diximus, tunc non oportet, ut soluatur, nisi post uiginti dies, aut circiter hos.	If, however, none of those things which we have said happens to the sick person, then it is not necessary that he be healed, unless after twenty days or about that time.
Deinde suspendatur manus infirmi ad collum eius.	Then hang his hand from his neck.
Et sit collum eius aequale, et custodiatur uirtute sua a motibus agitatiuis.	And let his neck be kept straight, and let him guard with virtue his own strength from restless movements.
Et fac eum dormire super dorsum suum.	And let him sleep on his back.
Et scias, quod haec fractura in triginta diebus, aut in triginta duobus diebus restauratur: et fortasse restauratur in uigintiocto diebus.	And know that this fracture is restored in twenty days, or in thirty-two, and perhaps it is restored in fifty.
Totum illud est secundum dispositiones complexionum, et dispositiones uirtutis.	All of this depends on the condition of his constitution, and the condition of virtue.
¶ De restauratione fracturarum Manus.	[Regarding the restoration of broken bones in the hand.]
Caput XIIII.	CHAPTER XVIII.
Scias, quod pectini Manus, et nodis digitorum raro accidit fractura.	Know that it is rare for a bone of the hand, or a knuckle of the fingers, to break.
Et non accidit ei, nisi attritio multotiens.	And it does not happen to him, unless by frequent rubbing.
Quando ergo accidit plantae fractura, aut attritio: tunc oportet, ut sedeat infirmus quadratus: et coram eo sit sedes secundum aequalitatem.	When, therefore, a bone is broken, or there is a bruise: then let the sick person sit in a sitting position; and before him let there be a seat on which to sit, with equality.
Deinde pone Manum eius super eam extensam.	Then put his hand on it, extended.
Deinde extendat minister ossa fracta, et aequet ea medicus, donec quando coniunguntur coniunctione bona.	Then the surgeon shall extend the broken bones and make them equal, until such time as he can join them together with a good joint.
Tunc oportet, ut ponat emplastrum et stuppam, si non accidat apostema calidum.	Then let there be applied plaster and a splint, if there does not happen to be a hot swelling.
Deinde pone astellam desuper secundum quantitatem loci: et tu iam inuoluisti eam in panno lini.	Then let the plaster be applied from above, according to the quantity of the place; and you have already bound it with linen cloth.
Si autem fractura est ad inferiora circiter uentrem plantae, tunc fac simile spherae ex panno: et praecipe infirmo, ut coartet super eam cum planta sua fracta: deinde stringatur cum panno longo.	If, however, the fracture is lower down, about the wrist-joint, then make a sort of sphere out of linen; and order the sick person to bend over it with his own wrist-joint that has been broken: and then bind it tightly with the linen cloth.
Et sit astella ex corio, in quo sit lenitas, ut applicetur corium cum corpore plantae: et stringe eam, secundum quod oportet.	And let there be a soft plate of copper, so that it may apply to the body with ease; and let it be bound tightly, according to what is necessary.
Si autem fractura est ad exteriora, tunc oportet: ut ponas astellam desuper, et astellam aliam ab inferiori in planta: et sit manus aperta recta.	If, however, the fracture is external, then it is necessary that you put a plaster from above, and another beneath in the foot: and let the hand be kept open and straight.
Deinde pone stricturam, sicut reuoluitur manus: et extende inter digitos cum ligamento.	Then put on a bandage, as it turns around the hand: and extend between the fingers with a ligament.
Quod si accidat fractura alicui nodorum digitorum, tunc si est pollex, aequetur secundum quod oportet.	If there is a fracture of any of the bones of the fingers, then if it is the thumb, it should be treated according to what needs to be done.
Deinde stringatur cum planta: et si amas, pone ei astellam rectam, paruam: ut eleuetur fractura, et non moueatur.	Then tie it with a splint: and if you want, put a straight bar, smooth: so that the fracture is held fast, and does not move.
Si autem fractura est reliquis digitis, sicut medio, et indici, aut auriculari, et anulari, tunc aequetur, et ligetur cum digito sano qui sequitur eum: aut ligentur omnes secundum continuationem: et est melius.	If the fracture is in any of the other fingers, such as the middle finger, index finger, or ring finger, then it should be tied to the finger that follows it: or all of them should be tied together according to their length: and this is better.
Aut pone super ipsum astellam paruam, sicut diximus in pollice.	Or put a splint on top of it, as we have said for the thumb.
Et considera in restauratione tua, et post ipsam dispositionem apostematis calidi: et oppone cum eo quod oportet, quando accidit aliquid ex illo, secundum quod iteratur eius narratio.	And consider in your treatment, and after that arrangement of the bandage with warm water: and oppose it as needed, when anything happens from it, according to what is its story.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Coxae.	On the restoration of a hip fracture.
Caput XV.	Chapter XV.
OS Coxae multotiens frangitur, et declaratur sensui: quoniam conuertitur ad interiorem et posteriorem partem.	The hip bone is often broken and can be recognized: because it turns towards the inner and back parts.
Et restauratio eius fit ita, quod stringitur ligamentum supra fracturam, et ligamentum aliud sub fractura.	And the restoration of it is done so that a bandage is put above the fracture, and another bandage is put under the fracture.
Et infirmus prostretur super faciem suam.	And the sick person extends his hand on his face.
Deinde extendat omne ligamentum minister ad partem suam secundum aequalitatem: et hoc, quando est fractura in medio ossis.	Then he should extend all the ligaments to their side according to equality: and this, when there is a fracture of the middle bone.
Si autem est fractura propinqua radici Coxae, tunc sit ligamentum ad partem pectinis, ut cadat extensio ad sursum: et ligamentum aliud sub fractura.	If the fracture is near the root of the hip bone, then a ligament should be tied to the pigtail side, so that it falls on extension towards the top: and another bandage under the fracture.
Et sic similiter si est fractura propinqua genu, tunc sit ligamentum propinquum genu, ut sit extensio ad inferiora.	And in the same way, if there is a fracture near the knee, then a close ligament should be tied to the knee, so that it falls on extension towards the bottom.
Deinde aequet medicus os utriusque manibus suis, donec reducat ipsum secundum similitudinem figurae naturalis: et coniugatur os coniunctione bona.	Then the doctor should make the bones of both hands fit together according to their natural shape: and join the bones with a good connection.
Tunc oportet, ut ponas emplastrum et stricturam, si non accidit membro apostema.	Then you should put on a poultice and bind it tightly, if there is not an apostema in the member.
Quod si accidat in eo apostema: tunc dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot, donec sedetur apostema calidum, deinde redi ad curationem tuam.	If there does happen to be an apostema in it: then let him be absent from his duties for a few days, until the apostema is removed by heat, and then return to your business.
Strictura autem eius ita sit.	But bind it so that
Oportet ut inuoluas super fracturam imema duram, id est, bindam: et dupla eam bis, aut ter: et remaneat ex ea superfluitas.	It is necessary that you wrap a cloth around the fracture hard, that is, bind it: and double it up twice, or three times: and let remain from it an excess.
Deinde inuolue crus, donec perueniat calcaneus apud radicem natis.	Then wrap the leg, until it reaches the heel bone of the grown child.
Et intromitte filum longum inter Coxam et crus prope genu ad inferiora, et ueniant extremitates fili a superiori parte duarum partium.	And insert a long thread between the coxis and the leg close to the knee towards the bottom, and make the two ends of the thread come from the top part of the two parts.
Deinde reuolue super Crus et Coxam quod superfluit ex alimema.	Then wrap the leg and the coxis that which is in excess from the cloth.
Deinde pone super Coxam in loco fracturae ipsius astellas, et pone ex eis astellam unam super os cruris.	Then put on the coxis, in the place of the fracture, stars, and put one star on top of the bone of the leg.
Deinde imple uacuitates inter crus et coxam cum pannis lenibus, ut aequetur strictura.	Then fill with wet cloths between the leg and the coxis so that it is tight.
Deinde incipe cum strictura forti a medio super locum fracturae tribus inuolutionibus, aut quatuor.	Then begin with the strong bandage from the middle of the place of the fracture three times around, or four times.
Et quanto plus elongaris cum ligamento a loco fracturae, sit strictura tua minor et mollior, et lenior.	And as much as you increase by stretching the bandage away from the place of the fracture, your bandage is smaller and softer, and gentler.
Deinde intende ad duas extremitates fili, quod tu intromisisti inter coxam et crus.	Then go towards the two ends of the thread, which you have inserted between the coxis and the leg.
Liga ergo cum utrisque tres astellas quae sunt desuper.	Bind then with the two stars that are on top.
Deinde uade cum duabus extremitatibus fili ad inferiora, donec peruenias ad cauillam pedis.	Then move with the two ends of the thread down, until you reach the ankle bone of the leg.
Et cum utrisque stringe etiam extremitates astellarum a parte altera: ut non remoueatur ligamentum ex loco suo.	And also tighten the ends of the bandage from the other side: so that the bandage does not move away from its place.
Deinde dimitte stricturam super illud, dum permanet, ita quod non accidat membro corrosio, neque apostema, neque inflatio, et similia eis.	Then remove the bandage off of it while it remains on, so that there does not happen to the member corrosion, or an apostema, or swelling, and such things like them.
Quod si accidat aliquid ex illo.	If something happens from it.
Propera ergo cum solutione eius, et rectifica illud quod accidit inde totum, secundum quod diximus multotiens.	Therefore proceed carefully with the washing, and adjust it completely as before, as we have said many times.
Si uero in osse est frustum ex osse quod pungat: tunc oportet, ut aeques illud, si est tibi possibile.	If, however, there is a fragment of bone that pierces the bone: then it should be made even as before, if you can do so.
Et si non, finde super illud, et remoue illud: et cura cum eo cuius praecessit rememoratio, donec sanetur.	And if not, find above it, and move that; and care with it whose memory is before it, until it heals.
Et quandoque stringitur haec fractura Coxae, praeter quod addantur ei astellae, sicut diximus in adiutorio et brachio.	And when this fracture of the hip joint is tightened, besides the fact that stars are added to it, as we have said in the arm and shoulder.
Verumtamen in restauratione eius taliter fracta, non accidit infirmo claudicatio.	However, in restoring it, such a fracture does not lead to limping.
Et si restauratur sola, praeter quod applicetur ei crus alterum, tunc necesse est, ut claudicet ille cuius est, semper.	And if restored alone, besides that an other leg is applied to it, then it is necessary that he who has it should always limp.
Et scias, quod Coxa stringitur in quinquaginta diebus, uel additur parum, aut minuitur parum: totum illud est secundum diuersitatem complexionum, et reliquarum dispositionum.	And you should know that the hip joint is tightened in fifty days, or added a little, or slightly shortened: all this depends on the difference of the complexions, and the remaining dispositions.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Rotulae genu.	Of restoring the fracture of the knee joint of the leg.
Caput XVI.	Chapter XVI.
Scias, quod Rotulae genu raro accidit fractura, sed accidit ei attritio multotiens.	You should know that the knee joint of the leg rarely breaks, but it often occurs by wear and tear.
Si uero accidit ei fractura, tunc non nisi aut fissura, aut foramen in partibus suis.	If a fracture has occurred, then there is either a crack, or a hole, or an opening in its parts.
Et est illud cum uulnere, et absque uulnere.	And it is with the ulna, and without the ulna.
Et statur super illud totum cum sensu.	And stands completely on that side with regard.
Et restauratio eius est ita, ut aequetur quod disruptum est ex partibus eius cum digitis, donec aggregetur, et coniungatur secundum quod possibile est ex aequatione et facilitate, et fabricatione.	And the restoration of it is such that it adjusts what has been broken from its parts with the fingers, until it comes together, and joins together in accordance with what can be done by adjustment and ease, and by making.
Deinde pone emplastrum ex farina sisami, uel molendini, cum albumine oui: et pone super ipsum astellam rotundam, si indiges illa: et stringe desuper strictura conueniente ad illud.	Then put on a plaster of rice flour, or to be ground, with egg white: and put over it a round bar, if you can bear that: and tighten from above with a suitable tie that goes to it.
Deinde considera omnes dispositiones quas narrauimus in reliquis fracturis: sicut apostema calidum, et similia illi: ita, ut opponas omni accidenti cum eo quod conuenit ei, donec sanetur.	Then consider all the dispositions which we have spoken of in the other broken parts: like heat apoplexia, and similar to them: so that you may oppose every accident with regard to what is suited to it, until it heals over.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Cruris.	Regarding the restoration of fractures of the leg.
Caput XVII.	Chapter XVII.
Scias, quod Cruri sunt duo ossa, quorum unum est grossum, et nominatur nomine Cruris: et alterum subtile, et nominatur Focile.	Know that there are two bones of the leg, one is large and called "leg bone": and the other is fine and called "shaft".
Et accidit utrisque ex speciebus fracturae quod accidit duobus ossibus brachii: et propter illud fit restauratio eius, sicut restauratio brachii aequaliter, et operatio est una.	And it happens to both species of fracture which happens to the two bones of the arm: and for that reason the restoration of this is made like the restoration of the arm evenly, and the operation is one.
Quod si franguntur duo ossa simul, conuertitur Crus ad omnes partes.	If both bones break at the same time, the leg becomes deformed in all parts.
Et si frangitur os subtilius, conuertitur Crus ad anteriorem partem.	And if the fine bone breaks, the leg is deformed towards the front.
Et si frangitur os grossius, inuenis illud inferius: et est ex eis quae non occultantur tibi.	And if the large bone breaks, it injures the lower part: and it is of these which do not hide from you.
Deinde administra extensionem, et aequationem, et ligationem astellarum secundum illud aequaliter.	Then administer stretching, and equalization, and binding of the joints according to that being even.
Verumtamen oportet, si fractura Cruris est fractura foeda, habens sethagie multa: ut sit extensio minor, et lenior alleuiatione tua.	However, if the fracture of the leg is a bad one, it has many things: so that there should be less stretching, and gentler relief for you.
Et in Crure quidem est ex operatione quiddam super brachium: et est, ut quando tu aequas astellas, et comples omnem operationem tuam, tunc accipe duas fascias ex ligno pini, quod administratur in fabricatione solariorum quod ponitur sub tabulis: et fiunt ex spatulis palmae: et elige ex eis quibus est grossitudo parua, et neque sint ex minutis: et sit longitudo earum secundum longitudinem Cruris a genu usque inferius.	And in the leg itself there is some operation similar to that of the arm: and it is, as when you make the joints equal, and complete all your operation, then take two strips from the wood of pine, which is used in making sole pieces which are placed under tables: and they are made from palm leaves: and choose from them which have little thickness, and there are none from the small ones: and let their length be according to the length of the leg from the knee down.
Deinde inuolue super unamquamque pannum duabus inuolutionibus secundum longitudinem eius.	Then sew over a single piece of cloth on two strips of linen, according to its length.
Et pone unam partem Cruris a parte una, et alteram a parte altera: et sint ex genu usque inferius pedis.	And put one side of the leg from one side, and the other from another: and let them be from the knee down to the foot.
Deinde liga duas fascias in tribus locis ex duabus extremitatibus et medio.	Then bind the two strips at three places from the two ends and the middle.
Cum enim strictura prohibetur, Crus declinat ad dextram et sinistram, et stat statione bona.	Since stricture is prohibited, the leg leans towards the right and left, and stands in a good position.
Et iam quidem administretur cunabulum ex ligno secundum longitudinem Cruris, et ponatur in eo Crus, ut conseruet ipsum a motu.	And already let there be administered a cane from wood according to the length of the leg, and let it be placed in it so that it keeps it from moving.
Et plurimum quidem oportet, ut facias illud in fractura quando cum ea est uulnus proprie.	And indeed it is necessary that you do this for a fracture when it is a simple fracture.
Deinde considera Crus in omni die, et stude cum eo studio ultimo ab apostemate, aut inflatione, aut reliquis aliis.	Then consider the bone every day, and study it with great care from apoplexy, or inflammation, or any other thing.
Si ergo accidit aliquid ex illis, tunc oppone ei cum eo quod oportet, usquequo sanetur, si Deus uoluerit.	But if anything of this happens, then oppose it to him as it should be opposed, until he is healed, if God wills.
De fractura ossium Pedis, et Digitorum.	Of the fracture of the bones of the foot and the fingers.
Caput XVIII.	Chapter XVIII.
Calcaneo quidem non accidit fractura penitus.	The heel does not occur a fracture within.
Ossibus uero Pedis accidit quandoque fractura, et Digitis parum etiam accidit fractura: et non accidit eis nisi attritio in pluribus dispositionibus.	But the bones of the foot do sometimes occur when a fracture, and the fingers also sometimes occur a fracture, and they do not occur to them unless it is a tearing in many places.
Quod si accidit ossibus Pedis fractura, et uides illa ossa sublimari super se adinuicem, tunc ponat infirmus Pedem suum super terram praeparatam, sicut ambulans.	That if a fracture occurs to the bones of the foot, and you see those bones sliding one over another, then let the sick person put his foot on the ground prepared like a walker.
Deinde sta tu, et pone Pedem tuum super illud quod eleuatur ex illis ossibus: postea preme, uel calca eam: et aequa ipsam, donec redeat in locis suis.	Then stand you, and put your foot on it so that it rises from those bones: then press on it, or trample on it: and make it even, until it comes back to its places.
Deinde pone emplastrum, et stuppam desuper: et pone sub uentre Pedis tabulam paruam, cui sint duo capita plana.	Then put a plaster on it, and a strap from above: and put under the foot a flat board with two flat heads.
Deinde stringe eam cum Pede strictura decenti, postquam tu inuoluis eam cum pannis, et reliquis quibus indiget.	Then tighten it with a band around the foot that is tightly tied down, after you have wrapped it with cloth, and with anything else that it needs.
Cum ergo praetereunt ei tres dies, aut quatuor, tunc solue ligamentum.	When therefore they have passed over three or four days, then loosen the ligaments.
Nam tu inuenies ossa aequata, siue sint fracta, aut sint dislocata.	For you will find the bones even if they are broken, or are out of place.
Operatio ergo in eis est, sicut uides.	The operation then is on them as you see it.
Si autem franguntur aliqui digiti, tunc restaura eos, et aequa ipsos secundum quod narraui tibi in restauratione digitorum manus.	But if any of the fingers are broken, then restore them, and make them even according to how you have told me in the restoration of finger bones of the hand.
Deinde pone digito tuo astellam secundum longitudinem digiti, et sit latior eo parumper: deinde pone sub Pede hanc tabulam quam narraui tibi, et stringe eam strictura decenti.	Then put your finger on a little splint according to the length of the finger, and make it a little wider: then put under the foot this board that I have told you about, and tighten it with a band that is tightly tied down.
Si uero quod frangitur ex ossibus est duo, aut tria, aut plus, tunc pone super omnem digitum astellam suae quantitatis, inuolutam in panno lini: et stringe tabulam in inferiori Pedis: et sit stans super unum capitum tabulae extra uentrem Pedis, ut teneat retentione bona.	If the fracture is indeed from the bones, two, three, or more, then put a staff of its quantity on all the fingers, rolled up in a cloth: and tighten the board in the lower foot; and stand with one head of the board outside the navel of the foot, so that it holds well with retention.
Et conuenit tibi, ut non obliuiscaris, quin consideres omnia quae dixi tibi in reliquis fracturis ex accidentibus quae diximus: et oppone omni accidenti cum eo quod oportet.	And it is appropriate for you so that you do not forget, except that you consider all that I have said to you regarding the remaining fractures from the accidents that we have mentioned: and oppose every accident with him that is necessary.
¶ De fractura Vuluae mulieris, et ossis pectinis, et uirgae uiri.	Regarding the fracture of a woman's vulva, and of the bones of the breastbone and spine.
Caput XIX.	Chapter 19.
Quando frangitur Vulua mulieris, tunc fac eam sedere quadratam.	When the vulva of a woman is broken, then let her sit square.
Deinde inclina eam ad partem dorsi ipsius parumper, et teneatur retro.	Then lean her slightly toward the back of her own side and hold her behind.
Deinde impleat obstetrix Vuluam eius coto, donec impleat eam: et fiat in Vulua ex eo sicut sphera.	Then the midwife fills the woman's vulva with cotton, until she is filled: and let it be made in the vulva from that with which a sphere is made.
Deinde concutiatur mulier, et eleua dorsum eius paulatim.	Then the woman is shaken, and her back is raised little by little.
Illud enim cotum egreditur, donec fiat ante portam Vuluae sicut sphera, et os fractum redit.	For that cotton will come out, until it goes before the door of the vulva like a sphere, and the broken jaw returns.
Deinde pone puluillum super dorsum eius.	Then put a cotton ball on her back.
Quando ergo uult mingere, remoueat cotum cum facilitate, deinde mingat: et reduc ipsum secundum modum, quo intromisisti ipsum in primis: deinde redeat ad puluillum suum primum.	When she then wants to urinate, let the cotton move with ease, and then urinate: and reduce it according to the way that you put it in at first: and then return it to her first cotton.
Faciat illud septem diebus, aut circiter, os ipsum enim restauratur.	Let it be made for seven days, or about, for the jaw itself is restored: for it is made again.
Et si uis, accipe uesicam ouis, et stringe super foramen eius cannulam arundinis, et intromitte uesicam totam in Vuluam eius.	And if you want to, take a white feather, and tighten a reed tube on its hole, and insert the entire feather into her vulva.
Deinde suffla in cannulam cum uirtute, donec infletur uesica intra Vuluam, fractura enim redit.	Then blow into the tube with force, until the feather bends inside the vulva, for the fracture returns.
Deinde impleatur cum coto, et stet aliquot diebus, secundum quod narrauimus, donec sanetur.	Then fill it with cotton, and stand a few days, according to what we have said, until it heals.
Et quando frangitur os Pectinis uiri, aut mulieris, tunc administra in restauratione eius, et ipsius aequatione illud quod narrauimus in osse Anchae.	When the skull of a man or woman is broken, then administer to it the restoration and correction which we have described for the bone of the cheek.
Et non occultatur rectum in his fracturis propinquis, quae parum contingunt, praecipue cui est quiddam studii, uel usus.	And the rectum is not hidden in those who are close to him, which happens little, especially if he has some study or use.
Et intellige librum meum istum multum, quoniam fractura ipsa significat tibi in pluribus dispositionibus uiam rectam in restauratione sui, et strictura sui: intellige ergo.	And understand my book very well, because the fracture itself tells you in many ways about the right way to restore your own health and tighten it: so understand.
In Virga autem uiri quando frangitur, accipe guttur anseris: et intromitte uirgam in ipso.	But when the man's skull is broken, take a goose's throat; and insert the staff into it.
Deinde pone super ipsum inuolutionem ex panno, et inuoluatur, et dimittatur tribus diebus, aut circiter eos, et sanabitur, si Deus uoluerit.	Then put a cloth over the wound and wrap it up; and leave it for three days or so, and it will heal, if God wills.
¶ De restauratione fracturae ossium, quando est cum uulnere.	On the restoration of fractures of bones, when they are joined with a fracture of the bone.
Caput XX.	Chapter XX.
Conuenit ei cui accidit fractura cum uulnere, praecipue si est magnum, sicut os coxae, aut adiutorii, aut simile illi, ut properes, et phlebotomes ipsum statim: si attestantur tibi conditiones phlebotomiae, sicut praemisimus.	It is appropriate for him who has suffered a fracture of the bone, especially if it is large, such as the hipbone or an aid, or similar to it, as you think fit, and stop the flow of blood: if you are allowed to bleed, as we have described above.
Quod si uulnus effluit sanguinem, tunc oportet, ut properes ad abscisionem eius, ita ut puluerizes super ipsum zegi tritum: si non est tibi praesens aliud.	If the blood is flowing, then you should, as you think fit, cut off part of it so that it turns into dust on top of the wound: if you do not have anything else at hand.
Deinde incipe restaurare fracturam in illo eodem die: et non postponas illud, si non accidit apostema.	Then begin to restore the fracture in the same day: and do not put off doing it, unless there is a bruise.
Si uero accidit apostema calidum, tunc dimitte restaurationem eius usque ad diem nonum, donec sedetur apostema.	But if a bruise has become hot, then do not administer the restoration until the ninth day, until it cools down.
Et non appropinques ei in die tertio, et quarto omnino, nam tu faceres ei accidere accidentia mala.	And do not approach him on the third and fourth days at all, for you would make bad accidents happen to him.
Si autem os fractum est eminens super cutem detectum: tunc oportet, ut coneris reducere ipsum, et aequare ipsum manibus tuis cum facilitate et extensione parua.	But if a bone is broken and stands out above the skin: then you should seek to reduce it and make it stand firmly with your hands, using a slight force and extension.
Si autem non praeparatur extensio eius, et ipsius aequatio manibus tuis: tunc reduc ipsum cum isto instrumento.	If, however, the extension is not prepared and his equinoctium with your hands: then reduce him with this instrument.
Et est instrumentum quod fit ex ferro, cuius longitudo est quantitas septem digitorum, aut octo: et eius latitudo est secundum quantitatem uulneris.	And it is an instrument that is made of iron, the length of which is the quantity of seven fingers, or eight; and its width is according to the quantity of the wound.
Et propter illud necesse est medico, ut accipiat ex eis tria, aut quatuor secundum quantitatem qua indiget ad illud ex curatione in omni specie fracturae.	And for this reason it is necessary that the doctor should take from them three or four according to the quantity that he needs for the cure of any kind of fracture.
Et sit rotundum: et sit in eo grossitudo parua, ut non duplicetur apud compressionem super ipsum in hora operationis: et sit acutae extremitatis, cui sit margo in extremitatibus suis.	And it should be round: and it should have little thickness so that it does not double itself under pressure on it at the time of the operation: and it should have an acute extremity, which has a rim in its extremities.
Et sit superius eius ad grossitudinem ex medietate eius usque ad inferiora.	And it should be above its thickness by a third of its length from its lower end.
Et haec est forma eius.	This is the shape of it.
Oportet in Hac Operatione, ut ponatur extremitas eius acuta curuata super extremitatem ossis eminentis: et impelle ipsum cum eo uice una, donec quando redit os et aequatur quadam aequatione.	It is necessary in this operation that its acute extremity should be placed curved on the end of the prominent bone: and push it with a single blow, until when it returns the bone and equips it with some équation.
Conare ergo aequare extremitates fracturae adinuicem.	Consider therefore to make the ends of the fracture face each other at right angles.
Quod si extremitates eius fracta est subtilis, et non accipit eam instrumentum accaeptione bona, tunc opotet, ut incidas extremitatem illius ossis, donec instrumentum potestatem habeat eius.	If its ends of the fracture are thin and does not take it with a good grip, then he should, that you hit the end of the bone, until the instrument can get a grip.
Si uero non potes reducere eos cum eo quod narrauimus omnino, tunc incide ipsum cum eo quod conuenit ei ex Incisoriis quae diximus: aut serra ipsum cum una serrarum quocunque modo possibile est tibi.	But if you cannot reduce them at all with what we have described, then cut him with it from the incision which we said: or saw him with a saw of any kind that is possible for you.
Deinde rade illud quod remanet in osse ex asperitate et corticibus minutis.	Then pare away what remains in the bone from the roughness and small bark.
Cum ergo reducitur os, et inuenit infirmus post reductionem eius dolorem uehementem laedentem, tunc scias, quod os non rediit ad locum suum naturalem.	But when the bone is reduced and finds itself weak after its reduction, with a painful and annoying pain, then you should know that the bone has not returned to its natural place.
Fac ergo illud.	Do this then.
Nam tu confers infirmo iuuamentum magnum, cum completur restauratio tua quam facis ossi.	For you have a great handicap when your restoration is complete which repairs the bones.
Tunc submerge pannum in uino stiptico, nigro.	Then dip the cloth in astringent wine, black.
Et proprie si est in aestate.	And especially if it is in summer.
Et non ponas super uulnus caerotum, neque aliquid in quo sit oleum: ut non faciat accidere in ipso putredinem et corruptionem.	And do not place it on a rotten splint, nor anything where oil is: lest it cause decay and corruption in itself.
Deinde administra astellas in hora complementi tui a restauratione ossis.	Then administer the medicine at the hour of your meal from restoration of bone.
Et dimitte uulnus detectum: ita, ut incidas cum forficibus foramen in inuolutionibus secundum quantitatem uulneris.	And release the nail that is driven in: so, that you do not come to harm with pliers in the event of a second wound according to the quantity of the wound.
Et caue omni cautela, ne stringas uulnus cum fractura.	And take all precautions, do not tighten the nail with a fracture.
Multotiens enim fecerunt istud stolidi medici: et fecerunt accidere super infirmos suos aut mortem, aut corrosionem, aut zuchem, id est, saniem.	For many times the ignorant physicians have done this: and they have caused to happen to their patients or death or corruption or putrefaction, that is, disease.
Et sit strictura tua mollis, lenis, diuersa stricturae fracturarum reliquarum.	And be your bandage soft, gentle, diverse from the strictures of broken bones.
Quod si uulnus est malum, aut est uulnus magnum, et times super ipsum quaedam accidentia mala quae narrauimus, et inuenis dolorem in loco suspensum: tunc non oportet, ut ponas super ipsum astellas.	That if the nail is bad, or is a large nail, and you wait for some misfortune to come that we have described, and suspend pain in the place: then it is not appropriate that you should place the nail on the splint.
Et fac eis inuolutiones ex pannis duris in loco astellarum, et stringe ipsum cum eis.	And make them solutions from tough cloths in the place of the nails, and tighten the nail with them.
Cum autem est post diem unum, aut dies duos, et uides uulnus iam incipere, ut in eo generetur pus: tunc aufer desuper ipsum pannum quem posuisti super ipsum cum uino.	When, however, it is after one day, or two days, and you see the nail beginning to form pus, then remove the cloth that you placed on the nail with the wine.
Deinde administra licinia, et unguenta cum quibus de consuetudine nostra est, ut medicemur uulnera: sicut unguentum tetrapharmacon, et similia illi.	Then administer licorice, and oils with which we are accustomed, to heal the wounds: such as the oil of four-fold mixture, and similar to it.
Et conuenit tibi, ut soluas ligamentum.	And it will be well with you, so that you release the ligaments.
Et considera uulnus in omni die mane et uespere, donec consolidetur, et sanetur.	And consider the nail every day, morning and evening, until it is healed, and has healed.
Et oportet, ut praeparetur membrum taliter, ut currat ex eo pus ad inferiora cum facilitate.	And it should be prepared for the limb so that pus can come out of it with ease to the lower parts.
Quod si praetereunt uulneri dies multi, et non consolidatur, neque abscinditur pus ab eo: tunc scias, quod illic sunt satagie ossis parua.	That if there are many days of wounds and it does not heal, nor does the pus come out of it: then you should know that there are small bones in it.
Quare oportet, ut inquiras uulnus cum tenta.	It is necessary to inquire about the fracture with the tendency.
Quot uero ex illis alsatagie sunt separata, remoue ea, et extrahe ipsa.	How many of those false joints are separated, remove them and pull out the same.
Et quae ex eis sunt non separata, et pungunt membrum, et faciunt accidere dolorem, conare incidere ea, et auferre ea omni modo quo possibile est tibi illud.	And which of those false joints are not separated, and piercing the limb, and causing pain, try to cause it, and remove it in any way possible for you that one.
Quod si accidat uulneri zuchen, aut ekileten, id est, estiomenus, aut species alia corruptionis et putrefactionis: tunc oportet, ut opponas unicuique ex eis cum eo quod conuenit ei ex curatione, cuius praecessit narratio in capitulo suo.	That if it is a wound that has been chafed, or ekileten, that is, hematoamas, or any other kind of corruption and putrefaction: then you should oppose each one of them with what corresponds to it in healing, the description of which precedes in its own chapter.
Et ex eo in quo oportet ut stet sermo meus, et cui facias praesentem mentem tuam quando frangitur os, et eminet super membrum, sicut os coxae, et adiutorii, et similia eis ex membris magnis, est, ut non praesumas attractionem eius, multotiens enim accidit ex illo mors, imo dimitte ipsum, donec putrefiat.	And from this, in which it is necessary that my speech should stand, and to which you should pay attention when the jaw is broken, and emerges onto the limb, like the hip bone, and assistants, and similar ones from large limbs, that is, do not suppose attraction of it, because often it happens from it death, but leave it until it putrefies.
Fortasse enim cadet per se post uiginti dies, aut triginta.	Perhaps it will fall by itself after twenty days, or thirty.
Tunc ergo cura uulnus, si uidetur tibi: et sinon, dimitte ipsum.	Then, therefore, take care of the fracture if you have it: and otherwise, leave it alone.
¶ De curatione Nodationis in uestigio fracturae.	On the treatment of a nodulation, if there is one: and otherwise, leave it alone.
Caput XXI.	Chapter 21.
Multoties accidit haec Nodatio in uestigio sanationis fracturae.	This nodulation often occurs in the process of healing a fracture.
Praecipue, quae est prope iuncturas: et foedatur ex ea figura membri.	 terutama that which is near joints: and it grows out of the shape of the limb.
Et fortasse prohibet membrum ab operatione sua naturali.	And perhaps prevents the limb from its natural function.
Considera ergo tunc, si nodatio est recens: administra in ea medicinas quae stipticitatem habent, sicut aloe, et olibanum, et myrrha, et sarcocolla, et acacia, et similia eis.	Consider therefore then, if the nodulation is new: administer to it medicines which have a constricting effect, such as aloe, and olive oil, and myrrh, and oak galls, and acacia, and similar ones.
Ita, ut accipias ex istis quasdam, aut omnes eas: et confice eas cum uino stiptico, aut cum albumine oui, aut cum aceto: et pone eas super nodationem in stuppa, et stringe eas super ipsam strictura bona.	So that you take some of these things, or all of them: and bind them with a bitter wine, or with white of egg, or with vinegar: and put them on the nodulation in a poultice, and tightly bind them with a good constriction.
Et dimitte stricturam, nec soluas eam diebus multis.	And loosen the bandage, and do not take it off for many days.
Deinde solue eam, et itera aliam, donec remoueatur nodatio.	Then remove the bandage, and put on a new one, until the swelling goes down.
Aut stringe super ipsam laminam plumbi decenter.	Or tighten with a lead strip laid斜 across.
Plumbo enim est proprietas remouendi omne quod timetur ex membris.	Lead is good for removing whatever fears the body.
Si autem nodatio iam in lapidem conuersa est, et stricta est, et festine prouocat necessitas ad auferendum eam: tunc finde super eam ex superiori parte eius, et incide superfluitatem eminentem: aut rade eam cum quibusdam rasoriis, donec remoueatur: et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	But if the swelling has already settled into the stone, and is fixed, and the need to remove it is urgent: then find on top of it and cut off the surplus: or else saw it off with some chisels, until you remove it: and take care of it, until it heals.
¶ De curatione quando restauratur, et remanet membrum post illud subtile, non secundum naturam suam.	As for the treatment when it is restored, and remains a limb after that, not in accordance with its natural shape.
Caput XXII.	Chaps 22.
Quando restauratur fractura ossis, et remanet membrum post illud subtile, debile: tunc non fit illud nisi propter caussas multas.	When a bone fracture is restored, and remains a limb that is weak, then it should not be used for any great cause.
Quarum una est, multitudo solutionis ligamenti et ligationis eius non secundum quod oportet: aut propter superfluitatem stricturae ligamentorum, donec prohibeatur nutrimentum currere ad membrum: aut propter multitudinem embrocationis superfluae in non sua hora: aut propter paucitatem sanguinis in corpore infirmi, et debilitatem eius.	Of which one is, a multiplicity of ligatures and their tightening not being in accordance with what should be: or because of the surplus stricture of the ligaments, until food running to the member is forbidden: or because of the multitude of embalmings that are superfluous at the wrong time: or because of the scarcity of blood in the body, and its weakness.
Et curatio illius est, cibare infirmum, et tenerum facere corpus eius, donec multiplicetur sanguis in eo.	And the treatment for it is, to feed the sick and make the body light: until the blood increases in it.
Et administra balneum.	And apply a bath.
Et intromitte gaudium et laeticiam super eum.	And introduce joy and gladness to him.
Deinde pone picem super membrum: ut attrahat pix ad ipsum nutrimentum multum.	Then place a piece on the limb: so that the piece attracts much food to it.
Et assiduet embrocationem eius cum aqua tepida, donec currat nutrimentum, et redeat ad figuram suam naturalem.	And persistently apply embalmings with hot water, until food runs, and returns to its natural shape.
¶ De curatione ossium fractorum quando restaurantur tortuose.	As for the treatment when broken bones are restored that have been twisted out of shape.
Caput XXIII.	Chaps 23.
Quando accidit membro iam restaurato post sanationem eius tortuositas, et eminentia ossi fracto, aut nodatio: et foedatur per illud forma membri, uerumtamen membrum non prohibetur ab operatione sua naturali: tunc non oportet ut recipias sermonem eius, qui existimat, ut frangatur membrum denuo.	When it happens that a member is restored after its cure, and there is a prominent bone fracture or swelling: and the shape of the limb is altered: but the limb should not be forbidden from its natural function: so you need not object to its breaking again.
Et iam fuerunt multi stolidorum medicorum et restauratorum, qui fecerunt illud in terra nostra.	There were also many foolish doctors and healers who did this thing on our land.
Et haec quidem operatio est uituperabilis ualde, perducens ad mortem, uel timorem magnum, ut scilicet sit mortalis.	And yet this operation is most dangerous, leading to death or great fear, as if it were mortal.
Verum si claudicatio et nodatio sunt recentes: tunc oportet, ut embrocetur cum aqua tepida, in qua decoctae sint herbae mollificantes, sicut folia alteae, et radix eius, et mellilotum, et illis similia.	But if the claudication and fainting are recent: then it should be soaked with warm water, in which the softening herbs have been boiled, such as the leaves of aloe, and its root, and mallow, and similar ones.
Et fiat ei emplastrum cum emplastro mollificatiuo, sicut dyachilon decenter factum.	And let there be made for him a plaster with a softening plaster, like that of dandelion根
Aut sumatur mucilago radicis alteae, et concutiatur cum adipe gallinae, aut oleo sisamino: et emplastretur cum eo.	Or take the mucilage of the root of aloe and mix it with chicken fat or oil of sesame: and let it be applied with it.
Aut sumantur ficus pingues, et terantur cum fimo columbino, et similibus eis quae nominantur ex medicinis diminuentes consolidationem.	Or take young fig branches, and pound them with the clay of columbine, and similar ones which are called to reduce consolidation.
Et quandoque soluitur nodatio cum fricatione assidua, antiqua, et leni, quae fit cum manibus humidis.	And when the fainting has ceased through persistent, ancient, and gentle rubbing, which is done with wet hands.
Et administretur motus membri ad omnem partem in horis omnibus.	And let the member move in all directions.
Si autem tortuositas iam antecessit, et fortis facta est, et conuersa est in lapidem, et prouocata est necessitas ad curatonem eius cum ferro: tunc oportet, ut secetur superius eius, et soluatur continuatio ossis, et incidatur quod superfluit ex nodatione aut osse cum Incisoriis subtilibus: et administretur facilitas in illo cum sollicitudine et studio.	But if the curvature has already preceded, and it is strong, and has turned into a rock, and there is a need to treat it with iron: then let it be cut above, the continuation of the bone be removed, and that which exceeds from the curvature be taken away with very fine incisions: and let ease be given to it with care and diligence.
¶ De sermone in Dislocatione.	On the treatment of dislocations.
Caput XXIIII.	Chapter XXIV.
Dislocatio est exitus alicuius iuncturarum a loco suo.	A dislocation is the exit of some joints from their place.
Quare prohibetur a motu suo, et foedatur figura membri.	Why it is prevented by its own motion, and is fixed in position.
Et facit accidere super infirmum dolores, et laesiones uehementes.	And does happen to cause great pain and painful wounds.
Quando ergo accidit alicui dislocatio, tunc oportet festinare ad restaurationem eius: neque tardet eam omnino.	But when such a dislocation has happened, then let it hurry to restore it: and do not delay it at all.
Nam si tardatur, apostematur locus, et fortasse cum eo reductio dislocationis.	For if it is delayed, the place will be infected, and there may well be a recurrence of the dislocation with it.
Propter illud ergo non oportet, ut moueatur, neque extendatur in hora apostemationis eius.	Therefore, it is not appropriate for him to move or extend himself at the time of examination.
Quoniam multotiens facit accidere spasmum, et dolores laedentes.	Because he often causes a spasm to occur and hurts with his movements.
Verum quando accidit illud, tunc oportet, ut properes ad phlebotomiam infirmi.	But when that happens, then you should approach the wound with care.
Deinde dimittatur, donec quiescat apostema.	Then he should be dismissed until the swelling subsides.
Deinde embrocetur membrum cum aqua calida et oleo.	Then the member is to be warmed with warm water and oil.
Deinde reducatur cum facilitate.	Then it is to be reduced with ease.
Et curetur omne membrum cum eo cuius rememoratio ueniet in loco suo.	And all members are to be cared for with their respective treatments.
Ego quidem iam ordinaui capitula dislocationis, etiam secundum quod praecessit in fractura, a superiori parte corporis usque ad inferiorem eius.	I have already arranged the chapters on dislocations, also regarding the prior fracture, from the upper part of the body to the lower.
¶ De cura dislocationis Mandibulae inferioris.	§ On the treatment of a dislocation of the lower jaw.
Caput XXV.	Chapter 25
Parum dislocantur duae Mandibulae nisi raro.	The two jaws are rarely dislocated.
Et dislocatio ambarum fit secundum unum duoru modorum.	And the dislocation of the lower jaw occurs in one of two ways.
Aut enim remouentur a locis suis remotione parua, et mollificantur parumper.	Or, on the other hand, they move away from their places by a small distance and become slightly softer.
Aut dislocantur dislocatione integra, completa, donec mollificentur ad partem pectoris, donec currat saliua infirmi, et non possit tenere eam, neque possit claudere os suum, et inuoluatur lingua eius cum sermone.	Or they are dislocated with an intact and complete dislocation until they become soft to the breastbone, until they salivate with care, and they cannot hold it, nor can they close their mouth, and their tongue is extended with a hiss.
Quando autem dislocatio eius est parua, tunc redit in pluribus dispositionibus per se cum paucitate.	When, however, the dislocation of his jaw is small, then it returns to its place by itself with a little difficulty.
Si uero est dislocatio completa, integra: tunc oportet, ut administretur reductio eius uelociter, et non tardetur penitus: et est, ut teneat minister caput infirmi: et intromittat medicus pollicem manus suae unius in radicem Mandibulae dislocationis inter os eius, si dislocatio est a parte una.	But if the dislocation is complete and intact: then it should be administered to reduce it quickly, and there should be no delay: and it is as if the doctor held the head with his hand at the base of the jaw's dislocation between its teeth, if the dislocation is from one side.
Aut intromittat duos pollices suos simul, si dislocatio est a duabus partibus.	Or introduce two fingers simultaneously, if the dislocation is on both sides.
Et reliqui digiti manuum eius sint extra, quibus aequet.	And the remaining fingers of his hand are outside, which makes it even.
Et praecipe infirmo, ut mundificet Mandibulas suas, et absoluat eas ad manducandum ad omnem partem.	And recommend to the sick person that they clean their jaws and allow them to eat fully.
Et medicus aequet Mandibulam, et impellat Mandibulam, donec redeat ad locum suum.	And the surgeon should make the jaw equal and push it back to its place.
Quod si difficilis sit reductio eius, praecipue si sunt ambae Mandibulae simul: tunc administra uaporationem cum aqua calida, et oleo, donec fiat facilis reductio ambarum: neque tardes reductionem ambarum omnino, sicut diximus.	If it is difficult to reduce it, especially if both jaws are involved: then administer perspiration with warm water and oil until the reduction becomes easy: and do not delay the reduction of the jaws at all, as we have said.
Cum ergo redeunt et aequantur, et clauditur os infirmi, et non mollificantur: tunc pone super eas puluillos pannorum, cum ceroto quod sit factum ex cera: et oleo rosato.	When they have healed and been made equal, and the jaw has closed, and the swelling has not subsided: then place a few cloth pads on them, with a ball of wax that has been made from wax; and oil rosin.
Deinde ligetur cum facilitate cum ligamentis mollibus.	Then it is bound together easily with soft ligaments.
Et sit somnus infirmi super dorsum suum: et caput eius sit stans inter duo puluinaria, ut non moueat ipsum ad dextram et sinistram: neque conetur, uel cogatur masticare aliquid: imo ponatur cibus eius sorbitio lenis, donec quando remouentur dolores, et nodatur Mandibula: tunc comedat quod uult, et administretur illud cum facilitate.	And it should lie down on its back: and the head of the patient should be placed between two cloth pads so that it does not move to one side or the other: and it should not be forced to chew anything: but its food should be soft, so that when the pain goes away, the jaw can open: then it may eat what it wants, and administer it easily.
Non laboret super operationem oris sui apud comestionem et potum, et oscitationem, donec nodetur Mandibula, et sanetur.	It should not be troubled by the operation of its mouth during eating and drinking, and whistling, until the jaw has healed and become well.
Quod si difficilis fiat reductio duarum Mandibuiarum, quando dislocantur in hora aliqua, et non conuertuntur ad loca sua: tunc multotiens accidunt inde febres, et soda assidua: et fortasse soluitur uenter infirmi, et fortasse uomit choleram puram.	If it is difficult to reduce the two jaws when they are dislocated at some time, and do not return to their places: then frequent fevers and sodas occur: and perhaps intestinal congestion occurs, and perhaps pure choler is lost.
Cum ergo uides illud: tunc scias, quia est perditio, et multotiens moritur ille cui accidit illud in decem diebus.	So when you see this: then know that it is a sign of death, and many times that person dies within ten days.
¶ De reducione dislocationis Furculae, et extremitatis humeri.	On the reduction of dislocation of the furrow and the extreme of the arm.
Caput XXVI.	Chapter XXVI. On the head.
Furcula quidem non dislocatur ex latere intrinseco, propter continuationem suam cum pectore.	The furrow does not dislocate from the side due to the continuity of its connection with the chest.
Et dislocatur quandoque ad exteriora: et declaratur illud sensui.	And it dislocations when and where it goes outwardly: and announces this to the sense.
Et restauratio eius est, ut iaceat infirmus super dorsum suum, et extendat brachia sua.	And its restoration is so that it lies sick on its back, and extends its arms.
Deinde coarta locum cum palma tua coartatione forti, nam ipsa redibit.	Then bind the place with your palm and bandage it strongly, for itself will come back.
Deinde pone super ipsam emplastrum, et puluillos, et stringe eam.	Then put a plaster on it, and poultices, and tighten it.
Extremitates uero eius quae sequuntur cubitum, et continuantur cum eo, non dislocantur, nisi raro.	The extremities of the leg, which follow the hip, and continue with it, are rarely dislocated, unless by rare chance.
Quod si dislocatur die aliquo: tunc oportet, ut reducatur et aequetur secundum quod diximus, et quod praeparatur tibi.	If it is dislocated on any day: then let it be reduced and adjusted according to what we have said, and that you be prepared.
Deinde pone super ipsam emplastrum, et puluillos, et stricturam.	Then put a plaster on it, and poultices, and bind it tight.
Et praecipe infirmo, adhaerere tranquillitati et quieti, donec sanetur.	And command the sick person to adhere to peace and calmness until he is healed.
Et cum hac eadem curatione reducitur extremitas Humeri, quando separatur etiam a loco suo.	And with this same treatment the limb of the shoulder blade is reduced when it separates from its place as well.
¶ De reductione dislocationis Humeri.	On the Reduction of Dislocation of the Shoulder Blade.
Caput XXVII.	Chapter XXVII.
Scias, quod Humerus non dislocatur, nisi secundum tres modos.	You should know that the shoulder blade is not dislocated unless by three means.
Quorum unus est, ut dislocetur ad partem titillici ad inferiora.	One of which is that it dislocates to the tickling side toward the lower part.
Secundus est, ut dislocetur ad partem pectoris.	The second is that it dislocates to the side of the chest.
Et fortasse dislocatur ad superiorem partem Humeri: et illud fit raro.	And perhaps it dislocates to the upper part of the shoulder blade: and this is rare.
Et non dislocatur ad posteriora, propter spatulam.	And does not dislocate to the rear due to the spatula.
Et non dislocatur ad anteriora, propter neruos.	And does not dislocate to the front due to the nerves.
Et plurimum quidem dislocatur et egreditur ad inferiora uersus titillicum: praecipue in illis, quorum carnes sunt paucae.	Indeed, it is very often that the shoulder blade dislocates and comes out towards the lower part next to the tickling: especially in those whose flesh is scarce.
Quoniam egrediur in eis uelociter, et ingreditur uelociter.	Because it exits them quickly, and enters them quickly.
In illis autem quorum carnes sunt multae, est econtrario illius, scilicet quia egreditur cum difficultate, et ingreditur cum difficultate.	But in those whose flesh is abundant, the opposite happens to it: that is, because it exits with difficulty, and enters with difficulty.
Et fortasse accidit quibusdam hominibus percussio, aut casus, et apostematur Humerus apostemate calido, et putatur propter illud, quia iam dislocatus est.	And perhaps happens to certain people a blow or a fall, and the shoulder blade comes out with heat: and it is thought by them that this is because it has already been dislocated.
Oportet ergo, ut experiaris illud, donec stes super certitudinem eius, et tunc procedas in curatione eius.	Therefore, let it be known to you, so that you do not hesitate about this, until you are completely certain of its state, and then proceed with its treatment.
Et cognoscitur dislocatio, quando est ad inferiora uersus titillicum: et distinguas inter Humerum dislocatum, et humerum sanum.	And it is known that dislocation takes place when it turns downward in relation to the nipple: and you distinguish between a dislocated shoulder and a healthy shoulder.
Nam tu inuenis inter eos diuersitatem manifestam, et inuenis in capite Humeri concauitatem, et sub titillico apud tactum caput humeri quasi ipsum sit ouum: et non potest infirmus reducere manum ad aurem suam, neque mouere eam omnibus motibus.	For you can clearly tell the difference between them: and dislocation in the head of the humerus, and under the nipple at the touch of the head of the humerus as if it were itself: and the weak cannot bring his hand to his ear, nor move it in all its movements.
Et similiter, si dislocatur uersus pectus, aut ad sursum: tunc inuenis manifestum tactum, neque occultatur.	And likewise, if it is dislocated towards the chest or upward: then there is a distinct touch, and it is not hidden.
Et huius quidem dislocationis fit facilis reductio, quando est recens, aut infirmus est puer.	And of this dislocation, its reduction easily takes place when it is young, or the boy is weak.
Et reductio eius est, ut eleuet minister manum suam ad superiora.	And its reduction is, as he raises his hand towards the top.
Deinde pone tu pollices tuos sub titillico eius, et eleua iuncturam cum fortitudine ad sursum ad locum suum: et minister eleuet manum suam, et extendat eam ad sursum.	Then put your fingers under its nipple, and raise the joint with strength towards the top to its place: and the boy raises his hand, and extends it upward.
Deinde ponat eam inferius, ipse enim redit uelociter.	Then let him put it downward, for he himself will turn it back quickly.
Si autem non redit per illud quod diximus, et sunt a principio quo accidit dislocatio dies multi: tunc oportet, ut balneetur infirmus in aqua calida, et administretur embrocatio quae mollificat et lenit, sicut si decoquantur radices alteae, et foenugraecum, et mellilotum in aqua, et administretur.	If he does not turn back through the above-mentioned means, and there have been many days since dislocation took place: then it should be, so that the weak man bathes in warm water, and applies a remedy which softens and relaxes, such as if they were cooked roots of aloes, and fenugreek, and mallow in water, and is applied.
Deinde resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum: et ponatur sub titillico eius sphera et lana, quae sit aequalis inter lenitatem et stricturam.	Then the weak man shall lie on his back: and a sphere and wool be placed under its nipple, which is equal between relaxation and constriction.
Deinde ponat medicus calcaneum suum super spheram, et eleuet caput humeri cum uirtute, et attrahat manum infirmi ad inferiora.	Then the doctor shall place his heel on the sphere, and raise the head of the humerus with strength, and draw the nurse's hand downward.
Et minister alius teneat caput infirmi, ut non moueatur ad inferiora: ipse namque redit statim.	And another shall hold the nurse's head so that she does not move downward: for he himself will turn back at once.
Et si uis, reduc eum secundum modum hunc: et est, ut facias esse praesentem uirum qui sit longior infirmo, et stet a parte lateris, et intromittat humerum suum sub titillico infirmi: et eleuet titillicum eius ad superiora, donec sit infirmus suspensus in aere.	And if you wish, reduce him according to this method: and it is as if you are present man who is longer than the weak one, and stands by his side, and places his shoulder under the nurse's nipple: and raise her nipple upward, until the weak one hangs in mid-air.
Et minister alius trahat manum infirmi ad inferiora uentris eius.	And another assistant should hold the patient's hand at the base of his foot.
Si autem infirmus est leuis: tunc oportet, ut suspendatur cum eo aliquid aliud, ut grauet ipsum: nam redit dislocatio statim.	But if the sick person is light: then it should be that with him something else is suspended so that he does not move it: for the dislocation comes back immediately.
Et reducitur etiam secundum modum alium: et est, ut figatur in terra lignum longum, cuius caput sit rotundum figura: sicut manica mortarii: quod non sit grossum, neque subtile.	And it is also reduced in another way: and this is that it is fixed on the ground a long piece of wood whose head is round figure: like the sleeve of the mortar: which should not be thick or fine.
Deinde ponatur sub infirmo postquam ponuntur super caput ligni panni lenes: et infirmus sit stans secundum longitudinem ligni.	Then put under the sick person a cloth made of soft material after it is placed on the head of the wood: and let the sick person stand according to the length of the wood.
Deinde extendatur manus eius ad inferiora a parte altera, et extendatur corpus eius ab altera parte cum fortitudine: nam iunctura redit ad locum suum cum uelocitate.	Then the assistant extends the patient's hand at the lower part of one side, and he extends his body with strength from the other side: for the connection returns to its place with speed.
Quod si difficilis sit eius reductio per omnia quae diximus, tunc utere hac cura: et est, ut accipias lignum cuius longitudo sit quantitas duorum brachiorum, et eius latitudo quantitas quatuor digitorum, et grossitudo eius quantitas duorum digitorum: cui sit caput rotundum, ut alleuietur introitus eius in profundum titillici, secundum hanc formam.	That if it is difficult to reduce him by all that we have said, then use this care: and this is that you take a piece of wood whose length is the length of two arms, and its width is the width of four fingers, and its thickness is the width of two fingers: whose head is round, so as to relieve the entrance into the hollow, according to this form.
Deinde ligentur super caput rotundum panni lenes, ut non laedat lignum infirmum.	Then they bind on the round head a soft cloth so that it does not hurt the wood of the sick person.
Deinde ponatur sub titillico infirmi, ut extendatur manus, aut brachium super lignum usque ad inferiora: et ligetur lignum super adiutorium et brachium et extremitatem manus.	Then put under the tickling assistant so that it extends the hand or arm over the wood to the lower part: and the wood is tied over the assistant's hand and arm and the end of the finger.
Deinde ponatur brachium super gradum scalae per latitudinem, et extendatur manus ad inferiora, et dimittatur reliquum corpus suspensum a parte altera.	Then put the arm over the step by its width, and extend the hand at the lower part, and let the rest of the body be suspended from one side.
Iunctura enim ingreditur statim.	For the connection enters immediately.
Cum ergo completur introitus eius secundum quemcunque modum possibile est: tunc oportet, ut ponas sub titillico spheram aequalis quantitatis ex lana.	Since then it is finished entering in whatever way possible: then you should put under the tickling sphere of equal quantity of wool.
Deinde pone emplastrum praeparatum ex puluere molendini cum olibano, et albumine oui super humerum totum, sicut reuoluitur desuper.	Then place the preparated plaster made of powdered rose with olive oil and white resin on the whole shoulder, as it comes down from above.
Deinde stringe sub titillico strictura decenti: et reuoluatur ligamentum super emplastrum desuper: et annectatur manus eius ad collum ipsius, et dimittatur, neque moueatur manus eius septem diebus.	Then tighten the bandage under the pressure of the swelling: and return the ligament over the splint above: and join his hand to his neck, and let it be, and do not move his hand for seven days.
Et oportet, ut ponatur cibus infirmipaucus, donec confortetur membrum: quoniam est uelocius ad sanationem eius.	And it is necessary that he take a little food for the sickly, until his member is healed: for it is quicker to heal him in this way.
Deinde ponatur amplior post septem dies, aut quinque, et ex ercitetur cum motu.	Then it should be placed more widely after seven or five days, and he should be tested with movement.
Si ergo firmatur et non mollificatur, tunc iam sanatus est.	If then it remains stable and does not weaken, then he is now healed.
Si uero iunctura dislocatur multotiens, propter humiditatem quae accidit ei, aut propter caussam aliam: tunc oportet, ut administretur in ea cauterium cum tribus foraminibus, secundum quod praemissum est in capitulo de cauterio.	If on the other hand the joint dislocates many times, because of the moisture that occurs with it, or because of some other cause: then it is necessary, in order to administer cauterization with six pores, as was said in the chapter about cauterization.
Quod si fiat hoc totum, et soluatur ligamentum post septem dies, et non confirmetur iunctura, et reducatur emplastrum et strictura super ipsum aliquotiens, et non firmetur, et cadat, et non possit eleuare ipsum ad superiora: tunc scias, quod nerui eius qui sunt ad caput humeri, iam incisi sunt, aut extensi, aut mollificati: et scias, quod iunctura nunquam figetur in loco suo.	What if all of this is done, and the ligament is allowed to heal over seven days, and the joint does not remain dislocated, and the splint and constriction over it are sometimes loosened, and does not firm up, and falls away, and he cannot raise it up again to his shoulder: then you should know that the nerves which are to the shoulder have already been cut, or extended, or weakened: and you should know that the joint will never be set in its place.
Dislocationis autem quae fit uersus pectus et mammillam, aut ad posteriora reductio, fit cum impulsione et extensione cum manibus: donec redeat, et administretur in ea reliqua strictura et cura, donec sanetur.	But if the dislocation is towards the chest and nipple, or towards the rear, it is done by an impact and extension with the hands: until it stops, and a remaining constriction and care is administered to it, until it heals.
Quod si accidat post sanationem grauitas in membro, et tarditas in motu eius, tunc utatur infirmus balneo multotiens, donec leniatur illa grauitas, et redeat ad naturam eius primam.	What if after healing a little weight comes on the member, and there is a delay in its movement: then the sick person should take frequent baths, until this weight is softened, and return to its natural state first.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Cubiti.	The Treatment of Dislocation of the Elbow.
Caput XXVIII.	Chapters 39-40: On the Treatment
Scias, quod iunctura Cubiti dislocatur cum difficultate, et similiter redit cum difficultate etiam: et ipsa quidem dislocatur ad omnes partes, et praecipue ad anteriorem, aut ad posteriorem.	You should know that the elbow joint dislocates with difficulty, and also heals with difficulty: it actually dislocates in all directions, and especially to the front, or to the back.
Et eius dislocatio non occultatur tibi: quoniam est cadens sub uisu, et sub tactu, secundum quamcunque figuram dislocetur.	And his dislocation is not hidden from you: because it falls by sight and by touch, whatever form it takes.
Et quando coniungis cubitum dislocatum cum sano, declaratur tibi illud manifeste.	And when you join the dislocated hip with the sound one, that will be evident to you.
Concauatur enim iunctura, et non potest duplicare brachium, neque tangere cum eo humerum suum.	For the joint will ache, and it cannot duplicate the arm, nor can it touch its shoulder with it.
Et oportet, ut properes, et reducas dislocationem statim, antequam accidat ei apostema calidum.	And you must hurry to reduce the dislocation as soon as possible before the injury swells.
Nam si accidit ei apostema calidum, difficilis fit eius reductio: et fortasse non sanatur omnino, praecipue quando est ad posteriora.	For if the injury swells, it is difficult to reduce it; and perhaps it will not heal at all, especially when it is behind.
Est enim deterior omnibus speciebus dislocationis, et uehementioris doloris eis: et multotiens descendit cum ea mors.	For every form of dislocation is worse, and the pain from it is more severe; and often death comes with it.
Et restauratio eius quando est ex eis quae possibile est reducere, est, ut extendatur manus eius cum duabus manibus: et brachium eius sit expansum, et manus medici sint supra cubitum et sub eo, et ipse impellat iuncturam cum pollicibus manuum suarum simul, aut cum radice palmae suae, donec redeat ad locum suum.	And the restoration of it when it has been reduced as much as possible is, that he extend his hand with two hands; and his arm be stretched out, and his fingers on either side of the hip, or on its root, pushing at the dislocation with the thumbs of his hands until he returns to his place.
Aut uero dislocatio est ad anteriora: tunc redit ita, ut duplicet manum cum manu sua, donec percutiat cum radice palmae suae cubitum qui est dislocatus.	Or perhaps the dislocation is forward: then he returns in such a way that he duplicates his hand with his own, striking at the hip which has been dislocated with the root of his palm until it hurts.
Quod si non obedit dislocatio ad reductionem, tunc administra extensionem uehementem, fortem ualde: et est, ut extendant brachium duo ministri: et teneant ipsum duo ministri etiam, ut non remoueatur apud extensionem.	Which if it does not obey the reduction, then administer a fierce, sharp extension; and it is as if two ministers extended his arm: and let them hold him too, so that he does not move during the extension.
Deinde reuoluatur brachium ad omnem partem postquam inuoluitur super manum eius pannus duplicatus longus, aut ligamentum latum.	And then his arm turns around to all parts after it has been wrapped over its hand with a long cloth, or with a broad strap.
Et quando tangit medicus manu sua iuncturam, inungat ipsam cum oleo: ut sit illud ex eis quae adiuuant in lubricitate iuncturae cum facilitate.	And when the doctor touches the dislocation with his own hand, he should wet it with oil so that it is from those things that help to lubricate the joint with ease.
Deinde impellat iuncturam impulsione uehementi, donec redeat.	Then push the dislocation with a sharp thrust until it returns.
Et post reductionem eius oportet, ut ponatur super ipsam emplastrum, in quo sit stipticitas, et exiccatio cum albugine oui: et stringatur strictura decenti.	And after its reduction, it should be placed on it a plaster that has the staphyloma and drying with alum, and it should be tightened by a thightening as it goes down.
Et suspendatur brachium a collo infirmi: et dimitte diebus aliquot.	And hang the arm from the neck of the nurse; and let it go for a few days.
Deinde soluatur.	Then let it be unbound.
Si ergo firmatur iunctura in loco suo, tunc solue ligamentum ab ea, et dimitte ipsam.	But if the joint is secure in its place, then untie the ligament from it, and let it go.
Et si uides iuncturam non bene stringi, tunc itera emplastrum, et ligamentum, et dimitte ipsam diebus aliquot, donec stringatur.	And if you see that the joint is not well tied, then put on more plaster and the ligament, and let it go for a few days until it is tied.
Deinde solue ipsam.	Then let it be unbound.
Si autem accidit ei grauitas post reductionem iuncturae, et dispositio sit in motu: tunc administra humectationem in balneatione, et fricationem subtilem, et compressionem, donec liniatur, aut pone super iuncturam iliati, id est, natem arietis pinguem.	But if it comes to pass that he has lost his weight after the reduction of the joint, and the position is in motion: then administer humidity in the bath, and subtle friction, and compression, until it is healed, or put iliac on the joint, that is, nates arietis pinguem.
Deinde ligetur, et dimitte ipsam super eam die et nocte.	Then tie it up, and let it go on top of it for a day and night.
Deinde aufer eam, et intromitte ipsum in balneum.	Then remove it, and let him enter the bath.
Cum ergo sudat, tunc frica iuncturam fricatione temperata.	But when he sweats, then apply friction to the joint with a moderate friction.
Deinde itera super ipsam aleliati uice una, et secunda, et tertia cum introitu balnei, donec leniatur.	Then put on top of it oil a single time, and a second time, and a third time with the entrance into the bath, until it is relaxed.
Et si uis, pone super ipsam stercus uaccinum, humidum, calefactum cum butyro, et stringe super ipsum.	And if there is a wound, put on top of it cow dung, moist, heated with butter, and tie over it.
Fac illud aliquotiens.	Perform this several times.
Ipsa namque lenitur, et redit ad dispositionem suam.	The joint is healed, and returns to its position.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Almahassem.	This is the treatment of dislocation by Albucasis.
Caput XXIX.	Chapter 29.
Mahassem manus multotiens dislocatur, id est, iunctura quae est inter brachium et manum.	Mahassem sometimes dislocates, that is, the joint between the arm and the hand.
Et reductio dislocationis eius est facilis.	And the reduction of his dislocation is easy.
Econtrario reliquarum iuncturarum.	On the contrary, the joints remain in their places.
Verumtamen oportet, ut uelocitas sit in reductione dislocationis eius in hora in qua dislocatur, antequam apostemetur locus: aut accidat in eo apostema calidum.	However, it should be that the speed is in the reduction of his dislocation in the hour in which it dislocates, before it has been measured: or happens in it a hot apoplexy.
Et reductio dislocationis in eo est, ut ponas Mahassem manus infirmae super tabulam, et extendat minister manum eius: et ponat medicus palmam suam super eminentiam iuncturae, et impellat eam, donec redeat.	And the reduction of dislocation is in it, so that you put Mahassem's hand weak on a table, and extends his servant hand: and the doctor puts his palm on the eminence of the joint, and pushes it, until he has set it back.
Verumtamen oportet, ut consyderetur, si palma iam recessit ad uentrem manus: tunc ponat infirmus dorsum manus suae super tabulam apud extensionem et reductionem: et si dislocatio est procedens ad dorsum manus, tunc sit positio manus eius intrinsece super tabulam, id est, interior pars manus eius super tabulam ponatur, ut cadat manus medici super ipsam eminentiam iuncturae.	Indeed, it should be considered that if the palm has already receded to the abdomen of the hand: then the sick person should put his back of the hand on a table at the extension and reduction: and if the dislocation is proceeding towards the back of the hand, then the position of the hand should be placed intrusively over the table, that is, the interior part of the hand over the table should be placed so that the doctor's hand falls upon it with emphasis on the tendon.
Si ergo redit statim, bonum est: et si non, tunc stringe eam cum emplastro sedante apostema: et dimitte ipsum, neque iteres illud.	If it then returns immediately, it is good: and if not, then bind it with a plaster while the swelling subsides: and let him go, and do not return to it.
Nam si non tolerat, neque potes super reductionem eius, postquam praetereunt ei dies, uerumtamen iunctura remanet secundum tortuositatem suam: et non nocet infirmo aliquid, nisi quod mollificatur manus, et non potest stringere aliquid: tunc scias, quod nerui sunt abscissi, aut attriti.	For if he does not bear it, and you cannot bring it to reduction after a few days, then the tendon remains according to its curvature: and it does not hurt the sick person unless his hand becomes soft, and he cannot grasp anything: then you should know that the nerves have been cut or worn away.
Non est ergo ingenium in ea, nisi ut stringatur cum cauterio prope casum eius.	Therefore, there is no skill in it except to bind it with a wound close to its danger.
Et fortasse non confert illud aliquid.	And perhaps it does not give anything.
Cum ergo non redit Almahassem, tunc pone super ipsum emplastrum, quod narrauimus.	But when Albucasis does not return, then put on him a plaster which we have described.
Deinde stringatur, et dimittatur quinque diebus: postea soluatur et dimittatur, et exercitetur manus.	Then let it be bound and let it be left for five days: then let it be loosed and let it be exercised.
Si autem priuatur motus eius, et accidat in ea aliquid grauitatis: tunc leni eam cum aqua calefacta, et fricatione aliquotiens, donec leniatur.	But if its movement is restricted, and something heavy happens to it: then soften it with warm water and occasional friction, until it becomes soft.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Digitorum.	On the treatment of dislocation of the fingers.
Caput XXX.	Chapter XXX.
Quando dislocatur ex eis Digitus ad omnem partem, uel ex eis Digitus ad dorsum palmae, aut uentrem eius: tunc extende Digitum, et impelle dislocationem pollicibus tuis, donec redeat.	When one of the fingers is dislocated completely, or one of them towards the back of the palm, or towards its heel: then extend that finger, and push the dislocation with your thumb until it returns.
Deinde sustenta caput Digiti, et suspende ipsum uersus partem ad quam dislocatur, et dimitte ipsum duobus diebus.	Then support the head of the finger and hang it towards the side to which it is dislocated, and let him go for two days.
Deinde suspende eum, et extende ipsum, donec aequetur rectus in illo die suo.	Then hang him up and extend him, until he is even with his back on that day.
Cum ergo fuerit nox, liga ipsum secundum narrationem ipsam: et non cesses soluere ipsum in die: et exerce eum cum motu: et liga ipsum in nocte.	When then the night having come, bind him according to his story: and do not cease to loosen him on that day: and exercise him with movement: and bind him in the night.
Fac illud diebus aliquot, donec stringatur.	Make it for those days, until he is bound.
Et similiter fac cum eo, si dislocatur ad uentrem manus: et liga eum ad partem ipsam, et fac cum eo operationem tuam primam, donec sanetur.	And also do the same with him, if his hand goes out of place: and bind him to that side, and do your first work with him, until he is healed.
Et similiter fac cum eo quando dislocatur ad reliquas partes.	And also do the same with him when his dislocated to other parts.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Spondilium dorsi.	On the treatment of dislocations of the spine.
Caput XXXI.	Chapter 31.
Quando accidit alicui Spondilium dorsi, aut colli dislocatio completa, aut remouentur Spondiles multae a locis suis: tunc non est in ea curatio, quoniam mors properat infirmo.	When it happens to anyone that the spine is dislocated, or when many of the joints are separated from their places: then there is no cure for it, because death approaches the sick.
Et signum illius est, quod egestio infirmi egreditur absque uoluntate, neque potest tenere eam: et multotiens mollificantur ex eo quaedam membra eius, aut duo crura eius, aut duo brachia ipsius, aut unum eorum: aut remouetur Spondilis una de loco suo.	And the sign of it is that he who is sickly leaves his bed without choice, and cannot hold it: and often weakens some member of him, or two legs of his, or two arms of his, or one of them; or when one of his spine joints is separated from its place.
Multotiens enim remouetur, quod multotiens fit remotio earum ad quatuor partes.	For it often happens that they are separated again, since they are separated on the four sides.
Illa ergo quae remouetur ad posteriora, nominatur Gibbositas.	So then who is dislocated backward is called a hunchback.
Curatio uero eius est, ut consyderes tunc, si Gibbositas accidit a puericia: tunc non est in ea curatio, neque ex ea est sanatio omnino.	The cure for it however is that you consider then if the hunchback happens from infancy: then there is no cure for it, nor is there at all healing from it.
In illa autem quae accidit a casu, aut percussione, aut similibus illis, iam dixerunt antiqui modos curationis sermone prolixo.	But in that which happens by fall, or by punch, or similar to those, the ancients have already said long words of ways of cure.
Cuius plurimum non redit cum proficuo.	Whose most does not return with profit.
Ego uero iam abbreuiaui ex illo, cuius parum excusat a multo eius ex propinquitate mea ad intentionem: et expositione mea qua exposui illud, et formaui instrumentum eius diuerso modo ab eo quo ostenderunt illud, et exposuerunt ipsum.	I however have shortened that out of it, whose little excuse from a great distance from my nearness to intention: and my exposure which I exposed that, and I shaped an instrument from him in different ways from him so as to show that, and they showed him.
Dico ergo, quod in gibbositate quae accidit ab anteriori parte, non est ingenium, neque sanatio ex ea.	I therefore say that in the deformity which occurs from the anterior part, there is no art and no cure from it.
Et similiter in illa quae fit ad duo latera etiam.	And likewise in that which happens on both sides as well.
Et non curatur ex eis, nisi illa quae accidit in dorso proprie, cum eo quod ego narro: et est, ut extendatur infirmus super faciem suam super podium aequale prope parietem: et expandatur sub eo stramentum humidum, ut non laedatur pectus eius.	And let it not be cured from them unless that which happens in the back of its own, with what I am telling you: and it is as if a sick person extended on his face on an equal platform near the wall: and spread out under him a wet cloth, so that it does not hurt his chest.
Deinde ponatur lignum rectum fixum in fouea in terra, in extremitate podii, circiter caput eius: et lignum aliud circiter pedes eius in extremitate altera podii: et minister teneat lignum, et sit non firmatum in fouea.	Then let a straight wooden beam be fixed in the ground, at the end of the foot, around the head of it: and another wooden beam around his feet at the other end of the foot: and let the servant hold fast to the beam, and not be firmly planted in the ground.
Et minister alter teneat alterum.	And let another servant hold fast the other one.
Deinde inuolue super caput infirmi, et sub titillicis eius ligamentum lene, firmum: et extende extremitatem ligamenti ad lignum quod est apud caput eius: et liga ipsum in eo.	Then let the nurse turn round on top of his head and under his chin with a soft band, firm: and spread out the end of the ligament to the wood which is at his head: and bind himself there.
Deinde stringe ligamentum aliud supra anchas eius, et supra genua ipsius, et apud cauillas eius.	Then let another ligament be tied above his shoulders and above his knees and near his ankles.
Deinde aggrega ligamenta omnia, et liga ea in ligno altero quod est apud pedes eius.	Then let all the ligaments be gathered together and bound to the other beam which is at his feet.
Deinde extendat omnis minister ad partem ligni ligamentum, et non remoueantur duo ligna ex locis suis in quibus sunt fixa: uerumtamen non sint firmata, sicut diximus.	Then let all the servants extend to the side of the beam and not remove the two beams from their places where they are fixed: however, they should not be firmly planted, as I said.
Et medicus ponat palmas suas super Spondilem cum fortitudine, donec redeat: aut ponat super eam tabulam.	Then let the doctor place his palms on the spine with strength until he recoups: or let him place it on the board.
Deinde annectat super tabulam pedes suos, donec redeat.	Then let him join his feet to the board until he recoups.
Si autem non redit per hanc curationem, tunc accipe tabulam cuius longitudo sit circiter tria brachia.	If however he does not recover by this cure, then take a board whose length is about three arm-lengths.
Et caua in pariete de quo diximus quod est prope infirmum, locum in quem ingrediatur extremitas tabulae.	And make a hole in the wall from which I spoke, which is near the sick person, a place to which the end of the board enters.
Deinde pone medium tabulae super Spondilem.	Then let half of the board be placed on the spine.
Et ponat pedes suos medicus super extremitatem alteram.	Let the physician set his feet upon the other end.
Et stringat bene, donec coartetur Spondilis, et redeat ad locum suum.	And tie it well, until the backboard is fitted, and return to your own place.
Deinde si uis, operare cum torno quod inuoluitur cum manu tua: et est, ut figas in terram apud caput infirmi in postremo podii duo ligna, quorum longitudo sit brachii unius: et apud caput eius in postremo podii duo ligna.	Then if you wish, operate with the turner that is held in your hand: and it is so, to put two pieces of wood on the ground near the head of the bed, whose length are the length of one arm; and near the head of those two pieces of wood.
Et sit longitudo quae est inter omne lignum palmus unus: et iam factum est in omni loco foramen, in quo currit tornum: et firmetur lignum omne in terra multum, ne moueatur omnino.	And the length that is between all the wood be one palm: and there has already been made a hole, in which the turner runs; and all the wood is made firm on the ground so that it does not move at all.
Et intromittatur lignum rotundum: et est tornum in quo reuoluitur ligamentum in duobus foraminibus duorum lignorum.	And a round piece of wood be introduced; and there is a turner in which the ligament turns in two holes of the two pieces of wood.
Et in extremitate eius est foramen, in quo firmatur lignum, cuius longitudo est palmus cum eo quod reuoluitur: et in duobus lignis aliis est similiter illius.	And at its end there is a hole, in which the wood is fixed, whose length is one palm with that in which it turns; and it is the same in the other two pieces of wood.
Deinde stringe ligamenta quae strinxisti in pectore infirmi torno quod est apud caput eius: et ligamenta quae strinxisti in cruribus eius in torno quod est apud pedes eius.	Then tighten the ligaments that you have tied inside the chest of the turner that is by its head: and the ligaments that you have tied in his legs in the turner that is at his feet.
Deinde stet apud omne tornum minister, qui torqueat manum suam cum licinio, cum quo reuoluitur tornum: et medicus aequet Spondilem, secundum quod diximus.	Then stand by all the turner, who twists his hand with a lever, with which it turns; and the physician adjusts the backboard, according to what we have said.
Haec est forma torni, quae sequitur.	This is the form of the turner, which follows.
Deinde postquam redit Spondilis, et aequatur locus, tunc oportet, ut ponas emplastrum exiccatiuum cum albumine oui.	Then, when the backboard has returned and the place is made equal, then you should put dried blood mixed with albumen on the wounds.
Deinde stuppam.	Then the stain.
Postea pone supra emplastrum astellam ex tabula, cuius latitudo sit trium digitorum, aut circiter eos.	Then place above the blood a board from a table, whose width is three fingers wide, or about that.
Et longitudo eius quantitas quae capiat locum Gibbositatis, et super partem Spondilis sanae.	And its length to take up the space of the support, and on the healthy side of the backboard.
Deinde ligetur cum ligamento quod diximus.	Then it is tied with a ligament that we have said.
Et utatur infirmus nutrimento subtili, donec sanetur.	Let the sick one be fed with subtle food until he is healed.
Quod si remaneat quiddam eminentiae in loco in fine sanationis: tunc oportet, ut administrentur medicinae quae mollificant, et leniunt, cum administratione tabulae quam narrauimus tempore longo.	If anything remains of a disease in the place at the end of healing: then it is necessary that which softens and makes mild be administered, with the tablet that we mentioned for a long time.
Et iam administratur in illo lamina plumbi.	And now it is administered in that tin-plate.
Et quandoque accidit eminentia in postremo Spondilium dorsi: et putatur per eam dislocatio, et est illud os quod iam eminet.	And when there is a disease at the very end of the spine: and it is thought through that dislocation, and it is this jaw that has already begun to emerge.
Quare non oportet, ut praesumptio fiat ei cum hac medicina: fortasse enim accidere faciet mortem.	Why should not the presumption be made with this medicine: for perhaps such will happen that it may cause death.
¶ De curatione Anchae dislocatae.	On the cure of an ankle dislocation.
Caput XXXII.	Chapter 32.
Scias, quod iuncturae Anchae, et iuncturae humeri, non accidit, nisi dislocatio tantum: neque accidit eis quod accidit reliquis iuncturis ex remotione parua, et concauitate.	You should know that the ankle joint, and the shoulder joint, do not occur unless there is a dislocation only: and they do not occur to them what happens to the other joints because of a small distance, and urgency.
Et iunctura quidem Anchae dislocatur secundum quatuor partes.	And the ankle joint dislocates according to four parts.
Quod est, quia dislocatur ad anteriora, et ad posteriora.	Because it dislocates to the front and to the back.
Et plurimum quidem dislocatur ad interiora: et parum dislocatur ad anteriora, et ad posteriora.	And many times it dislocates inwardly: and little to the front, and to the back.
Et curatio dislocationis eius ad interiora, est: quia quando tu coniungis crus infirmi sanum cum infirmo, est longius: et est genu eius eminens plus quam sani, et non potest infirmus duplicare pedem suum apud inguen: et est locus qui sequitur inguen apostematus apostemate calido, propterea, quod caput coxae iam peruenit illic.	And the cure of its dislocation inwardly is: because when you join the thigh of the sick with a healthy one, it is longer: and it is the genuflexion of him prominent than healthy, and cannot the sick double his leg by himself: and there is a place that follows the coxa separated apart, for this reason, that the head of the thigh has already reached there.
Et signum eius cui accidit dislocatio ad exteriora est, quod sunt accidentia eius contraria istis accidentibus.	And the sign of him who has a dislocation to the outside is, that are opposite accidents to these accidents.
Et signum eius cui accidit dislocatio ad anteriora, est, quia expandit crus sanum secundum complementum: uerumtamen non duplicat ipsum absque dolore qui est in genu: et si conatur ad ambulandum, non potest super illud ad anteriora: et retinetur urina eius, et apostematur inguen eius, et apud ambulationem est calcatio eius super calcaneum.	And the sign of him who has a dislocation to the front is, that he expands the healthy thigh according to the complement: however, it does not double itself without pain which is in the knee: and if it tries to walk, it cannot pass over that to the front: and it retains his urine, and is separated from the groin of him, and there is a trodden upon his heel when he walks.
Et signum eius cui accidit dislocatio ad posteriora est, ut non expandat genu, neque possit duplicare ipsum antequam duplicet inguen: et est crus eius etiam breuius altero: et inguen est mollificatum, et est caput coxae apud locum ilii.	The sign of dislocation to the back is that the knee does not bend before doubling the leg and also because the thigh becomes shorter on the other side; and the kneecap is at the place of the hip joint.
Reductio uero huius dislocationis specierum est, ut consyderes tunc, si dislocatio est uetusta, quae iam antiquatur cum habente ipsam.	The reduction of this dislocation is that you consider then, if the dislocation is old, which now has healed with the one who had it.
Deinde si tu administres reductionem eius, et remanet secundum dispositionem suam: tunc non est in ea curatio omnino.	Then, if you administer the reduction of it, and it remains according to its position: then it is not at all in this treatment.
Non ergo oportet, ut praesumptio fiat ei penitus.	Therefore, it should not be presumed that he has a complete cure.
In illo autem cuius dislocatio est recens, et est ex una specierum quatuor dislocationis: tunc propera ad hoc, ut uoluas iuncturam, et extendas ipsam ad interiora et ad exteriora, et moueas eam dextra et sinistra: fortasse enim redit, et non indiget alia cura.	But in that one whose dislocation is recent, and is of the four types of dislocations: then approach to this, that you rotate it, and extend it towards the inside and outside, and move it with the right and left hand: perhaps it will return, and does not need another treatment.
Si autem non redit hoc modo, tunc oportet, ut praepares ministrum fortem, et extendat crus eius ab inferiori parte: aut cum manibus suis, aut cum ligamento, quod ligetur super crus eius supra genu: et minister alius extendat manum eius desuper, ita ut intromittat manus suas sub titillicis eius.	But if it does not return in this way, then you have to prepare strong medicine, and extend the thigh from its lower part: or with his hands, or with a ligament that is tied above the thigh over the knee: and another servant extend his hand on the inside of his thigh so that he inserts his fingers under the skin of his thigh.
Deinde stringat cum ligamento leni super radicem coxae, et teneat extremitatem ligamenti alterius.	Then tie it with a soft ligament over the root of the hip, and hold the end of one of the ligaments.
Et sit extensio eius aut ab anteriori parte inguinis ad partem furculae, aut a posteriori ad partem dorsi.	And let him sit in an extended position or from the front part of the groin to the thigh, or from the back to the spine.
Et sit extensio eorum omnium uice una, donec eleuetur infirmus cum corpore suo a terra, et remaneat pendens.	And let all these extended positions be made in one way, until he stands up with his body from the ground, and remains hanging.
Et haec enim species extensionis est species communis specierum quatuor.	This type of extension is a common type among the four types of dislocations.
Si ergo redit dislocatio cum eo quod diximus, est bonum: et si non, tunc necesse est omni speciei illud quod dicam de curatione propria.	If this dislocation returns with what I have said, it is good, and if not, then it is necessary to say about each type that I speak of as its own cure.
In reductione quidem eius propria quando dislocatio est ad interiora, oportet, ut resupinetur infirmus super latus suum sanum.	In the reduction of this dislocation, when the dislocation is towards the inside, it should be, that the sick person lies on his healthy side.
Deinde ponat ligamentum super radicem coxae, in eo quod est inter caput coxae, et locum qui est sub inguine.	Then put the ligament on top of the root of the thigh, in that which is between the head of the thigh, and the place which is under the groin.
Deinde extende ligamentum ad sursum a parte inguinis ad altiorem partem corporis, ad partem furculae.	Then extend the ligament to the top from the part of the groin to the higher part of the body, to the part of the thigh.
Deinde accipiat minister alius fortis brachia eius, et minuat locum grossum coxae infirmae, et extendat ad exteriora extensione uehementi.	Then another strong minister should take his arm, and make small the place of the weak thigh, and extend it to the external extension in a mighty way.
Iam enim redit ad locum suum.	For he has already returned to his place.
Et haec species est facilioris reliquis speciebus curationis, qua reducitur hoc membrum.	And this type is easier than the other types of cure, because this limb is reduced in this way.
Si autem excusatur super te, et non obedit tibi ad introitum cum hac specie curationis omnino: tunc oportet, ut ligentur duo pedes infirmi simul cum ligamento forti, leni, super duos calcaneos, et super duo genua: et sit longitudo cuiusque a compare suo quantitatis quatuor digitorum: et sit crus infirmum extensum plus altero quantitate duorum digitorum.	But if he does not obey you at all with this type of cure: then it should be, that two nurses bind him together with a strong ligament, soft, over the two heels, and over the two knees: and let the length of each from its own place be the same as four fingers: and let the leg be extended by the other quantity of two fingers.
Deinde suspendatur infirmus super caput ligni, quod sit in domo: et sit longitudo eius a terra quantitas duorum brachiorum.	Then the sick person should be hung on top of the ligament, which is in the house: and let his length from the ground be the same as two arms.
Deinde praecipe iuueni forti, ut muniat caput coxae: et suspendatur cum infirmo inuenis alius: et impellat iuuenis alius, muniens coxam cum fortitudine, nam iunctura redit ad locum suum cum uelocitate.	Then command a strong man to support the head of the thigh: and another should hang with the sick person: and another should push with strength, because the joint returns to its place with velocity.
In reditione autem eius propria, quando est dislocatio ad exteriora, oportet, ut iaceat infirmus super podium, secundum quod narrauimus in habente gibbositatem.	In return, however, when it is dislocation to the outside, it should be, that he lies on his back, according to which we have said, having a gibbosity.
Et stringatur ligamentum super crus eius, infirmum proprie, et super pectus eius.	And let the ligament be stretched over his thigh, his own, and over his chest.
Deinde ponantur duo ligna, unum apud pedes eius, et alterum apud caput ipsius.	Then two woods should be put, one at his feet, and another at his head.
Deinde ponatur lignum additum in medio podii, fixum bene: super quod inuoluti sint panni humidi, ut non laedat infirmum: et sit lignum inter coxas eius, ut non attrahatur ad inferiora apud extensionem.	Then a wood should be put in the middle of the foot, firmly fixed: and let there be placed on it moist cloths, so that it does not hurt the sick person: and let the wood be between his thighs, so that it is not drawn toward the lower side at the extension.
Deinde extendat omnis minister ad partem suam, et medicus aequet reductionem manu sua.	Then all the attendants shall go to their respective places, and the doctor shall give the patient a thorough examination with his own hand.
Si ergo obedit ad reuersionem, erit bonum.	If he complies with the request for reversion, it will be good.
Et si non, pone super ipsam tabulam, et preme ipsam, sicut diximus in gibbositate, aequaliter.	And if not, place a table above it, and press it equally, as we have said in the case of deformity,
Verumtamen oportet, ut iaceat infirmus super latus suum sanum.	However, he should lie on his sound side.
Et quando dislocatio est ad anteriora, tunc oportet, ut extendatur crus infirmi uelociter: et est secundum hanc eandem narrationem super podium: et ponat medicus palmam manus suae dextrae super inguen infirmum.	And when the dislocation is to the front, then it should be extended quickly with the help of an attendant: and this is according to what we have said about the stand: and the doctor shall place his right hand on the hip of the patient.
Deinde coartet ipsum cum manu altera, et cum illa coartatione pone ipsum extensum ad inferiora ad partem genu.	Then he shall be pulled by the left hand, and with that pulling he shall be made to extend to the lower side of the leg.
Et si dislocatio est ad posteriora: tunc non oportet, ut extendatur infirmus ad inferiora, et sit eleuatus super terram: imo oportet, ut sit positus super rem duram, sicut oportet, ut fit etiam si dislocatur ancha eius ad exteriora, secundum illud quod diximus de accubitu eius super duas anchas: et est super faciem eius, et ligamenta extensa: secundum quod diximus nuper.	And if the dislocation is to the back: then it should not be extended to the lower side, and he should sit on the ground; but it should be placed on a hard surface, as we have said, and this is also what we said about his lying on two backs: and this is on his face, and the extending ligaments: according to what we have just mentioned.
Et oportet, ut administretur compressio cum tabula etiam super locum ad quem egreditur iunctura, cum completur reductio secundum quod oportet.	And it is necessary that compression with the table be applied also to the place from which the suture has been taken, when the reduction has been completed in accordance with what is required.
Et signum reditionis eius non occultatur tibi: et est, ut extendas duo crura infirmi: et quando uides ea aequalia, et infirmus stringit crus suum, et expandit ipsum absque excusatione: tunc scias, quia iam redit membrum, secundum quod oportet: tunc coniunge duas coxas, et pone emplastrum, et stringe cum imemati, id est, rota: ita, ut non moueatur ancha ad aliquam partium: et adhaereat infirmus quieti tribus diebus, aut quatuor.	And the sign of his return should not be hidden from you: and this is when you extend the two legs of the attendants: and when you see them equal, and the patient tightens his leg, and opens it without excuse: then you shall know that his limb has returned, according to what is required; then join the two hips, and put a splint, and bind with bandages, that is, with rope: so that it does not move from one part to another: and let him remain quiet for three days, or four.
Deinde solue ligamentum, et emplastrum, et compara crus cum altero: tunc si uides ea aequalia in statu, tunc scias, quod dislocatio iam firmata est: absolue ergo infirmum ad ambulandum.	Then solve the ligaments, and the splint, and bring the legs together: and when you see them equal in position, then you shall know that the dislocation has been固固的。
Et si uides aliquid mollificationis: tunc redi, et emplastra illud, et stringe illud secundum stricturam tuam primam: et dimitte illud etiam tribus diebus.	If you see anything that softens: then return and cover it with a plaster and tighten it according to your first measure: and also let it go for three days.
Deinde solue illud et fac ipsum tardare in ambulatione super utrumque aliquot diebus, donec confortetur bene.	Then dissolve that and make the person walk a little on both sides for several days, until he is well.
¶ De dislocationis Genu.	14. Of the dislocation of the knee-joint.
Caput XXXIII.	THE TENTH CHAPTER On the treatment of dislocations.
Genu dislocatur secundum tres modos.	(3) The knee may be dislocated  (3) in three ways:
Dislocatur ad exteriora, ad interiora, et ad inferiora, scilicet ad posteriora.	(i.e.  (1) to the outside, (2) to the inside, and (3) to the bottom, i.e., to the back.
Et non dislocatur ad anteriora.	(And it is not dislocated (4) to the front.)
Et signum dislocationis eius, est, ut praecipias infirmo, ut applicet crus suum ad coxam suam.	And the sign of its dislocation is (that he applies his knee to his hip).
Si autem non adhaeret cum coxa: tunc scias, quod Genu est dislocatum.	(But if it does not attach with the hip), then you shall know that the knee has been dislocated.
Et restauratio omnium modorum dislocationis eius est, ut facias sedere infirmum rectum, ita ut iam extendat crus suum si potest super illud, et adhaeret dorsum tuum ad faciem eius: et pone pedem eius inter pedes tuos.	(And the restoration of all kinds of dislocations is this: to make the sick sit upright, so that he may stretch out his leg over it and attach his back to his face; and place his foot between your feet.)
Deinde adhaerere fac Genu eius cum palmis tuis, et recta eas inter digitos tuos super Genu eius.	Then fasten the knee of the person with the palms of your hands, and keep them straight between your fingers above his knee.
Deinde applica cum palma tua duo latera Genu eius cum fortitudine.	Then apply with both palms of your hands to the sides of his knee with determination.
Et minister alius extendat pedem eius, donec redeat Genu ad locum suum.	(And another person extends his leg), until he brings back the knee to its place.
Et signum reditionis est, ut adhaereat crus cum coxa in lenitate, non laboriose.	(The sign of restoration is) when the leg attaches to the hip with ease, not with effort.
Deinde emplastra ipsum, et adhaerere fac crus cum coxa.	Then cover him with a plaster, and make the leg attach to the hip.
Deinde liga ea simul cum uitta tribus diebus, aut quatuor.	Then bind them together at the same time (for three or four days).
Deinde solue ea.	Then dissolve them.
Et non utatur infirmus ambulatione aliquot diebus, donec sanetur.	(And do not let the sick person walk a little for several days), until he is healed.
Si autem recusatur tibi reductio eius, tunc administra extensionem fortem cum ligamentis, quorum praecessit narratio in curatione anchae, donec redeat.	(But if you do not restore its reduction to you), then administer a strong extension with the ligaments, of which there is a report in the healing of ancient ankylosis, until he is restored.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Calcanei.	On the treatment of dislocations of the calcaneum.
Caput XXXIIII.	Chapter 34.
Calcaneus quandoque remouetur remotione parua, et quandoque dislocatur secundum complementum.	When the calcaneum is sometimes moved by a slight movement, and when it is sometimes dislocated from the second complement.
Et dislocatio eius fit, aut ad interiora, aut ad exteriora.	And this dislocation of its takes place, either towards the insides, or towards the outsides.
Et signum dislocationis eius est, quod uides Calcaneum inflatum, procedentem ad partem ad quam dislocatur.	And the sign of this dislocation is that you see the calcaneum swollen, protruding towards the side to which it is dislocated.
Curatio autem remotionis eius, est facilis reditionis: et est, ut extendatur cum facilitate cum manibus, et aequetur, donec redeat.	The treatment for this removal is simple and consists in returning it with ease with the hands, and in making it stable, until it returns to its place.
In curatione autem eius quando dislocatur secundum complementum, oportet, ut facias sedere infirmum rectum: et teneat ipsum minister fortis ualde a posteriori parte dorsi eius, in medio ipsius.	In the cure for this however, when it is dislocated from the second complement, you should make the sick person sit upright: and hold it firmly by a strong minister from behind its back, in the middle of its own.
Deinde tene tu cum manu tua dextra pedem eius a superiori parte eius, et cum manu tua sinistra ab inferiori parte pedis eius loco cauillae.	Then hold it with your right hand from the upper part of its foot, and with your left hand from the lower part of the foot in the place of the nail.
Deinde trahe pedem ad tecum manu tua dextra.	Then pull the foot towards you with your right hand.
Deinde cum sinistra duabus uicibus.	Then, with the two joints of your left hand.
Deinde extende cum sinistra, et impelle pectus pedis cum dextra uersus crus absque labore.	Then extend it with the left, and push the chest of the foot towards the leg without working.
Fac illud bis, sicut narrauimus.	Make it do this twice, as we have described.
Deinde impelle pectus pedis ad crus in uice tertia, et tu trahis cauillam.	Then push the chest of the foot towards the leg in a third pull, and you draw the nail in.
Si ergo redit in uice una, aut in duabus secundum hunc modum, et uides pedem aequatum, est bonum: et si non, tunc itera operationem super ipsum: quoniam ipse redit.	If it then returns in a single pull, or in two pulls according to this method, and you see the foot even, it is good; and if not, then repeat the operation on it: for it will return again.
Si autem prohibetur tibi reductio eius cum eo quod narrauimus: tunc fac iacere infirmum super dorsum suum super terram, et fige paxillum in terra firmatum ualde, ut cadat inter coxas eius: et tu iam inuoluisti super ipsum pannum, ut non laedat infirmum.	But if it is forbidden to you to return it with that which we have described: then let the sick person lie on his back on the ground, and fix a firm footstool on the ground so that it may fall between its knees: and you may now draw up on top of it by means of a cloth, so that it does not hurt the sick person.
Deinde accipiat minister coxam eius: postea extendat minister alter pedem, aut cum manibus suis, aut cum ligamento quod liget super collum pedis.	Then let the minister take the knee of the sick person: then extend the other minister's foot, or with its hands, or with a bandage which he ties above the knee of the foot.
Deinde extendat omnis minister contra extensionem comparis sui: et paxillus sit stans inter duas coxas infirmi retinens eum, ut non attrahatur corpus eius ad inferiora apud extensionem.	Then let all the ministers stand against his extension, and a pacifier be standing between two hips holding him back, so that his body is not drawn to the lower ones at the time of extension.
Deinde aequet medicus dislocationem manibus suis, et minister alter teneat crus sanum ad inferiora.	Then let the doctor make his hands equal and the other ministers hold the healthy leg down.
Nam dislocatio redit cum uelocitate.	For the dislocation returns with speed.
Quando ergo redit dislocatio, et declaratur tibi sanitas reditionis eius: tunc pone emplastrum et stuppam, et stringe ipsam cum ligamentis firmiter, et liga pedem cum ligamento ad crus.	When therefore the dislocation returns, and it is declared to you that the return of health is made: then put on a plaster and a splint, and bind it firmly with ligaments, and tie the foot with a ligament to the leg.
Et oportet, ut caueas uel timeas de neruis, qui sunt supra calcaneum posterius, ut non sit ligamentum super eos uehemens, et laedat eos.	And you should be careful and not fear about the nerves that are above the heel behind, so that there is no crushing of them by the ligament, and they hurt them.
Deinde dimitte ipsum duobus diebus, aut tribus.	Then let him go for two days, or three.
Quod si mollificatur ligamentum, stringe ipsum: deinde solue ipsum in die tertio, aut quarto: et prohibe infirmum ab ambulatione quadraginta diebus.	That if the ligament softens, bind him: then solve him on the third day, or fourth: and prohibit the sick from walking for forty days.
Si uero conatur ambulare ante illud spacium, non fit securitas quin dissoluatur super ipsum dislocatio, et corrumpatur, et non recipiat post illud curationem.	But if it attempts to walk before that space, there is no security unless the dislocation is dissolved on him, and it corrupts, and does not receive after it any cure.
Quod si accidat ei apostema calidum: tunc oportet, ut administres in sedatione eius illud, in quo praecessit narratio nostra in alio loco ex curatione, et embrocationem, donec remoueatur.	That if it happens to him a swelling that is hot: then you should administer to him in seduction that which we have mentioned in another place from the cure of a swelling, and a poultice, until it moves away.
¶ De dislocatione Digitorum pedis, et cura.	Of the dislocation of the fingers of the foot, and its cure.
Caput XXXV.	Chapter XXXVI.
Oportet, ut aequetur quod dislocatur ex eis cum extensione pauca absque labore: et illud quidem non est difficile, imo est facile.	It should be so that it is dislocated from them with a little extension without work: and this is not difficult, it is even easy.
Si autem dislocatio est in quibusdam nodis dorsi pedis: tunc oportet, ut faciat sedere infirmus pedem suum super locum aequalem terrae, aut super tabulam: et est stans sicut ambulans.	But if the dislocation is in certain nods of the back of the foot: then it should be so that the sick person puts his foot on an equal place of the ground, or on a table: and he stands as one who walks.
Deinde tu sta, et pone pedem tuum super illud quod eminet ex illis iuncturis.	Then you stand still, and put your foot on that which comes out from them by the joint.
Deinde calca illud cum pede tuo cum uirtute, donec redeat, et uideas ipsum iam aequatum, et non appareat in loco eminentia.	Then put that stone with your foot with strength, until it returns, and the hernia itself is already even, and does not seem to be outstanding in place.
Deinde pone sub uentre pedis eius tabulam quae capiat pedem totum, cui sint duo capita.	Then put under the abdomen of that foot a plate which catches the whole foot, which has two heads.
Deinde stringe ipsum strictura decenti tribus diebus.	Then tighten it with a string to be worn for three days.
Deinde solue ipsum, et fac quiescere eum ab ambulatione diebus multis, donec stringatur et securetur a reductione.	Then solve it, and let it rest from walking for many days, until the string is tight and secure from the reduction.
¶ De speciebus dislocationis cum uulnere uel fractura.	As for the species of dislocation with a fracture or break.
Caput XXXVI.	Chapter 36.
Quando accidit aliquid ex illo, et conaris curationem eius, et ipsius restaurationem, multotiens succedit mors: et propter illud non oportet, ut praesumat super curationem eius, quod est huiusmodi, nisi qui est prudens in arte longi usus, misericors, pius, tardus, non audax, neque praesumptuosus: et ut utatur in incaeptionce medicinis quae sedant apostemata calida tantum: et dimittat infirmum diuino iudicio.	When something like this has happened, and the patient is concerned about his cure and recovery, often death follows: and for that reason you should not presume to control his cure, which is of this kind, unless you are prudent in the art of long use, merciful, considerate, slow, not bold, nor presumptuous: and use medicines which sit on the pulse only, and let go of the sick with divine judgment.
Nisi uideas, aut speras salutem a perditione cum lenitate aegritudinis, et in quo apparet quiddam spei.	Except you hope for salvation from destruction with mildness of disease, and in which there seems to be some hope.
Conare ergo reductionem eius statim in principio rei, antequam accidat apostema calidum.	Therefore consider the reduction of it at once at the beginning of the thing, before a hot poultice has happened.
Si ergo redit membrum, secundum quod uolumus, tunc administra regimen quod sedat apostema: et cura uulnus cum eo quod conuenit ei ex unguentis desiccatiuis.	If then the limb returns, according to our instructions, then administer a regimen which sits on the poultice: and attend to the wound with that which suits it from an ointment of dried herbs.
Quod si dislocatio est cum fractura, et accidunt in osse satagiae separatae, tunc conare ablationem earum, et fac in illo quod diximus in aegritudinibus simplicibus ex eo quod praecessit in locis earum.	That if the dislocation is with a fracture, and have happened in bones separated from each other, then consider the removal of them, and make in it what we said in simple diseases because it has preceded in places of them.
Et caue secundum tuam uirtutem, et custodi teipsum ab introitu in uiam timoris: secundum quod praecessit praedicatio mea tibi.	And cause according to your strength, and protect yourself from the entrance into a trap of fear: because my prediction has come to you.
Nam illud est melius tibi apud Creatorem tuum, et magis permanens ad gloriam tuam, et magis saluum tuo corpori apud illos in tuo tempore.	For that is better for you with your Creator, and more lasting to your glory, and more healthy to your body with them in your time.
