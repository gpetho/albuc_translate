of the fracture of the hand
Know that on the back of the hand and at the knuckles of the fingers, fractures rarely occur, and there is usually only swelling.
And when the palm of the hand is fractured or swollen, the patient should sit cross-legged, and sit straight and evenly before him; then place his hand on the stretched towel, and the practitioner extends the broken bones, and sets them evenly together, so that they are well joined; and apply the plaster and the padding, if no abscess develops, then put a splint according to the size of the area; and it should be wrapped in a linen cloth.
And if the fracture is inside, around the belly of the palm, make a ball of cloths, and instruct the patient to squeeze it against his fractured palm; and then tighten it with a long cloth, and let the splint be of soft leather, as large as the palm of the hand, and tighten it as needed.
And if the fracture is outside, you must put a splint on top, and another underneath in the palm, so that the hand is open and straight, then tie it all around the hand, and tighten the bond between the fingers.
And if the fracture occurs at any of the knuckles of the fingers, if it's the thumb, set it evenly as needed; and tighten it with the palm, and if you wish, put a small straight splint to lift the fracture, and so it doesn't move; and if the fracture is in the other fingers, such as the index or one of the others, set it evenly, and tie it with the healthy finger that is next to it; or you tie them all together, which is better, or you put on a splint, as with the thumb; and be wary of the restoration and the disposition of hot abscesses, and treat what arises there, as I have said.
