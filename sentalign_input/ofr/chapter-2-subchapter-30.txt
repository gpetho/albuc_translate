It is advisable, when you treat a toothache, that you delay extracting it as long as you can, because one should not do this;
because it is a very important substance unless one has no other option than to extract it.
Then, when the patient is compelled to have it extracted, you must be certain of the aching tooth.
Many times the pain deceives the patient, and they think it is in a healthy tooth, and have the good tooth extracted;
and yet the pain does not go away because of this, until the bad one is extracted, for we have already seen this done to these healers;
and when you are quite certain of the aching tooth, you must scrape around the tooth with a strong spatula to protect the gum on all sides;
then loosen it with your fingers or with fine tongs at the first push and push, until it is well loosened, then firmly grasp it with the tongs;
and let the patient's head be in your lap between your knees, and hold it well so that they do not move.
Then pull the tooth straight out without breaking it, and if it does not come out, take one of these instruments and insert it gently on each side, and move it as you did before. 
And if the tooth is decayed and damaged, you must fill it with cloth, where the holes are;
and grip it carefully with the tongs so that it doesn't break when pulled;
and you must work very carefully around the gum to loosen the tooth.
And be very careful not to break it, leaving a piece behind, which would cause the patient even greater pain than before due to the harmful nature of the root.
And be careful not to do as ignorant healers do, who through their haste and recklessness sometimes damage the gums and donâ€™t achieve what we have described;
but sometimes, because of this, they cause serious illness due to the roots that remain, or because of the gum tissue they damage, as we have often seen;
and when the tooth is extracted, wash the area with wine or vinegar and salt;
and if bleeding occurs, which often happens, fill the area with ground vitriol;
and if that doesn't work, cauterize it.
The shapes of the instruments, which are used to move the teeth first, should have long points and thick handles so they don't bend when you pull the tooth;
and these are the shapes:
And they should be of thick parts so they don't bend when pulling, and be made of good Indian steel, and be toothed for a firm grip.
