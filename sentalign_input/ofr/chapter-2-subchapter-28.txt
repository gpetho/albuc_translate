of the flesh of the gums
Often extra flesh grows on the gums, which the ancients call "albulus"; so you must hold it with forceps, and cut it at its root, and let the pus or blood flow; then put on the area ground vitriol, or other astringent and drying powders; and if this flesh returns after the incision, and it often does, then cut it a second time, and cauterize it: it will not return after cauterization; and these are the shapes of the instruments for cutting.
