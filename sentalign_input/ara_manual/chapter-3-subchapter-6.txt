Chapter Six.
On the reduction of a fractured shoulder. The shoulder rarely breaks in its wide part, but rather its edges break. So, whenever a place in it breaks, or it breaks in its middle, and that is known by touch, then reduce it according to the shape of the fracture.
Straighten it and return it to its natural shape by any means you can, then apply to the area mill dust with egg white and soft mashaq, and place over it padding made of folded cloth, then place on it a wide splint made of wood.
Thin, according to the size of the entire shoulder, or slightly wider. If there is a curvature under the splint in any of the areas of the shoulder, then straighten that curvature with soft mashaq until the splint sits flat, then tie it from above with a long turban.
Tie it tightly and secure the splint so that it does not move from its place, and check the bandage every day. Whenever the bandage loosens, tighten it and adjust the splint if it has moved from its place.  Let the patient lie on his healthy side, and the shoulder heals in twenty days.
Days or twenty-five days. When this period is completed, loosen the bandage and you are safe, for it is one of the bones that one does not fear will shatter or break. If a splinter protrudes from the bone and it pricks under the skin, then cut over it and extract it.
And do what I mentioned in the fracture of the clavicle regarding soothing the hot swelling, if something like that occurs.
