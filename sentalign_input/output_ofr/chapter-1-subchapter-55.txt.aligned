Of/about stinking pustules/boils/sores	On the cauterization of pustules occurring on the body.	0.4487862
Sometimes swellings or stinking pustules appear outside the body, which come from large corrupted matters.	Foul pustules sometimes arise on the body, caused by heavy corrupt frigid matter.	0.715106
So it is necessary, at first when they appear, to make a cautery on each head of the pustule: a subtle cautery of myrtle wood, the tip of which is set on fire, or of long birthwort root, or with a lenticular cautery.	When they first appear you should cauterize the head of each one lightly with myrtle wood whose tip has been lighted in the fire; or with the root of the long birthwort; or with the lenticular cautery.	0.76996344
And sometimes they are cauterized at the beginning when they appear, in this manner, and they cannot grow from then on, but the superfluity from which they come is broken, and they are healed; but this must be done after bloodletting.	Sometimes furuncles also are cauterized in the same manner when they first arise; then they get no bigger and the superfluity originating them is dispersed and the patient is cured of them. But before you cauterize these, the patient must be depleted by bleeding.	0.7168311
