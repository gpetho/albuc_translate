And also apply two cauteries between the fifth and sixth ribs, slanting slightly towards the back; one cautery at the center of the chest and another over the stomach. And apply three cauteries on the back: one between the shoulder blades, and two on each side of the chest, below the cautery placed between the shoulder blades.	And two big cauterizations above the nipples in the space between the third and fourth ribs; and two more between the fifth and sixth ribs, tending slightly toward the back; and another in the middle of the chest; and another above the stomach; and three more behind, namely, one between the scapulae and two on either side of the dorsal spine below the one between the scapulae.	0.8970191
Do not press your hand too hard with the cautery; instead, it should only be obvious enough by the smell of the burning skin.	It is not necessary to cauterize deeply, but let it be a mere hint, in the outer skin.	0.5701466
Some of the ancients have said that certain practitioners use an iron cautery similar to a rod; they heat it, insert it between the ribs until it reaches the abscess, and let the discharge exit, as we mentioned in the case of a liver abscess.	Now one of the Ancients mentioned that there were some people who used an iron cautery shaped like a probe, and introduced it red hot into the intercostal space until it reached the abscess itself and evacuated the pus, as we have mentioned under tumour of the liver.	0.81626797
But with this procedure there is a risk: either the patient dies immediately, or a fistula develops at the site, which is incurable.	But in this perforation with the cautery there is a danger either that the patient may die on the spot or that an incurable fistula may arise at the place.	0.8313271
