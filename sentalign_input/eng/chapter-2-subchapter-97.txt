 CHAPTER NINETY-SEVEN.
On the application of leeches.
 Leeches are mostly used on those parts of the body to which application of cupping-vessels is impossible, either because of their smallness, such as the lips, the gums, and so on; or because the part is bare of flesh, like the finger, the nose, and so on.
This is the way to use them: you seek some leeches that are in fresh water free of dirt.
Then you leave them in fresh water for a day and a night until they are hungry and nothing is left in their bellies; then you purge the patient's body, either by venesection or by the application of cupping vessels; then you scrub the afflicted part until it is flushed; and then place the leeches on it.
When they are full they will fall off.
If it is possible to make suction with a cupping vessel, the effect will be greater.
But if not, wash the part with vinegar followed by much water; then rub and put pressure on it.
If the blood continues to run after the leeches have fallen off, and becomes an ooze, let linen dressings be wetted with cold water and apply them over the place until the oozing stops.
But if the bleeding be serious then sprinkle upon the place powdered vitriol or gall or similar styptics, until the haemorrhage is stopped.
Or let split shelled beans be applied to the place and left until they stick there, and then the bleeding will stop.
If it is necessary to repeat the application, the same leech should not be applied but another one if you possibly can.
If the leeches fail to stick on, the place should be wiped over with fresh blood or pricked with a needle to bring out a little blood; then apply them, for if they smell any blood they will immediately adhere.
When you wish to remove them, sprinkle over them a little powdered aloes or salt or ashes, then they will at once fall away.
