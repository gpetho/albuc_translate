O, sons, since I have completed for you this book, which is the culmination of the science of medicine, through its completion, and through its exposition, and through its declarations, it seems to me that I should satisfy you with this treatise, which is a part of the hand's operation, that is, surgery.
Because the operation by hand is neglected in our region and in our time, entirely deprived, so that the science of it is quickly lost, and its vestiges are obliterated; and nothing remains of it but some small descriptions in the books of the Ancients, which are mostly altered and lead to errors and hesitation, so that their intentions are obscured and their force and art are weakened.
And it seems to me that I should revive it with the ordering of this treatise, in that way, according to the method of exposition and declaration and abbreviation; and that it should come with the forms of the cautery instruments and of the other instruments of the work, as it should be by addition of the declaration, and by preparation of it, which is a necessary thing.
But the reason why a good artisan with his hand is not found in our time is that the art of medicine is lengthy, and that its practitioner must first be exercised in the science of anatomy, which Galen has described, so that he knows the locations of the members and their forms, and their conjunction and separation; and he should have knowledge of the bones, the nerves and the ligaments, and their number, and their origin; and of the pulsating veins and the quiet ones, and the places of their emergence.
And for that reason Hippocrates says that with one name much is said, but in the work little, and especially in the art of the hand.
But we have already said that in the introduction to this book; for whoever is not learned in what we have said of anatomy, is not free from falling into error, by which men will be killed, just as I have seen many such cases, because some are trained in this science and then practice it without knowledge and without experience.
For I saw a foolish and inexperienced physician incise a scrofulous abscess in the neck of a woman, and he incised some arteries of the neck, so that a great flow of blood occurred until the woman died in his hands.
And I saw another physician who undertook to remove a stone from a man who had it since his youth, and the stone was large, and he went to him and extracted that stone with a piece of the bladder, so that that man died on the third day.
And I was called to extract it, and I saw that because of the size of the stone and the condition of the patient, I knew that he would die.
And I saw another physician who received a stipend from a duke of our land for surgery, and it happened to a black eunuch who had a fracture in his thigh; and the physician, through his ignorance, extracted the fracture, on the wound, with pads and splints with strong constriction, and did not allow the wound to breathe (to heal properly).
And then he unbound it according to his wishes, and then he bound it again, and then he left it for some days and ordered that we unbind the bandage; and it remained so until the thigh and foot were festering (abscessed), and it came to ruin (loss of the limb/death).
And I was called to him, and I prepared to unbind the bandage, and quietness was achieved, and thus a lessening of his pains.
However, the corruption was already confirmed in the limb, so that I could not restrain it, and the corruption did not cease to spread in the limb until the patient perished.
And I saw another physician who perforated a cancerous abscess, and it was ulcerated for some days, until the malignancy of it was magnified by its lord (master, owner - perhaps referring to the spread of the infection or the worsening of the condition).
The reason is that a cancerous sore is pure melancholic humor; therefore, it is not fitting that it be treated with iron entirely, but rather the limb in which it suffers should be entirely rested (kept immobile).
And for that reason, sons, it is necessary for you that the operation with the hand be divided into two divisions: that is, into an operation which is associated with health, and into a work in which there is peril in the greatest situations (or "in the most serious cases").
And I have already expounded this in every part of this book where an operation occurs in which there is error and fear; therefore it is necessary for you to guard against this and avoid it, lest fools find a way to speak and dishonor you.
Therefore, take up your instruments with diligence and with God's protection, and treat your patients with happiness and firmness.
And use the best method, by the grace of God, leading to health and laudable success, and leave the terrible diseases of difficult healing, and abstain from those things that make you fear, so that hesitation in your faith and in your name may not overcome you: for this is more conducive to your glory, and higher in the world and for the sake of your holiness.
Galen already said in some of his admonitions: Do not treat a bad disease, lest you be called a bad physician".
And I have divided this book into three chapters.
Begins the division of the book, and first, of the first part. The first chapter deals with the head down to the feet,  the forms of instruments and the tools for cautery, and what is necessary in the operation.
The division of the second part. The second chapter, of incision and perforation, and of cupping, and of wounds, and of the extraction of arrows and similar things, all chaptered and ordered according to the forms of the instruments.
The third chapter, of reduction and dislocation, and of the treatment of sprains and similar things; a chapter ordered from head to foot, and of the forms of the instruments.
It is necessary that I say the quality of the benefits of that cautery and its drawbacks, and in what constitution cautery is prohibited.
Therefore I say that the discourse on the quality of the benefit of cautery and its drawbacks is a long and prolix discourse, and subtle in science, and a hidden secret; and many wise men have already spoken of it, and they have disagreed about it, and a little of their discourses suffices for me, fearing prolixity.
And therefore I say that cautery benefits all complexions universally, which are with matter or without matter, except for two complexions, which are hot complexions without matter.
In the hot and dry complexion with matter, there is disagreement; for some say that cautery is beneficial to it, and others say the contrary, that cautery is not suitable in a disease which is by quality and by dryness, because the nature of fire is quality and dryness, and it is inconvenient that a hot and dry disease should be healed with that which is hot and dry.
And I refute him who says the contrary, that benefit is done by cautery in every hot and dry disease that occurs in the bodies of men, because when you compare the body of man and its humors to the complexion of fire, you find the body of man cold.
And I say, concerning his discourse, that I have discovered this by experience several times.
However, it is not fitting that this should come upon one who is already experienced and practiced in the chapter on cautery through previous exercise, and who has known the diversity of the complexions of men and the disposition of diseases in themselves, and the causes of those, and their accidents, and the span of time of those.
But in the other complexions, there is no fear for you, and especially in cold and moist diseases, for all physicians have agreed on those, and are not in disagreement about the benefit with cautery in those.
And know, sons, that the secret of healing by cautery with fire and its goodness, above cautery with a burning medicine, is because fire is simple, its action does not reach except the member which is cauterized and does not harm the other member adjacent to it, except with slight harm.
But the action of burning medicine reaches to those members which are distant from it, and quickly causes in the member a disease of difficult healing and quickly kills.
But fire, by its sublimity and the goodness of its substance, does not do this except that it superfluously flows.  And it is known to us by experiment and by long service of study in the art concerning the truth of the causes; and for this I am excused from the length of discourse. And if it were not that it is not permitted in my book to present to you this secret hidden with fire, and the quality of its operation in bodies and of its expulsion by which it expels diseases, with a philosophical demonstrative discourse, which would be heavy upon your minds.
And know, sons, that they disagree on the time in which it is convenient to perform cautery, and they place the best time in springtime.
And I say that cautery is convenient at all times, because the harm caused by the accidental time is submerged in the benefit of that which is achieved with cautery, and especially if the cautery is for pains or necessary pains, strong and urgent, which do not tolerate delay because it is feared that from those (delays) greater harm will come than the small harm entering through time.
And this does not fall into your minds, or, sons, this is only esteemed by the vulgar people and foolish physicians, that is, that for that illness which is healed by cautery there is no remission at all times, and they posit this consequence.
And the cause is not at all as they think for that reason, because cautery is only in place of medicine which alters the complexion and dries the humors which are the cause by which pains come.
However, cautery surpasses medicine because of the speed of its effectiveness and the virtue of its operation and the greatness of its effect.
And it is possible that his illness returns at some time, according to the complexion of the patient and the location of his illness, and his strength, and that which is prepared in his body from the aggregation of superfluities in him, and that which has come to him in his acquisition in foods and similar causes; unless the illness in which cautery is administered is a subtle illness in a member with few superfluities and humors, such as cautery of a tooth for pain and similar to that, it is possible that in him that pain does not return, but this happens in small things.
And a more common saying is that cautery is the last resort of medicine, and it is a righteous saying, not in what they understand by it, for they believe that it is not a cure that benefits with medicine or with any other thing besides cautery.
And the reason is contrary to that; and the intention that cautery is the last resort of medicine is only when we administer the methods of cure in certain illnesses, and those medicines do not help, and then at the end of the process, one administers cautery, and it benefits for that. And therefore, from here it is seen that cautery is the last resort of medicine, not according to the understanding of the common people and many foolish physicians.
And the ancients said that cautery with gold is better than cautery with iron, and they did not say this except for the evenness of gold and the sublimity of its substance.
And they said that the place of cautery does not scar, although that is not absolutely true, because I have already proven this and found that it does not do so except in some bodies and not others, and cautery with it is good and better than with iron, as they said; however, when you do cautery with fire with gold, it is not clear to you, because it is ignited according to the quantity you want by the roughness of the gold, and because it is prepared to receive cold; and if you apply fire to it, the gold melts from the fire, and some small plates fall into the fire, so that the craftsman is distracted by that.
And for that reason, cautery with iron is done more easily and more readily with accuracy of operation.
And I have already ordered this chapter on cautery according to chapters, and I have ordered those from the head to the feet, so that I may easily find what the questioner wants from it.
The first chapter.
This cauterization is applied to dampness and coldness affecting the brain, the accidents of which are two causes: that is, the cause of sudden and abundant rheumatic flux, called coryza, flowing from the head to the parts of the eyes and ears, and excessive sleep, and toothache and throat pain, and universally every illness that comes from coldness, such as paralysis, sudden unconsciousness, apoplexy, and similar illnesses.
The method of this cauterization is this: first, order the patient to be evacuated with laxative medicine, purifying the head, for three or four nights, according to the strength of the patient, their age and their habits.
Then order him to shave his head with a razor, and then have him sit between your hands on a low bench and place his hands on his feet.
And then place the root of your palm near the brow above the root of the nose between his eyes. However, when your middle finger has reached that spot, mark that place with a probe, and then ignite the olive-shaped cautery, of which this is the form:
And then place that [cautery] on the spot marked with the probe, in such a way that it descends, with which your hand is gradually constricted, and you rotate it.
And then lift your hand slightly and observe the place, and if you see some quantity of the head of the bone uncovered, like the quantity of a grain of barley, then raise your hand, and if not, return your hand with that iron, or with another one if it is cooled, until that which I have told you is seen of the bone.
And then take a little salt and dissolve it on the spot and leave it for three days.
And then place on it cotton soaked in wine and leave it there until the burn scar is destroyed. And then treat the area with tetrafarmacon ointment until it is healed.
And it is said that when the wound remains open, the arm heals better, because it is better and more beneficial.
And some of them say that the elbow should be cauterized to the bone, and the cautery should be held there until some part of the bone's substance is charred.
And then scrape away what is burnt from the bone, and then it should be treated.
And others say that with the cautery, you should reach the back, until it penetrates strongly into the bone, until the bone is consumed.  And this is the way of a small alphecat (likely referring to a type of bone disease or injury): And they believe that vapors from the head exhale from that place.
And the wound should be kept open for a long time, and then it should be healed until it is consolidated.
But I have not seen these two types of cautery at all, except in some men, as a way of fear; and leave that, it seems to me, it is better with health, when it is; because the head is weakened by a solution of its continuity, as we have testified in the other members, and especially when the patient's head is of a fragile nature.
And the first type of cautery is safer and better, in my opinion; and use that, and with that work in health.
Chapter Two.
Concerning the cautery of the head.
When chronic and prolonged pain occurs throughout the head in a patient, and he uses leeches, cupping, purgatives, plasters, potions, poultices, and similar remedies, and especially if he has already been cauterized with a cautery which we recount and none of these things benefits him, then consider whether the patient's head is of strong constitution by nature; and if it is not fragile and he finds great cold, then cauterize him again with another cautery a little below that one. And then cauterize that [area] above the horn of his head with a cautery until the scab is formed. Incise the scab and uncover the bone to the extent we have recounted, and cauterize that with a cautery in the rear part of the head in the place which is called the vas—and this is the place where a cupping glass is placed. And ease your hand in this, and do not uncover the bone, for the patient thereby finds much greater pain, different from the pain of all other cauterizations of the head.
And I say this cautery in its place, because it is necessary that the cautery with which the horns of the head and the occiput are cauterized is a more subtle cautery than that with which the middle part of the head is cauterized; and this is its form.
Chapter three.
Concerning the cauterization of non-ancient migraine.
When a sudden pain occurs in the head, or a prolonged pain extends to the eye, let the head be evacuated with purifying medicines, and let the other treatment be administered, which I have described in the descriptions of illnesses; and if nothing helps, then cauterization is in two ways: either cauterization with a sharp burning medicine, or with iron.
But cauterization with a burning medicine is that you take a clove of garlic, and you peel it and cut off the ends from both sides. Then incise the location of the pain in the temple with a lancet until a place is made beneath the skin, until it is hidden.
Then bind it tightly with a cloth for a strong constriction, and leave it for three hours; and then untie it and remove the garlic, and leave the wound for two or three days, and then place on it cotton soaked in vinegar until the area becomes inflamed.
And then treat it with ointment until it is healed.
And if you wish, do this with some burning medicines which I have written about in the twelfth treatise on burning medicines.
But cauterization with iron in this manner: ignite the cautery, of which this is the form:
and it is called *claus clavilhs* (nail-shaped cautery), because its head is like the shape of a nail, in which there is a certain curvature, and in the middle of it is a small eminence.
And then place it on the location of the pain, and hold your hand—so that the flesh underneath is not burned—and move the iron little by little with speed.
And if the amount of flesh that is burned by the heat of the cautery is about half, then lift your hand so that the artery beneath is not burned, so that there is no flow of blood.
And then soak cotton in salt water and place that on the area, and leave it for three days; and then apply cotton moistened with honey, and then treat with ointment until it is healed.
And if you wish, cauterize with the tip of a knife, according to the cautery method, and be careful to avoid cutting the artery in this particular, not-ancient, migraine.
Chapter four.
Concerning the cauterization of chronic migraine.
When you treat migraine with what we have said in the previous treatment, and what we have said in the divisions of diseases, and the treatment does not help, and sometimes due to the severity of the illness, what we said about the first cauterization with medicine or cauterization with fire is insufficient, then you should heat the knife cautery until it is white hot, since you mark the location of the pain with a line whose length is half a finger, or something like that; and place your hand for a moment and press it until you incise the artery and reach the bone.
However, it is necessary for you to be careful about the continuation of the jaw, which is moved during mastication, and that the muscle is not injured and the nerve that serves it, and that spasm does not occur.
And if it is about the care and caution regarding the flow of blood from the incised artery, for in its incision there is danger, and especially for one who is ignorant of what he does and is not studious and experienced; and abandons the operation at the beginning.
And I will come with a recollection of the treatment of accidental bleeding from the artery according to its manner, in its place in this book.
And if you see that this disease is not relieved by this cautery and the patient's body can tolerate it, cauterize it in the middle of the head as we have recounted, and treat the wound until it is healed.
And if you wish, administer the cautery which we have mentioned in the chapter on the constriction of an artery with a cautery having two blades, and this cauterization is better and more suitable.
Chapter 5.
Chapter 5: On the cauterization of earaches.
When there is pain in the ear due to cold and it is treated with laxative remedies and with the other treatment which I have described in the division, and the pain is not relieved, then apply the cautery, and this is the one which is called "puncta", of which this is the form:
And then, quickly apply the cauterization, and let it be led around the whole ear as a wheel is turned, or in the circumference of each part if the pain is in a specific part. Lengthen the cautery from the root of the ear little by little after you have marked the place with a probe.
And if the cautery makes ten points in the whole ear, and whichever one it is, then treat the places until they are healed.
Chapter 6.
Concerning the cauterization of a cough.
A cough which is cured with cauterization is only of those species which come from phlegm, as we have said in the divisions of illnesses.
Avoid cauterization of the species that arises from dryness or from spasm of the nerve.
When you treat that type of cough with leeches and purgatives and gargles, and your treatment is not effective, then you should cauterize the patient with three cauterizations: the first at the root of the ear, the second a little below the temple, and the third at the junction of the two lips.
And place your cautery on the opposite side of the affected part, because softening does not occur except in the part that appears healthy.
And the method of cauterization is that you cauterize it with the cautery at the very tip of the ear, a little above the corner of the head, and another in the temple, the length of which should be according to the length of the index finger, and hold your cautery there until half the thickness of a quill is burned.
And this is the form of the cautery, and it is a type of knife, the form of which is shown above. (This assumes a diagram or illustration was present in the original text.) However, it is more subtle to do it a little like this; and it is necessary to cut away some superfluous thickness.
And then treat the area with what was previously described until it is healed.
Chapter 7.
On the cauterization of chronic apoplexy.
When apoplexy is chronic and you have treated it with what we have said, and your medication is not effective and the patient has no fever, then cauterize him with four cauteries: on all the corners of his head; and cauterize the middle of the head, as we have said; and cauterize the nape of the neck. And the manner of cauterization is done as described above.
And now it is cauterized above the stomach; and it is better behind; and then let it be treated with what follows.
Chapter 8.
On cauterization for forgetfulness done by flame.
So that at the beginning, large leeches and purifying pills are given to the patient.
And then shave the patient's entire head and apply to his neck a plaster of cetre described in the treatise on plasters.
And apply that several times, for that is a manner of cauterization. And do this according to the same order which I have already said.
And therefore if he is healed by those means, it is good; and if not, then make for him three cauteries in the back part of his head, which descend from the uppermost part of the head down to the lowermost part of the neck. And place between each cautery the width of a finger, and then treat the cautery with what has been described.
But if you add more and the patient tolerates it, then make a cautery in the middle place; and if you wish greater addition (a stronger cautery), then cauterize that above the two horns (presumably referring to anatomical locations on the head).
Then treat that until it is healed; and let the cautery be olive-shaped, according to the form given before.
Chapter 9.
Concerning the cauterization of paralysis and the softening of the whole body.
That you proceed in the purification of the head with jars and with that which we have said; and then shave the head of the patient, and then cauterize it with a cautery in the middle of the head, and with a cautery on all the horns of the head, and with a cautery on the back part of him, and with three cauteries on the vertebrae of the neck.
And if it is necessary in the illness of softening of the body to find it and the patient tolerates it and the illness is severe, then cauterize it with four cauteries on the vertebrae of the back, and finally with a cautery until it is burned from the coccyx upwards, and raise your hand. And then treat it until it is healed, and this should be an olive-oil cautery.
Chapter 10.
Concerning the cauterization of epilepsy.
The epileptic is not cauterized unless that epilepsy is caused by phlegm.
And therefore it is necessary to purify his brain at the beginning with herbs and with the other treatment which we have described in the section when the patient is strong and tolerates the expulsion of medicines.
And if it is a child who does not tolerate medicines, then administer gargles and masticatories that purify the brain, before that for many days, with improvement of the diet.
Then shave the head of the patient, and cauterize it with a cautery in the middle of the head according to the previous method, and with another cautery in the nape of his neck, and cauterize above each temple. And if the patient is strong and tolerant, then cauterize him with the cauteries which I have mentioned, having paralysis and softening of the body over the vertebrae of the neck and the vertebrae of the back.
And let the cautery be olive-shaped, as has been previously described.
But if the patient is a child, then apply a small cautery according to this method.
Chapter 11.
Concerning the cauterization of melancholy.
When the causes of melancholy are corrupt humors and a thick phlegm, then cauterize it with the cauteries which we have mentioned in the treatment of paralysis.
And if the cause of melancholy is a superfluity tending towards melancholy, and the patient's body is humid, then give him something to drink that cleanses his brain, according to what has preceded in the division (of treatments).
Then shave the patient's head, and then make a properly-made poultice of it over the circle (presumably a previously drawn circle on the head), and then place that in the middle of the head.
And let the patient be seated and recumbent (or, sitting leaning back), and be held on all sides.
Then apply a liniment; and it is most worthy to use old sheep's grease (or suet). And heat that (liniment) over the fire with a moderate, measured heating, which the said sufferer will feel when it is applied to him. Then pour that (heated liniment) into the middle of his head within the circle, and leave it there until it is cooled.
And do this to the patient once a week, along with his other good treatment until he is healed; or, if you wish, cauterize it making small punctures according to his need, but hold your hand with a cautery thus prepared: this is a kind of cautery which moistens the brain evenly.
Then apply that cotton soaked in grease or goose fat.
Chapter 12.
On the cauterization of water descending into the eye.
When the beginning of watery discharge in the eye is declared to you by the signs which I have mentioned in the division, then begin and give the patient something to purify his head, and keep it from all humidity.
And make him sweat in a bath for a few days.
And then order him to shave his head, and cauterize it with a cautery in the middle of the head; and then cauterize it with two cauteries on the two temples if the beginning of the watery discharge is in two eyes, or on one side if the beginning of the watery discharge is in one eye.
Incise with a cautery all the veins and arteries which are below the temples; and let the cauteries be far apart in the width of the temples.
And beware of a flow of blood when it is cauterized; and if you see a flow of blood from it, stop it with any medicine which is possible for you.
And I come with wisdom which is in the extraction of arteries and with the excision of those and the caution of blood flow.
And sometimes it is cauterized in the neck below the two bones with two cauteries placed apart.
Chapter 13.
Concerning the cauterization of old tears (likely referring to long-standing sores or wounds).
When the tears from the eyes are old and persistent, and through the veins and arteries which are in the manifest area of the head, and it is verified that this is a superfluity of cold, phlegmatic humors, then cauterize that with the cautery which we recounted in the beginning chapter about water falling into the eyes, and with a cautery in the middle of the head and with two cauteries in the neck below the two temples, and with two cauteries in the neck below the two bones. And if it requires additional treatment, then cauterize it at the outer corner of the eye, above the end of the eyebrow, with a small cautery.
Chapter 14.
Concerning the cauterization of nasal odor (or, more accurately, a foul smell from the nose).
When you treat this with what we have said in the division and your treatment is not effective, then you prepare and give the patient the decoctions for three nights; and then shave his head, and cauterize it with a medium-sized olive-shaped cautery. And then cauterize it with a clove-shaped cautery, with two cauterizations above the two eyebrows, slightly below the hairline.
And beware of burning the artery, that you do not burn it.
And of the clove-shaped cautery, this is the form/shape.
Chapter 15.
Concerning the cauterization for the softening/relaxation of the eyelids.
When the eyelid is softened by illness or humidity, then cauterize that eyelid with a lunar cautery; and this is its form:
And if you cauterize, do so above the two eyebrows a little, with two cauteries in each area, and let them be elongated towards the temples. And let the length of each cautery be according to the size of the eyebrow.
And do not press too hard with your hand and the cautery, but only to the extent that a third of the eyelid is hardened/cauterized.
Chapter XVI.
Concerning the cauterization of the eyelid of the eye when the hairs are turned inward and prick the eye.
When the hairs of the eye are turned inward so that they prick the eye, cauterization in those cases is according to two methods, for cauterization is either with fire or with a burning medicine.
If with cauterization by fire, instruct the patient beforehand to shave his hairs as those who cleanse them, until they are elongated and even; and if they prick below their roots, then you bind the patient's eyes with a bandage so that they are not hurt until the hairs have grown.
Then, when they have grown and are even, place the patient's head in your lap, and then mark on the eyelid of his eyes with a probe, with a mark which is according to the figure of a myrtle leaf, and let the beginning of the mark be near the hairs.
And then place a cotton pledget soaked in egg white or in gum arabic over the eye.
And then heat the cautery, of which this is the form.
And then cauterize over the figure which you have marked, little by little, in several times, until the surface of the skin, which is like a myrtle leaf, is completely burnt.
And a sign of the success of your work is that you see the eyelid of the eye already contracted and the hairs thereof raised from the puncture of the eye.
Then raise your hand and leave it for three days, and then place cotton with ointment over it until the scar is healed. And then treat that with ointment until it is healed.
But if something returns through the hairs near their origin and the eyelid is softened, then apply the cautery again over that, just as you did previously.
But if the hairs are beneath the eyelid, then cauterize it until it is raised to its natural place and is even, and the hairs do not prick the eye.
But cauterize with a burning medicine; this is to order the patient to pull out the hairs until they are elongated and even, and then a leaf-shaped plaster of cloth should be made like a myrtle leaf.
And then take known soap and quicklime, one ounce, or however much, and then mix those ingredients well, and do this quickly so that it does not get cold; and then spread this on the cloth which is made in the shape of a myrtle leaf, and place this on one or both eyes; and place under the eye cotton soaked in egg white, and the patient's head should be in your lap.
And place your finger on the medicine and press it a little and do not move it until the patient feels the bite of the medicine, for the bite is like fire.
And so when you perceive that he feels the bite, then leave the medicine and move it with your finger; then when the bite ceases, then remove the medicine and wash the eye with water; and then consider if you see that the eyelid is now raised as it is washed, avoid constriction with fire or incision, for then it is well; and if not, return to that medicine to the place where the medicine has not yet been applied and do not darken it until your operation is even and the eye is contracted.
And then place cotton with a bandage on it until the scab from the cauterization is eradicated, and then treat it with healing ointment or with another until it is healed.
And it is necessary for you, during your operation, to watch with vigilant diligence that nothing of the medicine falls into the eye, and if the eyelid in a few days is softened and some of the hairs stick to the eye, then repeat your medicine on that place of the eyelid which is softened, and precisely as you did at the beginning, and then cover it until it is healed.
And this is the form/method for myrtle leaf. (The sentence refers to a method using myrtle leaves, likely as a medicine.)
And know that the eyes of men are diversified according to their size and smallness, and therefore according to that is your contraction made.  (Meaning:  The treatment must be adapted to the size of the patient's eye.)
And the path of rectitude shall not be hidden from him who studies this art. (Meaning: The correct method will be clear to anyone who diligently studies this medical practice.)
Chapter 17.
Concerning the cauterization of a fistula that is in the lacrimal duct of the eye.
When you treat a fistula with what we have said in the divisions of diseases and your treatment does not succeed, then you must cauterize it in this manner: instruct the patient to place his head in your lap, and let a minister hold his head between your hands in such a way that his head is not moved or agitated.
Then place a cotton swab dipped in egg white or gum arabic on his eye.
And then heat the cautery, of which this is the shape:
which should be concave, like the shape of a reed or a vulture's feather, at the end with which the cautery is performed.
And if you wish, let it be penetrating to the other end. And if you wish, let it be pointed like a probe.
However, the concave one is better for your work.
Then press the fistula if it is open, and draw out the pus and dry it. And if it is not open, then open it and extract the rottenness from it.
Then place the cautery, which should be well ignited, over it, and hold your hand a little below the cautery, from the eye to the side of the nose, so that your hand does not burn or the patient is not disturbed, and then place the cautery on the hailstone of the eye and destroy it.
And so if at the beginning your cautery penetrates into the bone, it is good; and if not, then repeat the cautery once or twice, if necessary; and leave it like that for three days, and then place over it a compress with a bandage and around it with drying ointment until it is healed.
But if eleven days have passed and it is not healed, then place a sharp corrosive medicine on it until the bone is exposed and is scraped as is appropriate in its chapter.
And there is another method of cauterizing a fistula which some ancients said:  understand the location of the fistula and open it, and then place in that fissure a thin tube, which is shaped like this: And pour into it the quantity of one ounce of molten lead; and hold your hand with the tube with good retention, and let the patient not be moved so that the molten lead does not reach his eye; and it is necessary that you place on the patient's eye a compress soaked in egg white or in water, because the lead will burn the site of the fistula and heal it by a marvelous healing.
And if the fistula is healed with what we have said of the cautery and of the treatment, it is good; and if not, then it is necessary to administer a puncture of the nose and to reduce the fistula to the body of the nose as it will come to its proper place.
Chapter 18.
Concerning the cauterization of the fissure of the wells (likely referring to a type of wound or ulcer).
Many times fissures occur on the lips, and especially on the lips of children.
Therefore, if you treat those fissures with what we have said in the divisions and your treatment does not help, then ignite a small, knife-like cautery according to this form that is shown:
And let its concavity be according to the thinness of a knife.
Then carefully place that ignited cautery into those fissures until the cautery reaches the bottom of the fissures.
Then treat that with cerots until it is healed.
Chapter 19.
Concerning the cauterization of a fistula in the mouth.
When in the root of the uvula, or in the palate, or in the roots of the teeth, an abscess develops and then breaks, and then becomes chronic, and pus flows and a fistula is formed, and you treat it and the treatment is not effective, then you should ignite a cautery according to the size of the fistula.  Then place that ignited cautery into the opening of the fistula, holding it with your hand until the heated iron reaches the bottom of it; do this once or twice on the back of it; and then treat that with what we have said concerning treatment until it is healed.
And so, if the wound is closed and heals, it is good; but if not, then it is necessary to open the area and remove the corrupted bone, as will be explained in its chapter.
Chapter 20.
Concerning the cauterization of teeth and the softening of the gums.
When the gums are softened by moisture and the teeth are loose, and you treat them with medicines and it doesn't help, then place the patient's head in your lap, and then heat a cautery, the shape of which will be described later, in such a way that you place the small spoon over the tooth and quickly introduce the heated cautery into it, and hold it briefly until the patient feels the heat of the fire has reached the root of the tooth.
And then remove your hand, and then repeat the cauterization several times as needed.
And then let the patient fill their mouth with salt water and hold it for an hour, and then spit it out, because the loose tooth is fixed, the softened gum is tightened, and the corrupt moisture is dried up.
Chapter 21.
On the cauterization of toothache.
When toothache is due to coldness, or there is cold or a worm in it, and you cannot cure it with medicine, then cauterize it in one of two ways: either cauterize with a hot iron, or cauterize with fire.
Cauterization with a hot iron is done by taking a hot iron and heating it in a coal fire. Then take cotton and wrap it around the tip of the iron, and then dip it in boiling water, and quickly place it on the aching tooth until it cools.
And then repeat this several times until the heat of the fire reaches the root of the tooth.
And if you wish, dip wool or cotton in the aforementioned boiling water, and place that on the aching tooth, and place the heated iron on top of it until the iron reaches the bottom of the tooth's cavity.
However, cauterization with fire is done by using a small tube of bronze or iron, and there should be some thickness in the tube and the intensity of the fire should not reach the patient's mouth.
Then heat the cautery to the desired shape, and place it on the tooth and hold your hand there until the cautery cools; and do this several times because the pain will be relieved either that day or the next.
And it is necessary that, due to the impression of that cautery, the patient fill their mouth with good boiling water and hold it for an hour, and then spit it out; and this is the form of the cautery.
And cauterize with whichever extremity you wish, as is possible for you.
And this is the shape of the cannula:
Chapter 22.
Concerning the cauterization of extrophulos (likely referring to external swellings or eruptions).
When extrophulos are caused by phlegm and cold humors and are not responsive to digestion by medicines, and you wish to digest them lightly, then you ignite the cautery whose shape is as follows:  having two open ends so that the smoke escapes through one end of the cautery, and place this ignited cautery on that abscess once, and again if necessary, until it reaches the bottom of the abscess.
And if the abscess is small, then apply the cautery according to the size of the abscess, and then leave it for three days and apply a cloth soaked in butter over it until what the fire has burned is softened.
And then treat it with ointment and bandages until it is healed.
Chapter 23.
Concerning the cauterization of hoarseness and the constriction of the throat.
When humidities gather in the lung's passage, and especially when this is accompanied by coldness of constitution, then the patient should be evacuated initially with laxative medicines, and afterwards cauterize that area below the root of the throat in the constricted place.
And be careful not to reach the throat with the cautery, nor burn more than a little of its cartilage.
And cauterize that area with another cautery below the juncture of the neck, at the last vertebra. And his cauterization should be done with a nail, following the previous method.
And afterwards treat that with what was prescribed before until it is healed.
Chapter 24.
Concerning the cauterization of lung disease and cough.
When cough and lung disease are due to cold humors, and the patient has no fever or consumption [tuberculosis] and the disease is chronic, then cauterize him with two cauteries on the clavicle, in the places previously mentioned on the left and right; and with another cautery in the middle of the chest between the two nipples; and let the cautery be a nail according to the previous method.
And if you wish, let your cauterization be punctate with the cautery that is called a punctate cautery, the form of which precedes in the punctation of earache.
And let the points be close to those; and then treat it with the same things that have been mentioned before until it is healed.
And let the cautery have three prongs because cauterization is done with this: with one application you can make three cauteries according to this method:
Chapter 25.
Concerning the cauterization of the testicle, which is the head of the helper (presumably referring to the penis).
When the head of the helper (penis) is dislocated due to lubricating humors and is not fixed in the moment of its return from its dislocation until it is in its accustomed place to return, and then through a small movement it is dislocated again as it should be, as we have testified, then it is necessary that first you reduce the dislocation, and then the patient should be turned on his back or on his healthy side; and then raise the scrotum which is on the inner part of the testicle to the upper parts with the fingers of your left hand, if the joint is dislocated to the inner parts.
And then heat the cautery having two heads; and this is its form:
And then cauterize the scrotum until it penetrates from one side to the other; and the figure of the cauterization will then be of four cauterized points.
And sometimes it is adjusted according to this count, and therefore there are eight cauteries.
And then place on the cautery cooked porridges with salt, and then keep the patient at rest, and the limb should not be moved for some time until it is healed.
And if the dislocation is in the upper parts and this is done late, then cauterize over the muscle with a nail-shaped cautery or with many pointed cauteries, because the joint is strengthened and the humidity is expelled and the patient is healed.
Chapter 26.
Concerning the cauterization of the stomach.
When cold and many humors enter the stomach, exceeding its capacity and multiplying within it, and if you continue the treatments and do not resolve it, then the patient should lie supine, extend their hands and legs, and then cauterize it with three cauteries: one cautery below the feet, about the width of a finger, with a nail-shaped cautery, and with two other cauteries below on either side of that cautery, so that a triangular figure of cauteries is formed; and space them out so they do not touch to avoid festering.
And the depth of the cautery should be two-thirds the thickness of a finger.
And let the shape of the cautery be according to this form without addition. And if you wish, cauterize with a large cautery in the middle of the stomach according to this form; and this should be a circular cautery according to this form:  (This line indicates that diagrams or illustrations were present in the original text, showing different cautery shapes.)
And let the stomach be cauterized, paying attention to the area to be cauterized:  that is, mark points on the stomach with a probe to the desired extent, and then cauterize those points with the cautery; and then treat it with the previously described treatment until it is healed.
Chapter 27.
On the cauterization of a cold liver.
When pain arises in the liver due to coldness, humidity, or excessive flatulence, so that it is thrown from its normal constitution by superfluous egress, and the patient is not helped by what we have said, then the patient should be laid supine on his back, and three cauteries should be marked with a probe according to this form and this same size upon the liver, beneath the hypochondria, where the patient's lying down allows. (Again, this line refers to a diagram showing the placement of the cauteries).
And let the space between each cautery be according to the width of a finger, and let each cautery be according to the length of a straight finger.
And do not press too much with the cautery.
And if the amount of what is burned is half the size of a hazelnut, no more should be applied; and if the patient is standing on his feet; and if he is not standing, then let him be lying down, having already spread his thighs, and raising his arms.
And it is possible for you to cauterize these areas with a knife-shaped cautery, when you have subtlety and prudence in the art.
And beware that you do not proceed too much in the cauterization, and let the size of a whole hazelnut be cauterized so that the whole body is cauterized and it reaches the intestines, because the hazelnut here is small; and know this.
Chapter 28.
Concerning the perforation of a liver abscess with a cautery.
When an ulcer or abscess develops in the liver and you want to know if that abscess is in the liver flesh or in its tunic, then if it is in the liver flesh, the patient will experience heaviness and dull pain.
And if it is in the liver tunic, the pain is very sharp and sometimes it tires the doctors to cure it.
Therefore, the patient should be positioned on their side; then mark the location of the abscess with a probe; and then apply the cautery, which resembles a rake, the form of which was shown on the previous page. And cauterize with that cautery until the entire boil is consumed, until it reaches the pus, until blood escapes.
And then treat it with the treatment for other abscesses until it is healed.
And it is not fitting that this type of cauterization be used except by one whose study in the art of medicine is long and in whose hands many diseases have been treated;  but let someone with some experience sometimes dare this operation, however, let him leave it to us, it is better.
Chapter 29.
On the cauterization of pleurisy.
The ancients said that cauterization with the roots of aristolochia for cold pleurisy, according to this method, is effective, and it is this: that you take a long, dry root of aristolochia, as long as can be found, and of the thickness of a finger.
Then immerse it in oil and heat it in the fire, and then cauterize with a cautery in the place which is between the continuation of the clavicle and the neck; and with two small cauteries below the chin, slightly inclining towards the part below the beard, and with two cauteries in the area inclining between the fifth and sixth rib, inclining slightly towards the back; and with another cautery in the middle of the chest; and with another on the stomach; and with three cauteries on the back; and with one cautery in the place which is between the two shoulders, and with two cauteries on the two sides of the chest, below the cautery which is between the two shoulders.
And it is not necessary that you grasp the cautery with your hand, but rather let it be in the obvious and evident manner of the work. (or: ...but rather let it be handled in the clear and straightforward manner of the work).
And some ancients said that some men use a cautery of iron similar to a ray and ignite it, and place it in the area between the ribs, until it reaches the abscess and it is purged of the disease, as we have said in the case of an abscess of the liver.
But in this perforation with a cautery there is danger, because one can quickly cause death in the place, a fistula which is incurable.
Chapter 30.
Concerning/On the cauterization of the spleen.
When you treat the illness of the spleen with what we have said of the treatment in the division and your treatment is ineffective, then cauterization is appropriate in three ways, all of which are correct.  One is to make three or four cauteries lengthwise, according to the length of the spleen, following the pattern of the liver cauteries, the form of which has been previously described.
And let the distance between each cautery be the width of a finger or a little more, and the manner of cauterization should be the same as we described for the liver cauterization.
And do not press your hand against the cautery; and the patient should be lying on their side.
And another method of cauterization is to ignite the cautery with two points,  which procedure we described in the chapter on muscle dislocation, and elevate the rib which is in the area of the spleen where the patient's left side lies.
And your elevation, by which you raise the rib, should be along the length of the body, so that cauterizations are made along the width of the body.
Then insert the two ignited points deeply into that space so that with them you penetrate the rib on the other side.
And then withdraw the cautery; and thus four cauterizations have been made.
And if you wish, cauterize with a cautery having three points.
Then you should care for the cauterization until it has stopped discharging pus for many days, for this is more important than the other preceding causes in the healing.
Chapter 31.
Concerning the cauterization of a dropsical person.
Cauterization is not suitable for all cases of dropsy, but only in a specific type.
When you treat a dropsical patient with the methods of treatment that we have mentioned in the division, and your treatment is not effective, then you should cauterize them with four cauteries in a circle around the navel and with one cautery over the stomach, and with another cautery over the liver, and with another cautery over the spleen, and with two cauteries between the vertebrae of the back, and one cautery on the right foot, and with another cautery over the stomach. And the depth of the cauterization should be approximately equal to the thickness of a finger.
And then leave the cauterized wounds open so that they drain freely for a long time.
And do not remove the patient from treatment near the cautery with what is necessary for two intentions to be added to it, and it will be hastened to him with healing aid.  (This sentence is difficult to translate precisely because the phrasing is quite archaic and possibly uses medical terminology that is no longer current.  The gist is that the treatment should continue despite the cauterization, aiming for a speedy recovery.)
The shape of the cautery with which the abdomen is cauterized should be nail-shaped, as its form is described above; and that with which the back is cauterized should be olive-shaped, as its form is described previously.
Chapter 32.
On the cauterization of the feet and thighs.
When the feet are inflamed with dropsy and filled with yellowish water, it is necessary to cauterize the feet on the dorsal surface of the foot, in the space between the little toe and the ring finger. Raise your hand with the cautery and do not twist it; then raise your hand again, and do not completely withdraw it, because the yellowish water will flow out.
The cautery is according to this shape: Then make two cauteries on both thighs, and on each thigh a cautery should be made with the knife-like end of the cautery. And let the cautery be according to the length of the thigh; one below the knee and the other in the middle of the thigh; and two cauteries on each thigh.
And leave the wound open without treatment for a long time so that some water drains from it.
And then treat it with those things which we have mentioned.
Chapter 33.
Concerning the cauterization of the abdomen.
When the abdomen is cold and damp to the point that it weakens the vital functions – that is, the digestive and retentive functions which reside in the stomach and intestines – and this is treated with methods of healing that do not help, and sometimes the patient suffers, exhibiting a need for cautery, then cauterize it with a large cautery on the stomach as previously described in the cauterization of the stomach, with a circular cautery and with four small cauteries around the navel, using a small, nail-like cautery; and with cautery on the hypochondrium, either one large cautery or two.
And if sometimes the humors are excessive and the patient tolerates it, then cauterize it on the pubic bone and on the intestines, and quickly apply two cauteries near the stomach and near the groins, for this is a perfect cure, a help from which you will not err.
Chapter 34.
Concerning the cauterization of old hemorrhoids.
When there are old hemorrhoids by nature, or those of thick, cold humors or corrupt humors, and they are treated with what we have said in the division and your treatment is not effective, then cauterize with three small, triangular cauteries on the lower part of the sacrum, and with a cautery above the navel, placed as described twice.
And if you suspect that his stomach is cold and his food is not digested, and his face appears inflamed, then cauterize his stomach with a large cautery as previously described; and with one cautery on the liver, and with another cautery on his spleen using a nail-shaped cautery, and leave the cautery open for some time, and then treat him until he is healed.
Chapter 35.
Concerning the cauterization of swellings near their excision.
When you excise a swelling, then immediately apply a cautery that resembles a ray (or, a radiating cautery). Then insert that ignited cautery into the excised swelling, and keep your hand there until the cautery reaches the opening of the vein from which the blood flows.
And do this once or twice; for if the swellings are numerous, then cauterize each of them as we have recounted, and afterwards treat them with ointments until they are healed.
And if you cauterize with a large cautery on something, it is slower in helping.
Chapter 36.
Chapter 36. On the cauterization of fistulas that are formed in the lower parts of the body.
When nature does not obey the treatment which we have recommended in its place, and the patient is frightened by it, let it be healed with cautery.
Therefore, when someone has a fistula in the lower parts of the body, and it is old, running with pus and corrupt humors, then what is most appropriate is to probe it with a thin probe, and then ascertain the extent of its depth with the aforementioned probe.
Then ignite the cautery which is similar to a ray (or, perhaps, a 'rod'). And then insert that ignited cautery into this fistula, according to the extent to which the probe penetrated.
And repeatedly apply the cautery to it until those corrupt humors are burned away once or twice or three times, according to your assessment of necessity.
And beware of burning the nerves and veins; or if the fistula goes towards the body of the bladder or towards the body of the intestine, then beware of all those places; and do not do this unless the fistula is in a fleshy place and you think it is not penetrating (deeper vital structures).
And then treat the area until it is healed.
And if the wound is sealed, and the matter has been excised from it, and remains so for a long time, then know that it is entirely cured.
And if the matter has not been removed from it, then know that it is penetrating, or that the bone itself is corrupt, or that it comes from those causes which will be recalled in their place (in the later parts of the treatise).
Chapter 37.
On the cauterization of sores.
When in sores pain arises from cold or excessive windiness, and because of this the patient's body is weakened, then it is necessary that you cauterize that [area] over the sores with a cautery, over each sore with a nail-shaped cautery, of which the preparation was previously mentioned.
And quickly cauterize again a little lower, so that three linear cauterizations will result, and then they will be more efficacious in providing help.
Chapter 38.
On the cauterization of the bladder.
When weakness and softening occur in the bladder due to cold and humidity, such that the patient cannot retain urine, then cauterize that [area] in the lowest part above the bladder, where the hairs of the pubic region begin, and cauterize with one cautery on the right side, and with another on the left.
And let the length of each cautery be according to the size of the patient's finger; and cauterize that [area] with a cautery in the lowest part of the back, or with two cauteries if necessary.
And let the cautery be a nail-shaped cautery, as is customary/appropriate.
Chapter 39.
Concerning the cauterization of the breast.
When cold and humidity come to the breast, and because of this pregnancy is prevented, and her menses are corrupted, and their provocation is delayed, and pain occurs during their arrival, then it is necessary that the area be cauterized with three cauteries in a circle around the navel, as we have said in the cauterization of the bladder; and with a cautery above the lowest part of the back, or with two cauteries, and let the cautery be nail-shaped.
Chapter 40.
Concerning the cauterization of a dislocated hip.
When mucous humors are poured into the area of the hip, and are the cause of its displacement, and a sign of this is that the thigh is longer than the other when they are compared. And the location of the dislocation is found where it protrudes.
Then it is necessary that you cauterize the patient on the part of their hip with a circular cautery, after you have marked with a probe the circumference of the affected area as it is swollen, so that the affected area falls within the middle of the circle.
And let the cautery be of the kind described previously for the cauterization of the stomach.
And if this cautery is not at hand, then cauterize it with three cauteries using a large olive-shaped cautery.
And let the cautery be done according to the extent of the thickness of the entire limb; and then treat it until it is healed.
Chapter 41.
On the cauterization of the sciatic vein.
When pain comes in the hip area, and it is caused by cold and dampness, the patient is treated with what we have said and not with bloodletting, and this is antiquated, then you should purge the patient of thick humors with foul-smelling pills or with artificial or similar pills; and then cauterize it.
And the manner of cauterization in that case is according to two methods: either cauterization with burning medicines, or cauterization with fire.
Indeed, according to two known methods, one of which is that you cauterize the area of the patient's hip with three triangular cauteries according to this form; and make them of good depth. And let the space which is between each cautery be the quantity of the thickness of a finger, whether the cautery be olive-shaped or large.
But sometimes let the cautery be in the middle of the place, on the head of the hip, so that there are four cauteries.
And if you wish, cauterize with the circle whose form precedes in the cauterization of the hip dislocation, so that it is a continuous circle and burns the thickness of the whole buttock.
And this is the method of cauterization in sciatica when the pain is adherent to the hip and is not extended to the thigh.
But if it is extended to the thigh, then cauterize that with two cauteries on the thigh, on the place to which the patient points as being the location of pain; and with one cautery on the groin, four fingers somewhat below the left side.
And if the cautery is knife-like, let the depth of the cautery be according to the thickness of the buttock.
And if the patient indicates that the pain extends to the area near the toes, then cauterize there where indicated with a cautery in three or four points, or more if needed.
And if the patient indicates the pain to be below the buttock towards the thigh, then cauterize there with a knife-like cautery.
And be careful in all cauterization that you do not use the cautery so much as to burn nerves or cause great injury, and that because of this there is no harm or contraction in the patient.
And I have seen one and another of those whom I cauterized on the ankle and went too deep in the cauterization, and the leg was swollen until the tumor reached the foot, and the whole foot was perforated and corrupted. And then a very strong bowel movement happened, and then death.
And if the pain is in two places at once, cauterize each according to this manner.
And the wise men say that in the cauterization of the ankle, a cautery like this is the method: make a circle of iron whose circumference is half a palm; and let its opening be according to the thickness of a date pit, or a little less.
And within that circle let there be another, a third; and let the space which is between them be the quantity of a hazelnut; and let those circles be open on two sides; and let the length of those irons be a hazelnut or two hazelnuts, and make in those irons a properly prepared margin in the circles; and this is its form:
Then let it be heated in the fire until it glows red and throws off sparks, and then let it be placed on the ankle, the patient lying on their side. Therefore cauterize that with three round cauteries at once.
Then leave that for three days; then plaster it with a bandage and leave the wound open for many days; and then cure it with ointment until it is healed.
Says Albucasis: O, son, we have used this type of cautery little, because of the fear of looking at it, and because we have found few who dare look upon it.
But of the good cauteries to him who suffers them, and finds with it the place of it (the ailment).
But cauterize with adhering medicines, so that you make two circles having a perforated handle in which the hook of the iron door should fit; let the length of the walls in the height of them be two nuts or whatever those are.  (The last phrase is difficult to interpret precisely due to the archaic language and potentially imprecise measurement reference.)
And if the space which is between each is the quantity of the thickness of a finger; and let them be opened below and above, and let them contain themselves between them according to this form:
Then place the patient lying on their side over the affected part of the hip, and press your hand on the hip area; and then take warm water and pour it between the two circles, and the quality of that should be with the fire little by little, and hold that for the quantity of an hour, and let the patient suffer the biting and burning of it—for this causes a burning like fire—until the burning ceases.
Then raise your hand with the instrument and wipe the warm water from the entire hip with fresh water.
Then leave it for three days and put a bandage on it until the blackness of the burn is removed, and leave it for some days, and pus will drain from it; this is the final healing.
Then treat it with ointment until it is healed.
And if the pain extends to the hip or leg, make for him a bath that contains water according to how it is done for the hip similarly.
And this is the manner of hot water, and I have already written about it in the treatise on the rectification of medicines. Take alkali and quicklime, an equal part of each, and crush them and place them in a new pot, the bottom part of which is perforated with a small hole, according to the quantity that will enter the ray (presumably a type of instrument or container).
And place under the bottom of the pot another inverted pot, and pour over that alkali and quicklime fresh water which covers them by a finger's breadth; and after you compress them with your hand by good compression, and leave the pot to drip the sharp water into the inverted pot below.
And then gather all that water, and pour it over more fresh quicklime and alkali, for then it will be of a very strong sharpness, which is used in many medical operations and in cauterizing other limbs, because it acts like fire.
And some medicines with which it is also cauterized are,  for example,  verdigris and honey mixed with quicklime and soap in such a way that they are mixed together.
And Galien recounted from an ancient man the operation and cure with which pain in the hip and sciatic vein is cured, and greatly praised the effectiveness of it, and said that it had no need of another cure, and that it was healed at once as he recounted, for he quickly entered a bath and was already free from it.
And it is that there should be taken some green hellebore, and if green is not found, a fresh fig should be taken; and it should be well crushed with a little grease and placed on the hip where the pain is, or on the thigh, or on the leg, and bound on.
And it should be left on for three hours, or for as long as the patient feels a lessening of the burning.
Then put him in a bath, and when his body is reddened, expose him to the sun, for the pain ceases and he is healed.
And know that no one should use cautery with these medicines except after the evacuation of the body.
But Dioscorides said that when the varicose vein is cauterized with goat's dung, it will benefit him greatly; and let the cautery be applied in this manner: let wool be taken and soaked in old oil, and placed between the toes and between the ankle bones.
Then take dried goat dung and burn it until it becomes charcoal; and then place it on the wool and leave it until it is extinguished. Then repeat this, and do not cease doing this until the sensation of burning reaches the ankle and relieves the pain.
And this method of cautery is called cautery of  goats (or perhaps, more literally, "cow cautery," though the previous lines clearly specify goat dung).
Chapter 42.
On the cauterization of back pain.
Sometimes pain is in the back due to various causes, such as a fall or a blow, or excessive evacuation, and similar causes, due to the infusion of cold and humid matter.
And cautery is only suitable for that single type which is caused by the effusion of cold matter.
Therefore, after evacuation of the patient with purging pills and similar remedies,  make incisions on the back where the pain is, three lines according to its width, then mark with a cautery iron five cauterizations or more on each line, according to the patient's tolerance and their strength.
And let the cauterization be done with a pointed cautery.
And if you wish, cauterize with three or four cauteries with a nail-shaped cautery according to this form:
Chapter 43.
On cauterization at the beginning of gibbosity (or hunchback).
Often this illness befalls small children; and a sign of its beginning in children is that it occurs on their spine with elevation and movement.
And you find in the last vertebra of the back and neck that it begins to rise above the other vertebrae.
And so when you see this and want to prevent it, then cauterize that with a cautery that is circular according to this form: so that the cautery takes in all parts of the vertebra equally.
And if you wish, cauterize in the circumference of the vertebra with the pointed cautery two or three lines. And let the points be close to each other.
And then treat the area until it is healed with what we have said.
But beware that cautery is not administered in swelling that is caused by a spasm of the nerves.
Chapter 44.
Concerning the cauterization of gout and joint pain.
When joint pain is caused by cold humors which are infused into each member of the body, then when pain comes in the feet, it is customary for physicians to call this gout properly.
And so, if gout caused by cold is cured with a method of cure and the pains are not relieved, then cautery relieves them.
And it is that you cauterize that area for evacuation in the circumference of the joint of the foot with many cauteries.
And let the cautery be olive-shaped, of which this is the form:
And if it is necessary that a puncture be made on the surface of the foot, then do it with a pointed cautery. And if the pains ascend to the knees or other joints, and this often happens, then cauterize that area on each knee with three or four cauteries on each side with this olive-shaped cautery.
And if many cauteries are necessary, then cauterize the area, and do not press too hard with your hand and the cautery beforehand; let it only be around the thickness of a finger.
And if the pains rise to both knees, then apply the cautery which we have described in its chapter.
And if the pains are only in the hands, and it is called  (a type of) numbness, then puncture in the circle of the veins as they twist, puncture those two lines.
And if the pains remain in the fingers, then puncture in the circle of the veins on each finger and on the palm of the hand.
And if the pains rise near the elbows or muscles in a few days, then cauterize them in every part of the joints.
And do not neglect the patient's good regimen and the reception of medicines, for if good regimen is followed and the inflammation is evacuated with this cautery, they will be healed, God willing.
Chapter 45.
On the cauterization of fractures.
When a fracture occurs in the knee and the intestines protrude in front of the patella into the genital area, and this is beginning to happen, then you should order the patient to stop eating that day and use lenitive remedies so that the rupture descends from their abdomen.
Then support the patient between your hands on their back, and instruct them to hold their breath until the patella or intestines are expelled or appear.
Then, with your words and signs, gently return the rupture over the bone of the pubis, noting that the extremity should resemble a half-circle in the upper parts of the body.
Then heat the cautery, whose form is this:
until it is very red and throws off sparks. Then return the intestine or hernia to its cavity, and place your hand over the area so that the intestine does not protrude.
You have already opened the space between the patient's thighs and placed a cushion underneath; and let another servant be on their legs, and another on their feet, who should hold their hands.
Then place the cautery on that mark with your hand, holding the cautery straight, and hold it there until you feel the bone of the hip within the middle of the swelling; and repeat with it another time if you did not achieve it in the first attempt to reach the bone.
And observe carefully the position of the intestine during your cauterization, so that you do not burn the intestine, lest death or other great harm befall the patient.
And know that if you do not reach the bone with the cautery, do not continue your operation.
And it is necessary that the cautery for children be small, according to their size and measure.
Then care for the cauterized area for three days with a poultice until the burn scab is softened.
And then treat it with other ointments until it is healed.
And the patient should lie on their back for forty days until the area and wound are sealed/healed.
And it is necessary that you give him nourishment according to the length of his treatment, which will cleanse his belly, and that the intestine does not escape due to the effort of healing.
And then, when he wants to get up after about forty days, apply a properly made bandage, and keep it on for another forty days.
And let him be reduced in work and in the repletion of food and drink, and in vehement voice, for when he uses this regimen of complete healing he will be healed.
And I will describe the treatment of ruptures in other parts of the belly; and at the beginning, if you want them not to spread, then cauterize the rupture with a round cautery according to its size, and let that which is exuded from the cautery be like a third part of it; and then treat it with what we have said, and it is appropriate.
And some first said that the rupture should be cauterized with a triangular cautery according to this form, since it is marked with a probe:
and a line is placed which goes through the widest part of the rupture, and another line above it; and place your hand with a pointed cautery, but the first cautery is lighter and better.
Chapter 46.
On the cauterization of torsion.
When pain develops in some member because of a fall or a blow, and that pain persists for a long time and does not yield to treatment with medicines, then it is necessary to cauterize with a pointed cautery.
And let the cauterization of each member be according to its size and smallness, and its strength and weakness, and the location of the torsion and its pain.
Therefore, if it is healed by the first cauterization, it is good; and if not, then repeat the cauterization; for it is customary for such pains to be punctuated from one member to the next nearest one, so it is necessary to treat those with cauterization until the patient is healed.
Chapter 47.
On the cauterization of leprosy.
Lepers are sometimes treated with cautery with great benefit, especially if the type of leprosy is caused by putrefaction of phlegm and melancholy.
And so, if you wish to cauterize the leper, consider whether the leprosy is spreading, and if it is not cured by what we have said in the division, and if it persists, and you fear that the corruption will affect the whole body and its entire complexion, then cauterize it on the head with five cauteries: one in the middle of the head, and the second a little below, towards the forehead at the hairline; and the others on either side of the two horns; and one behind, on the nape of the neck or back of the head.
And finally, with your hand, press the cautery slightly inwards so that it makes a small impression on the bone, and the scabs are removed from it, so that the expulsion of thick vapors may be relieved from it; and cauterize over the spleen as needed.
And if the leprosy is already spread over the patient and is manifestly apparent, then you must cauterize it with those cauteries which we have mentioned on the head; and with a cautery on the tip of the nose, and with two cauteries on the two cheekbones, and with two cauteries on two vertebrae of the neck, and with six cauteries on the vertebrae of the back, and with one large one on the vertebrae near the buttocks, and one on the buttock, and with two on the hips, and one on each hip, and with two on the knees and one on each knee, and with two on the elbows, and with two on the muscles, and with two on the ankles of his feet; and cauterize it on all the joints of the fingers of the hands and feet, and on each heel of his feet, and on the wrists of his hands.
And beware of the nerves which are on the heel, that you do not burn them.
And sometimes it is cauterized with one cautery on the pubic bone and with another on the stomach opening, and another on the liver.
And know that the more closely placed the cauteries, the more beneficial and helpful; and know that the patient does not feel pain from the cautery, as he does from wounds, because his body is already numb.
And the cauteries should be large or small according to the limbs and joints, as is prescribed by the types of instruments.
And then treat the cautery with cooked barley flour mixed with honey and with other treatment until it is healed.
Chapter 48.
Concerning the cauterization of numbness.
When a limb is numb or asleep and has been treated with medicines, oils, and plasters, and is not healed, then cauterize that numb limb with cauteries according to the size or smallness of the limb.
And let your cautery penetrate the thickness of the skin a little. And then treat it with ointment until it is healed.
And sometimes some numbness is cauterized which extends to the hands and feet, and to the vertebrae of the back and near the origin of the nerves which move that limb, and the numbness is relieved.
But do not attempt this except one who is skilled in the anatomy of the limbs and the origin of the nerves moving the whole body.
Chapter 49.
Concerning the cauterization of albaras, which is morphea.
When albaras is chronic and you do not apply any medicinal ointments to it, then cauterize it with a hot cautery, a little according to the size of the affected area, until the whiteness and its color are relieved, and its color is changed.
Then treat it with flour of barley and lentils with rose oil and arnaglossa leaves, and with pigeon's blood or hen's blood, of each an equal part and all mixed together, and then apply a linen cloth over the area until it is healed.
Chapter 50.
Concerning the cauterization of cancer.
When cancer is beginning and you wish to remove it, then cauterize it with a circular cautery around its circumference, as it is swollen.
And the wise men say that it should be cauterized with a pointed cautery in the middle; but to me this is not advisable, because I fear that it will be ulcerated, and I have already seen this happen several times.
And it is more proper that it be cauterized around its circumference with a circle as we have said, or with many cauteries.
Chapter 51.
On the cauterization of swellings.
When a swelling is slow to mature, and this is due to the superfluity causing it, or to the age of the patient, for he is old and decrepit, with little blood, or because of the time, and you wish to hasten the maturation of the swelling; then cauterize around its circumference with many small, pointed cauteries; and then leave it, for it will hasten maturation.
But if you wish to perforate it with a cautery, then you heat the cautery, of which this is the form: and place it in the middle of the swelling until it penetrates the skin.
And if the cautery is in a lower place, so that the body of the arm may be relieved; and then treat it until it is healed.
Chapter 52.
On cauterization with a corrosive.
A corrosive is a corruption that moves in the limb, which corrodes it like fire consuming dry wood.
Therefore, if you see this corrosive in a place that has suffered cauterization with fire, then you immediately cauterize with very small nails, and large ones according to what is appropriate in the place where the corrosive is.
And then cauterize it completely until you eradicate all the corrosion and none of it remains.
And then leave it for three days, and place crushed sulfur mixed with oil on the cauterized areas until the scabs are completely eradicated and all the corruption is gone.
And then treat it with flesh-generating ointments.
But if after three days you see that healthy flesh has grown where there is no corruption, it is good; but if not, then repeat the cauterization on what remains in the corrupted places.
And corrosion is sometimes treated with a sharp medicine, for that serves in place of cauterization. But however, cauterization with fire is of more readily available help.
And I have already described the treatment of it with sharp medicine in the division, and therefore take that when you have need of it.
Chapter 53.
Of the cauterization of wounds and other similar things.
Many times a disease called a wound occurs in the parts below the foot, and it is a large, penetrating wound which injures the foot; and cauterization in these cases is done in two ways, that is, cauterization with fire and cauterization with hot water.
But cauterization with fire is that you heat the concave cautery resembling a vulture's beak, which should be made of iron according to the size of the wound in every part, and should be of fine edges.
Then place that heated instrument on the wound, and move your hand with the cautery in a circle around the wound until the cautery reaches the depth of the wound. And leave it there for three days until it begins to shed pus. Then plaster it with crushed wild mallow herbs mixed with salt, and leave the plaster on it for one night, for this will eradicate it from its roots.
Then treat the area with a flesh-generating ointment until it is healed.
And if it does not heal, and often appears on the surface of the body, especially on the hands and feet, then you must apply cautery with water to those areas. Take a small tube of bronze, iron, or vulture bone, and place it over the wound; then pour a small amount of hot water into the tube, and hold your hand, and rotate it with the pressure of your entire hand, pressing the edge of the tube into the root of the wound. The hot water will find its way to the root of the wound; let the patient endure the bite of the hot water for about an hour, and then remove it, for the wound with its roots will be eradicated.
And do this to those and then to the others until you have treated all of them that are in the body.
Then treat the sores, once the roots of the wounds are eradicated, with ointments that generate flesh.
Chapter 54.
Concerning the cauterization of tremor.
When someone experiences tremor due to cold in the nerves, or from a cold fever, or from a similar cause, then you should cauterize them with four or five cauteries on the vertebrae of the back, one cautery between each vertebra; and with a cautery on their feet, and on their stomach, with an olive-shaped cautery.
And their tremor will subside, and hasten the healing of the cold illness.
Chapter 55.
Concerning the cauterization of accidental swellings in the body.
When in the body there are swellings and pustules formed from thick, corrupted matter; then at the beginning, as it appears, it should be cauterized over the head of the fistula with a fine cautery with myrtle wood, whose extremity is extended with fire; or with a long root of eryngo; or with a lenticular cautery.
And sometimes the cautery is also suitable at the beginning of its expulsion, according to this manner; and they are not believed, and the superfluity is broken up by doing this, and heals from it.
However, it is necessary that this be done near evacuation with phlebotomy.
Chapter 56.
Chapter 56. On the cauterization of a blood flux accidental to an incision from an arrow.
Often there is a flux from an arrow wound which is incised through the wound, which comes out, or through the incision of abscesses or cautery of the limb, and then similarly, and it is difficult to stop that.
Therefore, when this happens to someone, then you press with your hand on the opening of the arrow wound, and place your finger on it, tightly pressing it many times until the flow of blood stops under your finger, and it does not come out.
Then put small and large olive cauteries in the fire, many in number, and blow on them until they are very hot.
Then take one of them, small or large depending on the location and the wound where the artery is broken,  quickly applying it to that vein after you have removed your finger, and hold the cautery there until that blood is stopped and restrained.
And if the blood is expelled from the opening of the artery when you remove your finger and apply the cautery, then quickly take another cautery from those which are prepared in the fire, and do not cease to do this one after another until the bleeding is stopped.
And be careful not to burn the nerve that is there, and that no other harm comes to the patient.
And know that when blood flows from the artery, it is not possible to stop it in those cases, especially when the artery is large, except in one of four ways: either with a cautery as we have said, or with extraction if it is not extracted, for when it is extracted the extremities are better burned and the bleeding is stopped, or that it be tied with thread or with a strong ligature, or that medicines whose virtue is to stop blood be applied to it; and they should be held in place with a compress with a decent constriction.
But that which administers a decent restriction with ligature and constriction with cloths or by application of cauterizing substances and the like, does not confer benefit except slowly.
But if this happens to someone and neither physician nor medicine is present, then gently place the index finger over the opening of that vein as we have said, and apply strong pressure until the blood is stopped from the main part of the wound, and the finger is not removed from the artery; and on the artery sprinkle very cold water until the blood is congealed and thickened; and then consider what need there is of cautery or medicine.
Of incisions and perforations and cupping and of phlebotomy and of wounds and their similars.
We have already discussed in the first chapter every illness in which cautery with fire and with burning medicine is appropriate, and its occasions and causes, and the necessary instruments with the forms of the cauteries; and I have ordered the chapters from the head to the feet.
And I will proceed in this chapter in the same manner, so that the one who seeks this will be relieved, then concerning that which he will have requested.
And before I begin this, it is necessary, son, that you learn that in this chapter there is fear, that which is in the first chapter on cauterization.
And because it is necessary that there be great caution in it, for in the operations which are in this chapter, many times there is evacuation which is with blood, with which life remains, because of the opening of a vein or incision on an abscess, or opening of a fistula, or purification of a wound, or extraction of an arrow, or incision of a stone, and their like. And with all those things are accompanied fear and trembling, and in the worst of them, death.
And I warn you that this should not befall you, in which there is hesitation, for sometimes it happens to you, the ways of men with many kinds of illnesses. And of them there is some who is angry with his illness and death is light for him, and this is because of the vehemence of what he finds in his illness, and because of the length of his illness, and with the illness is a fear which signifies death.
And of those there is one who gives you his wealth and says, you hoping with that for health, and his illness is pernicious.
Therefore it is not fitting that you consent to him who comes to you of whom this manner is; and your caution should be greater than covetousness and your greed; and do not presume anything about this except from certain knowledge which verifies this for you, and to which follows praiseworthy success.
And use in the cure of all your patients prognosis and indication of him to whom health is restored, for in that is to you help towards acquisition of fame and memory, of praise and glory.
O, sons, may God inspire in you his understanding and not hinder your direction and protection, for this is in his hand.
And I have ordered this chapter, distinguishing it by chapters as I preceded in the chapter on cauteries, from the care of the head to the feet, so that this which you ask for and of which you have need may be alleviated for you.
Chapter one.
Of the treatment of the water which is contained in the head of infants.
Know that this illness often happens to infants during childbirth and when the midwife squeezes the infant's head excessively.
And sometimes it happens due to a hidden cause which is unknown.
But I have only seen this illness in infants; and all those whom I saw died from it, and thus it is, in my view, a deadly affliction for them.
And I have seen that an infant whose head was filled with water, and his head was always thus enlarged until he could no longer support himself because of the size of his head, and moreover, the humidity increased until he died.
And this humidity is either accumulated between the skull and the bone, or it is accumulated under the bone on the scalp.
Because, in that case, if the humidity is between the skull and the bone and the abscess is small, then it is necessary that you make an incision in the middle of the head with a fissure in width, and let the length of the fissure be about two nuts so that the humidity flows out, and this is the form of the spatula:
And therefore, if the humidity is more increased and the abscess is larger, then there are two fissures in this manner:
And if the humidity is under the bone, the sign of it is that you see the sutures of the head opened on all sides and the water is squeezed out when you compress that with your hand on the inner parts, and this is not hidden from you. It is necessary that you make an incision in the middle of the head with three fissures in this manner:
And then extract all the humidity from the incision; and then tighten the fissures with cloths and feathers; and then bathe it from above with wine and oil until the fifth day, and then untie the bandage and treat the wound with tents and ointments, and bind the head evenly; and let the patient eat dry food with little humidity until the member is strengthened and healed.
And there is another method of incision, that you consider where the magnitude of the abscess and the collection of water appears, for sometimes it is more in the occiput, or in the front part, or on the right, or on the left; and therefore attend with the incision where the abscess and the repletion of water appear, and do it as best you can.
And observe that you do not cut the artery and that a flow of blood ensues and the patient dies from that flow of blood with evacuation of humidity.
Chapter 3. (or Second Chapter, depending on whether the numbering restarts with each major section or continues sequentially.)
When someone suffers from cataracts or rheum in the eyes or feet, and this is chronic, and medicinal treatments do not help, then the last resort is incision of those two arteries (likely referring to the arteries mentioned in the previous chapter, near the ears).
Therefore, when you wish to incise them, have the patient raise their head, and gently rub the area with a rough cloth so that the arteries appear.  Then, tighten the patient's neck with a cloth; and carefully observe where the vein pulsates; and the location of each, above the points near the ears, is compressed, and is thus hidden except in certain individuals.
Then mark the artery with a probe, and incise each one with a sharp lancet on each side, making an incision that reaches the bone, and this should be done across the width of the head.
And if you wish, insert the lancet under the artery and cut it at the incisions made above.
And let the length of the incision be about two fingers' breadth, for when a vein is incised, the blood will exit with a pulsatile flow, leaping out frequently.
But if the artery does not appear to the touch, then you must measure three fingers' width from the ear, and mark it with a probe, and cut down to the bone.
And the amount of blood to be let is about six ounces, and quickly let more or less, depending on the strength of the patient and the fullness of their artery.
And then examine the wound, and if any cause of the injury remains on the bone, then incise it so that a hot abscess does not develop.
Then bind the wound with feathers and linen bandages, and treat it with ointments until it is healed.
Chapter 3.
Concerning the extraction of arteries which are in the temples.
When someone suffers from chronic migraine or sharp headaches, due to acrimonious humors and a quality in the tissues of the temples, or a chronic and similar ailment, and it is treated with medical remedies and this does not help, then we must attempt in these illnesses the extraction of the arteries in the temples, or their cauterization as we have shown.
And the manner of the operation and extraction of these is that the patient shaves the hair which is on the temples; and locate the artery appearing in the temple, for it is shown to you by its pulse, and is hidden except in a few men because of the intensity of cold.
And if it is hidden from you, then the neck of the patient should be constricted with some cloth; and then rub the area with a rough cloth or warm the area with hot water until the artery appears to you manifestly. And then you take the spatula of which this is the form: And then you scrape the skin with this easily until you reach the artery; and then put in it a hook and extract it to the superior parts until you extract it from the skin and uncover it from the tunics which are below it, from every part.
But if the artery is subtle, then wrap it with the end of the hook, and then cut a part of it according to the amount by which its ends are lengthened and contracted, and there will be no flow of blood, because if they are not incised the blood will not flow at all.
And then evacuate from one to three ounces of blood.
And if the artery is large, then it is necessary that you tie it in two places with strong double silk thread or with cords at length, and do not let it putrefy before the consolidation of the wound and a flow of blood occurs.
And then incise the superfluity which is between the two ligatures; and do this at that time or at another time.
And if you wish, cauterize it with a cautery to the bone with a knife-shaped cautery until its ends are incised, and it will be in place of the same work.
And it is a better procedure unless the patient has a fever or is of a hot complexion; because cautery is among those things that help drying humors, and therefore it is better in this situation.
And it is necessary after the extraction of the arteries that you fill the place with old linen, and that powders are placed on it decently made, and then it should be treated with drying medicines causing the flesh to grow and with bandages until it is healed.
And if while you are operating another time, a flow of blood from the artery occurs, then you should take care to restrain that blood, either with a cautery, or by filling the place with linen, and press with your hand until the blood is restrained. And if none of those things are at your disposal, then place your finger on the place until the blood is congealed, and bathe the place with very cold water until the sharpness subsides, and it is constricted as needed.
And what is lighter in the extraction of an artery is that you cauterize the vein with this cautery having two blades, after you have marked the two places with a probe, and apply each, very hot, until they reach the bone and cut the vein in two places, so that what is between the extremities is elongated, because they are not entirely consolidated with this cautery.
And this is the form of the cautery:
And let the sharpness of the two blades be equal. However, if it has less sharpness than two knives, it is better, because if it is sharp like two knives it will approach each cold [presumably referring to a cold instrument or condition] and will not cut the flesh quickly.
Therefore, since in those [instruments] there is some thickness, the heat of the fire is retained in them and the flesh is cut lightly.
And this method is better in every respect and gentler.
And let the space which is between the two blades be the amount of the thickness of a finger.
Chapter four.
Chapter Four: On the treatment of sharp and acidic tears of the eyes.
When there are acidic tears, and it is the flow from those veins which are on the head's surface, and you find no cause for treatment in medicine, and sometimes the patient's face reddens and they feel in their forehead a crawling, as if it were the crawling of ants, and their eyes are swollen, moist, so that their hairs are stuck together, and the eyelids are inflamed by the acridity of the tears, the ancients were skillful in the treatment of these cases, and they called that treatment *spassa*.
And it is that you command the patient to shave the hairs which are on his forehead, and then incise three fissures in the forehead, equally distant according to the length of the forehead. And if the length of the fissure reaches two fingers: one fissure should be equidistant from the length of the nose in the middle of the forehead, and the second according to the length of a little movement of the muscles which are in the lacrimal duct, and the third on the other side.
And guard yourself from the incision of the arteries which are on both sides, and lengthen your hand from the continuation of both jaws. And if the space of each incision is the amount of three adjusted fingers.
And if you have a piece of prepared sponge or very dry cloths with which to dry the blood.
And then insert a spatula with two sharp ends, of which this is the form of its incision: which is from the part of the temples to the second incision. Excoriate with that [tool/instrument] the entire area which is between the two incisions, with the [surgical] knife which is above the bone, and then do this from the middle incision to the second incision. And then remove that spatula and insert into the first incision again another instrument which is called a curette, sharp on one side and not sharp on the other.
And place the sharp edge of that [instrument] against the flesh attached to the bone, and the blunt edge against the bone, and push it until it reaches the middle fissure, and sever with it all the vessels that descend from the head to the eyes.
But let the incision be continued to that part of the bone, and then do this in the middle fissure to the other fissure.
And after a quantity of blood has flowed, press the places of the congealed blood clots.
And then place in each fissure a pledget of old linen, and put on them powders soaked in wine and oil and vinegar, and see that a hot abscess does not develop.
And on the third day, untie the bandage and administer a large infusion of warm or lukewarm water, and then treat it with basilicon ointment with rose oil and others until the wounds are healed.
Chapter 5.
Concerning the treatment of tears caused by cataracts and descending to the eyes from the inner parts of the head.
When someone experiences acute and persistent cataracts, and the patient's eyes appear small and sunken, and their vision is weakened, and the eyelids are ulcerated and their skin falls away, and there is sharp, persistent pain in the forehead and consequent sneezing, then know from these symptoms that the matter and cataracts come from many veins originating in the inner parts.
And the best treatment in such cases is this: order the patient to shave their forehead, and then incise a fissure in the middle of the forehead, a small one in width (and begin the incision from the left temple to the right temple; and let the incision be between the bones; and extend your hand from the temples which are damaged through chewing), until the bone is uncovered.
Dry all the blood with a sponge or a dry cloth and then fill the space between the two lips of the incision with old cotton or linen cloths. And then bind it above with powders soaked in wine and oil so that a hot abscess does not develop.
And when you unbind it and see that the abscess has diminished, then you should scrape the bone until new flesh begins to grow there, and then treat it with a drying regimen that will cause the flesh to grow, such as if you take two parts of wheat flour and four parts of colophony and mix them, and an emplaster is made from them and applied to these wounds to promote the growth of new flesh.
Chapter 6.
Concerning the treatment of that which falls into the ears.
Every cause that falls into the ears is one of four types, for it is either a mineral stone or something similar to stone, such as iron and glass, or it is from a plant such as a thistle or bean, or it is a fluid substance such as water and sour wine and things like them, or some animal.
And therefore, when a stone falls into the ear or another similar cause among those things which do not adhere to or grow in the ear, and you place the ear in the sun, and if you see the stone, then instill into it some violet oil or sesame oil, and then proceed with its extraction, and induce sneezing with a suitable remedy, and obstruct the nostrils before the onset of sneezing. And then place some pieces of cloth or wool around the ear, and pull the ear upwards, for many times it is expelled by these means.
And if it is not expelled, then proceed with its extraction using the instrument called a slender, epicyclic probe, of which this is the form:
And if it is expelled with the probe, it is good; and if not, then proceed with its extraction using a thin hook with little curvature.
And therefore, if it is not expelled by this, then make a small tube of brass and insert the end of the tube into the opening of the ear, and seal around the tube with wax and softened oil so that nothing is open except the tube. And then extract it with your breath with strong suction, for many times this has been accomplished as we have recounted.
But if it is not expelled in this manner, then take a small amount of lit tinder or a similar preparation used for catching birds, and place it on the end of a thin rod, and then carefully wrap a suitable cotton around that. And then carefully insert that into the opening of the ear with ease, and then dry the ear of its moisture.
And therefore, if it is not expelled by all the methods which we have recounted, then you should consider cutting it out before it develops into a hot abscess or spasm.
And the manner of cutting it out is that you first bleed the patient from the cephalic vein and extract the blood according to their strength, and then hold the ear between your hands and turn the ear upwards, and make a small incision at the root of the ear, above the cartilage, in a well-prepared area. And let the incision be crescent-shaped until the stone is reached; and, when the stone is found, remove it if you can with appropriate instruments; and then immediately close the incision with speed, and treat it until it is healed.
And if the cause lodged in the ear is a growth of fat that is swollen, then administer its cure and extraction; but if it does not respond to such treatment, then take finely powdered litharge according to this method: and apply it to the excision of that growth which has fallen into the ear.
And do not do this when you think that it is already moistened by the vapor of the ear, and apply it in small amounts, and then remove it with tweezers or a fine instrument, or with an incision as we have said, for its extraction is thereby eased.
But if water has entered the ear, the patient should use sneezing initially, and fill his ear with some old cotton, and lie down on the ear in which the water is, and if it is expelled by this, it is good; and if not, then take several heated pebbles or beans according to the length of the finger, and warm them slightly in the fire, and the patient inserts one of these into the opening of his ear and jumps on one foot on that side and strikes with another stone upon the stone which is inside the ear. Therefore do not cease this with the stone until all the water is expelled.
Therefore do not cease this with the stone until all the water is expelled. And the water will be expelled in this way: you take some paper or tow, and put one end of it in the ear and hold the other end to a fire until the greater part of it is burned.
Then put in more tow and do this several times until all the water is expelled, and remove it with a cannula as was said above of the extracting stone.
But in the extraction of a creature entering that ear, if it is small, like a louse or similar, treat it as we have said in the division; but if it is large, which appears to the judgment of the eye, then administer its extraction with forceps and hooks, and the cause of this is easier than all the other causes which fall into the ear.
But in the extraction of a worm generated in the ear, when you treat it with what we have said in the division and in the treatise on distillations and your treatment does not work, then you must expose the ear to the sun.
And then, if any cause of the worms appears, then extract it with forceps or with fine hooks; but if no cause appears, then take a cannula narrow below and wide above, of which this is the form: And introduce the narrow end into the ear according to the amount the patient can tolerate; and then suck with it strongly, and do this many times until all the worms are expelled.
But if it does not obey you in this way, then you should fill and close the opening of the cannula with wax as we have said; then administer distillations which the ancients have already proven in the treatment of worms, and you will find this in the treatise on distillations.
And let your pouring, with which you pour the medicinal oils into the ear, be with this instrument, of which this is the form: And make it of silver or bronze, narrow below, in which there is a small hole, and flat above.
And then let it be such that it pushes what is in the concavity of the cannula outwards where it will be necessary. And if you wish, take a ray [possibly referring to a thin, rod-like instrument] and wrap its end decently with cotton, and then pour oil into the concavity of the ear, or the juice of some herb, or whatever you want of these medicines into the cannula — and that is in the ear — and then insert the ray with cotton on top and press with your hand that with moderate compression until the oil is expelled into the concavity of the hearing and the patient feels the oil inside.
And what is poured into the ear should be warmed a little by fire. And be careful that what you distill into the ear is not too cold, for ear medicines do not tolerate that.
Chapter 7.
On the treatment of ear obstruction.
Sometimes children are born without perforated ears, and this also happens in some adults, an obstruction in the ear canal due to a wound or a growth of flesh within; and this obstruction sometimes occurs in the inner part of the ear canal, which does not allow hearing, and sometimes in the outer parts.
And that which occurs in the inner part, which does not allow hearing, is in most cases difficult to heal.
And in that case where hearing is possible, you should expose the patient's ear to the sun and examine it. And then, if you see an apparent obstruction, open it with a fine spatula, of which this is the form:
If its end is narrow, one side being sharp and the other not; and the spatula should be two finger-widths wide so that it does not injure the ear.
And so if the obstruction is due to flesh grown in the ear or its canal, then take thin hooks and cut away that fleshy growth forcefully until all the flesh is removed.
And if the obstruction is in the vestibule of the ear, then take a fine, thin probe and heat it slightly with fire, and then place it into the ear canal.
And then if you have felt an obstruction with which the patient experiences difficulty, due to impaired hearing, force the obstruction out gently; and be careful not to injure the nerves of the ear.
Then place in the ear a linen cloth, according to the size of the opening, which you have wrapped in Egyptian ointment; and do this for several days until you are sure of the healing of the wound; or take a wick and soak it in warm water, and sprinkle crushed  [herb/powder - the word is unclear] on it and use it; and if you see the ear is already abscessed, then you must remove the wick and replace it with another wick that you will wrap in a cerate made with rose oil, until the abscess is completely drained; and then treat it until it is healed.
But if bleeding occurs, then submerge a sponge or cloth in cold water and place it on the ear, and use the other treatment which stops the bleeding, which is described in the treatise on distillation.
Chapter 8.
Concerning the treatment of a stye which develops on the eyelids.
Styes which develop on the eyelids are sometimes moist, sometimes dry.
Therefore it is necessary that you hold them with forceps or with an awl, and incise them with a spatula from their roots, and afterwards place a poultice on the incised areas.
But if pain with bleeding occurs, then cauterize them with a thin, lentil-shaped cautery.
And the best cauterization is near the incisions, and often they return when some cause remains from their roots; and when they are cauterized with fire, those roots are burned and do not return.
Chapter 9.
Treatment of swelling that comes to the eyelids of the eyes.
Often there appears on the eyelids of the eyes some growth which resembles a swelling in its firmness and hardness, and because of its swelling it is called [a swelling/tumor].
And it is an accumulation of thick humidity in the eyelid, below and above.
Therefore, the operation on them is that you should consider then if the swelling originates in a way that it appears from the eyelid and is spread to every part; and its cause is light.
Then make an incision on it in width, and then peel it off from every part easily until it is removed, and then lift it with tweezers and cut it off.
And if the lesion is large, then you should close it with sutures; and treat it until it is healed.
And if it is small, it will not harm you because the ointment heals it and causes it to granulate (heal by forming new tissue).
And if the growth is leaning towards the inner parts of the eyelid from the inner surface, then lift the eyelid and lift the growth with tweezers, without needing to make an incision, and press it from all sides, and if the eyelid is lengthened by the incision, this does no harm in any case.
Then, after the incision, wash the eye with salt water; and treat the area with a healing agent until it is healed.
Chapter 10.
Concerning the treatment of a stye on the eyelid above the eye.
A stye is a swelling which is generated in the membranes of the upper eyelid, and more frequently in children, it irritates their eyes and causes them to become inflamed; and they cannot look at the brightness of the sun because tears gather in them.
And therefore you see them lying on their faces all the time, and sleeping on their faces; and the lower eyelids, below their eyebrows, are moist, showing inflammation, and the imminent appearance of a stye is in the eye; and when you press the area with your fingers, you feel the stye within.
And one method of operation is that the patient rests their head in your lap, and you place a cloth between them and yourself, and make a circle of it according to the size needed to encompass the whole stye, and place that over the stye and press with your fingers all around so that the stye is contained in the center of the circle, and then, in the center of that swelling, make a cut with a lancet, creating a fissure, but let the fissure be no larger than the incision made in bloodletting.
But in the beginning it is necessary that you incise the skin completely until you reach the stye, because in most cases the stye is excised through an incision, according to the form of a white swelling.
Then extract it with cloths which you have wrapped around your fingers at the edges and roll it between your right and left hand until it is removed.
And be careful not to go too deep with the incision so that with the lancet you do not reach the eye and injure it.
But if the stye does not appear at the beginning of the incision, then go a little deeper into the incision gently until you reach the stye; and then extract it as we have said; and then soak cloths in wine and vinegar and apply them to the area, and press them with powders.
And some people crush salt and place it in the cavity of the incision so that it dries up the remaining moisture.
And then care for it until it is healed.
But if a hot abscess occurs at the site, then treat it with soothing plasters until it is healed.
Chapter 11.
Concerning the various ways of touching the eye.
When in the eyelids of the eyes, growths appear under the natural hairs and are hardened, then these harm the eye and cause various illnesses such as continual tears and softening of the eyelids and membrane, until this causes destruction of the eye, which is called a touch-infection of the eye.  It is cured in four ways: either by cautery with fire; or with a sharp medicine as previously stated in the chapter on cautery; or the touch-infection is treated by incision and suture; or by canes, as I shall explain.
And therefore it is necessary that you place the patient's head in your lap; then turn the eyelid of the eye with your left hand, and if it is turned, good; and if not, introduce a needle into that part where there is a swelling beneath the eyelid, and push the needle with the swelling upwards, and this should be — near the margin of the eyelid where the hairs grow — near the hairs, and pull the swelling towards the upper parts with the eyelid, and turn it with the ray (presumably a surgical instrument, perhaps similar to a speculum).
And then make an incision in the inner part of the eyelid beneath the hardened hairs with a sharp instrument from the larger lacrimal duct to the smaller lacrimal duct; and then remove the swelling and place small pieces of cotton or cloth under the eyelid, and then sew up the eyelid with thread, and let it be like the shape of a myrtle leaf.
However, the shape should be according to the amount of elevation of the eyelid, for this varies in people, for some it is necessary that a large amount of the eyelid be incised, according to the extent to which the eyelid is softened.
And then make an incision with the sharp instrument along the two lines which you have sewn, beginning from the larger lacrimal duct to the smaller lacrimal duct. And if your incision is near the natural hairs, like the thickness of a king's (presumably a reference to a specific size or type of needle or instrument).
And then place the hook in one of the two angles of the carbuncle, and then excise the whole of it, and then join the two lips of the wound with glue or fine wool thread, and wipe away the blood, and stick what superfluous matter remains of the carbuncle to the two eyebrows with some sticky substance, if you wish to do so, and if not, do not worry.
And then leave the suture of the threads for three or four days, and then treat it.
And if you wish, leave the wound without a suture, and treat it with something that dries and constricts, because the eyelid is raised by the sealing of the wound and its union; but suture is better.  Therefore the ancients advised this.
However, let there be diligence in the patient's care, and it is a good operation, and let there be no fear in it.
And there is another way to treat it, which is to mark on the eyelid a figure like a myrtle leaf, and then raise the eyelid with three separate and joined hooks according to this form:
But if this is not possible, to hold the hooks, and this is not suitable, then take a needle on which there is thread and place it in the middle of the figure, and introduce the other thread near the larger tear duct, and the second thread near the smaller tear duct, and adjust the threads between your fingers with equality, and then with those, with equal elevation, raise the entire area on which it is marked as we have recounted.
And then join the two lips of the wound with a suture, and treat it until it is healed.
But if an abscess occurs near your incision or fissure, treat that abscess with a plaster and similar things, and with ointments.
And sometimes it happens to the eyelid that its hairs are inverted; then it is necessary that you use on it what we have said about incision; however, suture in each case is more skillful/artificial.
To splint with canes is according to this form: and it is that you turn back the eyelid and split the growth that is within, as I have recounted; and then skillfully make two thin canes or splints whose length is according to the length of the eyelid and whose width is less than the width of the eyelid. And you have already incised at the ends of each part, where you have the threads.
Then carefully add [something] over the excess of the eyelid's skin, and bind the canes to each part with a strong ligature, and leave it for some days, for the growth, through the binding, will die and dry up and rot until it falls off by itself.
But if it is delayed, then break it with forceps, and then treat the wound until it is healed.
Then, when it is solidified, the eyelid is raised and the hairs do not sting.
And this is the form of the two canes which you will make according to this form: and let it have the quantity of length and width neither more nor less.
Chapter 12.
Chapter 12. Of the elevation of stinging hairs in the eye with a needle when the hair is hard.
When there are unnatural, hard, rough, and stinging hairs in the eyes, then the operation is that you take a fine needle, and place on it a fine silken thread, and then adjust its ends, tying each in a very subtle manner. And let the length of the threads be the quantity of a palm.
And then you prepare two other fine threads underneath, and tie their ends if you wish.
And then have the patient place their head in your lap, and let it be near the sun so that your work is illuminated, for it is a subtle and delicate operation.
And then insert the needle into the root of the offending hair, which needs to be removed, and make it penetrate the eyelid quickly until you extract it above the natural hair.
And then pull the hair upwards and insert it into the  *alixati* (likely a solution or ointment – the exact meaning requires further context), and let there be one, two, or three hairs, and no more.
And then pull your hand with that until the hair is removed along with the *alixolati* from the eyelid, along with the natural hair.
But if the *alixalati* is pulled and the hair is not removed, you will pull the *alixalati* downwards with the thread that you have composed with it, until the *alixalati* is pulled out from the wound above.
And examine it with the vision of your eye, for then you will remove the *alixalati* and the thread, and clean each and close the eye, and let it be closed for two or three days, until the hair adheres to its place and good flesh grows over it.
And if the hair is shorter, then you attach a long hair from the natural hairs, and it is elevated with that, or you let it be until it is lengthened by some space, and then you elevate it.
Chapter 13.
Concerning the treatment of a stye which appears on the upper eyelid.
When a stye appears in the eye, and it is a contraction of the eyelid when it is contracted upwards, or to the right or left side, due to poor consolidation of a wound or incision or cautery, and it is called *leporina* (harelip-like), and this *ahecrati* (likely a variant of 'hacreati' meaning stye or related eye condition) is either natural or accidental, and is caused by the consolidation of a wound or incision or cautery, or by similar poorly healed conditions.
The manner of the operation is that you incise that consolidation and separate its lips, and place between them a small piece of linen cloth, and bind them until they are healed.
And it is not fitting that you use treatments which dry or constrict; for if you do this, the stye will return worse than it was before.
Use on it things that soften, such as fenugreek, and bathe it with the water in which mallow and its seeds are boiled, or with diachylon ointment, which should be liquefied with some oil, and immerse the linen cloth in it, and treat it with that.
And the treasure of your treatment is that you ensure, by every means, that it is not consolidated in a way different from its original form.
And this operation which we have described is nothing but a correction of the stye so that it does not return to its former state.
Chapter 14.
Of the treatment of a stye which is formed on the lower eyelid.
This stye which forms on the lower eyelid, which is truly called a stye; and it has a natural cause, or an accidental one.
But an accidental one is caused by a wound, or by a cut, or by cautery, or by similar things.
And the method of its operation is that you take a needle with double thread, and insert it into the flesh, passing it from the left lachrymal gland to the right lachrymal gland, until the thread reaches both ends of the flesh.
Then extend the flesh upwards with the needle and sew it with the needle, and incise it with a wide spatula. And then if the shape of the eyelid returns as it should be, it is good; and if not, take a splint and place it in the slit, and with it reshape the eyelid, and make the two incisions in the edge of the lower eyelid.
And let the ends of the two incisions be two angles of the incision which you have made until they meet, and let an angle be made of them so that when they are joined together, their shape is made.
And this shape is a Greek letter: lambda (Λ).
Then oppose the flesh to that (amount) which is the width of the sharp lower eyelid, so that it may be the eyelid.  (This is a difficult sentence due to the archaic phrasing and somewhat unclear reference; it likely refers to precisely aligning the incised flesh to restore the eyelid's natural shape and width).
And then join the separated parts and sew them with wool thread; and then treat them with what we have said of emollient medicines and poultices until it is healed.
And if it is raised by a fissure, suture, or cautery, then it is necessary that you make a flat incision on the skin of the eyelid according to what has been previously described. And then separate with a poultice between two lips as we have said.
In summary of the discourse on the treatment of an abscess, whether above or below, let the operation proceed according to the preparation of the abscess, and that is in the form of many varieties.
And the skilled artisan always prepares instruments in every possible way so that he can restore the figure to its natural form, or close to it, and the patient according to what suits him in the operation and instruments in the best dispositions.
Chapter 15.
Chapter 15. Of the adhesion of the eyelid to the conjunctiva or to the cornea.
When this consolidation happens to many men such that the upper eyelid is adhered to the white of the eye, and its natural movement and function are impeded, then you must introduce the tip of a probe under the eyelid and lift it up, or spread it with an unguent.
And then you incise the adhesion with a fine spatula, which should not be sharply pointed, but rather slightly blunt, so that the patient is not disturbed during the operation, and ensure that the spatula does not injure the eye with its sharpness.
And let your incision gently separate that adhesion until the eyelid is returned to its natural form and the adhesion is completely healed.
Then you apply salt water to the eye to wash it; or distil into it some acacia dissolved in water.
Then separate the eyelid from the eye with a small, smooth instrument, and place wool soaked in egg white on the eye.  Then, on the third day, use consolidative remedies until it is healed.
Chapter 16.
Concerning the incision of the nail and the fleshy eminence of the tear ducts.
Know that a nail is of two types, for it is either nervous, and is similar to hard, thin horn; or it is non-nervous, similar to a congealed white humidity, which, when the iron touches it, or when it is forced to be removed with tweezers, is cut off and the tweezers are not inserted into it.
And both types begin only from the larger tear duct, until it grows little by little, covering the vision and preventing light and the movement of the eye.
But the manner of operating in its incision is that the patient places his head in your lap, and then open his eyes, and raise the eyelid with your hand, and then grasp the nail with tweezers of little breadth and extend it towards the upper parts. Then take a needle and insert into it a horsehair, or ox hair, or cow hair, or similar, or strong thread, or double the end of the needle little by little and insert it into the middle of the nail, and penetrate it with the needle, and tie the nail with thread; and extend it to the upper parts, and scrape with the hair the side of the nail which obscures the pupil. And thus you follow it with the hair into the back of it.
And then you incise the remainder at the root of the tear duct with a fine spatula or with small scissors, and leave the natural flesh of the tear duct so that by the incision of it there is no continuous flow of tears.
And sometimes the nail, with the tweezers alone extended or with thread, as we have said, and then it should be scraped with a lion spatula, of which this is the form:
And be careful that with the spatula you do not touch the cornea and that a rupture occurs in it, and that the pupil is perforated.
Then, into the wound, put a little crushed salt or a poultice made of linseed, and leave that in until the next day; and then treat it with what is necessary until it is healed.
And if the nail is not sensitive and you cannot insert the needle, nor is it embedded with the tweezers, then many times this type of nail is cured with medicines, and is healed as I have recounted in the division (chapter/section).
And if you want to incise it, then you open the wound of the patient and take a fine lion spatula of sharpened iron according to this form: with subtlety/precision. And if you see that it is rarefied and is congested and festering in that root, then distill from your still into the wound a poultice made of linseed or with rue or with crushed salt, and plug the wound until the next day.
And then repeat the operation on it until all that is there is removed, unless on the contrary a hot abscess forms in the wound, for then you leave it be, and treat first the abscess until it is healed.
And then repeat your operation on it with reason until it is healed.
The eminence of the lachrymal flesh, if noticeable in the wound as a great impediment, should be suspended with hooks; and incise it on one side, and do not extend the incision so that you do not cut the flow of tears.
And then distill into the lachrymal duct a poultice of rue and linseed until it is healed.
Chapter 17.
Of the incision of a carbuncle and of that which is born of flesh fastened in the wound.
Sometimes in the eyes of some, red flesh is grown, and it is over-raised until it covers the pupil, or approaches or presses on the eyelids, and strongly quickly compresses the eyelids to the outer parts and is similar to a rose of a balustrade.
But the operation in it is that the patient puts his head on your lap; and then open the eyes of that one and collect all that flesh with instruments convenient for this, and hold it with forceps or with scissors; and then incise the flesh at the beginning until all is finished with the lancet, and guard yourself from the eye that you do not injure it during your operation.
And let your incision with which you incise those be with a spatula, which we have recommended in the incision of the nail, or with small scissors with which the hair is collected, according to how the form of it will come in this chapter.
Then when your incision is completed and all that flesh is removed, then fill the eye with crushed salt, or distill into it red powder similar to that of corrosive medicines, and place on the outside of the eye a bandage with egg white until it is secured from a hot abscess.
And if some cause of inflammation remains and hot blood is observed, and you fear a hot abscess, then leave the eye and treat that abscess with what will cure that abscess, and then repeat on it with an operation until it is healed, and similarly do in the fleshy excrescence which happens in the eye of this kind.
However, you should avoid any treatment of the fragile eye by natural or accidental means, operating with iron, and do not put your hand to any of these operations until you see that the limb is able to endure that operation.
Chapter 18.
Concerning the collection of pus in the eye.
Pus is red veins which are swollen on the eye and prohibit the proper operation, and they weaken the eye over many days.
Therefore, it is necessary at the beginning that you consider if the eye in which there is pus is strong and has no other disease than pus; then you may collect that pus.
And it is that you command the patient to place his head in your lap, and then suspend those veins with one or two onces, according to your judgment; and let that ounce be of subtle doubling according to this form:
or two ounces gradually in one piece according to this form:
And then let those veins be collected with fine forceps, with subtlety, and wipe away the blood little by little, until you see those veins be removed from the eye and be healed.
And be careful that you do not injure the eye with the ends of the spatula; and if your operation is in the midday before the sun, and you are very firm in your operation that you do not incise except those veins.
And when you have finished, then you distill into the eye verdigris or vinegar so that with its acidity it corrodes what is removed from the eyelid.
But if that is not possible for you, collect everything at that time, and then you plaster everything with something that relieves his pain, and leave it for some days until his pain is calmed and the danger of a hot abscess is averted.
And then repeat on him according to the same manner until he is healed.
And this is the form of the forceps:
Chapter 19.
Of the reduction of dislocations in the nose.
When you treat a dislocation with cautery or with a sharp, burning medicine, as previously described, and it is not healed, then there is no generation in it, but rather you should make an incision on the abscess before its maturation, and extract all the humidity that is within it and the pus, until the bone is exposed.
And then, when the bone is exposed and you see corruption or blackness in it, then you scrape it with an instrument of which this is the form:
And it is named a rasp, and it should be made of Indian iron, and its head should be round, like a chisel, which should be pointed by filing or sharpened by subtle pointing (as is shown in the following form).
And place that [rasp] on the corrupted part of the bone, and then rotate it between your fingers, and press your hand little by little until you know that the corruption is scraped away.
And this should be done several times, and then restore the place with drying and styptic substances.
Then, if the place is consolidated and good flesh has grown there and the body of the pus is separated and remains for forty days, and it is not renewed and is not festering and no accident happens to it, then you will know that it is healed.
And if not, then there is no other remedy but to reduce the fissure to the shape of the nose, and according to this manner:  it is that you uncover the underlying bone with an iron instrument or with a sharp medicine, and when the bone is uncovered, then you take a trephine according to this form:
Let the extremity of the iron trephine be triangular, and its shaft be thin and tapered to the extremity, like this.
And then place that [trephine] on the bone, and let it be near the lacrimal bone; and extend your hand a little from the eye, and then rotate your hand with the trephine until it penetrates the whole bone, and the patient will feel it because they will feel the wind escaping when you have your hand there.
Then restore the place with styptic and drying medicines, as I have taught you.
Then, when the flesh grows and the place is hardened, the matter which flowed to the outside parts returns to the nose, therefore this is easier on the patient.
Chapter 20.
Of the reduction of the protrusion of the eye.
When the eye protrudes in its entirety and is not injured by a wound or diminution, then you should let the patient lie down, and then you should follow that, and then you should place cupping glasses on the neck without scarification and suction for good suction; and then place on the eye an ointment which is made from acacia, aloe, incense, and sarcocolla, and then firmly bind the plaster on the eye with many powders.
And the manner of the powders is that you take many linen cloths, and each cloth should be folded into four layers; and make many of those.
And then place those one on top of the other according to the amount that the eye needs. And then bind tightly over those with a strong cloth with a firm constriction; and repeat the cupping with suction without scarification; and then remove the cupping glasses and leave the eye bound day and night.
But if meanwhile the ligament is softened, then it must be very tightly bound.
And then remove the bandage during the day and night, as we have said.
And if at times the eye is already reduced, it is good; and if not, then repeat the plaster with the powders and the binding and the cupping until it is healed.
Chapter 21.
Concerning the incision of the eminence of the uvea tunic. (or, Of the incision of the prominence of the uveal coat)
When there is a rupture in the uvea tunic, and it protrudes and extends beyond the eyelids like a grape, and the person's appearance is marred by it, and you wish to incise it, then the operation is as we have recounted: that you insert the needle into the root of the uvea from the lower part to the upper part, and then place another needle with double thread from the lachrymal side (near the tear duct), and make that penetrate and leave the first needle according to its placement; and then incise the place of the double thread and lift with that the part of the uvea in the circumference of the needle, and tighten that firmly.
And then remove the needle and place on the eye wool infused in egg white and leave it until the thread with the uvea falls away.
And then treat the eye with something that will strengthen it until the wound is healed.
And sometimes gather from all sides with a circle of cloth around the eye a large prominent swelling, and then it should be perforated with a fine instrument that reaches the pupil of the eye, and lets out the albuminous moisture, and the eye descends and enters immediately.
And then compress it until it is healed.
Chapter 22.
Concerning the treatment of [a condition, likely an eye condition, given the preceding context.  "Alconati" is likely a corrupted or archaic word needing further context for precise translation.]
This illness, which is called alconati, is nothing but a fluid that is located in the eye, similar to descending water, but it is not that [i.e., it's not simply water].
But the method of working on it is that you make the patient sit on a prepared and straight chair, and then take his head in your hands on both sides and manipulate it until you see the fluid come to the lower parts, and then let it be dried and not descend, and let the light be obstructed, and the patient see things as he used to see them.
And if it does not descend downwards, know that it is water.
But if the descent of the fluid is not prepared with what we have said, then make the patient sit between your hands and then take a fine spatula and use it on the pannicle, wiping a little below the junction of the conjunctiva with the cornea in the limbus (towards the empty space), until the fluid is expelled.
Then, when it is expelled, you instill warm water into the eye in which you have mixed honey, or water in which you have previously boiled fenugreek and honey.
And then let it be treated with the other remedies until it is healed.
Chapter 22.
On the treatment of the watery discharge from the eye.
We have already discussed the types of watery eye discharge in the division and which ones it is appropriate to pierce with a lancet, then that which according to health. (This sentence is grammatically awkward and could be improved with more context.  A more natural translation might be: "We have already described the types of watery eye discharge and which should be lanced, and those that will heal on their own.")
Then it is necessary that you make the patient sit between your hands on a square [seat/cushion] and tie his healthy eye, a very tight bandage.
And then place your left hand near the eyelid of his eye, if the eye which has the water is the left eye; or with your right hand, if the eye is the right one.
And then with your right hand take an almond, if the eye is left; or with your left hand, if the eye is right.
And then place the end of the almond near the cornea, along the width of the iris, in the white of the eye on the side of the smaller lachrymal duct, and then gently press the almond and roll your hand with it.
And then penetrate the white of the eye and feel that the almond has already reached the empty cause. (This likely means "feel that the almond has reached the source of the problem"  or something similar. The phrase "causa vueda" is unclear and could refer to a cavity or a void related to the ailment.)
And it should be that the distance of the almond to the pupil is the measure of the space which is from the pupil to the end of the blackness, which is the cornea; for you will see with that pupil through the vision of the eye by the clarity of the cornea.
And then place the almond into the place where the water is, and then you pull it down once, then another, and then if the water descends immediately, then the patient will see that upon which his sight falls immediately, and the almond in his eye. (This refers to a procedure involving removing fluid from the eye.  "Aygua" means water, likely referring to accumulated fluid.)
And then rest a little; then if the water has descended, then you should remove it another time before the almond is expelled.
And then when it is dried and does not descend, then you extract the almond with ease, and gently rotate it with your hand, and then dissolve a little clear rock salt in the water and wash the eye inside with it; and then place outside the eye cotton or tow or wool infused in rose oil and egg white and bind the eye with this.
But we and those of our time place over that a compress of egg white.
And if the almond does not obey you upon entering the eye because of its hardness—for there are some men whose eyes are very hard—then it is necessary that you take the spatula which is called an alberid, of which this is the form:
Then perforate that conjunctiva with it, and do not thrust your hand into the hole, but only make a subtle pathway for the almond.
And then introduce the almond as we have said.
And for the completion of your work, let a comfortably made bed be prepared for the patient, in which he may sleep on his back in a dark room, and let all movement be forbidden.
And position him in such a way that his body is aligned, and he does not turn his head to the right or left at all.
And let the healing be according to its disposition within the third day.
And then release him from that dark room and gradually expose him to light, and show him some things, and then return to the treatment within the seventh day.
And it is not fitting that you do this at the hour of the treatments or immediately after the infusion. Furthermore, it is necessary that you avoid this because the water might easily rise through great and vehement observation/attention.
But if a hot abscess occurs, then it is necessary that you open the wound before the seventh day, and rectify it with something that reduces the abscess.
Then you cover his eyes and place over his face a cloth by which his sight is governed, keeping him for some days in the darkest room.
And then let him be moved from that room gradually and gradually converse about his affairs.
And know that in a cataract, the pupil is not excused from some visions, and then you should be bold about the operation.
And it has come to us from some of those who are at Artach, and someone said that they make fire in Ayrac, a perforated vessel, by which water is sucked.
However, I have not seen anyone in our land who has perfected this, nor have I read this in any of the books of the ancients; and it is possible that this is new.
And these are the forms of the kinds of magdaans so that he who is ignorant of them may know them:
And they should be made of bronze or iron properly, and their ends should be with this triangulated subtlety, the sharp end like that which is the form.
Chapter 24.
On the treatment of rotting flesh in the nose.
When various fleshy growths appear in the nose, some of which resemble a very small scorpion, or a polyp fish; and this illness is called polyp because it resembles that represented fish. And from it is cancerous flesh, spreading, of a dark color; and from it is flesh like a lion, not of dark color.
Therefore, in the case of these fleshy growths that are not malignant or cancerous, you should make the patient sit between your hands and place them in the sun, and open their nostrils, and gently prick those growths with your lancet. Then extract it to the outside, and then incise what you have grasped of those growths with a sharp, thin spatula from one side until you know that all the flesh has been removed; if any part remains from which excision is possible, then scrape it with one of the subtle instruments easily until nothing remains. But if it bleeds profusely or a hot, malignant abscess forms, then apply what is necessary; or if it is one of the malignant abscesses, then you should incise and cauterize it until the bleeding is stopped and all the cavities are cleared.
Then, after the incision, apply sharp vinegar and water, or just vinegar, to the nose. But if the nose is open and no moisture flows into the palate, then you know that it is healed.
But if the moisture does not penetrate as it should, then you know that inside there is rotten flesh in the upper bones of the nose to which excision has not reached.
Therefore, it is necessary to introduce a linen thread into the nostrils, which should be of some thickness, and tie knots on it; and place between each knot the amount of a finger or less, and then insert the thread into the nostrils with a rod or other suitable instrument.
And after this has been done, let it draw its fragrance until it reaches the nasal passages and comes out over the throat, for often children at school do something similar, and it is an easy thing for one who wishes to do it.
Then place the two ends of the thread, one end outside the nose and the other remaining inside the nose, and then apply sawdust with the knots that are on the thread, and do this until you know that the flesh is now together with the knots of the thread.
And then remove the thread, and apply to the nose, near the extraction of the blood, a poultice, and do this for three days or more until the ointment corrodes all that is rotten flesh.
And finally, at the end of the treatment, place a lead cannula in the nose for several days until it is healed.
But if you need a more drying cure, use that one.
And this is the form of the instrument, a head-purging device, with which oils and medicines are distilled into the nostrils:
And make this of silver or brass, which should resemble a small open lamp, like a small bowl, and the spout similarly.
And if you wish, make a closed cannula like a tube, and the cannula of the head-purging instrument should be flat and open; it should have a handle at the back, with which you hold it when you heat the oil or water, or whatever you want of the juices and extractable substances.
Chapter 25.
Of nasal polyps in the extremities of the nose.
Many times a polyp grows in the extremities of the nose, and it is magnified and increased in a few days to the point that it is easily visible.
And for this it is necessary that you incise it at the beginning of its appearance, and eradicate it completely. And then apply to the area either a cautery or a burning medicine which will stay in its place.
But if its incision is delayed until it is magnified, then consider if it is hardened, firm, of dark color and with little sensation; then do not touch it with iron, for it is a cancerous ulcer; for many times he who incises this ulcer suffers great harm from it, the one who had it.
And if the ulcer is of a clear appearance and not of dark color, and sometimes incision is possible in all of it, then evacuate the patient and incise it without fear, and cure the area with something that dries and constricts until it is healed.
Chapter 26.
Concerning the suturing of the nose, lips, and ear when their continuity is broken by a wound or similar injury.
Know that when a solution of continuity occurs in one of these cartilages, you should have little confidence in that operation except in certain men.
Therefore, when such a thing happens to someone, consider if it is a fresh wound with its own blood, and then you join the two lips of the wound with suture, and then cure it until it is healed.
And if the lips of the solution of continuity are already separated, and each is healed, then it is necessary that you scarify each part of their apparent skin until blood comes out. Then join the two lips with suture and tighten them, and on them sprinkle dragon's blood and finely ground egg shells, and place over the powder a piece of diachylon plaster, or some other of the consolidating plasters, and leave it bound for two or three days, then unbind it and change the plaster and leave it until the threads are themselves cut, and then cure with ointment until it is healed.
But the manner of the suture is that you close the solution of continuity either with needles, as we have recounted in the suture of the belly, or close the solution of continuity with thread, as has been made known to you.
Chapter 27.
Of the extraction of those things which come into the two lips in the inner parts.
Many times there appear in the inner parts of the lips of many men certain hard abscesses resembling goose fat, and some of them are smaller and some are larger.
Therefore it is necessary that you turn back the lips and separate each of those hardnesses on all sides, and afterwards fill the place of the excision with crushed sage until the blood is restrained, and afterwards it should be washed with sharp vinegar and the place treated with something that is styptic, until it is healed.
Chapter 28.
Concerning the incision of the flesh adhered to the gums.
Often a growth appears on the gum, flesh that adheres, which the ancients called an albulus; then it is necessary that you lift that with a hook or hold it with forceps and incise it down to its root, and let the serum or blood flow.
And afterwards place on the area crushed sage or other styptic or drying powders.
And if that flesh returns, then incise it a second time, and cauterize it, for afterwards the cautery will prevent it from returning.
Chapter 29.
Concerning the treatment of teeth with iron.
When on the surface of the teeth, both the inner and outer parts, and between the gums, rough, sticky, and sometimes blackened scabs are attached, and they become citrine or green, so that corruption extends to the gum, and the teeth become loose.
And then it is necessary that you make the patient sit between your hands and place his head on your lap, and scrape the teeth on which those scabs and things resembling sand appear, until nothing of them remains, and do this to remove the blackness, the greenness, and the others until they are cleaned.
Then, if what was in those [teeth] at the beginning of the treatment is removed, it is good; and if not, then you repeat the treatment on those [teeth] on the next day and the second and the third until you arrive at the desired end.
And know that the teeth require many scrapers of diverse shapes and figures, according to what is prepared for your operation. And because the scraper with which the tooth is scraped on the inner part is different from the scraper with which it is scraped between the teeth according to other forms, these forms of scrapers should be prepared by you, which you will see immediately:
Chapter 30.
On the extraction of teeth.
That you cure the tooth of its pain with all skill and delay its extraction, for there is no cause that supplies its place when it is extracted, for it is a sublime substance, wherefore its extraction is excusable.
But when the patient is forced to have that tooth extracted, you must be firmly certain which is the painful tooth, for many times the pain deceives the patient and he thinks it is in a healthy tooth, and you extract that one, and then the pain does not cease until the sick and painful tooth is extracted, for we have already seen this through the operations of barbers.
Therefore, when you are certain which tooth is painful, and you know it well, then you must scarify around the tooth with a spatula in which there is some virtue, until it is dissolved from the tooth's gum on all sides, and then loosen it with your fingers, or with fine forceps, at first little by little until you loosen it completely.
And then apply strong, large forceps for good traction or firm grip, and place the patient's head between your knees so that you hold it well and it does not move, and then pull the tooth straight in such a way that you do not break it, nor cause the patient greater pain.
And then, if it is not dislodged, take one of those instruments and place it under the tooth on all sides easily, and force its removal as was done at the beginning.
But if the tooth is cracked or eroded, then you must fill that crack with cloth and tighten it with a thin, pointed instrument so that it is not broken at the time of your traction on it with forceps.
And you must open carefully with scarification around all parts of the gum and take great care that you do not break it and leave a part of it behind, which would return to the patient causing an injury worse than the initial pain.
And beware that you do not do what some ignorant barbers do in their haste and audacity regarding extraction, without administering what we have recommended; for many times they cause great illnesses in men which are more difficult to cure, and leave their roots all behind, or some of them, or extract them along with some bones from the jaw, as we have witnessed many times.
Then, after its extraction, the mouth should be washed with warm wine or sour wine with salt.
And if bleeding occurs from this, as often happens, then crush some amount of alum and sprinkle it on the wound, and if this alum does not work, cauterize.
The shape of the forceps and delicate tongs with which the tooth is initially grasped should be long in the gripping part, short in the handle, and thick, so that they do not bend when you have to work with them.
And let them be, as it were, of thick handle, so that when you tighten them they are not bent, [and] with short gripping ends.
And let them be made of Indian iron, carefully made with straight ends, and at the ends of these let there be teeth, of which the ones interlock with the others and tighten by strong compression; and sometimes the ends of these should be in the shape of the beak of a bird called a *ciconia* (that is, a stork), and they are of strong compression.
Chapter 31.
On the extraction of teeth and the removal of broken jawbones.
When you must extract a tooth that is broken and some portion remains, then you should place a cotton compress soaked in a softening agent on the area for one or two days until the area is softened; and then insert forceps, the ends of which are shaped like the beak of a bird called a *ciconia* or stork – the shape of forceps:
Their ends should be made internally like a file or rasp.
And if it does not yield to you thus with these forceps or pincers, then you should dig around the root and uncover all the flesh and insert the instrument called an *atali*, that is, a small lever, the shape of which is this:
And let it be of short length, somewhat thick, and not too thin, lest it break.
Therefore, if by this the root is extracted, good; and if not, help yourself with these other instruments, of which these are the shapes: the shape of the first instrument is a triangular end, which should have some thickness:
The shape of the second instrument is that it should be triangular and of a more slender end.
And you are already aided with this instrument having two hooks, of which this is approximately the following form: and with other instruments which precede in tooth extraction; for help is given with this instrument which resembles a large hook, and this is its form:
of the triangular, curved or short end, which should have some thickness, and not be bent so that it is not broken.
And know also that the instruments for molar teeth are similarly made to the other instruments.
But the wise and subtle artisan in the art finds for himself, according to what the operation and the diverse illnesses signify to him; for there are illnesses for which the ancients neither named nor devised a proper instrument, due to the forms of diverse species.
But if the bone of the jaw or of the other bones of the mouth is broken or injured, then it should be treated in its place with what is convenient for it from among the instruments and forceps which we have described in the extraction of tooth roots, and help yourself with a splint, of which this is the form:
And let there be some thickness in it little by little, and let it be tightened or held with the mouth so that it does not escape or flee until the bone is completely set; and then restore the place with medicines convenient for this.
But if there is a small rottenness in the bone, then scrape away that rottenness and its blackness, and treat it until it is healed.
Chapter 32.
Concerning the treatment of teeth that protrude above the others.
When teeth protrude beyond their natural alignment, their shape is flawed, and this is especially true for women, and most especially for venerable old women; therefore, you must consider: if a tooth is close to another tooth, and neither suture nor filing is possible, then extract it; but if it is not connected to another tooth, then you should incise it with an instrument of which this is the shape; and it resembles a boar's tusk and should be made of Indian iron with a very sharp tip.
And let your incision, with which you incise it, be done gradually over several days because of the hardness of the tooth, and so that no other teeth are damaged.
And if the protruding tooth is suitable for filing, then file it with an Indian iron file of this shape:
And let the entire file be of Indian iron and very carefully made; and let it have very fine points, like a file with which needles are made, with which the tooth is filed little by little over many days carefully, so that no other tooth is damaged or broken. Then smooth it at the end and polish it with some rasps.
And if it is a tooth of which a part is chipped and hurts the tongue, then it is necessary that you file it until the roughness of that fracture is removed and smoothed, and it is filled so that the tongue is not injured and speech is not impaired.
Chapter 33.
On the restoration of broken teeth with gold or silver wire.
When the front teeth suffer concussion and loosening from a blow or fall, and the patient cannot bite on what he eats, and you have treated this with styptic medicines, and your treatment has not been successful, then to prevent them from falling out, they should be fastened with gold wire and not silver, because silver turns green and becomes powdery after a few days, but gold never changes.
And let the wire be of such fineness and thickness as can fit between the teeth; and the method of binding is that you take the wire and pass double the length between two healthy teeth, then, making two turns of the wire between the broken teeth, whether one or more, until the wire reaches the healthy tooth on the other side. Then repeat the weaving back to the point where you began, and tighten with your hand gently and skillfully until it is firm.
And let your tightening, with which you fasten the wire, be such that it does not slip from the roots of the teeth.
Then cut off the superfluous ends of the wire with forceps or scissors, and smooth those ends at each location, and tuck them away and hide them between the healthy tooth and the damaged tooth, so that they do not injure the tongue. And then leave it thus tightly bound.
But if it is loosened or broken, tighten it or them with another wire in the same manner at all times.
And this is the form of the teeth and the method of straightening two healthy teeth and two damaged teeth, thus as you see them bound:
And when it is done that one or two teeth return to their proper places, and they have grown back as we have described, and that they remain fixed.
And only a good and skilled craftsman does this.
And sometimes some cow bone is adapted, and it is made from them in the form of a tooth, and it is placed in the place where the tooth is missing, and it is tightened as we have said, and it remains and serves in its place for a long time.
Chapter 34.
Of the incision of the ligament which occurs in the tongue and prevents speech.
This ligament which is under the tongue is sometimes natural, with which one is born, or accidental and occurs from a wound which has already healed.
And the operation is that you open the patient's mouth, their head being in your lap; and lift their tongue, and then incise that nervous ligament according to its width until the tongue is freed from its constraint.
But if in that area there is any hardness or knotting, and this is due to the healing of a wound, then you should make an incision and divide it along its width until you have cut the ligament and the knotting is dissolved.
And be careful that no fissure is made in the depth of the flesh and that you cut only superficially, so that a flow of blood does not occur.
And then wash the site of the incision with warm water or with sour wine or with cold water; and then place under the tongue a linen cloth; that is a kind of sponge which the patient should keep under their tongue every night so that it does not heal again.
But if bleeding occurs, place crushed vitriol on the area; but if the bleeding persists, then cauterize the area with a lancet-shaped cautery which is suitable for this. And then treat it with the other remedies until it is healed.
Chapter 35.
On the extraction of a ranula from under the tongue.
Sometimes an abscess resembling a small tumor occurs under the tongue, preventing the tongue from its natural function; and it is quickly enlarged until it fills the mouth.
And the operation is that you open the patient's mouth, sitting facing the sun, and examine the abscess.
And if you see it is dark or black in color, hard, and the patient feels no sensation in it, then do not touch it, for it is cancerous.
And if it is inclined towards white, and there is moisture in it, then place your hook there, and incise it with a fine spatula, and incise it completely; and if blood flows during your operation, then apply crushed vitriol on top until the bleeding is stopped.
Then return to your work until you have completed it, until it is washed with wine and salt; and treat it with the other appropriate treatment until it is healed.
Chapter 36.
Chapter 36. On the extraction of an abscess from both ears, and from that which is located in the throat, and of other abscesses.
When a goiter develops in the throat, these are glands that are gathered together like cotton, which protrude outwards and are called "two ears," and when you treat them with what we have said in the previous section and it is not healed, then consider if the abscess is hard, of a dark color, and insensitive to touch; then do not touch it with an iron instrument.
And if it is red and the root is large, then do not touch it with iron because of the flow of blood; rather, leave it until it matures, and then you will extract it, or it will break open by itself.
And if it is white, soft, and its root is thin, then it is something that should be incised.
And the operation is that you should consider, before your operation, whether the abscess has already matured completely through rest, or if it has diminished in some way; and then make the patient sit in front of the sun, with their head in your lap, and open their mouth.  The assistant, holding their hands, will press down on the patient's tongue using a very fine instrument, which is of this shape:
And it should be made of silver or bronze, and should be as thin as a knife.
Then, as you press the tongue with this and the abscess is shown to you, and you look at it carefully, then take an oncia [ounce, possibly referring to a type of surgical instrument or a measurement of ointment] and place it in the tonsil, and draw it outwards as much as you can. Furthermore, if you pull out some material from the membranes, then immediately incise it with an instrument of this shape:
Furthermore, if you pull out some material from the membranes, then immediately incise it with an instrument of this shape: and it resembles forceps, but its ends are curved, so that the opening of each is opposite the other, very sharp, which should be made of tempered iron.
But if this instrument is not at hand, then incise it with a spatula, of which this is the shape: And let it be sharp on one side, not sharp on the other.
And after you have incised one side, incise the other in the same manner, and immediately after the incision, let the patient gargle with cold water.
But if bleeding occurs, gargle with a decoction of pomegranate rind or myrtle leaves and similar astringent substances until the bleeding is stopped, and then treat it until it is healed.
And sometimes other abscesses appear in the throat besides those near the two ears, and incise those in the same way as I have said in the incision of the two sides equally.
And I once treated a woman with an abscess which had formed in her throat. This abscess was dark in color, relatively insensitive, and had already closed off her throat, so that the woman was breathing through a narrow passage.  I had already forbidden her to eat or drink water, and she would have died if she had lasted another day or two.
And the abscess had grown so much that it had created two channels through which it was discharging.
Therefore, I treated it with a fistula, and I inserted a probe into one of the openings and pulled it through. A large portion was extracted.  Then I incised the abscess from where it extended to the other opening and opened up its mouth, compressing her tongue. Then I placed the probe in the abscess.
And then I excised a large part of it, and only a little blood flowed from it. Therefore, the woman's throat was cleared, and she immediately began to drink water and then eat food.  I continued to incise the abscess many times over a long period, and another abscess formed in its place, which I incised until it was completely resolved.
Then I burned and cauterized her throat; this stopped the infection. Then I waited and did not know what God would do next about it.
Chapter 37.
Concerning the incision of a wen when it is abscessed.
When catarrh descends to the uvula, and it is abscessed and elongated, then it is called a perpendicular [abscess]; and if it is thick and round in the lower part, then it is called a boil.
But when it is treated with what we have said in the section, and your treatment does not work, and you see that the already existing abscess is small and subtle, then you must incise the one that is round and aggregated; and if it is long, and is bloody, of a dark color, and the patient feels no sensation, then you must delay the incision, for in that case there is danger for the patient.
And when you see it according to the manner I have described, in its whiteness and length, make the patient sit and press their tongue with an instrument which follows its shape, and then place the hook in the uvula and pull it down, and incise it with one of the two instruments which are described in the incision of the tonsils.
And you must not incise it except what is adjusted to the natural limit without addition, for if you incise more, you will impair their speech.
And after the incision, use what we have recommended in the incision of the tonsils, and treat it until it is healed.
But if the patient is frightened by the incision, you should use caution in cauterizing it without causing fear, and the method of cauterization is only with boiling water, and it is that you place the patient's head in your lap, and then press their tongue with the instrument which we have mentioned, and then take the boiling water which we have described in the chapter on cauterization, and apply it with that live coal, and apply it neither thickly nor thinly, and with that fill the concavity of the instrument of which this is the shape:
Let its extremity be a concavity in which the medicine is placed, like the concavity of a spoon, and place the instrument with the medicine on the uvula, and let the patient lie on their side so that the saliva or mucus from their mouth runs out due to the internal medicine, so that nothing of it descends into their throat and harms them.
And then take your hand with the medicine, and press it on the uvula for half an hour until you see it become blackened and dried by the action of the medicine.
And if you wish, take cotton and wrap it around the end of the spoon, and soak the cotton in the medicine, and insert the spoon with the cotton into a tube so that the cotton adheres to that tube, and do this as many times as necessary until you achieve what you want from the cauterization of the uvula, and then leave it until it dries and falls off after three or four days.
And if you need to repeat the medicine, repeat it, and after the cauterization, clean the area around the uvula with cotton soaked in vinegar, and cleanse with it what remains around it from the medicine, and wash it with cold water, and treat the outside with an embrocation, and the inside with gargles until it is healed.
And this method of treatment is safer than incision and less frightening.
Sometimes the uvula is cured with a method more subtle than cautery or incision, for it is cured with fumigation in this manner: take calamint, hyssop, origanum, rue, Arabic gum, chamomile, and similar herbs, and combine all these ingredients, or some of them, in a pot, and submerge them in sharp vinegar, and boil; and the pot should be well sealed with suitable clay, and in the middle of the pot there should be a hole, over which should be placed a concave instrument of brass, or made of silver or brass in this manner.
And insert the end into the patient's mouth so that the vapor rises to the uvula through the cannula, until the uvula is sufficiently fumigated.
And then repeat this many times until it is dry, and be careful not to perform this treatment at the beginning of the appearance of an abscess, for it would aggravate the abscess too much, and you should not do this, but rather cauterize the declaration of the abscess.
But if you do not have this instrument at hand, then take a reed and attach a hen's egg shell to the end of it, so that the patient's mouth is protected, because the eggshell prevents the vapor from burning the mouth.
And this treatment is salutary.
Chapter 38.
Concerning the extraction of thorns and that which adheres in the throat and other causes.
Many times something adheres in the throat, whether a fish bone or some other thing.
Then it is necessary that you extract that which of those things is apparent, upon which the eye falls, after you press the tongue with an instrument, in front of the light, so that to you is made clear that which is in the throat.
And that which does not appear and is hidden from you in the throat, it is necessary that you make the patient vomit before the food is digested in the stomach, for very quickly the cause attached to the throat will be expelled by vomit; or that the patient swallow a piece of turnip or lettuce root or a piece of dry bread; or take a piece of dry sea sponge, and tie that firmly with thread, and then let the patient swallow it, for when it arrives at the place where the thorns are and is extracted, then they are expelled. And moreover, take an eel, well tied with thread, and let it be inserted and quickly extracted; or take a leek and quickly insert it and quickly draw it out.
But if they are not expelled by those means which we have mentioned, then use a lead instrument according to this form:
And let it be thicker than a finger, and at its extremity let there be a concavity which you introduce into his throat with ease.
And he should have his head raised up, and be careful not to touch his throat bone, lest it harm him, and with that you push the bone or thorn, or that the physician does it with his hand.
But however, it is better that the patient himself inserts it, because of his knowledge of the location of the attached cause, and pushes downwards, and pulls his hand up with the instrument, all this according to the quantity that is prepared for him until it is expelled.
Chapter 39.
On the extraction of a leech attached to the throat.
When a leech is medicated with what we have said in the division of treatment with medicines and it does not work, then consider placing the patient's throat in the sun, after you have compressed their tongue with the instrument we have recommended to you.
Therefore, if you see the leech, extract it with a small hook or with gentle, careful movements.
And if it is not possible for you to extract it with that, then take a concave cannula and insert it into the patient's throat, and then place a heated iron in the concavity of the cannula, and do this as many times (until the leech is dead and detaches from the throat) and abstain the patient from water all that day.
Then take a vial full of cold water, and open his mouth into it, and wash the mouth with it; and do not swallow any of it and stir the water from time to time with your hand, for the leech immediately falls when it feels the water.
But if it is not expelled by what we have recommended, then fumigate the patient with cyprus or with asafoetida through the instrument we recommended for the fumigation of the uvula.
Do this, so that it will fall.
And another method of operation in the fumigation of it, is that you take a pot in which there are burning coals and the pot is covered with a lid in the middle of which is a hole, and the end of the instrument is fitted into that hole; and then direct the fumigation upwards; and let the patient put his mouth to the end of the cannula, and close his mouth so that the fumigation is not expelled until you know that the fumigation has reached the leech, for the leech will immediately fall.
And if it does not fall, then you repeat the fumigation many times, and restrain the patient from drinking, and eating salty things and garlic, and do not drink water, and thus it is necessary that with this regimen it will be expelled.
And this is the form of the instrument with which a leech is drawn from the throat when it is seen; and it is similar to forceps like this, except that there is some curvature in it: which is placed in the throat, and the end of it is similar to a stork's beak, which is hollow, in which there is a roughness of filing, so that, when it grasps something, it does not let go.
Chapter 40.
In which is the summary of the discourse on the appearance of abscesses and on their incision.
Abscesses are of many species, of many manners, according to the remembrance of them, of each one in this book.
And they are diverse in perforation and incision of them by two methods, of which one is by the species of abscesses in themselves; and by what we understand of the humors.
And the second method is according to the locations in which they occur in the body, for an abscess occurring in the head is different from an abscess occurring in the buttocks; and an abscess in a fleshy place is different from an abscess occurring in a joint; and each of them has its own judgment for operation.
And moreover, of abscesses, there are some which should not be perforated except near maturation of the pus in them or their completion.
There are other abscesses which should be opened when they are raw and not matured according to their completion, such as abscesses that are near the joints, because when an abscess is near a joint, its being is prolonged until it consumes what is in its circumference, and very quickly the ligaments or nerves of that joint are corrupted, wherefore a cause of contraction of that member is made; or it is an abscess near a principal member, and if you delay its perforation until it is matured, it will harm the principal member; or it is near the anus, therefore perforate that which is not mature; and it is not fitting to perforate it raw, with incomplete digestion, except that which is near the anus, so that its matter may not consume and be elongated to the inner parts of the anus, and a fistula be made, or that it be made in such a way that it may not heal. Moreover, you must know the time of perforation of the abscess, and this is when it is matured.
And know that it is matured when there is a lessening of the pain and the cessation of the fever, and also the diminution of the redness and of the pulsation, and the acuteness of the head of the abscess, and the other signs.
And because it is necessary that you know how to make the perforation fall in the place lowest on the abscess and from where the healing comes from the eminence.
And the perforation should always be along the length of the flesh or body, if the abscesses are in the parts of the hands or feet, and in the place of the tendons, of the cords of the nerves, of the arteries; and, lastly, in all equal places in which there is no reflection; for in those that are reflected, use perforation according to that member.
But when the abscess is in a fleshy place, then it is better that you leave the perforation of it until its digestion is confirmed according to what has been said; for if you perforate it before that, the course of its pus and much filth is prolonged, and quickly its lips are hardened and its depth increased.
But some abscesses are perforated according to the width of the flesh or body due to necessity, or according to what the member requires.
And it is necessary that you administer a small perforation in small abscesses, and in large abscesses a large and wide perforation, or many incisions, according to the diversity of the size of the abscesses.
And others are abscesses in which it is necessary that the point be curved and incised, when it is made like bread and is made in such a way that it is already ripe, like that which happens in cases of buboes and swellings.
And some of those are incised with a three-angled incision; and others are incised in the shape of a myrtle leaf, like the abscesses of the armpits.
And there are those in which a round incision and a crescent-shaped incision are administered, and similar ones.
But that which is not like the aforementioned superficial abscesses, you must perforate it with only a superficial or flat perforation.
And when the abscess is large and has collected much pus, you must perforate it and do not worry about extracting all the pus at once; having extracted a part of it, then compress the abscess until the next day, and then extract a larger part, and do this many times gradually until it is all expelled.
And especially if the patient is of weak constitution, or a pregnant woman, or a small child, or an elderly person in decrepitude, because the animal spirit is often dissolved with the egress of the pus, and the patient dies very quickly; and you open them.
Therefore, observe this chapter with great caution, and concerning your perforation in which you perforate these abscesses, you must clean the wounds and consider then if the wound of the abscess is small, or is a flat incision, then you apply to it lint or old cotton; and if the abscess is large, and the fissures of the perforation are many, then you must place a wick in each hole until they meet.
And if in the abscess a part of the skin is severed or you have hollowed it out in the circumference, then you must fill it with old cotton or thread made from linen cloth, as when you have extracted splinters or roots, without moisture; and bind it until the third day; and then proceed with this and treat it with the ointments that are necessary until it is healed.
But if a flow of blood occurs during your operation, then apply cold water and sour wine in which you dip a linen cloth, and place this over the place of the blood flow many times.
But if the flow of blood persists, then you must apply the regimen and treatment and powders which I have recounted in many places in this our book and division.
But if it is in winter, and the location of the abscess is a place of many nerves, then you should mix powders in warm wine and oil, and apply those to the areas.
And if it is in summer, and the areas are fleshy, then you should apply powders soaked in water and oil or with wine and oil, and all this should be cold until the third day, as we have said, and then you should open the abscess and clean it and apply to its treatment what is suitable for it until it is healed.
And this is what is necessary for the knowledge of the treatment of abscesses universally, but according to the way of distinction I have already spoken of each abscess and in what manner is the way of its treatment in particular chapters.
Chapter 41.
Concerning the incision of abscesses which occur in the back of the head.
In the back of the head, small abscesses are found, and these are a type of node which contains membranes that are attached to their surfaces; and their appearance is varied.
And they are suppurative, and those contain a humidity similar to slime. And some of them contain a humidity similar to pus, and resembling them; and some of them are stony, hard.
And in the incision of all, and in the extraction of those, there is no fear, since the extraction of those does not cause contrary harm.
And the operation in the incision of these is that you probe them with an instrument whose shape is appropriate for this, which is called a probe, until you know what they contain.
For if what it contains is humidity, then incise it with a longitudinal incision, a superficial incision according to this form:
And begin the incision from line B to line G.  Then, when the humidity is evacuated, you scrape that which contained the humidity, and do not leave any of it at all, for often it returns if any of it remains.
And then immerse cotton in Egyptian ointment, if it is available, and if not, in water and salt; and fill the wound with this and leave it there until the next day, for with this you corrode all that is left of that membrane.
And then repeat applying cotton with Egyptian ointment a second and third time if needed, until you are confident that no part of that membrane remains; then cure the wound with ointment until it is healed.
And if the abscess contains fatty nodules, then you incise it according to this form: with an incision having the form of a cross, and insert forceps between the two lips of the incision and scrape it from all sides, and exert your strength in extracting the tunic which contains it.
But if the artery opposes you, then do what I recounted to you first.
And similarly proceed in a petrified abscess, in incision and cure as we have told you; and the incision on a petrified abscess is easier, because it has little blood and little humidity.
And sometimes some of these abscesses are in the head of some men, in which there is no humidity at all; the reason is that I incised an abscess on the head of an old woman and found the abscess like a deaf, rough, white stone, which could not be crushed, and if anyone were struck with it, it would hurt them.
But in other accidental abscesses in the head besides this, this is not the chapter, such as the abscesses that occur on the heads of children and behind the roots of the ears; however, the incision of all these should be a superficial incision.
And make the perforation of those from the lowest part of them so that the body may be relieved of the pus in the lowest parts.
And then treat those with what is suitable for that treatment.
Chapter 42.
Chapter 42. Of the incision of scrofulas which happen in the neck.
Many times these abscesses occur in the neck and in the armpits and in the groin; and sometimes they happen in other parts of the body.
And those which happen in the neck, and many are engendered amongst them, and every scrofula of these is within its own proper tunic, and thus, as in the nodes and abscesses of the head, as we have recounted.
And the species of these scrofulas are many, for of these some are stony, and of these some contain humidity, and of these some are malignant which do not obey cure.
Therefore, in that which you see of good disposition in the touching, of which the color of that which is manifest is near to the color of the flesh, and is softened on every part, and is not annexed to the nerves of the neck, nor to the veins, nor to the artery, and is not deep, it behooves you to incise that with a superficial incision from the upper part to the lower part of the body, from line G to line B, and scrape that from every part, and extend the lips of the flesh with hooks, or with many hooks if you have need of them, as we have said in the abscesses of the head, and extract that little by little.
And it is most cautious that the vein or nerve not be incised.
And let the spatula not be very sharp, lest it injure you with the incision, or that it disturb the patient, and that you incise that which it is not necessary to incise; for if you should incise a vein or artery, and prohibit you from your operation, then place on the wound powdered vitriol or other powders which stop the flow of blood, and bind the wound, and leave it until the acuteness of the abscess subsides and the wound is softened and begins to be purulent. When the blood is cut off.
Then return to your operation until you have completed it.
And then examine with your index finger if there is any cause of other small scrofulas, then incise those and cleanse them.
And if there is a large vein at the root of the scrofula, it is necessary then that you not incise that scrofula at its root. Beforehand, it is necessary that you tie it with strong doubled thread and that you leave it until it falls off by itself without harm.
Then fill the wound with old linen which you have already submerged in Egyptian ointment, and then cure it.
And if you incise the whole scrofula, then it is necessary that you adjust the two lips of the wound and sew it immediately as soon as there is no remaining superfluity.
But if you see that there remains superfluity because of the size of the scrofula, it is necessary that you intend to incise the root of it, and extract it and administer suture and what is said [above].
And for those scrofulas that contain humidity, perforate it with a superficial perforation where the place of its maturation appears to you, and place the perforation so that it is the lowest part of the body, as we have said.
Then administer a perforation, perhaps with ointment and similar things, so that it corrodes what remains of the corruption. And then, when you see the wound to be already cleansed, then you cure it with a flesh-generating ointment until it is healed.
Chapter 43.
Concerning the incision of the abscess of the accident within the throat.
The ancients described this incision in the abscess, but no one in our land has been seen to have performed it.
And this is the inscription/writing of the discourse of those (people/ancients).
But in men having a swelling, the extraction of the abscess should be avoided, lest harm be done thereby, because all the veins and the major ones of the patient are there.
But in those who have abscesses located in the mouth, throat, or ears, when the illness is not in the windpipe, it is necessary to use the incision of the abscess to avoid the destruction which is caused by perforation (or suppuration).
Therefore, when we want to do this, we should incise the abscess below the three circles of the abscess circles, or four, with a small incision in width between two circles in quantity, so that the incision is in the skin, not in the cartilage.  This location is suitable for incision because it is devoid of flesh and its blood vessels are distant.
And if the physician is fearful, then he should extend the throat's membrane with a hook, and then slit the membrane until he reaches the channel (windpipe), but avoid the blood vessels if he sees any of them.
Then incise the skin as we have recommended; and the incision of the windpipe is indicated by the inflammation which comes from it with what is broken from it, and by the loss of voice.
And leave the wound open for some time.
Then, when the time has arrived in which perforation is feared, bring together the two lips of the wound's membrane and sew it alone without the cartilage.
And then administer medicines that promote the growth of flesh until it is healed.
And Albucasis says that the sum of the discourse which we have recounted, the exposition is nothing other than that you see that some of these abscesses have already obstructed the throat of the patient, and the patient has come close to death, and his breath is cut off, and some go to incise the epiglottis so that the patient breathes over the area of the wound through some respiration, and is saved from death.
And for that reason I order the wound to be left open until the malignancy of the disease is consumed; and its malignancy lasts for three days; and then I order the wound to be sewn, and cure it until it is healed.
And this which I have seen myself, is that a servant took a knife and put it in her throat and incised with it a part of the windpipe, and I was called to her cure, and I found the murmur as it is murmured by the dying, and I uncovered the wound and found the blood which had come out of the small wound.
Then I was confessed that she had not incised a vein or artery, and the wind was issuing from the wound, and I cured it until it was healed.
And nothing happened to the servant except hoarseness in the voice, and after some days she returned to a better state of health.
And now I say that in the incision of the tonsil there is no fear.
Chapter 44.
Concerning incision of an abscess which occurs in the throat externally, and is called a throat hernia.
This abscess, named throat hernia, is a large abscess according to the complexion of the body, and it is common in women.
And it is of two types, for it is either natural or accidental.
And the natural type is not possible to cure.
And the accidental type is of two kinds, of which one resembles fatty nodes, and the other kind resembles an abscess which is caused by the knotting of an artery, and in this one there is danger. And one should not use iron on it presumptuously except in that which is small. And you should probe and investigate it with the finger; and if you find it similar to a fatty node, and it is not connected to any of the veins, then you should incise it like nodes and remove it with what contains it from the skin and  [remove] the little blister; and if not, then its whole being should be examined, and then treat the place with what is needed for healing until it is healed.
Chapter 45.
On the incision of the types of nodes.
There are many types of nodes, and I have already mentioned all their types in the division.
And it is necessary that I recount thus the difference between a node and an abscess, lest there be doubt.
Therefore I say that with an abscess there is heat and fever and vehement pain until the boiling of the superfluity is settled; and putrefaction is complete, then the fever, pain, and heat cease.
But with a node there is neither heat nor fever nor pain, and it contains that lion-colored fluid which is in its own sac.
And it is according to the color of the body, and its beginning is like a swelling and is formed like a blister, either larger or smaller, and they are of two types, for they are either fatty and contain humidity, and the colors of the humidity are many, as I said in the division.
Therefore it is necessary, when you arrive at the treatment of a node, that you extract it and investigate it at the beginning with an instrument which is called an intromes, according to how its form will appear in the chapter which is about this.
And the manner of investigating abscesses and all nodes is that you take this instrument and insert it into the most humid place which you find in the abscess, and you will turn your fingers with it little by little until you know that the instrument has already penetrated the core.
And then place your hand according to the size of the abscess, and then extract the intromes and consider what has come out in its track.
And if the flowing humidity, whatever its color, is expelled, then you incise it with a superficial section as I have said in the other abscesses.
And if there is no humidity in the track of the intromes, then know that it is fat (or greasy).
And dry it with an incision having the form of a cross according to this form: Just as I have taught you, and suspend that with hooks, and peel the skin from all sides easily, and keep the skin or sac, if you can, over that and extract that pus with the node.
But if it is broken during the operation, it is not possible to extract that pus, and this often happens, and then you extract it in pieces until nothing remains of it.
Because if anything remains, little or much, the node will return accordingly.
And if you see that some small part remains, then fill the wound with some sharp corrosive powders and bind the wound, and place over it a hot poultice, and treat it with another treatment until it is healed.
And if it is a large node, then you sew the two lips of it and treat it with that which causes it to granulate (heal by forming new tissue).
But if a pulsating vein is contrary to it, or a non-pulsating one, then you cauterize and fill the place with crushed vitriol and leave it tightly bound for two or three days until the wound dries and the boiling of the blood subsides; and then return to incising that which is rotten in the node.
Chapter 46.
Of the forms of instruments necessary in incision and perforation.
Of these are the forms of the instruments, and there are three types: some are large, some are medium, and some are small.
The form of the large instrument is this:
The form of the small instrument is this:
They are made of iron, of lead, with properly rounded ends, so that they may easily enter the abscesses.
And these are the forms of the instruments, and they are named *albered*, and one of them is called *berid*.
And they are of three types, for of them there is a large, a medium, and a small one.
The form of the large instrument, its shape is:
The form of the medium instrument, its shape is:
The form of the small instrument, its shape is:
It is agreed that they are [used] for those abscesses and discharges and fistulas and buboes, because among those are [abscesses] from bones and other causes.
And they are made round, thick, smooth, like large needles with which saddles are sewn, and they are made of gilded bronze, or of bronze, or of iron, or of silver. And the best are when they are made of gilded bronze.
And the instruments are made of black lead, which are agreed to be used to open fistulas in the cavities of which are reflections, so that they are reflected with their lightness through those reflections.
And they are of three types, for some of them are long, others medium, and others short, according to the size of the fistula's width and its stricture.
Form of the large lead instrument:
Form of the medium lead instrument:
Form of the small lead instrument:
The shapes of the hooks are of many types, for some of them are simple, which have only one curve, and are of three types: large, small, and medium.
And of them there are hooked ones, and they are of three types.
And of those there are hooks having two curves, and they are of three types.
And of those there are hooks having three curves, and they are of three types.
And all these are necessary in their place/for their purpose.
Form of a small simple hook, its form is:
Form of a large hook having two curves. Form of a medium-sized hook having two curves. Form of a small hook having two curves.
Form of a large hook having three curves.
Form of a medium-sized hook having three curves.
And these are the forms of the scalpels with which nodes and abscesses are cut and scraped, and there are three types, for of these there is a large, a medium, and a small one.
Form of a large scalpel:
Form of a medium scalpel:
Form of a small scalpel:
The ends of those with which the incision is made are sharp, and the other ends are not sharp, and they are not positioned in such a way, except so that it is easily done in the scraping of the nodes, fearing incision of a vein or nerve, and by these the patient is healed and finds a little tranquility through the cauterization which is found after the scraping of the abscess.
And these are the forms of the cauteries, and there are three types: large, medium and small, as you will see.
They are made of brass and are similar in shape to a ray with which alcohol is made.  (The "ray" likely refers to a shape, not a fish; the alcohol reference is puzzling and may be a scribal error or a reference to a specific type of brass.)
And it is at the end,  the pointed part hidden by a sheath, and in that way it can be used internally and externally as you wish, as you see.
The shapes of the spatulas, which are hidden within the fingers below the perforation of the abscesses, and the patients do not perceive them, are of three types: large, medium, and small. And these are the shapes of those:
The shapes of cupping glasses with which the flow of blood is stopped, and they are of three types: large, medium, and small; their shapes are:
They should be made of bronze or copper, round with some length, and they should be thin.
And it is necessary that you have these types of cupping glasses: large, medium, and small, so that with them you can stop the flow of blood quickly when necessary, and when other medicine is not initially effective.
However, do not use them to stop blood in every part of the body, but only in fleshy areas, such as the muscles of the legs and thighs, and the muscles of the arms, and of the breasts and abdomen and knees, and similar fleshy, moist muscles.
And sometimes other small instruments are made, similar to the rind of a bladder, according to this form; by means of which blood is drawn off when it is done by phlebotomy, or by incision of a vein or artery.
And sometimes they are made round, according to this form:
Chapter 47.
On the treatment of men's breasts which resemble those of women.
Sometimes the breasts of some men are inflamed due to excessive sleep; and then the breasts are inflamed, and resemble the breasts of women, and remain as pustular, whitish swellings.
And for one who has this, it is necessary that you incise those with a lunate incision, according to this form, from line B to line G, and then scrape away all the thickness, and then fill the wound with incarnative medicine, and then close the two lips of the wound with sutures, and treat it until it is healed.
But if the breast droops downwards and is softened by its size, as it happens in women, then let it be split in two its upper sides, with two incisions similar to a lunar figure, of which each is contained within the other, towards the end of each, so that the larger line contains the smaller according to this form, from line B and line G. And then scrape the skin which is between the two lips of the wound, and remove the fat, and administer what we have said of the suture and powders which are necessary in the healing until it is healed.
And if you do not complete the incision of what needs to be incised because of the patient's unease, and because of the flow of blood, then you must fill the wound with cotton soaked in corrosive ointment and leave it until it corrodes what remains of the fat, and then treat it until it is healed.
Chapter 48.
Of the perforation of abscesses that form under the armpit.
These abscesses that form under the armpit are a kind of scrofula, hard, and containing a sac-like skin.
And some of these contain humidity; and those that contain humidity should be incised with a lunar incision according to this figure: from line G to line B. And when all the pus within the abscess has been evacuated, then you fill it with old cotton and leave it there until the next day.
Then the cotton should be removed and it should be treated with a suitable ointment until it is healed.
And if the abscess is of the kind of nodes and scrofula, then you should incise it as we have said in the section on scrofula, similarly.
But if the wound is so extensive that it causes putrefaction, then apply cautery as we have previously described.
Chapter 49.
Concerning the incision of abscesses that occur from an arrow or vein.
When an arrow is broken, and the remaining shaft is embedded, then often an abscess occurs.  The signs by which it is known that inflammation and abscess are due to an artery or vein are these: because when an abscess is due to an arrow, it is long and extends deeply into the body; and when you press the abscess with your fingers, you feel a hissing sound within it.
And that which is due to a vein is round on the surface of the body.
And incision of this abscess is dangerous, especially in that which is under the armpits, and in the groin, and in the neck, and in many places of the body; and it is very large, therefore its treatment with iron should be avoided, and that which is in the extremities, or in the head, should be avoided.
But concerning that which is caused by inflammation of the opening of the arrow wound, make a lengthwise incision in the shaft; and then widen the incision with hooks and around the arrow, and free it from the tissues until it is uncovered.
Then place a needle on it and make it penetrate to the other side, and tie the arrow with a double thread in two places—this method I have shown you for the extraction of two arrows that are in the temples.
Then pierce the place which is between two ligaments with a spatula until all the blood that is in it comes out, and the abscess is dissolved.
Then administer treatment in which powder is applied so that the ligaments may heal; and then treat it with ointments suitable for this until it is healed.
And if it is an abscess caused by a severed vein, then you should hold with your hand as much of the abscess as you can with the shaft, and then insert the needle under the place that you have held under your hand, and make it penetrate; and let there be a double thread in it so that you can extract it from the other side, and then tie the abscess with a good ligature as I have told you in the ligature of a grape, in two parts with two ends of the thread.
But if you fear that you will extract the thread, then insert the thread with that needle under the entire abscess below the incision of the first needle, and tighten the threads in four places.
Then dry the abscess in the middle of it until, when what is inside it has come out, then you incise the superfluity of the shaft, and leave what is tied to it.
Then place on it a powder which you have submerged in wine and oil, and then administer the treatment which is done with poultices and ointments until it is healed.
Chapter 1: Of the abscess which occurs due to the twisting of nerves.
Just as abscesses occur in arteries and veins, similarly abscesses occur in the nerves when they are struck or injured by excessive labor, and the like.
And it is most often found in the areas of the joints or the heel, or in any place where the joints are weakened.
And this abscess is serious, and is similar in color to the rest of the body, and is in the worst conditions when it is constricted with force, causing the patient to feel a kind of numbness.
And this abscess is not located in the front of the body, therefore it is below the ribs, and it is weakened in every part and does not extend to the front or back.
Therefore, that which is in the joints should not be invaded with iron, for contraction will quickly ensue.
But that which is in the head or forehead, finish it with a spatula. But if it is a small abscess, then grasp it with forceps and excise it from the roots.
And if it is large, then suspend it with a hook, and flay it, and then remove it; and close the wound with suture, and treat it until it is healed.
Chapter 51.  (or Chapter LI, using Roman numerals)
Concerning the incision of an abscess which occurs in the abdomen (or belly).
It happens to some men many times in their bellies and in other parts of their bodies that there are swellings which are called fungals by similarity to fungi, of which the root is subtle and the head is large; and the lips of these are  turned inward (or inverted), and some of these are small, and some are very large.
And I have seen one, and in his belly were two swellings which were very similar to fungi, and there was no difference between them,  [being] white, with slender roots.
And the lips of these were inverted and split open, and humidity constantly flowed from them.
Therefore I incised them and found in one eighteen ounces of pus, and in the other six ounces.
And the operation in the incision of these is that you consider then if the patient is humid, and the color of the swelling is white, humid, with a slender root; then you incise it with a broad spatula, and let cauteries be in your presence in the fire, for many times from the incision of it much blood is expelled; and if the blood overcomes you, cauterize it.
And if you see the patient fearful and timid, beware of incision with iron; but then take freshly made lead plaster, and bind the swelling with it, in the manner which we have described; and leave it for two days.
And then adjust the tightness of the lead thread; therefore, do not cease to tighten the lead greatly over the swelling, until it is severed and falls off by itself without work.
But if the swelling has a thick root, then in its incision there is some cause for fear and dread, and especially that which is in the belly.
But it is possible that you incise half of it, and then cauterize it so that it does not return.
And then care for it until the wound is healed.
And beware that you do not presume to incise a swelling which is of a dark color, of little feeling, and of a hard consistency, for that is a malignant cancer.
And I bring to mind a crab in relation to this.
Chapter 52.
Concerning the treatment of a swelling of the umbilicus.
A swelling of the umbilicus is caused by many things; either by fissures of the skin which is over the belly, and a protrusion of the intestine or bowel as happens in other ruptures; or by blood which flows from a vein or artery as has been said before, or by wind constricted there.
But if it is due to a fissure of the skin and a protrusion of the intestine, then the color of the swelling is similar to the color of the body; and it is soft without pain, and appears in various locations. And if it is due to the protrusion of the bowel, then its location is as we have recounted, with even greater variability, and when you press it with your fingers it is hidden, and quickly returns; and it is easily replaced there, and is greatly increased by the intake of baths and strenuous work.
But if it is due to moisture, then it is soft and is not hidden when you press it with your hand, nor is it constricted, nor does it grow.
And if it is due to blood, then the swelling appears with these signs, tending towards blackness.
But if it is due to rotten flesh, then the swelling is serious, large and hard, and is located in a specific area.
But if it is due to flatulence, then touching it is soft.
And the operation is that you consider then if the swelling of the umbilicus is from arterial blood, or venous blood, or from flatulence; then you must be prohibited from treating it, because in that there is fear and danger as I have taught you in the chapter in which I discussed swellings from arterial and venous blood.
And if the swelling of the umbilicus is due to the intestine or the hernia, then you must command the patient to hold their breath and lie down; and then mark with a probe around the entire umbilicus, and then command him to lie between your hands on his back, and then surround with a broad spatula the circumference of the umbilicus over the area you have marked with the probe; and then extend half of the swelling upwards with a large inch; and then tie it around with strong thread or with a bandage and tie it in a proper manner.
And then open the middle of the extended swelling over the ligature and insert your finger into that opening and search for the intestine; and if you have found it and secured it with the ligature, then you carefully extract and push the intestine into the inside of the abdomen.
And if you have found the hernia, then grasp it with forceps; and incise its excess.
But if it is against your practice to operate on an artery or vein, then circumcise that spot, and then return to your procedure; and take two needles and thread them with strong thread and insert the two needles into the circle which you have made around the swelling in the manner of a cross, making them penetrate; and then tighten the swelling in four parts over the needles.
And if you wish, remove the needles and leave the area until the protruding flesh dries and falls off by itself; or incise it when it is thinned and dried, and then treat it with the appropriate ointments until it is healed.
And if the prominence of the umbilicus is from flesh growing there or from a humidity, then it is necessary that you empty the abscess as we have said and extract the blood or humidity which you find there, and then treat it with what is appropriate and which will consolidate the area.
Chapter 53.
Concerning the treatment of cancer.
We have already discussed, in the division, the types of cancer and in what manner it is possible to treat it with medicines, and that it is to be avoided to treat it with iron so that it is not ulcerated; and we have said that cancer is generated in the manner and caution of its treatment.
And the ancients said that sometimes cancer is in a place where its eradication is possible, such as cancer which is in the breasts or in the groin and similar members, to extract all of it, and especially when it is small and beginning.
But when it is old and large, it is not appropriate to apply oneself to it, for I have not been able to cure anyone of it, nor have I seen anyone else who has succeeded in doing so.
And the operation on it, when it is located as we have said, is that you proceed and let the patient bleed, purging some black bile, and then bleed him, if a manifest repletion is found.
Then prepare the patient with a preparation in which he is situated for the operation, and then apply to the wound ointments which are suitable for it; and then scrape thoroughly from all sides with a good, sharp curette until no trace of its roots remains. And let the blood flow, and do not staunch it lightly, and press the area, and wipe away the thick blood completely with your hand or with whatever instrument is available to you among your instruments.
But if you find excessive bleeding from a vein incision or artery, then cauterize it until the flow of blood ceases, and then treat it with the other treatment until it is healed.
Chapter 44.  (Assuming a standard chapter numbering system)
On the treatment of dropsy.
We have already recounted, in the division, the types of dropsy, and the signs of each type, and their treatment with medicines.
And that which is cured with iron is only the ascites type, and iron is not applied to the tympanites type or the anasarca type, for that is mortal.
And when you have treated this tympanitic type of dropsy with medicines and your treatment is not effective, then consider, for if the patient has already acquired debility, or has another illness along with this dropsy, such as a cough or abdominal pain and similar things, then beware of treating them with iron, for there is danger in that.
But if you see the patient with exuberant strength, and with no other illness but dropsy alone, and neither a child nor an old person, then the manner of operating on them is that you lift the patient between your hands, and the attendant gently presses their belly with their hand, driving the water towards the lower part of the pubis, and then take a pointed trocar in this manner:
Let it be two-sided, sharp and long, with a sharp point like a trocar; but let there be some shortness in it, little by little, so that in the operation with it you do not pierce the intestine, and thus injure it.
And then consider if the origin of the dropsy is from the intestines, for then it is necessary that you make the incision at a distance of three fingers from the navel towards the lower parts, directly over the pubis.
But if the origin of the dropsy is due to liver disease, then your incision should be three fingers to the left of the navel.
And if its origin is from the spleen, then your incision should be on the right.
And it is not fitting that your incision be on the side on which the patient wishes to lie, lest the superfluities flow to that weak place.
And then perforate the entire peritoneum with the instrument, and then introduce it into that incision, and raise your hand with the spatula between the peritoneum and the omentum, and you should separate that; if [the separation is] the amount of a fingernail or thereabouts.
And then perforate the omentum until the spatula reaches the empty place, which is the location of the water. And then extract that and introduce an instrument of which this is the form: and it is similar to a fine silver cannula; it is made of silver or bronze or tin, to which, in its lowest part, there is a small hole, and on its sides there are three holes: two on one side and one on the other; and its incised extremity is shaped like a feather, like this:
And at its uppermost extremity is a ring, because when the instrument reaches the water, then that immediately rests on the instrument, therefore evacuating the water in a moderate amount, because if you evacuate more than is necessary at once, the patient will quickly die from the dissolution of their animal spirit, or they will suffer syncope, which is near death.
But evacuate according to the quantity of its virtue and according to what the patient's condition, the virtue of their pulse, and their overall well-being signify to you.
And then extract the instrument, and retain the water, the reason being that it is immediately retained by the chain which holds the hole that is above the cup, which I have described to you how to perforate in that manner.
And then repeat the procedure with the instrument the next day if you see the patient tolerating it, and extract a small quantity of water, and do this for several days cautiously, and guard yourself against error so that only a little water remains.
But if you are concerned about the patient, and leave a large quantity of water, then treat them with burial in warm sand, and induce sweating in a bath, and expose them to the sun for a long time; and treat them with drying medicines until they are healed.
And cauterize the stomach, the spleen, and the liver after the extraction of the water, as I have recounted in what precedes.
Chapter 54.  (Assuming a chapter numbering system starting at I or 1)
Concerning the treatment of children who are born with imperforate urinary tracts.
Sometimes a child is born from its mother's womb and the opening of its urethra is not perforated (or is narrow, or is not in its proper place).
Therefore, it is necessary to treat it with perforation as soon as it is born, using a very fine probe, in this manner:
Then place a thin lead pin in the opening and leave it there for three or four days.
And when it wants to urinate, it should be encouraged and will urinate; and then the pin should be replaced.
And if you do not place the lead [pin], it is possible that the urine which flows over the area will not allow it to close.
But that in which the opening is narrow should be treated with a lead pin, as we have said, for several days until it is widened.
But those in whom the opening is not in its proper place, that is to say, those in whom the opening is below the end of the penis, so that they cannot urinate unless they elevate the penis with their hand,  it is not a generative issue, because the sperm cannot reach the womb in a straight line, and this is a very protracted illness.
And the manner of the operation is that the patient should be positioned on his back, and then extend the head of his penis with your left hand with a strong pull, and incise the head of the penis at the location of the foreskin with a sharp scalpel, like an incision with a feather, or that you shave a portion so that the middle of it becomes similar to the head of the penis, and that the opening falls in the middle as it should.
And be careful in your operation of blood flow, for this often happens; and staunch the blood with something, and tend to the wound until it is healed.
Chapter 56.
Concerning phymosis, which occurs in the prepuce at the head of the penis, and of corruption, blackness, and adhesion of the prepuce to the head of the penis.
Many times this phymosis occurs on the penis and is a fleshy excrescence.
And of these, one is malignant and another is non-malignant.
For the non-malignant type, you should suspend it with a fine hook and excise it until you have removed it completely; then apply to the wound a pledget soaked in Egyptian ointment; and after that, treat it with diafinicon ointment until it is healed.
And if the phymosis is malignant, of a livid color, then you should apply cautery near its incision and its root.
But if the phymosis is on the prepuce of the glans penis of an uncircumcised man, and one part of the phymosis is inside the prepuce and the other part is outside, then you should remove the phymosis that is inside first, until it is consolidated; and then you treat the outside part, because if you treat both together, the prepuce may be damaged.
And if you see in the genitals and prepuce blackness and corruption, then you should remove everything that is already blackened and beginning to corrupt or is already corrupt; and then apply to that area a poultice of honey, which is mixed with finely ground bark of pomegranate and crushed and sifted chickpea flour.
And then treat it with another suitable treatment until it is healed.
But if there is a flow of blood, then apply lunar cautery according to this method:
Because cautery is helpful for two conditions at once, that is, for bleeding and for a wound when it is corrupted/infected.
And if the head of the penis is corroded and completely destroyed, then you should insert a lead cannula into the meatus of the prepuce so that the patient can urinate through it.
In the adhesion of the prepuce to the head of the penis (and this adhesion occurs only in one whose prepuce is healthy, and circumcision has not been performed; and when adhesion occurs due to a wound or abscess) it is necessary that you scrape with a blunt instrument until the adhesion is dissolved and the head of the penis is freed from all parts.
And if it is difficult to separate these exquisitely, then you should scrape with a sharp instrument some part of the head of the penis and the prepuce, and this is because the prepuce, when it is thin, is very easily perforated by its slight thinness.
Then separate the prepuce from the head of the penis with a thin linen cloth, which has been soaked in cold water so that they do not adhere again.
And then let it be treated with styptic wine until it is consolidated (healed).
Chapter 57.
Chapter 57: Of the cleansing of children and the treatment of what happens to those circumcised.
Circumcision is not a solution of continuity like other wounds; however, since it is of our operation and our will, and since it is properly done on children, it is necessary that we assign to it the best operation and the easiest path leading to health.
Therefore I say that the ancients did not mention circumcision in any of their books, because they did not use it in their laws, and it is only because we have acquired it through experience, which is why I have found most artisans and barbers to use circumcision and cleansing with a lancet and with forceps; and they use ligature with thread and incision with the nail.
And I have tried all these methods and I find no better cleansing with forceps, with ligature with thread than cleansing with the nail, because many times the foreskin retracts further up, because the foreskin has two layers, and the lower layer remains, and it is easily forced to another incision and certain pain. And with cleansing which is done with an awl, and is digital, which shoemakers use, the incision of the tip of the penis is not assured, because it easily enters the hole.
But in the operation with a nail, it easily becomes rusty and corrupts your operation. And the foreskin of the child is short by nature, and many times it is born in such a way that it has no need of cleansing, and I have seen this.
But of the cleansing that is done with forceps and ligatures with thread, the goodness, experience reveals to me, because the forceps are of proportional incision, for this reason that the sharpness which is above is thus like the sharpness which is below; and thus as you press your hand, two sharpnesses are proportioned, and you incise according to a comparison at one time; and compression of the thread is made with a figure containing the foreskin of the penis from every part, with which no error at all happens.
And the manner of the first operation is that you make the child, especially if it is one of those that understands a little, stay still, so that you do nothing but tie the thread to its penis alone, and leave it there until the next day.
And then make it happy in every way possible that it receives understanding. And then make the child lie still between your hands, prepared and not at all fidgety; and hide the forceps in your hand or under your foot, so that the child does not see them or any other of the instruments.
And then place your hand on his penis and blow on the foreskin, and pull it until the head of the penis is exposed, and then cleanse it of whatever dirt is clinging to it.
The shape of the forceps for circumcision, this is the shape:
Let the one extremity be non-cutting and the other cutting, so that the head of the nail does not come out, and let the length of the two sharpened points be like the length of two handles equally. (This describes the design of surgical forceps;  "nail" likely refers to a pin or rivet connecting the two parts of the instrument.)
But the error in circumcision is that you too quickly remove the whole, or part of, the inner foreskin below the incision.
Therefore it is necessary that you stretch that (skin) with your fingernail before the suppuration of the place and that you incise it equally.
And if you cannot hold it with your fingernail, then pull it with tweezers and incise it.
But if three days have passed, and what is swollen remains under the inflamed penis, then you leave it until the hot abscess has subsided, and then carefully scrape it, and incise it as you see fit.
And be careful of the head of the penis, for that will harm him.
And then treat it with that which consolidates the wound, from the powders which we have recommended in the treatise on powders.
And if it is incised beyond measure, and obeys the upper parts, this will not harm him.
And furthermore, treat it with what we have said until it is healed.
Chapter 58.
Concerning the treatment of urine retained in the bladder.
Retention of urine in the bladder is caused by obstruction from a stone, or by congealed blood, or by pus, or by a fleshy growth, and similar to those things we have said concerning the methods of treatment in the division.
And if it is not dissolved by what we have said, and the cause is vehement upon the patient, then it is necessary to administer extraction with an instrument which is called a syringe, of which this is the form: Let it be of silver and be subtly long and concave, like a bird's quill, with a slender length similar to a palm and a half, to which is a thin tube at its head.
And the manner of drawing the urine by this means is that you take a doubled bladder and tie at its end wool or cotton with a good binding; and introduce the ends of the bladder into the lower part of the syringe, and cut with scissors if any excess of wool remains, but introduce it into the tube forcefully. Then grease the syringe with butter and egg white.
And make the patient sit on a chair (or stool,  "sella" can mean either), and rub their bladder and penis with moist oils, olive oil and rose water.
Then gently introduce the syringe until it reaches the root of the penis; and then bend the penis upwards towards the navel; and then push the syringe inside that; and then push it until it reaches the bladder, and this indicates to the patient that it has reached the void, and it is not done according to this order, but the meatus, which goes in a tortuous way.
Then extend the bladder with the wool little by little, because the urine will soak the wool.
Then extract it and perform the urine cure, and use a syringe, do not cease to do this and use a syringe until the bladder is emptied and the patient finds relief.
Chapter 59.
Concerning the quality of bladder clysterization with a clamp and with similar instruments which are suitable for this.
When an ulceration or abscess occurs in the bladder, or congealed blood in it, or putrefaction is constricted, and you wish to instill waters and medicines into it, then it should be done with an instrument which is called a clamp, and this is its form:
except that at its extremity it is blunt, that is, closed. And in it there are three holes: two on one side, thus twice.
In the beginning, there is a concave place, in which that which is to be injected is placed, and it should be according to the quantity that fills it, without addition, until when something is drawn from the humors with it, it is drawn, and when it is expelled, with that it is drawn, and when it is expelled long, as the clamp does with which naphtha is poured in sea battles.
Therefore, when you want to draw humors from the bladder, insert the extremity of the clamp into the humor, and draw with it that which is pushed to the upper parts, because the humor is drawn into the concavity of the clamp.
And then insert the extremity of the clamp into the urethra as we have described for the syringe; and then expel the humor with that which you expel, because that humor immediately reaches the bladder, and the patient feels it.
The form of the subtle catheter with which the bladder is catheterized, and this is its form:
And let it be made of silver or tin, of which the uppermost end should resemble a small feather, and below it a slender tube.
And then take a goat bladder, and place in it the liquid that you wish to inject into the bladder, and then tie it between two with a strong double ligature, and warm that liquid over the fire.
And then insert the tip of the catheter into the urethra.
And then squeeze your hand on the bladder with the liquid with gentle pressure until the patient says that the liquid has reached the bladder.
But if you do not have a bladder at hand, then take a piece of parchment and make a circle from it; and perforate it throughout its roundness; and then insert strong thread into those holes, so that it is wrapped around; and then attach the circle in such a way that it is joined together as a suture, after you put in it what you want of liquids, oils and waters.
And then you tie that to the instrument and do with it as you have done with the bladder, and express with your hand until the liquid reaches the bladder.
Chapter 60.
On the extraction of a stone.
We have already mentioned in the division the types of stone and their treatment with medicines, and the difference between a stone generated in the kidneys and a stone generated in the bladder, and the signs of it.
And we have spoken of the stone in which [one performs] an operation by hand and incision.
And the stone generated in the bladder properly is that which is lodged in the bladder.
And I am narrating that with clear exposition and brevity.
Therefore I say that the stone generated in the bladder mostly comes to children; and of its signs it is that the urine which is expelled from the bladder is similar to water in its thinness, and sand appears in it; and the patient rubs his penis, and often cries, and is restless; and with that comes forth the anus in many of those [children].
And the healing of children from this [condition] is easier while they have reached fourteen years; and it is difficult cure in the elderly. But in young people it is milder because it is among them [i.e.,  the condition is less severe in young people compared to the elderly].
And of that [stone] which is larger, the cure is easier; and if it is small, it is contrary to that [i.e., the cure is more difficult].
Therefore, to arrive at the cure of this, it is necessary at the beginning that we purify the patient with a clyster which removes all the phlegm which is in his bowels; for that phlegm sometimes prevents the extraction of the stone because of its obstruction.
And then the patient should be taken with his feet up and massaged and shaken gently so that the stone descends to the bottom of the bladder, or that it sometimes jumps from another location.
And then make that [patient's] body between your hands prepared, and his hands should be below his thighs, so that the whole bladder is made to decline downwards.
And then search for it and all of that outside.
Therefore, if you feel the stone in the space, then you should immediately take care of it with an incision.
And if it does not completely descend from your touch, then it is necessary that you anoint your index finger of your left hand with oil, if the patient is a child, or the middle finger if he is a fully grown young man, and introduce it into his rectum. And search for the stone until it is under your finger. And return it little by little into the neck of the bladder.
And then press on it with your finger, and expel it outwards to the place where you made the incision.
And command the assistant to press on the bladder with her hand; and command another assistant to extend the genitals upwards with her right hand, and with her other hand support the perineum which is below the genitals, near the place where the incision is made.
And then introduce a well-sharpened spatula, of which this is the form: and incise that which is between the anus and the genitals, not in the middle, but towards the left thigh; and let the incision be above the stone, and your finger be in the anus, and let a transverse incision be made, so that the external incision is wide and the internal narrow, according to the size that the extraction of the stone allows, and no larger, for you will easily compress with your finger, which is in the anus, the stone against the incision, and it will be expelled without difficulty.
And know that some stones are angular and rough, wherefore their extraction is made difficult by this.
And of those that are like a gland, and are round, the extraction is easily done.
Therefore, if it is one which is angular and rough, adjust it in the fissure.
And if it is not thus expelled, then it is necessary that you push on it, or that you press on it with a suitably shaped instrument, the end of which is like a file with which you press on the stone, and it does not escape from it; or that you introduce under it a slender instrument with a curved end.
But if you cannot [remove it] in this way, then you enlarge the hole a little, and if you see a flow of blood, staunch it with crushed vitriol.
But if the stone is more than one, then at the beginning you apply your hand to the mouth of the bladder, and then incise it; and then gently push it; and similarly do if there are more than two.
And if the stone is very large, then it is ignorance to incise it with a large incision, for two things happen to the patient: either he dies or he suffers continuous urinary incontinence, because the place is not completely consolidated.
But administer its expulsion until it is ejected, or work on breaking it with forceps until you extract it in pieces.
Then, when you have completed your operation, fill the wound with aloe and dragon's blood and bind it. And place over it a cloth soaked in oil and wine, or in rose oil and cold water, so that a hot abscess may be calmed.
Then lay the patient supine on his back, and do not untie the bandage until the third day.
And when you have untied that, bathe the place with water and plenty of oil, and then treat it with diafinicon ointment and diabazilicon ointment until it is healed.
But if in the wound you find a hot, burning, corrosive abscess, similar to blood frozen in the bladder, and because of it urine is suppressed (and this is known by the passage of blood with urine), then insert your finger into the wound and extract that blood, for if it remains it provokes corruption of the bladder and its putrefaction.
Then wash the wound with sour wine, water, and salt, and with any other suitable remedy, doing what is necessary for its healing until it is healed.
And it is necessary during the entire treatment that you bind both thighs and adjust the medicines which are placed on the area.
And if the stone is small and is in the meatus of the penis, and is lodged there, and the flow of urine is obstructed, then treat it with what I recommended before resorting to incision, because many times because of this treatment incision is required; and I have already proved this, which is that you take a polished iron borer, of which this is the form:
of triangular end, sharp, set in wood.
Then take gall and bind it to the penis below the stone so that it does not return to the bladder.
Then introduce the iron into the penis, perforating easily until the borer reaches the stone. And turn the borer with your hand in that stone little by little, and you will enlarge the perforation until you make it penetrate from the other side; for the urine will immediately be released.
Then press your hand on what remains of the stone on the outside of the penis, because that is broken, and it is expelled with the urine, and the patient is healed.
But if this cure is not suitable for you for some reason that prohibits it, then bind one gall below the stone, and another gall above the stone. Then incise over the stone in that penis between the two ligatures. And then extract it. Then untie the ligatures and clean the congealed blood which is formed in the wound.
And the ligature of gall below the stone is not necessary except so that it does not return to the bladder, and the other ligature above, because when the gall is untied near the extraction of the stone, the hernia returns to its place and closes the wound.
And for this it is necessary for you, when you tie the gall above, that you elevate the hernia to the upper parts, or that it return through your accomplishment, and thus close the wound as we have said.
Chapter 61.
On the extraction of a stone from women.
Stones are rarely generated in women.
But if a stone is found in one of them, then its cure is difficult, and prohibited in many ways.
One reason is that women are easily made virgins (implying the difficulty of accessing the stone due to the hymen).
And the second is that you will not find a woman, be she chaste or married, who willingly exposes herself to a physician.
The third is that you will not find a woman who knows this art well, especially the operation with the hand.
And the fourth is that the location of the incision for a stone in women is far from the stone itself, requiring a deep incision, and this is dangerous.
But if necessity compels you to this, then you must find a female physician who is skilled, and they are rarely found.
But if you are deprived of that, then seek a skilled and subtle male physician, or find a matron well-versed in women's matters, or a woman who has some knowledge of this art.
Therefore, have that person present, and command them to do everything you order, from the initial examination for the stone; the reason for this is that if the woman is a virgin, she should place her finger in her rectum and search for the stone.
Therefore, if she finds it,  press it down with her finger, and then instruct her to incise it.
But if she is not a virgin, then instruct the matron to insert her finger into the patient's vagina and search for the stone, while placing her left hand on the bladder and compressing it with good pressure.
Then, if she finds it, she should gently push it from the opening of the bladder downwards, using the sum of her strength until it reaches the root of the thing.
And then incise it near the junction of the vagina and the root of the thing, wherever it is situated, and center the stone in that area, and her finger should not be removed from the stone while compressing it downwards.
And the incision should be small at first; and then insert a probe into that incision, and if the stone is felt, then adjust the incision according to the size that you know the stone will be extracted from it.
And know that the types of stones are many: for some are small and large, and smooth and rough, and long and round, and having branches.
Therefore you should know how many types there are of them, so that you can signify that which you wish.
And if you see a flow of blood, apply crushed vitriol to the place and leave it there for an hour until the bleeding stops, and then return to your operation until the stone is removed.
And make sure you prepare the instruments which are mentioned in the extraction of stones in men, so that you are aided by them in your operation.
And if you see a flow of blood, and you know that the expulsion of blood is from the artery that has been incised, then you should apply powder to the place and bind it tightly with powders and a descending bandage, and do not repeat this; and leave the stone and do not extract it, for the patient will quickly die. And then treat the wound.
Then, when the sharpness of the bleeding has subsided after a few days, and the place has healed, you return to your operation until the stone is removed.
Chapter 62.
Concerning the incision of a strangulated hernia.
A watery hernia is nothing but an accumulation of humidity in the white sheath which is below the scrotum containing the testicle, and is called the sheath.
And sometimes it is in the proper membrane which nature prepared for it in the part of the testicle, so that it seems that there is another testicle; and this is the scrotum between the white sheath that we have mentioned, and this is nothing but a swelling.
And the generation of this hernia is due to weakness which affects the genitals, so that this matter is poured into them, and sometimes it happens due to a blow inflicted on the genitals.
And this humidity has many colors, for its color is either tending towards yellow or bloody, or red, or black and foul-smelling, or watery white, and this is what is most common.
And the signs by which it is known where this accumulation of water is are these: for if it is in the white sheath which we have mentioned, then the swelling is round, tending slightly towards length, like the shape of an egg, and it surrounds the testicle, because the humidity contains it on all sides.
And if the humidity is in the proper membrane, then the swelling is round in the part of the testicle and therefore one believes it is another testicle.
And if the humidity is between the cord of the genitals and the white sheath, then it falls below the feeling/sensation.
And if you want to know the color of the humidity, then you test the color of the humidity in the swelling with a lancet whose shape precedes it; and according to what has emerged in the trace of the lancet, judge what is inside.
Therefore, when we come to its treatment with iron [cautery], then it is necessary that we order the patient to be phlebotomized if that is possible for you, and you see his body full [of blood].
Then let him be supine on his back on something a little raised, and place many cloths under him.
Then sit on his left side, and command the assistant to follow on his right side, who will extend his rod [likely a probe or similar instrument] to one of the two sides, to the cord of the genitals and to the part of the navel of the belly.
Then take a broad spatula and split the cord of the genitals in the middle lengthwise almost to the pubic bone.
And let the incision be made straight and equally distant from the line that divides the skin of the genitals, until it reaches the included white fat.
And scrape that [fat], and observe, and beware lest you incise that; and your scraping with which you scrape it, let it be suspended somewhat, and more subtly scrutinize with the scraping according to the quantity possible for you.
Then perforate the water-filled fat with a wide perforation, and extract all the water.
Then separate the two lips of the incision with hooks, and extend the fat to the upper parts; and do not touch the cord of the genitals within, and incise the fat in whatever manner is possible for you. And incise it in its entirety or in pieces, and especially its thin layer, for if you do not exquisitely scrutinize its incision, it is not ensured that the water will not return.
But if the matter proceeds from outside its cord during your operation, then when you have completed the incision of the fat, return it inside, and then join the two lips of the cord of the genitals with suture, and then treat it like other wounds until it is healed.
And if you find the testicle corrupted by another illness, then you should tie the vessels which are on the spermatic cord, and extract the testicle, and then treat it as we have said.
But if the fluid is gathered in two separate parts, then know that there are two hernias; therefore, incise that part in the same way that you did the other; and if it seems to you that it is one operation, then you may perform it.
And then you should wipe away the blood, and insert into the incisions wool soaked in oil or rose oil; and place on top more wool which you have soaked in wine and oil, and spread this over the genitals and the area of the abdomen; and place on top folded cloths and powders, and bind those on top with a bandage which is according to this form:
And then two cloths should be taken and filled with carded wool in this manner; and the ends should be made with which it is bound with cotton or damp wool, and they should be added with a tight structure in the waistband of the breeches, and one of the ends should go from the buttocks to the groin, and the second should go to the part of the scrotum, and two ends over the two thighs and two other ends over the two knees, and the entire binding should be adjusted in the waistband of the breeches.
And sometimes this hernia is treated artificially with cautery instead of incision with an iron; and it is that you take a thin, knife-like cautery and that you incise with it the skin of the genitals, and it is ignited as we have recounted until the white, fluid-containing cyst is revealed, and then you take a cautery of this shape: and it resembles the Greek letter.
And then perforate the cyst with it, and ignite it until all the moisture is expelled.
And then stretch the cyst with tweezers, and scrape with tweezers, and scrape with a thin, ignited cautery; and incise it as much as you can until you eradicate all of it; and be careful that the fire does not touch the egg (testicle).
And know that this operation is safer and involves less blood loss, and is better than an operation with an incision.
But if an abscess forms contrary to expectation during the incision or cauterization, or there is a flow of blood, then you must cure whatever is contrary to expectation with the treatment that is appropriate for it, as has been said.
But if the patient is fearful and does not expect a second operation because of its horror, then administer perforation as I have recommended; and this is when you are certain, through what we have said about the signs, that the hernia is watery.
Then you should make the patient sit on some raised seat; then perforate the abscess at its lowest part with a broad spatula, and place the perforation along the length of the body.
And let the opening be wide enough that all the water flows out.
Then place a cloth over the area and bind it, and leave it so that the remaining water can drain out. And then treat it until the wound is healed.
But if there is an obstruction to the outflow of water, then you should perforate it: and this is done only because the white pannicle in the opening of the wound creates an obstruction and prevents the exit of the water; then you should put into the wound a tool with which water is extracted from dropsies, the form of which has been described before; or apply a small incision to the obstruction in the wound.
And know that the water will return, and will accumulate again within six months or thereabouts; and when it has accumulated, then it should be perforated in the same manner, for the patient will thus pass their days.
Chapter 63.
Concerning the incision of a fleshy hernia and its treatment.
Know that in the incision of this hernia there is fear of loss leading to death in the worst cases; therefore, to me it seems better to leave it alone and let it be saved by that means.
And I am remembering the operation on that [hernia] and the types of abscesses.
Therefore, I say that abscesses originate in the bodies of which the genitals are composed, and this is caused by many things: either by an acute, sharp superfluity which is poured into the genitals, or by percussion (a blow).
And the color of the abscess is according to the color of the body, and no pain is found in it, and it is a serious abscess.
And very quickly is a stony abscess formed, of which the color is dark, and there is no feeling in it.
And sometimes it is caused by a knotting of the arteries, and by the inflammation of these as it is perceived in its appearance, or by inflammation of the veins.
But that which is from inflammation of the arteries is known by the dispersion of the abscess when we compress it with our fingers; and it should not be touched.
But that which is caused by inflammation of a vein is not dispersed by any means through compression with the fingers.
And it is possible that an incision is made on this type [of abscess] and on the other tissues; and it is that you incise the tunic of the genitals, and then extend the testicle upwards, and extract it from the white sheath, and free the suspensory ligament, and ligate it, and incise the suspensory ligament after you have freed it from all parts of the testicle.
Therefore, if the testicle is consolidated with those inflamed tissues, then you must extract the testicle and incise it.
And if there is adhesion to any part of the sheath, or to that which is between the vessels, then you must free all that adhesion and incise it with a circular incision.
But if there is a growth of flesh at the site of the adhesion which is behind, then you must incise all that which is there, and extract the testicle as we have said.
Then, when your operation is completed, fill the wound with wool infused in rose oil and wine; and then treat it with the other treatments until it is healed.
Chapter 64.
On the treatment of a hernia which is of the scrotum.
A scrotal abscess is a swelling enveloped by some covering similar to a boil, with softening of the testicles, and it makes movement, exercise, and walking difficult for the patient.
And in the treatment of this illness, one must fear that which precedes it [i.e., the cause of the illness].
However, we must describe the operation in that case, as the first physicians did.
And I say that you should make the patient sit on a raised seat; and then push up the suspensory ligament of the testicles towards the lower parts; and then hold the skin of the genitals with your fingers, along with the vessels that are close to the groin; and let another assistant hold those [parts] as you do, and extend them with firm extension.
And then incise with a broad, sharp knife using a transverse incision directly over the vessels until the vessels are exposed.
And then scrape away all the parts as we have told you in the extraction of arrowheads which are in the temples.
And then insert into those [vessels] a needle with double thread, and tie it at the first of the places where you made the incision, and tie it again at the other end. And then incise those [vessels] in the middle with a straight incision along the length of the body, and extract what is gathered there of fetid and corrupted humors.
And then treat the wound with the treatment of other wounds in which you want healing to be engendered so that the vessels that nourish one of the two genitalia do not fall, for that is not harmful.
But if you cut all the vessels, then it is necessary that the testicles be removed or that the testicles be tied off along with the vessels, so that they are deprived of all nourishment by the incision of the vessels, and that they wither, or that they are tied off so that there is no nourishment for them.
Chapter 65.
On the treatment of intestinal hernia.
The occurrence of this hernia is due to a rupture that happens in the peritoneum extended over the abdomen from the inguinal rings of the abdominal muscle, causing the intestines to descend through that rupture.
And this rupture is either of the peritoneum or an extension of it, and these two types occur for many reasons: percussion, jumping, shouting, lifting something heavy, or similar.
And the sign of this, when it is due to an extension of the peritoneum, is that it happens gradually over a long time, and not suddenly, and it is an inguinal abscess towards the groin because the peritoneum compresses the intestine.
And the sign of it, when it is due to a rupture of the peritoneum, is that at the beginning it causes sudden, intense pain; and it is an abscess appearing differently under the pubic bone, and this is due to the protrusion of the intestine, and its body in the parts outside the peritoneum.
And sometimes the omentum is expelled along with the intestine, and this hernia is called an intestinal zirbal hernia.  (Note: "zirbal" is likely a corruption or dialectal variation of a word related to the omentum; a precise modern equivalent is difficult to determine without further context.)
And sometimes it is caused by flatulence, and sometimes a tear occurs in the intestine, and it is retained there, and this causes great harm to the patient, and sometimes it causes severe pain, especially when it is pressed.
And in the treatment of these types of illness with iron [presumably referring to cautery or other surgical instruments], caution is needed, because cauterization should be avoided in that area.
And the method of operating on this is that you instruct the patient to reduce the intestine with his hand to the inside of its cavity if it obeys its return, and then it should be pressed on his neck between your hands, and raise his legs.
And then stretch the skin which is the skin of the testicles upwards, and incise the skin of the testicles completely lengthwise; and then place two hooks into the lips of the incision as you need to open the incision with them.
And if the incision, according to the amount that is possible for you, allows the egg [presumably referring to a hernia or testicle] to be expelled.
And then scrape away that skin which is under the skin of the testicles until the hard white skin is uncovered on each side.
Then you insert your finger into what is the testicle, into what is between the white skin, which is under the skin of the testicle, and the second skin, and break up with it the adhesion that is in the back part of the testicle.
And then gently pull the skin of the testicles outwards with your hand, and with this, stretch the white skin upwards with your left hand, and raise the testicle with the skin to the edge of the incision; and tell the assistant to pull the testicle upwards and you dissolve the adhesion that is behind with a complete solution [likely referring to a complete separation].
And check with your fingers that there is no intestinal matter enveloped in the hard white skin. But if you find any such matter, then push it back into the abdomen below.
And then make an incision in the area under the skin of the testicles, through which incision blood and pus will flow, just as we have recounted in what we have said.
And then apply wool soaked in oil, and place it on the wound; and apply the ligature which we have described (and sometimes the white skin is cauterized, which we mentioned near its incision to prevent blood flow, because this often happens) and leave the ligature until it falls off by itself.
But if its falling off is delayed, then let it be bathed with warm water, and apply that until it falls off as we have said.
And then treat the wound with the other treatments for wounds until it is healed.
Chapter 66.
Of a Windy Hernia (or,  Of a Ventosity Hernia).
In this hernia, I have not seen anyone who has dared to treat it with iron.
And the first ones said that it is done in the same way as we have recounted in the hernia that is with wine; which is that you tie the vessels near the incision on that side with ease; and then dry the middle area around the abscess with that which opens it, until the vessels fall away.
And cure the wound as we have said until it is healed.
Chapter 67.
Of the rupture that is made in the groin.
Sometimes a rupture occurs in the groin as we have said, and it swells the area.
And do not allow the genitals any cause of the intestines in the genitals; and if they do, it is little; and it returns at all times.
But if the time with this is prolonged, a fissure is made in the sheath until the intestine descends into the sheath; and this happens because of the extension of the sheath which is in the groin as we have said, which causes the sheath to be stretched, and then it is softened and the place is suppurated and swollen.
And its cure is with cautery as has been described previously.
And sometimes it is cured with iron according to this manner:  the patient lies on his back between your hands, and then dry the place of the rupture from the swollen abscesses with a cut across the width according to the amount of three fingers.
And then tighten the white sheath that is under the testicle until it is uncovered.
And then take the iron (cautery) and place it on the prominent part of the sheath, and press it against the front of the abdomen.
And then sew the two prominent places on the end of the sheath's iron, and join one of those to the other with a suture.
And then remove the end of the iron, and do not incise the sheath completely, nor extend the wound, nor do anything else like that, as I will make known to you in the treatment of intestinal hernia.
And then treat it with the treatment for wounds, and if you have incised the veins, clean it and repair the wound until it is consolidated; because the sheath is contracted and the prominence of the rupture is not adjusted.
And cauterization is better in this place, because it is closer to health (i.e., more likely to promote healing).
Chapter 68.
Concerning the softening of the swelling of the testicles.
Many times the swelling of the testicles in some men is softened because the flesh that is between them is softened, and its appearance is damaged.
Then it is necessary for the one who is charged with his cure to make the patient lie down according to his condition, and incise all the swelling which is softened above the natural swelling; and then that he join the two lips with a suture.
And if you wish, sew up initially the excess of the softened swelling with three or four stitches and with a firm suture.
And then incise between the sutures; and then treat it with the cure for other wounds until it is healed and the threads fall out.
Chapter 69.
Concerning castration.
Know that castration is forbidden in our law, but because of this I am required to remember it in this book; and its remembrance is necessary only in two ways, one of which is so that it is within the knowledge of the physician when questioned about it, that he may know the treatment when it occurs; and the other way is that many times we have need of the castration of other animals for our benefit from them, such as of horses, and of goats, and of pigs, and of similar animals.
And therefore I say that castration is done in two ways: either by abrasion, or by incision.
But in that which is done by abrasion, the method of operation is that we should immerse the animal in warm water until its genitals are softened and relaxed and hang down. And then grasp them with your hand until they are relaxed and do not appear tense to the touch.
But in castration done by incision, it is necessary that you hold the animal and press the scrotum of its testicles with your left hand.
And then tie off the suspensory ligament, and incise each testicle with a single cut until both testicles are freed.
And then incise them after you have skinned each one. And do not leave any substance on those of the cyphus except the subtle cyphus which is on the vessels.  (Note: "cyphus" here likely refers to a specific medical term, possibly related to a type of bandage or dressing, that is not readily translatable without further context).
And this manner of castration is better which is done by crushing, because strong crushing leaves no substance of the testicles by which the animal desires copulation.
And then care for the wound until it is healed.
Chapter 70.
Concerning the treatment of hermaphroditism.
Hermaphroditism in men is according to two manners: one is that which appears as if there were space in the scrotum of testicles, in that which is between two testicles, a figure like a woman's vulva in which there is hair.
And sometimes from that area urine flows, which is in the scrotum of the testicles.
But in women, it is one type: and it is that the vulva of the woman above the pubis is like two testicles of a man, somewhat diminished at the outer part, like the prepuce of a man and two testicles.
And the cure is of three types: two for men and one type for women. And it is necessary that you incise those tightened flesh until the impression of that [problem/growth] is removed, and then that you cure those with the treatment of other wounds.
And in the second type of men, from which urine flows which is in the scrotum of the testicles, there is no cure or operation for it.
Chapter 21.
Of swelling and prominent flesh due to causes in women.
A slight swelling is usually caused by natural reasons until it is stressed and made worse; and sometimes it is magnified in some women to such an extent that it is spread like in men and interferes with intercourse.
Then you must hold the excess swelling with your hand or with bandages and incisions.
And do not overdo the incision, especially near the root, so that bleeding does not occur.
And then treat it with wound treatment until it is healed.
But a birthmark is flesh that grows in the womb of the mother until it fills it, and quickly protrudes outwards resembling a tail (and for this reason some first called this "tailed disease"); therefore, we must incise it as we incise a swelling, and treat it until it is healed.
Chapter 72.
On the treatment of sciatica.
Sciatica is when the woman's vagina is not perforated, or the opening is small. And this is either natural or accidental.
Accidental is due to a preceding illness, and that is caused either by insufficiently formed flesh or by a subtle or thick scar tissue.
And it is formed either in the front of the mother, or in her sides, or in her upper part, or in her lower part, and it prohibits coitus and conception and childbirth, and it strongly inhibits menstruation.
And the diagnosis of this is made by examination of the womb; if the obstruction is apparent, it is profound; but if it is not apparent, then you search for it with your fingers or with a probe.
But if the obstruction is due to a thin scar and is close to the two labia, then you cut and break it up.
And you place powders on the two labia, and then place your index fingers of both hands together.
And the woman should be on her back, her thighs spread, and then forcefully spread the two labia until that thin scar is broken and the obstruction is opened.
And then take wool, soak it in oil, and place it on the area, and keep it moist all day so that the incised area does not heal.
But if the scar is thick and dense, then you should incise it with a broad spatula or with a myrtle leaf.
But if the obstruction is due to an abscess, then open it with a lancet and incise it.
And have with you medicines that stop bleeding without biting, such as acacia, dragon's blood, and enses [this word may be a misspelling or a less common term; its meaning in this context is uncertain, requiring further research into medieval medical texts], mixed with egg white.
And then administer a wide lead cannula so that the wound does not heal too quickly.
And keep it there for a few days and apply some dry poultice.
And then it should be treated with another healing method until it is healed.
And sometimes it happens in the natural birth of other flesh [likely referring to a growth or tumor], and then it is necessary to incise in this manner. But if this is due to a cancerous abscess, to the cancerous abscess which is in the breast, no counter-irritant [or harmful treatment] should be applied in any way with iron.
Chapter 73.
Of the treatment of hemorrhoids and a boil or red swelling that occurs in the vulva of women.
Hemorrhoids are a dilation of the openings of many veins from which much blood constantly flows; and when they are old hemorrhoids, they become boils [or swellings].
And I have already mentioned in the division the types of these and their signs, and I will say thus which ones receive treatment and which ones do not receive treatment.
Therefore I say that hemorrhoids and boils, when they are in the mother's womb and do not appear externally, then in those cases no treatment should be done with iron [i.e., cautery or surgical instruments].
But those which are at the orifice of the womb, upon which one feels [them], those are the ones that are cured [or treatable].
And it is necessary that you place the woman in a cool place and then extend the boil with forceps, or with a rough cloth, and incise them to the roots.
And then sprinkle on those [wounds] some powder to stop the flow of blood, from among the incisive powders without biting [properties], such as acacia and similar ones.
And then bathe her feet for an hour, and then place them in cold water.
And if the flow of blood persists, then have her sit in a decoction of sumacs and pomegranate bark and gallnuts and similar things.
And then take barley flour and mix it with honey and sour wine and make a plaster with this and apply it to his back.
And if the blood is drawn off, it is good; and if not, apply two cupping glasses, to the breasts without scarification.
And then take wool and soak it in coriander juice or in comfrey juice or in wild-carrot juice with diluted wine and apply it to the area; and then treat the area with ointment until it is healed.
And treat that until it is healed.
Chapter 74.
Concerning the perforation of the rectum, an accident in the mother.
Many kinds of abscesses happen in the mother, such as cancer, and stony abscesses, and ulcerations, and buboes, and erysipelas, and hemorrhoidal fistulas, and fissures, and boils, and other abscesses. And I have already discussed these illnesses and their types and their signs, and their treatments, in the previous section/division.
And it is fitting that I speak in this treatise of the hot abscess which occurs in the mother, for it is among the abscesses that require cauterization, and if you wish to know in what manner its operation is performed with iron.
Then you must consider if the pain of the abscess at its beginning is acute with throbbing and phlegm and fever, and sometimes it reddens and if you feel it there, then do not attempt its perforation, and treat it with things that promote maturation until the acuteness of the symptoms subsides.
And then you should make the woman sit on a stool that has two seats; and she should lean on her elbows and adjust her feet to the lowest part of the abdomen, and her thighs should be spread, and she should place her arms under her knees, and bind each one with a suitable bandage.
And then the midwife should stand on the right side and provide the instrument with which the orifice of the womb is opened, the form of which will be described in the relevant passages.
And it is necessary, when you wish to use this instrument, that you place with the ray the neck of the woman's womb, and that which of the instrument is inserted into the womb should be no more than the neck of the womb and harm the patient. But if the instrument is larger than the neck of the womb, then you should apply powders to the texture of the neck of the womb so that the entry of any instrument into the neck of the womb is prevented.
And it is necessary that you place the turning instrument from the upper side and that the person administering it holds the instrument and turns the turning instrument until the orifice of the womb is opened.
And when the wound appears, and it is touched with the hand and is soft and moist, then it is necessary that you dry that wound with a clean cloth.
And when the pus is evacuated, then it is necessary that you place in the wound a wick submerged in rose oil or green oil in which there is some astringency; and place the caulking in the section in the neck of the womb.
And place outside the womb and on the vulva clean wool submerged in water in which mallows have been boiled.
And then let it be treated for about two days with an ointment which is suitable for this until it is healed.
And sometimes the womb and the wound are washed so that it is cleansed with water and honey, and then with water in which the root of lily or of birthwort has been boiled, and then it returns to the ointment.
And if the wound is deep inside the closed womb, then you must be prohibited from treating it with iron, taking care of it with what we have said in the division.
Chapter 75.
To teach midwives in what manner live embryos should be treated when they exit in an unnatural way.
It is necessary that the midwife know at the beginning the form of natural childbirth by its signs, and that is when you see the woman strain in the lower parts and desires to smell the air, and on top of that is relieved by that which is above her of the birth, and hastens the exit of the embryo, then you know that this birth is according to the natural form, and it is the exit of it on its head, and the afterbirth with that or suspended or hanging from the umbilicus.
Therefore, when you see those signs, then it is necessary that her belly be compressed so that the embryo descends easily, because when they descend on their head, they leave the afterbirth, and it is cleansed of those superfluities with good purification.
But that which is otherwise is an unnatural and unfavorable birth, because when the embryo is exited on its feet and its body is exited before its head and its feet, and one of its hands, or at its foot, or its head and one hand are exited, or at its belly, and is quickly turned on its neck, resembling those unfavorable forms.
Therefore it is necessary for the midwife to be wise and skillful in all these matters, and to guard herself against error and deception.
And I am showing all the forms of those, and what skill is in those so that it may be signified by that and be established on that.
When the fetus is exited head-first through natural exertion, and this is strenuous for the woman and the birth is difficult, and sometimes her strength is already weakened, then make her sit, or have the women support her, and evaporate her genitals with cooked fenugreek and moist oils.
Then the midwife inserts a small, flat spatula between her labia and with it splits the secundina (afterbirth), or scrapes it with her fingernail until it is free of moisture. And press the woman's belly until the fetus descends.
But if it does not descend, then it is necessary that the woman be clysterized with a mucilage of chickpea and a mucilage of fenugreek with wine.
And then, after the clyster, order her to be compressed and make her sneeze with a sternutatory; and hold her mouth and nose for an hour, for the fetus will be expelled immediately.
And if the two hands of the fetus are expelled at the beginning, then you must reduce them gently little by little. But if it does not obey the introduction, then place the woman on a stool and raise her legs, and then shake the stool on the ground; and the woman should be held so that she does not fall from the shaking.
And if the hands are not returned inside and the fetus dies, then incise them and extract the remainder of the fetus, or tie its body to its hand with a cloth and extract it gently, for it will be expelled.
When the fetus is on its feet, then you must push them upwards, and gently turn the fetus, and then grasp it, and then take one of its feet and extend it gently little by little.
But when it has come out between the thighs, then you command her to strain, and make her sneeze forcefully, for it will be expelled if God wills it.
And if it is not expelled with what we have recommended, then you return the fetus little by little until you place it according to its natural position, for then it will be expelled easily.
And if it is prevented by everything we have recommended, then take mallow mucilage and dissolved gum, and pound it all well in a mortar, and then apply this to the vulva of the woman, at the very bottom of her belly. And then make her bathe in lukewarm water, up to her hypochondria (the area below the ribs).
And when you see that the lower parts are softened, then make a fumigation of myrtle for her and apply it to her. And when she has had the fumigation for an hour, then make her sit on a chair, and then make her sneeze and hold her mouth, and lift her up, and press the lowest part of her belly with gentle compression, for the fetus will soon be expelled.
Thus [extract] the fetus laterally, holding it with one of your hands. Let [the reduction] be skillfully done by hand; but if you cannot reduce it, then raise the woman and make her walk.
And if she cannot walk, then make her lie on the bed, and shake her thighs with violent shaking, and then administer poultices which I have recommended made of mucilage.
And if childbirth has begun, then make her sit on a stool, and then work on the reduction by hand, and grasp the fetus according to its natural shape, and make the woman sneeze and command her to strain until it is expelled.
Thus [extract] the fetus over the neck, spreading your hands, and its face is towards its mother. Let the midwife hold the hand of the fetus and then gently rotate it, and let this be done easily.
And when it is grasped, then place on its neck that which we have recommended of oil and mucilages.
And then instruct her to cough gently, and when you have done this, then make her sit on a stool and command her to lean to her right side, and then command her to strain; and make her sneeze with a [suitable] concoction. The prepared fetus exits sideways.
When the mother's horror subsides according to this method, consider, and then you incise the secundines with your fingernail until the moisture is evacuated.
And if the fetus is suspended around its face and neck, then you incise it at the umbilicus, so that it is not retained and dies.
And then push the fetus into the birth canal until you place it as it should be, and tell the woman to strain several times, and it will be expelled easily, if God wills it.
The exit of twins or multiple fetuses. Know that twins are often born, and sometimes three or four, but that is rare and seldom happens; but there are causes for this in nature, and they do not live.
And they share, even if they are multiple, a single placenta, and they are separated by a membrane, distinguishing them within the umbilical ligament of each one. And sometimes they are expelled as a single fetus by easy natural delivery, and sometimes they are expelled by difficult delivery as we have recounted.
And if any of their births are difficult and reach the point of unnatural presentations that we have described, then treat them as we have recounted.
And if the midwife is skillful and does this with ease and skill, and with patience, and is ingenious according to every presentation, as she is prepared to manage with skill leading to health.
Concerning that which is formed in the womb from embryos and is aborted.
Sometimes one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, or more than ten are formed in the mother.  And it has been verified by me that one woman aborted and expelled six, and another ten, all formed, which was determined by the measurement of the glorious wise men.
And all this must be within the knowledge of the midwife, because it often appears similar to this, and therefore she must oppose it with what is necessary.
Chapter 76.
On the extraction of the fetus when it is dead.
When you treat a dead fetus with what we have said in the division of medication, and it has not yet been expelled, and you are forced to operate with your hand, then you must consider if the woman is of sound constitution and is not afflicted with any of the conditions that threaten her with danger.
Then the woman should be placed on the bed on her side, her head inclined downwards, and her hips raised.
And the attendant should hold her from both sides, or she should be tied to the bed so that her body does not extend during the extraction of the fetus.
And then you moisten the mother's vulva with warm oils and a mucilage of mallow, fenugreek, and linseed.
And then let the midwife anoint her hand with those oils and mucilages, and gently introduce her hand into the mother, and then search with her hand for the place where the umbilical cord is attached to the fetus.
And convenient places for this: then you consider if the fetus is positioned to descend head-first, and then you grasp the umbilical cord at its eyes, or neck, or mouth, or palate, or under the chin, or at its clavicle, or in the appropriate places on its shoulders, or under its hypochondria.
But if the descent is feet first, then at the heel, or in the middle of the back.
And it is necessary to hold the umbilical cord with the right hand, and place its curvature in the space between the fingers of the left hand, and introduce the hand gently and place the umbilical cord in one of those places which we have mentioned, until the empty space is reached.
And then place and fix another umbilical cord in opposition to it, or a third if necessary, so that the traction is equal, and there is not extension only along its straightness.
Rather, it should be manipulated on all sides, so that its expulsion is eased, just as it is done in a tooth extraction.
And it is necessary in this case that the extension is softened; and if any part of it is retained, then it is necessary that the midwife lubricate some of her fingers with oil and skillfully insert them and loosen what is retained with them.
Therefore, if the part of the fetus is expelled, then the umbilical cords should be moved to a higher position; and do this until the entire fetus is expelled.
But if the hand is delivered before the other, and it is not possible to reduce it because of its constriction, then it is necessary that a cloth be wrapped around it; and then extract it until it is entirely delivered, and incise it either at the joint of the hand or at the elbow.
And thus you should proceed with the other hand and with both feet.
But if the head of the fetus is large, or experiences constriction during delivery, or if there is accumulated water in its head, then it is necessary to insert a spatula between the fingers and puncture the head to extract the water, or to break it open with an instrument which is named “alundat”, the form of which will come with the forms of the other instruments in the chapter which is next.
And similarly proceed if the fetus has a naturally large head: and then it is necessary to incise it with a scalpel, or to grasp it with forceps as we have said; and then extract the bones with forceps.
And if the head is delivered but constricted at the clavicle, then it should be incised so that the moisture which is in the feet is drained.
But if it is not complicated, nor does it obey delivery, then you should incise the head immediately as much as is possible for you.
And if the lower part of the belly is abscessed or dropsical, then it is necessary that you perforate it until the moisture which is in it runs out.
But if the fetus is on its feet, then its extraction is easy and its direction to the mother's mouth is easy.
But if it is constricted around the belly and feet, then it is necessary that you extract it with a cloth which you will have wrapped around your hand, and that you incise the belly and feet until that which is in them flows out.
But if the other limbs are obstructed and the head returns, then the midwife inserts her left hand; but if the mother's mouth is open, then she inserts her hand into the womb, and searches with it for the head, and draws it with her fingers towards the mother's mouth, and then inserts into it one or two fingers, and draws it out with them.
And if the mother's mouth is constricted by a hot abscess which harms her, then it is necessary that nothing be disturbed about it; rather, it is necessary then to administer the effusion of humid, oily substances. And administer plasters; and bathe the patient in waters that soften and moisten.
And if the fetus is on its side, then, if possible, let it be rotated: and let that which we have said concerning a living fetus be administered.
And if this is not possible, then let it be incised in pieces, and let it be extracted.
And it is necessary that you leave no part of the afterbirth inside.
And when you have completed all your work, then administer that which we have said concerning the treatment of the hot abscesses which might happen to the mother.
And if bleeding occurs, then bathe in styptic waters and administer the other treatment.
And I have seen a woman in whose womb was a dead fetus, and soon after that, she was pregnant again, and soon after, the fetus died again. A long time ago, an abscess occurred in his navel; and it swelled until it was opened, and it began to discharge pus.
And I was called to his care, and I treated him for a long time, and the wound did not heal.
Then I applied plasters of strong attraction to him, and I extracted a bone from him; and after some days, I extracted another bone; and I was greatly surprised, since there should not be bones in the belly.
And then I considered that they were bones from the dead fetus.
Therefore I cleansed the wound, and extracted many bones from him, the woman being in good condition, and she lived in this way for a long time, with a little pus draining from him.
And I did not consider this to be strange, but because in this there is knowledge and help, so that the skillful physician administers cure with his hand.
Of the forms of the instruments that are necessary to extract the fetus.
Form of the incision with which the mother is opened:
This is the form of a constrictor in which the limbs are bound, which constriction has two incisions at the two ends of two poles. However, this incision should be finer than the constrictor, and be made of ivory or boxwood.
And let the width of each piece of wood be about two fingers, and the thickness of each be about one finger, and the length of each be one and a half palms; and in the middle space between the two pieces of wood are two fittings of the same wood which are already fixed, of which the length is half a palm and a little more, and the width of each is about two fingers, or a little more.
And these two additions are inserted into the mouth of the mother so that she may be opened with them when you turn the two aforementioned incisions.
Another form similar to that one, but more subtle and lighter:
Let it be made of ivory or boxwood, in the likeness of forceps. However, at its extremity there are two additions like those you see, and the length of these additions is about one palm, and the width of each is two fingers.
And when you want to open the mother with these, then you make the woman lie on the bed with her legs hanging down, that which is between her thighs open. Then open your hand with the instrument as you do with scissors equally, according to the amount you want to widen the opening of the mother, until the midwife does what you want.
The form of vertigo which the ancients described:
The form of the impellent by which the fetus is expelled:
Form of the [malady/problem] by which the large head is contained/held back.  (The "2" likely indicates a superscript or annotation in the original text, perhaps clarifying "amisidat.")
And it is similar to forceps which have teeth at the end, like tongs, and sometimes it is made long like forceps according to this form, like tongs, which have teeth like saw teeth with which it is incised and held back. Form of a small ailment/problem/malady.
The form of a hook having a spine/thorn.
The form of a hook having two spines/thorns.
The form of a spatula having two ends with which the head is severed/cut off.
The form of two broad spatulas.
All these instruments are exercised, and when the types of these are more multiplied and prepared by the artisans, the easier is their operation and the more plentiful they are for the people.
And do not neglect to have these instruments prepared, for the necessity of them is not excusable.
Of the extraction of the afterbirth.
When the afterbirth is retained after childbirth, then you should command the patient to hold her breath, and then make her sneeze forcefully, and press your hand over her mouth and nostrils, and if it is expelled by this, it is good.
And if not, then you take a pot and pierce a hole in the lid and put in it herbs, opening the mother's mouth; thus with rue, chamomile,  anise,  and camomile, dried arabic gum, cassia lignea, and holy thistle. All these herbs, or some of them, should be submerged in water in the pot, and place that over the fire.
And then place a reed cannula in the mother's mouth, and hold it there until the vapor reaches the mother's womb.
And then make her sneeze as we have said, and the afterbirth will be expelled quickly.
But if after this treatment it remains and is not expelled, then you instruct the midwife to submerge her left hand in sesame oil or mallow poultice, and then introduce it into the vagina and search for the afterbirth with it; and when it is found, then take it and extract it little by little. But if it is attached to the womb of the mother, then she should introduce her hand as we have recounted, and when she has found the afterbirth, extract it little by little as instructed, so that the mother does not collapse from the violent traction. Afterwards, it should be turned to the right and left sides with ease.
And if the mother's mouth (cervix) is constricted, we have already recounted the treatment with sneezing and with the oil and herb medication.
But if it is not expelled by all the means we have recounted, then be careful not to tire yourself in repeated attempts at extraction; however, what has come out at the mother's vulva should be tied to the woman's thigh, and then cauterize it with ointment and tetrafarmaco; for this will cause it to rot in a few days and it will dissolve and be expelled.
But when it rots, a foul odor rises to the head and stomach, and this harms the patient; and then fumigations suitable for this should be administered.
But some of the Ancients have already proven the fumigation of hellebore and dried figs.
Method of instrumentation with which a woman is fumigated for the retention of menses and afterbirth:
Let it be made of glass or bronze.
And let the thin end be placed in the vagina and the wide end over the fire, and the fumigation be placed on the embers of the fire.
And let her hold that until that fumigation is consumed and then another.
Concerning the treatment of an imperforate anus in a child.
Many children are born and their anuses are not perforated, which are very narrow and obstructed. Then it is necessary for the midwife to perforate that narrow passage with her finger; and if not, perforate it with a sharp instrument, and be careful not to touch the rectum.
Then place wool soaked in wine and oil on it; and then treat it with ointment until it is healed.
But if you fear that it is obstructed, then place a cannula in the opening for several days, and remove it when the child wants to defecate.
And if anal obstruction occurs due to the healing of a wound or abscess; then it is necessary that that consolidation be incised, and then it should be treated with what we have said about treatment and lead (possibly referring to lead-based ointments).
Concerning the treatment of fistulas that develop below (presumably, in the anal or perineal region).
The fistulas that develop in the lowest part are nodular and thick, which develop near the anus externally or in the space between the buttocks.
And it is one fistula or several.
And when that nodule is old and discharges a watery white fluid or fine pus, and sometimes some of these fistulas are penetrating.
And those penetrating ones are known because of what comes out of them through discharge and flatulence; and sometimes the patient experiences discharge, and worms easily emerge from them.
And sometimes these fistulas penetrate into the space leading to the bladder, and into the meatus of the penis; and some penetrate into the hip joint and into the buttock.
And what distinguishes a fistula penetrating into the rectum from one that doesn't, is that you insert your finger into the rectum, and insert a thin probe of brass or iron into the fistula when there is no tortuosity.
But if there is tortuosity in it, then insert into it a thin probe of lead or horsehair until you feel the probe or hair on your finger.
And if you do not feel it at all, nor does anything emerge from the opening, neither discharge, worms, nor flatulence, as we have said, then know that it is non-penetrating, and then attend to its cure.
And when the fistula penetrates into the bladder or into the meatus of the penis, then its sign is the passage of urine from it, and prohibition of it so that the place may be consolidated with medicine.
But if it penetrates into the joint of the hip or into the bone and causes pain in the surrounding area, then its sign is that the probe penetrates thus far if there is no tortuosity in it into the bone, and pain in the circumference of the area; and that from it there is always foulness; and that medication is of no use in it, nor is it consolidated with ointment.
And in all those penetrating fistulas there is no complete cure, and the treatment of these is the work and vanity of foolish physicians on which they are fixated.
But in that which is not penetrating and not chronic, healing with iron is hoped for, according to what I shall recommend to you, and this I have already proven.
And it is that the patient lies between your hands on his back and raises his legs towards you, his thighs inclined towards his belly, and then introduce a lead or bronze probe, if there is tortuosity in the fistula, until you know the place where the probe penetrates.
And if the patient feels pain around the anus, then you must insert your finger into the anus.
And if you feel the probe itself penetrating on your finger, besides what you feel between your finger and that fistula or flesh, then you know certainly that it is penetrating; and then do not work on it, for there is no cure in that, as we have said.
However, some say that it is healed slowly in some men.
And of the medication by which help is hoped for him, it is that you ignite a fine cautery according to the width of the fistula, as is preceded, and introduce that ignited cautery into the fistula until it reaches around the anus; and then repeat this two or three times until you know that all those fleshy, fistulated parts resembling a bird's feather quill are cauterized.
And then treat it with poultices wrapped in linen until all the cauterized flesh sloughs away, and then treat it with flesh-generating and consolidating medicines; and if it is healed, good; and if not, then it will not be healed at any time by any other cure.
And if the probe enters, but does not penetrate to your finger which is in the anus, and between that and the probe there is a thick layer of flesh or fistula, and you see the fistula in such a way that it is the surface of the skin, then dry the skin from the beginning of the fistula, and you will dry it with the probe; and it shall be in the fistula until the incision reaches the place where the end of the probe arrives, and through the probe it is freed and removed.
And then cleanse those fistulated tissues that resemble a bird's quill, and let no part of them remain.
But if you see a flow of blood come between you and your work when you cauterize those tissues, then the best and lightest instrument is to cauterize with fire or with a sharp medicine, because cauterization with fire achieves two good things: that is, cauterization of those affected tissues, and the staunching of blood and drying of the humors.
And then treat it with poultices wrapped in linen or crushed cloth until the place is clean, and then treat the wound with ointments that generate and consolidate firm flesh.
And these are medicines in which there is stypticity and desiccation; when then it is restored, it is healed and we do not fear recurrence.
But if the fistula penetrates to the rectum and is elongated from the surface of the body, then insert your finger into the rectum and examine it with that.
And so if you feel the probe and between you and it there is a covering of fat or flesh, and it is close to penetration, then it is not an operation in itself but according to faith and hope. (This implies the outcome is uncertain and relies on a positive prognosis)
Which condition requires one of three approaches: either cauterize it as we have said; or dry it until you reach its cavity so that you can insert the poultices and the cure is closer; and do not proceed excessively with incision so that you do not cut the muscle containing the rectum, and that this happens to the patient against their will; and then treat it with what we have said because it will heal quickly; or elongate that covering and clean it after drying it near the anus, as we have said, either with a probe or another instrument with a sharp tip, and then clean those fistulous tissues which are in the incision where you can with cauterization; and then strive to make the restoration of the entire wound with incision, and if the orifice above is not consolidated, and the fistula remains open in the rectal area, it will be easier for the patient. And sometimes the fistula ends in this way: when you insert the probe into the fistula, and it is in the side of the anus near the surface of the body with the tail and in the margin of the anus, then take a probe with a perforated tip, which is like a needle for preparing stitches in this form:
and insert it into that fistula wrapped with five threads or around them; and then insert a probe with thread into the fistula until you reach its cavity.
But if it penetrates the margin of the anus inwards, then you pull the thread from that hole so that you insert your finger into the anus; and pull out the end of the thread and tie the two ends together, and tighten each one, and leave it for a day or two, and when you cut the thread into the flesh, tighten it well until those tissues are cut which are between the two ends of the thread and that they fall away.
And then treat the wound until it is consolidated and healed.
But if the opening of the fistula is not penetrating, then make it penetrate, in whatever way is prepared for you, except that it should be in the preon, because you should not do it so as to cut the muscle; and then treat it with that until it is healed.
The form of the pointed probe with which the fistula is probed: its curvature is very sharp and the other part is not sharp, so that it does not cut what is unnecessary, as sometimes happens.
Of the suturing of hemorrhoids from which blood flows during their incision.
Hemorrhoids are of two kinds, for either they are between the buttocks, similar to charcoal, or they are like bunches of grapes. And of these, there are small and large ones, and blood flows from them constantly, and there is one, and there are many, and they are outside the anus, and at its extremities.
However, those that are outside the anus are according to the months of little humidity, from which flows a citrine liquid or a little blood with continuous flow, and they are according to the color of the body.
And the treatment of that which is inside the anus is that you command the patient to strain and to push until the anus comes out and the hemorrhoids appear to you. Then you should seize and suspend them with hooks or hold them with your nail, and then incise them near their roots.
But if the hooks cannot hold them because of their humidity and softening, then take them with rough cloth or with cotton or with a wool pledget, and extract them with your fingers, and then incise them and sprinkle on them some hot powders near the incision, so that they act on them in place of cautery; or cauterize them as was described in the chapter on cauterization. And then treat them with the other treatment until they are healed.
And if the anus does not obey the expulsion, then you should  stimulate the patient with a  stimulant which has slight biting properties, and it should be washed with that water which is in the anus and which should slightly obey expulsion when the patient strains.
But if the hemorrhoids are outside the anus, then their cause is slight, and it is that you should take them with your nail, or that you take them with a hook, and incise them, and then treat them with what we have said until they are healed.
And that which you have incised, you must suture it in this manner: take wrapped thread and insert it into a needle and then pull the hemorrhoids to the upper parts, and make it penetrate with the needle into the root of the other part, and wrap the two ends of the thread in the lower part of the needle, and it should be laterally; and tighten the hemorrhoid with a strong constriction, and then knot the thread and remove the needle.
And do this to all of them, and leave one of them unstitched, so that the superfluity of blood may flow from it.
And then place on the anus a cloth soaked in rose oil or cerate; and place that on the anus and command the patient to rest. And then leave it until it falls off; and when it has fallen off, treat it with ointments or with other cures until it is healed.
And since they are old and that medicine is not effective, then you must scrape them with the point of a spatula or with your fingernail until they are moist and the crust above is removed, which prevents their consolidation; and then treat them until they are consolidated.
Then remove them with more forceful scraping than the first time until they bleed much and are excoriated; and then treat them until they are healed.
Know that a whitlow, that is, a felon, is nothing but a round sore according to the color of the body, similar to the head of a carnation, and is found throughout the body and especially in the parts below the feet and in the fingers, and from these, pain arises from the inflammation.
And then it is necessary that what is in the circumference of the felon be incised, and it should be held with forceps or with a hook, and be eradicated from its root; and then treat that.
And if you wish, cauterize it according to what is prescribed in its chapter.
But a wart is a small, rough, fistulated, round eminence on the surface of the body, and many times it appears on the hands of children.
And its cure is that you extend and incise it, or that you tie it tightly with thread or with a hair so that it falls off. And if you wish, cauterize that, as we have said, with fire or with a sharp medicine (caustic substance).
But a mole is a small, rough or fistulated, large eminence on the surface of the body, growing much in the pubic area, and when the cold finds it, it is felt in it similar to the bite of an ant, and it is made around the body (or, "all over the body").
And its cure is that you take a cannula of goose quill or vulture quill, and it should be strong, and place that over the mole until the circle of the cannula contains the parts of it; and then rotate your hand with the cannula until you incise what is in the circumference of the mole, and you place that into the depth of the flesh, and you eradicate the mole from its root.
And if you wish, do this with a bronze or iron cannula according to this method:
Let the upper part of the cannula be drawn out to a thinness, blunt (that is, non-perforated), wrapped so that the grip of it might be facilitated and its rotation.
And if you wish, cauterize the mole as was previously mentioned in the cauterization of a boil in the chapter on cautery.
Concerning the form of the instruments that are used to give a clyster.
Sometimes a clyster is made of silver, or of brass, or of molten or hammered bronze; and sometimes it is made of these instruments, small and large, according to those to whom they are administered, for that which is administered in the cure of small children should be small; and for those whose rectums are fragile or painful, the clysters for them should be small.
The form of a large and a small clyster:
The head of the cannula above, to which the bag is tied, should be wide in this manner; and there should be a distinction where the bag is tied, as you see.
And the lower extremity, which is inserted into the rectum, should be blunt (that is, not open) and very smooth, tapering to a point; and on one side of it there should be two holes, and on the other side one hole, and the size of the hole should be according to the thickness of the [patient's] rectum, and slightly larger.
And the bag, in which the medicines are placed, should be made of an animal's bladder or sheepskin, and its length should be one palm.
And it should be perforated with many holes, as it is rolled up; and the space between the holes should be the width of a finger.
Then insert into those holes strong, raw linen thread, about ten threads, or thereabouts; and tie the bag with it; and when the bag is placed in position, tighten it at the head of the clyster tube between two points with strong compression, and then cauterize each hole:  The way to cauterize this is to fill the bag with the medicine, which should be warmed according to the patient's tolerance; and be careful that it is neither too hot nor too cold.
Then the patient should lie supine on their back, raise their legs, and place a cushion underneath, on which are placed cloths or a blanket; then lubricate the tip of the clyster tube with oil, or egg white, or fenugreek mucilage, or something similar; then insert it into the rectum easily; then the attendant should take the bag and squeeze it with both hands and forcefully until all that is in the clyster is evacuated into the bowel; and then remove the clyster tube and the patient lowers their legs.
And if the medicine forces a bowel movement, hold it as long as possible; and if they sleep with it all night, it is more beneficial.
But if you use this clyster for diseases of diarrhea and the bowel movement troubles them, then repeat the clyster until they are healed.
And if there are hemorrhoids or painful abscesses in the anus, then the clyster tube should be very thin and soft, like those used for infants.
On the treatment of wounds.
I have already said in the section on wound treatment what was appropriate for the book, and I will now describe the treatment of those wounds with hands and medicines according to what is suitable.
Therefore I say that wounds are diversified according to what causes the wounds and according to the location on which the wounds occur.
And the causes by which wounds are often made are such as a stone throw, or an incision from a sword or knife, or a blow with a lance, or with a club, or with an arrow, or similar to those from many causes.
But the wounds that are in the locations of the body are such as a wound which falls upon the head, or the neck, or the feet, or the belly, or the thigh, and similar to those of other limbs.
And I am recounting the treatment of some wounds so that you may apply that reasoning and rule to other wounds.
And I will begin with simple head wounds, for the discussion of compound wounds will come at the beginning of the third chapter.
Therefore I say that when a simple wound occurs on the head and there is no fracture, then consider: if it is from a stone throw or the like, and it has only bruised the scalp and is a large wound, and you fear the occurrence of a hot abscess in that patient, then you should immediately bleed him and phlebotomize the cephalic vein, and do not delay this; and extract blood from him according to his strength unless some reason prohibits phlebotomy, especially if the blood that has flowed from the wound is little.
And let the phlebotomy be on the opposite side from the wounded part; and guard the patient from repletion and from wine and from heavy foods.
But if some cause prohibits bloodletting, then let his diet be reduced and he should not approach meat or wine.
And place on the wound, if a hot abscess occurs in him, a linen cloth soaked in rose oil alone or in wine in which something astringent has been steeped.
But if there is certainty of a hot abscess, then place on the wound, if it is recent, its own blood, and the air has not changed that powder which I will shortly recount.
And if the air has already changed that [wound], then apply some ointment until it is healed.
But if the wound is large or is from a sword cut or similar, and its lips are not brought together by themselves, then bring them together with sutures, according to what I shall recount concerning their suturing.
But if the wound has already exposed the bone and hangs, and there is not retention of it but only a small suspension, then incise it and then treat the wound with medicines and restore the flesh properly in place of the bone, and command the patient to be fed on foods which are not coarse: heads and strong cooked meats and similar, until it is healed.
And if you find putrefaction in the bone and it does not adhere to the bone, then you incise all that which is rotten and remove it, and then treat it.
But if in these wounds there is an artery or vein from which a flow of blood might occur, and it is not stopped by medicines, then you search for the artery, and if you find it uncut, then you cut it with a spatula, or tie it; and if necessity compels you that what we have said does not suffice, then you cauterize until the bleeding is stopped.
And if these wounds are simple and small, then their cause is slight; thus you sprinkle on them this powder, for it consolidates them before the air alters them.
And the manner of the powder is this: take olive oil one part, dragon's blood two parts, unslaked lime three parts; let all be well crushed and sifted, and with it let the wound be filled, and let it be bound with a good bandage until it adheres well to it, and is coagulated with the blood.
And then bind it above with small bandages and leave it, and do not unbind it while it is thus, that it is not festering, for the medicine is not removed from it until it is healed.
And sometimes it does this alone with heat, when you do not have olive oil and dragon's blood at hand.
And do this same operation on large wounds when it is necessary that it be placed on them and they are stitched, and they are fresh wounds with their blood, which the air has not altered.
And if the air has altered them, and especially when it is in summer time, then this powder is not intended to be applied, but rather treat those with what we have said, in such a way that you apply digestive ointments on them, or that you place on them powders of barley flour with water and honey until they shed pus; and then treat them with the other treatment until they are healed.
But if a fracture in a bone happens with the wound, and it is small, then you extract it with tweezers.
And I will describe the treatment of head fractures in what follows.
Of the neck wounds.
But if the wound happens in the neck, then there is no difference in medication between it and a simple head wound.
But if the nerves of the neck or an artery are incised, then if it is a nerve, there is nothing to be done but to avoid treating it with something that causes strong stypticity, such as vitriol and things similar to it, because they are harmful to the nerves and constrict them. And do not apply anything cold to the wound, because the substance of the nerves is cold, and their continuation is with the brain, which is the highest of all the members.
And if it is cured with light medicines, such as being washed with fresh water, sometimes infused with rose oil or without, and  incense when washed with fresh water and other minor remedies in this manner, and moist ointments.
But if the wound is large, then administer sutures, or draw together its edges, and then treat it with powders until it is healed.
But if the wound is deep or there is pus at its lowest point, then perforate it at the most depressed point.
But if an artery has been incised in the wound and there is a flow of blood, then separate or cut it, or tie it, or cauterize it if necessity requires it.
But if the vertebrae of the neck have been incised, or all, and the veins of the neck have been saved, then you should align the edges of the wound with sutures over the cervical spine and do not touch that; first equalize it and return it to its natural shape, and then tighten it with a suitable bandage, and leave it for a few days; and then treat it with ointments that possess styptic and healing properties until it is healed.
But if the wound has damaged the bone, then clean it, and if there are bone fragments in it, extract all those that you can; and what you cannot remove, leave it until the wound suppurates, and is separated and the injury is relieved.
And if the wound is recent, then sprinkle upon it the powder which has been recommended to you. But if a fistula has formed in the wound, then treat it with that of which the recollection will come later in its chapter.
If it is a wound from a lance or a knife, and you see its depth, then consider further if there is a puffing up from the wound when the patient breathes; then know that the wound is mortal.
And if it is not deep and the wound is recent with its own blood, then you apply powder to it in the first hour, and do not bind it tightly lest the blood be retained in its depth and return to the heart and kill the patient, but apply attractive ointment, and unbind it twice a day.
And if the ointment is not at hand, then place old linen on the opening of the wound so that it draws out what is there of humors; and make the patient sleep on the wound so that what is contained therein flows out.
But if three days or more have passed since the wound and it has not caused the patient spasms or tremors of the heart, or constriction of the throat, and you see his other conditions are good, then know that the wound is safe; and then treat it with caulks and with other treatment until it is healed.
But if its healing is delayed, and it remains open for a long time, then know that a fistula has formed; treat it then according to its chapter.
And if the wound is from an incision of a sword or knife, and is simple on the surface of the foot or leg, then treat it with what has been previously described for sutures, if it is large, or with powder, if it is small.
But if it has caused damage to the bone, and pieces of it are already detached, then you should clean the wound and try to extract those pieces, if they are separated. But if they are not separated, then leave them until the wound is cleaned, so that their extraction is easier.
And for other accidental wounds in other limbs, the method of treatment is the same as what we have said.
Of wounds of the abdomen.
The illness which happens in the abdomen is either great, or small, or moderate.
And a small rupture is made difficult in another way, and it is so that their reduction is more difficult, if you do not take care of their replacement immediately, because it opens and swells, so that their entry is made difficult.
And therefore the best rupture is moderate, because in that one the reduction of the intestine is not difficult, as it is difficult in the two species previously mentioned.
And know that the suturing of the abdomen is according to four methods, but two sutures are common which are suitable for the suturing of other wounds of the body.
And two other sutures peculiar to it are used for other wounds, but however they are more appropriate in the suturing of the abdomen.
And I recount to you each one with explanation and clarification.
Therefore I say that when the wound is small and some part of the intestine has protruded through it, and it is difficult to reduce it, then this is in one of two ways: either because of the smallness of the rupture as we have said, or when the intestine has become inflamed by the coldness of the air.
And therefore when this is so, then it is necessary that you warm it in such a way that you submerge a sponge or cloth moistened in lukewarm water alone, or that you boil it in water with squill, cyperus, and spikenard, and bathe the intestine with it until the inflammation is resolved.
And sometimes it is done with something that has astringent properties, and it is better than water alone in resolving the inflammation.
And so when you see the inflammation to be resolved, then you moisten the intestine with water in which mallow and marshmallow have been boiled, for by this the entry of it is eased with little trouble.
But if the return of it is hindered despite this treatment, then incise the rupture a little with an instrument with which hemorrhoids are incised.
And the first treatment is better, when it is proper that there is no incision, and there is no need to dry it because of necessity and debility.
Of the instrument, this is its form:
One part of it is sharply curved, and the other part is not-sharp, and the extremity is thin, and not with the thinness of a spatula, rather it is somewhat blunt.
And thus, when the wound is widened and the intestine protrudes, then its reduction should be according to its natural form, in its proper place, if possible, for that is better.
But when the rupture is wide, and is in the lower part of the belly, then you should make the patient lie on his back, and raise his legs higher than his head; and if it is in the upper part of the belly, then you should raise his head and feet higher than the lower parts.
And similarly, if the rupture is in one of the two sides of the belly, then always direct your attention and consideration to this, so that the side in which the wound is located is higher than the other.
And thus you should administer this in large wounds and in medium-sized wounds.
And in small wounds, place what you have prepared, and then let the assistant, between your compassionate hands, hold the entire rupture with his hand and adjust its lips, and then uncover from that side to that side so that the suture is somewhat further away.
And this is the common method of suturing: first you take the needle, or several needles according to the size of the wound; then leave the width of your ring finger from the edge of the rupture, and thread the needle, ensuring you don't put thread in the two ends of the suture, with the two ends of the thread that is under the suture of the inner parts, until you make it penetrate that part; and you have already added two ends of the suture and two ends of the thread, and this makes four points.
Then tighten with double thread in the needle's circuit, and sometimes from both sides together, and then bring together the two edges of the wound with a decent approximation; and then leave the width of a finger and place another needle there, and then tie this with thread as you did with the first needle; and do not cease doing this with the needles if necessary until you have completed the entire closure of the wound.
And let the needles be of medium thickness, neither too thick nor too thin, for thin needles cut the flesh too easily; and thick ones are difficult to thread, therefore they should be of medium thickness.
And the needle should not be inserted too deeply into the two ends of the suture, so that the flesh is not excessively cut and the wound does not open before it heals.
And the sutures should not be too long, lest the wound be prevented from healing.
Then cut off the ends of the needles so that they do not harm the patient during their sleep; and you will place over the suture finely powdered material from all sides, which will hold the ends of the needles; and leave them there until you know that the wound is healed.
And this type of suture with needles is most convenient for small wounds, because one or two needles, or thereabouts, suffice for their suturing.
But the second suture is common: and it is that you stitch the four ends, of the wound and two ends of the flap, at once, with a needle around which a thread is wrapped, even in thinness and thickness.
Then, when with the needle you have penetrated these four ends, return the needle to the same side from which you began, so that the drawn thread may fall from the uppermost part to the wound, so that the suture is like a cloth stitch with which cloths are tightened.
And place between each stitch the width of the little finger.
And this suture is known to men.
And with such a suture I sewed up the wound which had happened to a man in his belly, which had been wounded with a knife, and the disruption of the wound was more than a palm, and two palms of intestine had come out from the middle of the wound, and the disruption was in the middle of the member; and then I reduced it after the intestine had been outside the wound for twenty-four hours.
And the wound was consolidated in the space of fifteen days or thereabouts, and I treated him and he is healed; and afterwards he lived for many years, and remained in his usual state of health.
And the other physicians had judged that he would not be healed; and it was by a miracle that he was, for I did not treat him with ointment, because it was in a place where ointment was not found nor any medicine, but I placed old linen on the wound twice a day and washed it frequently with honey water until it was healed.
But I will describe two kinds of sutures proper, according to the account of Galen (Paraula likely refers to Galen, a prominent ancient physician whose works were highly influential in medieval medicine).
And it is that you begin with the suture of the chain, and insert the needle from the outside to the inside.
And so when the needle penetrates the chain and into that same laceration according to its width and length of the whole body, leave the end of the thread in which you have inserted the needle; and make it penetrate at the other end, the needle from the inside to the outside at the other end of the half. (This is a description of a surgical suture technique; the language is quite technical and requires understanding of the procedure to translate accurately).
And when you have made that penetration, then you make it penetrate again at that same end of the half from the outside to the inside; and leave the end of the thread that is in this stitch, and make the needle penetrate at the other end from the inside to the outside. (Continuing the description of the surgical suture technique).
And make it penetrate with that penetration with which you make it penetrate into the thread at the end of the half which is on his side until all of that penetrates. (This sentence continues the technical description of the surgical stitching, and the meaning remains slightly unclear due to the archaic language and the medical procedure being described).
And then begin on that same side and sew that with the end that is of the thread in the other stitch, and extract the needle from the chain which it penetrated, and then return it into that chain and sew the end of the thread which is on the other side with this end of the half; and extract it from the chain which is on his side. (This continues the detailed, step-by-step description of the surgical suture technique.)
And do this once and again, and do this one time then another time until you sew everything that is outside according to that example. (This completes the instructions for the surgical stitching, indicating repetition until the wound is fully closed).
And the sum of this manner of suture is that you sew with a leather suture with which you sew skins, in such a way that you sew the thread once from the part of the end of the chain, and that you leave it another time until you have completed it.  (This passage summarizes the stitching technique, comparing it to stitching leather and emphasizing the method of passing the thread in and out.)
But the second type of suture, which is properly called, and this is from a speech by him and by him recounted, is that you sew it according to the similarity with which some physicians sew it, in such a way that they join each part to its corresponding part in a manner convenient to nature; and they apply the end of one to the other and the end of the half to the other end, and this is done as I have recounted to you. (This describes a second suture technique, referencing a physician's method focusing on joining corresponding parts of the wound naturally.)
So that you place the needle at the end of the half near you from the outside part, and make it penetrate to the inside part in that sole, and leave two ends of the thread; and then turn the needle and make it penetrate from outside to inside through the two ends of the thread. (This gives detailed instructions for a step in the surgical procedure, describing needle placement and thread manipulation.)
And then turn each of them, and make each penetrate from the inside part to the outside part through two other ends of the half that are on the opposite side. (This continues the surgical instructions, describing the manipulation of the needle and thread to close the wound.)
And this manner of suture is better than the common, light suture, and it is the suture of which I previously made mention. (This compares the described suture technique to a simpler method, asserting its superiority.)
This is the speech of Galien.  (This identifies Galen as the source of the described surgical technique.)
And moreover, I would say to some, the suture of the belly is rectified with two needles, that is, that you insert into each of these a thread, and begin with the insertion of the needle from the side which is towards you, and make it penetrate to the other side according to the suture of those who sew hides similarly. (This describes an alternative suture technique for closing an abdominal wound, using two needles and comparing it to the stitching of leather.)
And know that when the disruption is in the middle of the belly, then the suture of it is more difficult than in other places of the belly. (This explains that suturing a wound in the center of the abdomen is more challenging than in other areas.)
But the judgment of the medication of a wound is the judgment of other wounds. (This states that the principles of treating one wound apply to others as well, indicating a general approach to wound care.)
The reason is that when you clean the fresh wound with its blood before the air alters it, and reduce the intestine and sew it and prepare it decently, then place on it incarnative powder. (This describes the treatment of a wound: cleanse it immediately, reduce any protruding intestine, stitch it closed, and then apply a powder to promote healing.)
And if the air has already altered the wound, then place on it certain ointments which are present with you until they form a hard scab and the threads fall out, and are consolidated with ciphac and myrrh; and then cure it as is the cure of other wounds until it is healed.  (This explains the treatment if the wound has already been exposed to air: apply ointments to promote scabbing, using ingredients like ciphac and myrrh, and then continue with standard wound care until healing is complete.)
But if you do not have the medicines present, then immediately place on it, as soon as it begins to discharge pus, old lint, and change that twice a day, as you have been taught, until it is healed, for you do not need other medication in many situations when the wounds are simple. (This offers an alternative treatment if the necessary ointments are unavailable: use clean lint to dress the wound and change it twice daily until healed, stating that this is sufficient for many simple wounds.)
But if you fear that the wound will communicate infection to the principal members, then it is necessary that you submerge lamb's wool in good quality soaked oil, or in rose oil, and place that in the area around the places that are between the armpits and below the armpits. (This advises a preventative measure if there's a risk of the wound spreading: soak wool in oil and place it around the armpits to prevent the infection's spread to vital areas.)
And if you feel pain or putrefaction in his intestines, for many times this happens, then cauterize it with black, warm styptic wine, and especially if the putrefaction has reached the intestine and an exit wound has been made penetrating into its cavity. (This instructs to cauterize the area with styptic wine if there's pain or infection in the intestines, particularly if the infection has penetrated the intestinal wall.)
And know that that which is of the large intestine is of easier healing than that which is in the small intestines.
And it is of difficult healing because the intestine which is called "jejunum" does not receive healing from a wound which falls upon it at all; and this is because of the great multitude of veins which are in it and because of the magnitude of those which are in it, and because of the subtlety of the body of that, and because of the proximity of that to the nature of nerves. (This explains why wounds to the jejunum (a section of the small intestine) are difficult to heal: the abundance of veins, the delicate nature of the tissue, and its proximity to nerves hinder healing.)
But if that which proceeds from the wound is the web (likely referring to a membrane or tissue), and you obtain it fresh, reduce it according to your skill with which you reduce the intestines equally. (If a membrane is protruding from the wound, the instruction is to carefully and skillfully reduce it back to its proper place, similar to how the intestines would be repositioned.)
But if it has passed through the space and has already become green or black, then bind it with a bandage over the place that is blackened, so that a flow of blood comes, for in the web are veins and arteries. (If the tissue has become necrotic (green or black), the instructions are to apply a bandage to promote bleeding, as the affected area contains veins and arteries.)
And then incise that which is beyond that ligament, and place two ends of the bandage hanging down from the part below the wound outside it, so that the traction of it towards the falling of the web and emission of the arm of the wound may be relieved upon you. (Incise the tissue beyond the ligament and let two ends of the bandage hang down to relieve tension and prevent further protrusion of the affected tissue and the arm of the wound.)
A reminder of wounds when they happen in the intestine. (This is a heading or title indicating the following text will discuss wound treatment pertaining to the intestines.)
When a rupture occurs in the intestine and it is small, then it is possible that it may be restored in some men, because of this, for I saw one who had been wounded in his belly with a lance thrust, and the wound was on the right side of the stomach, and the wound was old and had become a fistula, and from it came pus and flatulence. (If intestinal rupture is small, it might be repairable, as exemplified by a case of an old, fistulized lance wound to the stomach that drained pus and gas.)
Then I pursued his cure, although I was not confident in his recovery, but I continued to treat him until he was healed and the place was consolidated. (Despite low expectations, the author treated the patient until the wound was fully healed and the area consolidated.)
And I, having seen the place now consolidated, feared for the patient that some accident of illness might befall him in his belly; and no such ill accident happened, and he returned to his usual disposition, eating and drinking, and then entered a bath and was exercised in his limbs.  (After the wound healed, the author worried about further abdominal complications. However, the patient recovered well, resuming normal diet, bathing, and exercise.)
And some experienced [people] have said that when a wound occurs in the intestine, and it is small, then it should be tied in this manner: and that is that you take ants with large heads; and then adjust the two lips of the wound and place one of those ants that has its mouth open over the two lips of the wound; then when it bites those and clenches its mouth, cut off its head, because it adheres and does not dissolve. (Experienced practitioners suggested using large-headed ants to close small intestinal wounds:  place an ant's open mouth across the wound edges, then decapitate it to keep it firmly in place.)
And then place another ant next to the first, and do not cease to do this with ants, one next to another, according to the size of the entire wound. (Continue placing ants along the wound until it is completely closed.)
And then reduce [the intestines] and sew the wound; and let those attached heads remain in the intestine until the intestine is healed; and no harm will befall the patient. (After the ants close the wound, reduce the intestine and stitch the wound, leaving the ant heads in place until the intestine heals, causing no harm to the patient.)
And it is also possible that the intestine be tied with fine thread which is made from the intestine of an animal, since it is thinner in needle; and that is that you take the end of these intestinal threads, and it should be very thin, and then tie its end with its thread, wrapped, and then thread that thread into needles and sew the intestine with it, and reduce that [intestine] into the disruption [or rupture]. (Alternatively, the intestine can be sewn with fine thread made from animal gut.  Prepare the thread carefully, then sew the intestinal rupture using a needle, and finally, reduce the intestine back into place.)
And this method of suturing with ants is only a matter of trust and hope. (This ant-suturing method is merely a hopeful, uncertain approach.)
But if the wound is large and wide, especially if it is in one of the small intestines, then this is only a palliation, and not a complete healing. (However, if the wound is large and particularly in the small intestine, this technique only provides temporary relief, not a complete cure.)
On the treatment of fistulas and fistulae. (Concerning the treatment of fistulas.)
Know that every wound and abscess, when it ages and becomes old, and forms an ulcer, and is not consolidated and discharges pus continually and is not excised, then, in whatever member it may be, it is universally called a fistula, and we call it a *zukem* (or *azukem*).
And a fistula, in truth, is a hard, white, knotted swelling, which is painless and has a concavity like the concavity of a bird's claw; and for this reason it is called a claw-like ulcer, that is, a claw.
And in some people it is moist, discharging pus; and very quickly the moisture is exuded in a few hours. And sometimes this moisture is thick, and sometimes thin, and sometimes coarse, and sometimes fine.
I have already shown all those causes, and their signs, and their treatment with medicines, in the division (of the text).
And it is necessary that I make known to you the treatment of fistula, which is done by means of a manual operation.
And know that fistulas occur in all the members of the body; for there are fistulas that reach the large veins and arteries, or the nerves, or the diaphragm, or the intestine, or the bladder, or one of the ribs, or one of the vertebrae of the back, or one of the joints composed by composition, such as those of the hand and foot; and those that damage the proximity of the principal member and its likeness.
Therefore, that one of these fistulas which is according to this manner is one of the diseases of difficult healing, and does not receive treatment, and occupation with it is work and ignorance.
And if there is one of the fistulas whose depth does not reach those places that I have mentioned, and you hope and trust in its healing, and want to arrive at knowledge of it, then take a probe of brass or iron, and if the fistula goes straight, and search for it with it.
But if the fistula is tortuous, then investigate it with a subtle lead probe, because lead, with the lightness of its body, is easily bent along the tortuosity.
And if the fistula has many horrific passages, it is not possible for you to determine its course with a probe.
Then, inject a clyster into the orifice, because the liquid by which you inject it will go through the other orifices and clean them.
And then inquire carefully, in what manner it is possible for you to know if there are bones or nerves here, and if the depth of the fistula is far or near, or if it is a fistula which has many orifices, and be upon this entirely with the sum of your strength, with your questioning, with which you question the patient, and the discovery of the pain through your compression with the hand over the place, and the resemblance of the signs and accidental causes to the abscess.
And when you have considered all those causes with true judgment, then proceed to the cure with confidence: and it is that you consider then if it is a fistula apparently near or in a safe place, far from a joint, or from a nerve, or from an artery, or from a vein, or from one of the places which I have told you.
Then you dry the fistula as was said before in the description of it, and remove that which is in that filtration and of corrupted flesh, and that which has grown in the orifice of the flesh, or of the skin and the like, and cure it until it is healed.
But if the fistula is of great depth, and is straight, then it is necessary that you incise it in the front as much as is possible for you, and then cleanse it of all its corrupted flesh; and then apply cauteries wrapped in sharp medicines, and introduce them into the depth of the fistula, which you have grasped with an instrument.
And do this several times until the sharp medicine corrodes all that is rotten in the depth of the fistula from the corruption.
And then restore it with ointments which engender healthy flesh until it is healed.
But if it is not healed by this, then you cauterize it as we have recounted.
But if the cause of the fistula is bone and you are certain of this, then you should investigate it and dry it out as we have recounted, if you do not prohibit any cause from a vein or nerve or principal member, as we have said.
But if the bone is exposed to you and there is some corruption and blackness in it, then you scrape it until all the corruption is removed; and then treat it with something that will cause it to grow new flesh until it is healed.
And if it is not healed and discharges pus as it did before, then know that you have not achieved the total eradication of the corruption; and then uncover it again and carefully perform the scraping and cleansing with your utmost strength, and then restore it.
And so if it is healed, good; but if not, then know that the corruption is in the deep recesses of the body, which has not been reached, and then for you in that case there is nothing to do but leave it.
And if the corrupted bone is small, or it is possible for you to pull it out, then pull it out with fine forceps which are suitable for this.
And if there are many bones, then carefully remove all of them, and with your strength leave none of them behind.
But if some of the moisture causes you difficulty, and there is no fear or error in their incision, then incise those ligaments or flesh if they are there, and free the bones.
But if you are not ready to remove the bones at this time, then place on the wound something that will suppurate the wound, and leave it until this reaches the area around those bones of flesh and ligaments, and keep the wound from healing, and keep the incision that you made in your operation constricted.
Furthermore, if you fear, place on it a cotton ball submerged in crushed rosemary with oil, or a cotton ball submerged in Egyptian ointment, or in any of the green ointments, because when those ligaments are suppurated, and the bones are separated from them, their removal and extraction is easier.
But if it is a large bone, such as a leg bone or thigh bone or similar, and only its surface is corrupted, then scrape it with a rasp only on the surface until the blackness and corruption are removed, and then restore the wound.
But if the corrupted part is large, and the corruption has already reached the marrow of the bone, then it is necessary to close that and completely incise it to the place where the corruption has reached, and then treat it until it is healed.
And I recount to you what happened to a man in his thigh, so that you may use this as an example and aid in your operation.
There was a young man, about thirty years of age, who suffered pain in his thigh, and from the inner parts, pus had spread through the body until it reached the thigh; it was a matter of an abscess, a large abscess, and there was no external cause for it.
And then time passed with this due to the error of the physicians, until the abscess was opened, and much matter flowed from it, and its treatment was delayed until the leg was fistulated, and many orifices were formed in it, all of which discharged pus and the humors of the body.
And then many physicians treated him for about two years, and there was no improvement in his condition, until I was called.
And I saw his leg and the matter running from those orifices in great quantity; and the body of that man was all swollen, and his color was jaundiced.
And then I inserted a probe into one of those orifices and it reached the bone.
And then I examined all the orifices and found them to extend to all parts of the leg.
And then I considered and incised one of those orifices until I exposed a part of the bone, and I found it corrupted, and it was already earthy and corrupt and blackened; and a part of the leg was already corrupted to the extent that it had penetrated to the marrow.
And then I sawed off what was exposed and prepared of the exposed bone.
And I thought that in the bone there was only that corruption which I cut away and sawed off, and I had already removed it.
And then I applied the restoration of the wound with consolidative medicine for a long time, and it is not consolidated.
And then I iterated and uncovered the bone a second time over the first uncovering, and I found continuing corruption in the bone.
And I sawed off what appeared to me of that corruption, and then I was thwarted in making its cure and restoration, and it is not restored.
And then I uncovered it again and did not cease to incise the bone little by little, piece by piece, and I was thwarted in its restoration, and it was not restored until I incised about a palm's breadth of it, and that I extracted with its marrow, and then I restored that with medicines, and it is slightly consolidated and healed.
And further iteration in its operation and section is not necessary except for the disposition of its fragility and for the paucity of its tolerance and its fear of death, for it suffered at all hours from syncope due to the superfluity of evacuation.
And therefore it is healed by a whole healing, and nothing is in place of the hard bone flesh; and its disposition in its body is made good and its strength returned; and it is preserved in its dispositions and suffered no impediment in walking nor harm in any respect.
But if it is a prominent bone in a place already excised, then you must excise it in this manner: that you take a ligature and bind it tightly to the extremity of that prominent bone, and command someone to extend it upwards; and place another woolen ligature thicker than the first; and then tie it over the flesh which is below the bone, and extend its extremity so that you pull the flesh to the lower parts, and you uncover the flesh over the place which you wish to saw so that the saw does not injure the flesh.
And place wood or a board decently under the bone, for when you do this, the saw is not prohibited from cutting the corrupted flesh.
And it is necessary that the sawing be over the corrupted place little by little, for if corruption is in the concavity of the bone and does not appear in its outward aspect to the touch, then force a sawing of it another time.
And if the bone is corrupted and not prominent, with one part continuous with the other, and the corruption is in the middle or part of it, then you uncover the flesh from all parts completely; and then place wood underneath, and then saw it from the first part where the corruption is until the sawing is continuous with the other part.
And let the sawing be according to the location of the corruption, little by little, as we have said.
And if the corruption is in the joint, incise that corrupted joint, and saw the bone where it is continuous with the other part.
And if the corruption is in the continuation of two joints, then there is no reason for it but ingenuity (or skillful intervention).
And if the corruption is in the bone of the hand or foot, it is very difficult; however, you must inquire into the corruption in whatever manner appears to you, and you must open it, and clean it according to any disposition which is possible for you, and with every tool it should be rectified for you, when no vein or nerve opposes you.
And know that the incisors and saws for incising these bones are many according to the location of the bones, and the preparation of them, and the thickness of them, and the subtlety and size and smallness of them, and the hardness and their rarity; therefore it is necessary that you prepare for every kind of operation an instrument convenient to that operation.
And know that this operation signifies to you the type of instrument of which you should make use; for with you is great study and long and extensive knowledge of the methods of this art, and testimony of types of illnesses, because then you already have for yourself that which is convenient in the instruments for every illness.
And I am providing you at the end of this chapter the number of instruments which you will keep as simple ones, with which you will proceed to your operation which you will practice on the others. Form of saw:
Form of another saw:
Form of another large saw:
Shape of a ray (or spoke, or beam): Let the head of this ray be according to the shape of a star-shaped key head, and its points be according to the shape of the points of a [presumably, surgical] awl.
And it is only necessary that with this [instrument] the heads of the joints are rubbed when they are corrupted, or the mouth [wound/opening] is very wide.
Shape of a smaller razor:
Shape of a broad razor:
Shape of another saw decently made: let it be made of the strongest arc [bow/curve] and its sharpness of iron, and its member [handle?] of wood, a pointed handle decently made. Its shape/form:
Shape of a razor which has a concavity:
Shape of another, subtle razor:
Shape of another razor with a curved end:
Shape of a small razor similar to a tentacle:
Shape of another, smaller incisor:
Shape of another incisor; this one resembles a ray, and its end is like a saw, and it is used in many places in the treatment of bones:
Shape of a ray which is suitable for the treatment of those who have perforated bones:
And its end is triangular and sharply pointed.
And it is made of Indian iron, and similarly, it is necessary that all the things we have said about razors, and incisors, and saws.
Concerning the incision of extremities and the sawing of bones.
The extremities may become diseased either by intrinsic or extrinsic causes; or if you have treated that corruption with those medicines and the treatment is ineffective, or you see the corruption spreading through the limb without being caused by anything, then you must incise that limb to the point where the corruption has reached, so that the patient may escape death or a greater impairment of the limb.
And the sign of this which happens is that the limb becomes black as if fire had already burned it, or the blackness spreads until that decay reaches the limb so that it affects and consumes the entire body; and then treat it with an incision.
Similarly, if the cause of the corruption is the attack of some poisonous creature, such as a sea scorpion, a viper, or a spider, and the like.
And if the corruption or the attack is in the extremity of a finger, then you incise the finger and do not give space to the corruption so that it spreads to the hand.
And similarly, if it happens in the hand, then you incise it at the root of the palm, and do not give space to the corruption so that it spreads to the forearm.
And if it affects that [the forearm], then incise the arm up to the elbow joint.
And if the corruption passes beyond and you see it around the elbow, then in that case is the death of the patient; and to administer any other remedy beyond that is of little virtue.
And similarly, if corruption affects a toe, then you incise it up to one of the ankle bones.
And if it takes hold in the heel, then you incise the whole foot. But if it ascends into the knee, then you incise the leg up to the knee joint.
And if the corruption has already reached the knee, then there is no remedy for him but dismissal, and to leave the patient to death.
And the manner of incising or sawing off a limb is that you tighten a ligature on the lower part which you wish to incise, and tighten another ligature above the location; and let an assistant stretch a ligature on the lower parts, and let another assistant stretch a ligature above; and you separate the flesh which is between the two ligatures  so that all the flesh is exposed; and then let it be incised or sawn off.
And it is necessary that a linen cloth be placed on all parts so that it does not touch the healthy area, and that the patient receives a suitable lesion and a hot abscess.
But if you encounter a flow of blood while operating, then you carefully cauterize the affected area, or apply some powders that staunch the blood; and then return to your treatment until it is completed.
And then bind the injured limb with a suitable bandage, and treat it until it is healed.
And I recount to you what happened to a man in his foot, this same accident which I have recounted to you, which is that a blackness occurred in his foot with a burning that resembled a fire burn.
And that corruption occurred first in his toe until it affected the whole foot.
And then that man prepared himself because he saw the cure going to the limb with such vehemence that he found himself in pain and burning, and he incised that foot up to the joint, and it healed.
A long time later, the same corruption occurred in the index finger of his hand.
And then he came to me, and I tried to repel that superfluity with what I applied to his hand in medicines, to purify his body; and the superfluity was not repelled and began to spread to another finger until it reached the hand.
And he asked me to incise his hand, but I did not want to do that, hoping for the repulsion of that superfluity, and more so fearing death from the incision of his hand, because the patient's strength was failing.
And after he left me, he returned to his land, and it was reported to me that that man prepared and incised his whole hand, and he was healed.
And I have included this narrative so that it may be helpful in cases of this disease, and that it may serve as a sign by which it may be recognized and according to which it may be treated.
Concerning the treatment of sinuses and the quality of clyster administration with medicines.
When an abscess occurs in any fleshy member and the space of the abscess is prolonged until it forms a collection of pus, and then it is broken open and perforated, and the pus comes out of it, and the place remains empty, as if it were a vessel, and the skin that is over it is thin like a delicate cloth, and it has not reached further corruption, and does not impinge on the bone or nerve or ligament, it is called a sinus, and not a fistula.
However, if the space is prolonged to the point that the corruption affects some member, then it is called a fistula and not a sinus.
And the treatment of it is to incise that skin completely, especially when it is thinned and made like cloth, and to ensure that it does not adhere to the place because of its corruption.
But if you suspect that the skin adheres and that the corruption has not spread further, and there is a swelling of the skin, then you treat that with a clyster.
And it is that you consider the sinus, and then if it is large, and the pus that comes out has a foul odor, then clysterize it with an Egyptian medicine, which is made of oil, sour wine, and resin, taking equal parts, and they are mixed in a vessel, and they are cooked over the fire until the medicine becomes thick and reaches the consistency of honey.
And then you take what is necessary of it and dissolve it with water and honey; and clysterize the sinus with this, and constrict its opening, and leave the medicine in it for the amount of two hours.
And then extract that with a syringe; and do this for as many days until the sinus is cleansed and the stench is removed.
And sometimes it is clysterized with lye water, when this medicine is not present to you; and it is that you take the ash of vines, and put water on it; and then strain it and clysterize with it until you are certain that the sinus is then clean.
And if the patient does not tolerate the Egyptian medicine or the lye water, then clysterize it with water and honey and some crushed resin mixed in, and clysterize with wine and honey mixed, for it is the property of honey to cleanse and wash, and the wine makes it adhere to the sinus, and especially when the wine has an excess of astringency and dryness.
And when you have done this several times and are sure that the sinus is now clean, then clysterize it with something that causes the flesh to grow there.
And it is that you take diafinicon ointment and dissolve it with rose oil and astringent wine; or that you clysterize it with other medicines and ointments that have the properties which I have already written about in the treatise on ointments.
And if the orifice of the sinus is narrow, so that the clyster cannula cannot be inserted, then you should gradually widen it with a small iron instrument, and place a caulked plug wrapped in Egyptian ointment or basilicon ointment inside until it is widened.
And similarly, if the orifice is wide, then you should bring its lips together with sutures and leave an opening sufficient for the clyster to enter without addition [of force/widening].
And if the orifice from which the pus flows is located high up, then dry the lowest point of it so that the pus will flow downwards, for when the pus is contained within the depth of the sinus, flesh will not be generated there.
And if it is not possible for you to dry the sinus to the lowest point as you wish, then I advise you to prepare the limb with a preparation by which the pus flows lightly as it is prepared, and that no pus is retained.
But the cloth that is over the orifice of the sinus, this you should change every hour so that what is collected there from the pus can be removed. And so that you may know if the pus that flows is much or little, or is digested, or is undigested.
And with this, you should examine the location of the sinus, whether the patient feels pain there or not, and if there is an abscess there.
And as your treatment continues in this manner, and you see that the matter discharged onto the orifice of the sinus is already adhering, or is about to adhere, then, on the third day, loosen it; and when you loosen the dressing, change the cloth to another and renew the ointment.
But if near the sinus there is a subtle poison, then do not despair of its adherence, for its healing approaches, for there are some men in whom the generation of flesh in their wounds is slow, and there are others in whom the opposite occurs.
And if undigested pus has issued from the sinus for many days, then you should know that the sinus will not adhere; and if the adherence of the sinus is delayed and the cause is prolonged, then you should adjust to the drying of the medicines; and if the medicines are moist in their substance and in their effect,  they are dried like diafinicon ointment when excess zegi is added to it.
And the best remedy with which it is cured is to take diafinicon ointment and dissolve it in rose oil, and let old wine be added to it, equal in amount to its substance, and mix that with it, and use that.
And it resembles that action, when there is no pus, diafinicon ointment, honey cooked until thickened, and use it; or take myrrh, aloes, and incense, grind it all, and powder it over the honey while it is on the fire, and then apply this to a cloth and bind it over the sinus; and apply this with honey which you have cooked until thickened, and powder it on a cloth and bind it.
And sometimes aristolochia longa and roots of lily of the valley (and it is lily of the valley) and barley flour and centaury are administered with it, and use these simples or compounded ones, grind them, sift them, and powder them over the honey which has been mentioned; and use it.
And if the sinus is prolonged, and is not healed by this treatment, then know that the corruption is in the depth of it, and it has already spread to the bones or other hard members or ligaments; then treat it with a fistular treatment, as has been said above.
Concerning the treatment of paronychia, and of the worn nail, and of the added incision of the finger, and of the section.
Paronychia is an abscess which arises under the nail of the finger or toe of the hand or foot, and quickly spreads to other fingers, and as it is prolonged and its treatment is neglected, or it is suppurated by a hot abscess, or it is corrupted, and pus is discharged until it corrodes the root of the nail, and quickly corrupts the whole of it, and quickly its corruption penetrates to the bone until there is a fetid odor to it, and the extremity of the finger becomes swollen, and its color becomes dark.
And therefore when you have treated it with what we have said in the division and you do not succeed in your treatment, then it is necessary that you incise with an iron all the superfluity which remains of the nail and then cauterize the wound there, for a hot cautery is very helpful in this.
But if the bone is sound and the nail is healthy, and the additions of the nail, being empty, now compress the flesh at the parts within, and begin to prick and injure it, then it is necessary that you place a thin blade under the angle of the nail which pricks the flesh, and push it up and incise that flesh easily, and place on that which remains of the flesh corrosive medicines until all is removed; and then treat that with ointments until it is healed.
But if the corruption has already penetrated the bone, then it is necessary that you incise that bone and extract it, for it will never heal if the bone is corrupted within.
And if you see the corrosion and corruption spreading in the finger, then you incise it at one of the joints according to what is prescribed in its treatment, and then cure it until it is healed.
But if the nail suffers percussion or abrasion, and there is vehement pain in it, then it is necessary that you first phlebotomize the patient, and then cut the nail with a sharp instrument with a transverse section from above downwards, and be careful that the section does not reach the flesh which is beneath the nail, for you will cause the patient vehement pain, and it will be a cause of the generation of superfluous flesh in the place; and then treat that place with whatever relieves pain.
But a finger, which is born in the hands of some men, is very quickly fleshy, and very quickly bony, or very quickly develops a nail.
And some of them are born at the root of the joint, or their birth is at some joint of the fingers. But that which is born at some joint of the finger does not hurt, and that which is born in the joints is very quickly painful.
And of those that are born fleshy, the section is easy, and it is that you incise that one below its root with a broad instrument.
But of that which is born at the root of the joint, the cure is difficult; and therefore guard yourself from its excision.
But in that which is born on a finger between the joints, it is necessary that you first incise its flesh with a round incision down to the bone, and then saw it with one of those saws suitable for this, and then cure it until it is healed.
But a consolidation which happens to the fingers between their joints, either by the birth of a man born thus, or by the consolidation of a wound or by burning with fire, or similarly, then it is necessary that you separate that consolidation until the fingers return to their natural form.
And then place between them cloths soaked in rose oil so that they are not lightly consolidated, and separate them, or place between them a thin lead plate until it is consolidated as is necessary.
And similarly, if consolidation occurs in some fingers with the palm, then you separate that consolidation according to what is prepared and suits the shape of the member.
Concerning the incision of vices, there are several.
Vices are varices, and they are twisted, thick veins full of melancholic superfluities which appear in many parts of the body, and most frequently in the legs, and especially in the legs of travelers, laborers, and those who carry burdens.
Then it is necessary that you administer a purging of the body of black bile several times with a strong expulsion, and then bleed the patient from the basilica vein.
But the cure of them with iron is according to two methods: one is that they be incised and that black blood be drawn out, and the other method is that the vein be elevated and completely extracted.
The incision is done in this manner: first bathe the leg with very hot water until the thick, feculent blood of the leg is resolved. Then bind the patient's leg, from the upper part of the thigh to the part below the knee, with a bandage. Then incise the vein in one, two, or three places with a wide incision. Then draw the black blood with your hand from the lower part of the leg upwards and downwards until the quantity you desire and which you deem sufficient is released, and which will remove the strength of the disease from the patient.
Then bind it up, and instruct him to abstain from foods that generate black bile.
And repeat the treatment by phlebotomy when the veins are full and this harms the patient.
But their elevation is according to this manner: you who shave the patient's leg, if there is much hair on it, and then place them in a bath and bathe their leg with hot water until it reddens and the veins are distended; or, if a bath is not available to you, that the limb be warmed by vigorous exercise, until the member is heated.
Then incise the vein on the straight part of the vein by a longitudinal incision, or behind it below the knee, or at its lowest point below the heel.
Then open the vein with an incision and scrape the vein completely until it bleeds and it is from this appearance that you see that redness changing to black.
And then, when you open the vein, you see that white which is like a cord.
Then you place a ribbon underneath so that it is raised and separated from the vein, and suspend it with a golden hook.
Then make another incision near that incision for three fingers' breadth, and scrape the vein from the part above the vein until it bleeds.
Then raise it and incise it at the back near the heel, and then pull it out and raise it until it comes out through the second incision, and then pull it out from the incision that is above it.
And do this until you extract it from the incision that is highest or most superior of all the incisions, until it is all removed; and then incise it.
And if it does not obey you to be extracted and elevated, then insert a double-pointed strong needle and tie it and extract it, or insert a ribbon underneath and move your hand in every direction until it is released. And be careful that it is not incised; for if it is broken, it is made difficult for you to elevate it and it becomes a harm to the patient.
And when it is all removed, then place on the wound site wool soaked in rose-scented wine and olive oil and un-scented olive oil, and treat it until it is healed.
And if the intestine is constricted, having a tortuosity where it is coiled in the parts, and it is not straight as we have said, then it is necessary that you make an incision upon it in every part of its tortuosity and in the places of its coiling, and then suspend it with hooks until you elevate it entirely.
And be careful in your incision that you do not cut the vein and that you do not injure it, for it will be difficult for you to elevate it; and use your prudence in this.
The form of the incision with which the intestine is cut:
It is not sharpened like the hooks, nor is it of a sharp point so that it does not injure the vein; and it is of a thick, flexible lion [likely meaning "lion-like," referring to its strength or possibly a material], for if it were thin, it would cut the vein because of its thinness; therefore it has a superfluous thickness as we have said.
Of the extraction of a vein from the leg.
This vein is engendered in the legs in hot lands, such as al-Ategi in the land of the Arabs, and in the hot and arid lands of India, of little moisture, and in which neither grass nor trees grow.
And it is quickly engendered in other parts of the body besides the legs.
And its generation is from putrefaction that comes from under the skin, just as serpents, worms, and scabies, and worms engendering between the skin and the flesh, come from within the body.
And a sign of the onset of this vein is that a vehement inflammation occurs in the leg; and the area is blistered; and then the vein begins to emerge from the place of that blister, which resembles the root of a plant.
And when its extremity appears, then you should wrap around it a piece of lead weighing one drachm to two drachms, and bind it and leave the lead suspended from the leg.
And as many times as some cause from it appears outwardly, wrap it in lead and bind it. And if the growth is prolonged, then you incise a part of it and wrap the remainder; and do not incise its root until it has emerged, for if you incise it, it is retracted and enters the flesh and causes an abscess and putrefaction in the area and a bad ulceration.
Therefore it must be treated gently and extracted little by little, until it is expelled from the bottom and no part of it remains in the body.
And from this vein has come forth in some men that is in its length of five palms and fingers, and it has already reached me that one of twenty palms issued.
And if it is incised at the time of its medication, then insert a probe into its opening and perforate it with a long opening into the body, until all that is in the matter is evacuated, and treat the putrefaction of the place for some days with medicines; and then cure it according to the treatment of abscesses.
And this vein sometimes has many branches, and especially when it appears at the joint of the foot or in the foot, and many orifices come to it, and a branch comes out of each orifice.
And therefore cure it as we have said in the division and with what is said above.
Concerning the incision for worms generated under the skin, and it is called bovine illness.
This illness is called in some lands near us bovine illness because it often happens to cattle, and it is a small worm which is born between the skin and the flesh, and it goes throughout the body, ascending and descending, and it is felt by its movement from limb to limb until it breaks the skin and comes out.
And its generation is by the putrefaction of certain humors, just as worms and serpents and earthworms and ascarids occur in the belly.
And it is feared for its malice, for when it goes into the body and is elevated to the head, and has reached the eye, then very quickly it opens it and enters and destroys the eye, and this happens many times.
Therefore, when you wish to cure this and extract it, then it is not done except by its movement and appearance felt, and then it is necessary that you tightly bind that which is above it and that which is below it with strong binding and constriction, and then cut over it and extract it.
And if it is deeply embedded in the flesh and you do not find it, then you apply a cautery with fire to the place until it dies, and the greatest cause that is feared is its corruption, by which it corrupts the place as we have said.
But if you see it has reached the head near the eye, then bind above the eyebrow with a strong constriction, and then cut above it, and extract it; and it is necessary that the patient use purification of their body with medicines evacuating bad putrid humors, and guard against foods generating putrefaction.
Concerning the incision/operation for the illness nafir (a disease name, likely requiring further context for precise translation).
This illness is called nafir in our land, and it is a pain which comes in some limbs, and then is moved from limb to limb.
And I have already seen that, as I will recount to you. I was called to a sick woman in a village, and I uncovered her arm and saw a small swelling in the superficial vein of the arm, and after it was warm for an hour, I saw that swelling move like a worm climbing upwards, but more lightly than one would fear, as if it were quicksilver when it runs from place to place.
And then the pain left that place and fixed itself in the muscle, and remained there for about an hour.
And then it ran to the other side until it reached the other arm.
And then I remembered that it was moving throughout her body, as I had seen; and I was very amazed by its change of location and its speed from limb to limb. And I had seen this before with my own eyes in this manner, however I have seen many who find pain shifting from limb to limb. But I did not see it with my eyes as clearly as in the woman.
And I thought that this was so because the woman was old, with a dry body and exposed veins, and in this case, that wind-like sensation was easily perceived as it moved.
And it is necessary that it not appear, according to this treatment, in those who are robust and have moist bodies with well-hidden veins.
And if you want to cure him, and the patient feels that pain, but it is not apparent to your eye as we have said, then you press on that place lightly and dryly until that constricted wind-like sensation is expelled, and cauterize the area.
But if you do not see it with your eyes, then you treat it with rubbing of the body and with things that expel winds, and drive them out with foul-smelling pills and pills of serapium and the like.
On the extraction of arrows.
Arrows are diversified according to their types, and according to the places in the body where they fall, for their diversity is that some have large points, and small ones, and concave ones, and blunt ones, that is, solid ones; and some that have three angles, and some that have barbs; and some that have feathers.
And of the signs of the brain, if an arrow falls into it and pierces the bone and emerges from the cranium which is above the brain, for this causes a sudden and vehement headache, and scotoma (blurred vision), and vertigo, and redness in the eyes, and inflammation and redness of the tongue, and spasms and confusion of the mind, and vomiting of bile, and quickly speech is lost and the voice is destroyed, and a white humidity resembling pus emerges from the wound, and pus from it similar to the watery substance of flesh.
And therefore, if these signs appear to you, then abstain from treatment and from the extraction of the arrow, unless it is outside.
But the signs of the arrow when it falls into the heart, which is near the left nipple, are that it feels as if it were stuck in something hard, and not in something empty; and quickly the movement of the arrow is similar to the movement of the pulse, and black blood flows from the wound, and there is coldness of the extremities, and cold sweat, and syncope; and therefore know that death approaches without any doubt.
And the signs when the arrow has wounded the lung are the emission of frothy blood from the wound, and the vessels near the neck are swollen, and the patient's color is changed, and he breathes with great difficulty, and desires the inhalation of cold air.
And if the arrow falls into the diaphragm which is in the chest, the pain is then near the lower ribs, and the breath is labored with vehement pain and with sighing, and not all the muscles of the limbs are paralyzed.
And if the arrow falls into the stomach, then very quickly some undigested food comes out of the wound.
And if the arrow falls into the abdomen, and is stuck in it, some broken tissue, or intestine, comes out of the wound, and there is no hope of cure without extraction of the arrow.
And if the arrow falls into the bladder, and urine comes out, and some matter proceeds from it to the outer parts, and there is very quickly pain upon the patient, then know that it is mortal.
But the other members, such as the face, the neck, and the throat, and the shoulders and the armpits, and the vertebrae of the back, and the clavicle, and the hip, and the leg and similar members, are saved according to the better dispositions when the arrow does not find a vein or artery and is not a poisoned arrow.
And I recount this to you, what I have seen of the nature of these arrows, so that you may signify by this concerning your treatment.
Which is the reason why, in one man, an arrow fell into the tear duct of his eye at the root of the nose, and I extracted it from the other side, below the lobe of his ear, and he was healed, and no harm befell his eye.
And I extracted another arrow from a Jew, which fell into him in the lobe of his eye, below the eyelid further below, and the arrow was already hidden and I only found a small extremity with which it adhered to its shaft, and it was a large arrow of the sharp arrows of the Turks, with an iron head on which there were no barbs.
And the Jew was healed, and no harm befell his eye.
And I extracted another arrow from a Christian man which had fallen into his throat, and it was an Arabic arrow, and this is the kind that has barbs; and then I incised over it between two guides, and it was already submerged in his throat; and then I was subtle with that, and I extracted it, and the Christian was healed.
And I extracted another arrow from a man which had fallen into his belly, and I thought that he would die from it; and then, since thirty days had passed and nothing had changed about his condition, I incised over the arrow and I pulled it out, and he was healed, and no harm befell him.
And I saw another man in whom an arrow had fallen into his back, and the wound had healed over him, and since it had been about seven years, the arrow came out at the root of the thigh.
And I saw a woman into whom an arrow fell in her belly, and the wound is healed within her, and nothing has changed in her condition, and the woman found no hindrance in any of her natural functions.
And I saw another man into whom an arrow fell in his face, and the wound is healed and the arrow broken, finding no great pain, and many similar to these.
And I extracted the arrow from the man, one of the king's princes, that had fallen into the middle of his nose and had already declined a little to the right side, and the whole arrow was hidden.
And I was called to his cure about three days after the arrow's impact.
And then I found the wound from the arrow very narrow; and then I examined it with a thin probe, and did not feel it; but he felt a prickling under his right ear, and then I suspected that this prickling was due to the point of the arrow.
And I applied a plaster to the area which has attractive and digestive virtue, trusting that the area would suppurate so that the location of the arrow would appear to me, so that I could operate on it.
And no significant accident occurred in the area that would indicate the arrow had reached that location; and I continued with the plaster on him for many days and no accident occurred; and the wound was consolidating meanwhile, and the patient refrained from its extraction for many days until one day he felt the arrow within his nose and reported this to me.
And then I applied a sharp, corrosive medicine to the wound for many days until it was opened, and with a probe I examined it, and found the thin point of the arrow, which adhered to the shaft.
And then I carefully applied the sharp medicine to the opening of the wound until the point of the arrow appeared to me visibly, and I spent time doing this for a period of four months.
And then, once the wound was enlarged, and it was possible for me to insert forceps into it, and remove it, and I did not succeed in this way, then I did not cease to refine and devise a method for this with ingenious means, until I succeeded one day in extracting it using specially made forceps, as the design of these will be shown at the end of the chapter, until I extracted it; and then I restored the wound.
And some physicians judged that the cartilage of the nose would not be restored, but I restored it and the wound was healed, and the patient was completely cured, and he suffered no ill effects.
And I recount to you the method of extraction of certain arrows so that you may make this a rule and explanation for what has not been said, for the parts of this art and its definitions are not comprehended in narration nor do books contain them.
And skilled artisans compare the small with the large; and the present with the absent; and find new operations and instruments because of the unexpected occurrences of strange causes in the art.
Therefore I say that arrows are not removed from the members in which they are fixed except in two ways: either by traction from the place where they enter; or by counter-traction from the opposite side.
And that which is removed from the place where it entered, is an arrow lodged in fleshy tissue, and it is pulled and removed.
And if it does not yield to such removal at the time it is caught, then it is necessary that you leave it for some days until the flesh around it softens, and its removal and egress are facilitated.
And similarly, if it is fixed in bone and does not yield to removal, then leave it for some days and attempt its removal with traction and movement each day, and it will eventually be removed.
And if it still does not yield after some days, then it is necessary that you perforate the bone around the arrow on all sides with a thin drill until the space around the arrow is widened, and then extract it.
But if the arrow is hidden in the body and is beyond feeling, then you should probe for it with a probe, and if you feel it, then draw it out with instruments that are suitable for its extraction.
And if you cannot reach it because of the tightness of the wound and the length of the projectile, and there is no bone, nerve, or vein in the way, then you should incise the wound until it is widened and it is possible to extract the arrow.
And if it is held by barbs, then you should free the flesh in which it is embedded from all sides with all the skill you can; and work on this, if you cannot, by removing the flesh at the barbs' fracture points and twisting them until they release.
And when you perform the extraction of the arrow, wherever it may be, then use twisting with your hand and forceps on all sides until it yields; and proceed with great subtlety so that the arrow is not broken and that its extraction is not made difficult for you.
And if you cannot manage it at that time, then leave it for some days until the parts surrounding it soften, and then try again, for then it will be easier. But if you encounter excessive bleeding, then administer the treatment described in the appropriate chapter.
And be careful about your incision of veins or nerves or tendons, and use all possible skill to extract the arrow; and do this with ease, calmness, slowness and firmness, as I have recommended to you.
And therefore, make the arrow straight so that the patient is in accordance with the position in which the arrow entered him, for this is more helpful. But if this is not possible for you, then administer what is possible according to the circumstances.
But if the arrows are protruding from the opposite side, or if any part of them projects outwards, or if the end of the arrow causes swelling and protrusion of the part above the bone, then you should cut above it; and let the incision be according to the size that the forceps can grasp; and then pull it out, for it will be easily removed in this way.
But if it is lodged in the bone, then you twist the blade against it until the arrow is released from the bone, and enlarge the opening, and then extract it.
And if not, leave it for a few days, and then try again until it comes out.
And if the shaft of the arrow is inside, then you push it through with him/her.
But if the shaft has fallen off and you want to administer an impulse, then you insert, if it is blunt, a concave instrument so that the concavity of it fits onto the end of the arrow and then push it through.
But if the arrowhead is concave, then you push it through with a strong instrument entering it, because the arrowhead is relieved by it.
And if the arrow is poisoned, then it is necessary that you remove all the flesh in which the poison is, if it is possible for you, and then treat it with what is appropriate.
And if the arrow falls into the foot, or into the belly, or into the bladder, or into the side, and is close enough that you can touch it with your finger, and it is possible for you to cut around it, then cut around it and guard yourself against cutting a vein or nerve, and extract it, and then sew the wound if necessary, and treat it until it is healed.
The form of forceps with which arrows are pulled out:
Let the ends of their jaws be like a bird's beak, which are made like a saw when they grip the arrow so that they do not release it.
And of these there are many types, large, small, and medium-sized, according to the size of the arrow and its smallness, and the size of the wound, and the tightness of the place.
like a ray, so that its entry into the concave arrow is eased and it is pushed with that.
Of phlebotomy of the veins.
The veins for phlebotomy, of which the customary number is thirty, of which sixteen are in the head; that is, two pulsating veins which are near the ears, called alhasisain; two veins that are in the two apparent temples; and two veins that are in the two tear ducts of the two eyes that are called aspicientz; and the vein prepared in the middle of the forehead, and the vein that is at the tip of the nose; and two guidegi that are at the neck; and two veins that are in the upper lip; and two veins that are in the lower lip; and — these are the veins that are called algelic —; and there are two veins that are under the tongue. But the veins that are phlebotomized in the arms are five; for of these, one is the cephalic, and it is near the wild olive; and the people call it "the vein of the head", and it is a hidden vein, and it is a mixed vein, and it is composed of a branch of the basilic, and of another branch of the cephalic; and the people call that one "vein of the whole body", and the basilic is the vein which is located in the domestic olive, and is called "citillar", and the common people call that one "vein of the belly"; and the funis of the arm, and it is located above the fold, and it is that in which phlebotomy is performed, and it is that which appears above the elbow by manifest appearance; and the salvatella, and it is the vein that is between the auricular finger and the little finger, and it has two branches in it.
And in the foot and leg there are three veins; one of these is that which is below the bend of the knee of the wild olive; and the second is the saphena, and its location is below the leg of the domestic olive; and the sciatic vein, and its location is below the leg of the wild olive; and in the leg there are other veins similar to these.
The benefit of the veins near the ears is for chronic catarrhs, migraine, headaches, and old, bad head ulcers.
And the manner of bleeding those veins is as I recount to you: that is, the patient's head should be shaved, and the patient's head should be rubbed in the occiput at the location of both veins with a wide cloth with good friction; then the patient should constrict their neck with a band until the two veins and their locations appear near the ears in two depressed locations of the head; and seek them with your finger, and if you feel the pulse of these with your finger, bleed them there carefully.
Then you take the lancet knife, and it is that which is incisive, and then you insert it under the vein in the elbow until the blood comes out. Then raise your hand with the vein and elbow to the upper parts and incise the vein with an incisive incision. And let the length of the incision be the amount of two fingers joined, or thereabouts; and let blood flow out as much as you wish.
Then bind it with powders and leave it until it is healed.
And already and previously at the beginning of the book the incision of these and their cauterization [was described].
But of the two arterial veins that are at the temples, bloodletting is beneficial for chronic and severe migraine, and persistent ophthalmia, and a body of acute superfluities poured into the eyes.
And the way to perform phlebotomy on these is as I have recounted to you: constrict the patient's neck very tightly until the two veins appear to the touch by manifest appearance and their pulse is felt beneath your finger; and then you bleed with a lancet.
Then you raise the skin above the vein at the upper part with your index finger, and insert the phlebotomy lancet underneath, and raise the vein upwards; and incise it just as you have done in the other two veins; and let the blood flow according to your need.
Then loosen the constriction of the patient, and place your finger on the vein for an hour, and then place cotton and powder on it and bind it tightly above with a strong constriction, and leave it until it is healed.
And already the recollection of them, and of their incision, and the traction, has been preceded in the beginning of the book.
Therefore, the benefit of phlebotomy of the frontal vein is for phlebotomy of the cephalic vein in old diseases of the face and for migraine, redness, and foul ulcers.
And the quality of his phlebotomy is as I recounted to you; that is, that the patient constrict his neck with a bandage until the vein appears; and then take the instrument which is named a lancet, of which this is its form:
Place the prominent point which is at the head of the lancet on that vein and strike it with a hammer or other suitable object in the manner of it, and let the blood flow according to the quantity which you wish; and then loosen the perforation of the patient and bind it until it is healed.
And sometimes it is opened with a lateral phlebotomy, however, it is not fitting that the phlebotomy be of acute extremity like the other phlebotomies, rather it should be of blunt extremity, and perform the phlebotomy across, because the bone is near and would easily break in it the phlebotomy when it is sharp.
But the benefit of the two veins that are at the lacrimal ducts of both eyes is for scabies of the eyes, for redness and swelling in the eyes, and for diseases of the face.
And the manner of the phlebotomy is that the patient constricts his neck with a bandage, and then perform the phlebotomy there, and you should be standing over his head.
And let the phlebotomy be performed across rather than lengthwise, with a small phlebotomy, because in that place there is no flesh; and if the phlebotomy is sharp, its point will be easily broken.
Then make the blood flow as much as is necessary for you, and place cotton over it, and bind it for a night, and then unbind it.
But phlebotomy of the vein of the nose is beneficial for acute fever and violent headache, and for diseases of the face and migraine and redness that occur in the face, especially when it is chronic.
And the manner of his phlebotomy is that the patient constricts his neck, and then you hold his nose with your left hand, and take a long, thin phlebotomy instrument and insert it into the middle of the nasal bridge in a straight line, because the vein is not palpable there, and because the blood begins to flow immediately.
So that you move your hand with the small phlebotomy instrument little by little and make the blood flow according to your need; and then bind it for a night, because it is lightly restored.
But the benefit of phlebotomy in the two temples is for the constriction of the throat and the beginning of leprosy and many diseases, and impetigo, and bad, corrosive ulcers, as well as herpes.
And the manner of phlebotomy in these [temples] is that the patient should tighten each side of his neck with a bandage; and the surgeon should stand over the patient's head, and the patient should be seated on a chair.
And then phlebotomize the vein lengthwise with a small, wide phlebotomy instrument little by little; and then extract blood according to a moderate quantity or according to what you see is necessary; and then do the same with the other vein.
And then untie the bandage and tighten the two veins with a moderate constriction so that the patient is not suffocated, and leave it until morning because the wound is healed.
And the benefit of phlebotomy of the alveolar veins [veins of the gums] helps with small abscesses and pustules of the mouth, corruption of the gums, bad ulcers and fissures, and bad ulcers that are in the nose and around it.
And the manner of phlebotomy of these [veins] is that you make the patient sit before you, and tighten his neck with a bandage, and then roll back his lips and look for two veins, one of which is on the right of the lip and the second on the left; and the indication of each is by the blackness of each of the two, and this is more so because in the area of these there are small, black veins; and then incise each with an incision.
But if you are in doubt, and you do not know which is which, then you should incise the larger of those veins, and the most obvious one.
And do the same for the two veins that are in the upper lips.
But of the two veins that are below the tongue, the benefit is in the phlebotomy of the cephalic vein for inflammations that are in the throat, for disease of the uvula, and for diseases of the mouth.
And the manner of phlebotomizing these is that you hold the patient between your hands facing the sun, and lift their tongue, and look under the tongue, on one side is a vein and on the other side a vein, and the color of each is tending towards blackness.
And then phlebotomize each; and be careful not to press too hard when phlebotomizing those, because beneath those are arteries.
And the veins that are phlebotomized in the elbow are those which are present in all men, and their phlebotomy is done in two ways: either by inserting a lancet or olive-shaped fleam of subtle point; or by cutting with a fleam-knife, and this is called scarification, and this is its form:
Let its width be like this, and it is suitable for opening concave, full, prominent, thick veins, and those which contain thick, turbid blood.
And this fleam is of lesser width and more subtle extremity, and is suitable for the phlebotomy of subtle veins that contain thin, citrine blood.
But the benefit of phlebotomy of the basilic vein, which is one of three veins: because it draws blood from illnesses that are below the throat and neck, and from that which affects the feet and belly.
And it is fitting for the phlebotomist, when performing this phlebotomy, that he carefully guards against it and be exceedingly cautious, because beneath it there is an artery; and if he errs and misplaces the puncture of the fleam, he will cut that artery and cause a flow of blood; therefore, it is necessary that one not phlebotomize it with a sharp fleam before it has been incised with a lancet.
And if the basilic vein does not appear manifestly, then it is necessary that you leave it and that you move to another, or that you seek some branch of it; or that you phlebotomize in its place at the end of the arm, for that is manifest; and incise it with a lancet-fleam as we have said.
But if you wish phlebotomy in the same place, then before the constriction of the arm you should touch the area until you know the location of the pulse, and then mark it with a pen; and then tie the arm and incise the vein with a concave incision with a lancet-fleam as we have said; and take care that the incision does not fall within the space of the artery's location.
And when you see, as you tighten the ligature, inflation in the place you have marked with a pen, then that inflation is inflation of the artery, and therefore avoid that.
And if you see the blood flowing in the phlebotomy like a child's urine, and the blood is thin and red, then know that it is from the artery; and then you quickly place your finger on it for a long time; and then remove your finger, and if the blood is severed, for many times it is severed, then you tighten the arm and leave it.
And guard the patient from his movement, and let there be a supervision of him and do not anger him for some days until he is healed.
But if the blood is not severed, and you see that you do not have present medicine for this, then you incise the artery, if it appears to you; because its extremity is constricted, and the blood is severed; or that you take bark of a fig tree, and crush it, and take one half and bind it tightly over the location of the vein with a descending ligature and with powders until the next day.
And then if the blood is severed, it is good; and if not, then cure it with that which is preceded in the remembrance of the place of the powders that sever the flow of blood.
And the severing of his blood is difficult in many dispositions because of the small size of the wound and the possibility of binding the arm.
But from the dark vein, phlebotomy is helpful that extracts blood from the upper part of the head and the lower part of the body; for this reason, because it is composed of a branch of the basilica and a branch of the cephalic, as we have said.
And it behooves the phlebotomist that he be very cautious in his phlebotomy, for below it is a nerve; and then if he errs in the puncture of the phlebotomy and finds the nerve, there will happen to him stupor, and its healing is difficult, and very quickly it is not healed at all. And this nerve often appears to the feeling; and if it is hidden from some men and is subtle and is not shown, then it behooves you to place the phlebotomy with which you phlebotomize with a slanting section, and avoid the nerve with your strength.
And if the vein is between two nerves, then you open the vein lengthwise.
The benefit of phlebotomy of the cephalic vein is that it draws blood from the head and provides relief to diseases of the eyes.
And it is fitting in this case, if you wish that the phlebotomist punctures with an olive-shaped phlebotomy instrument or with a myrtle-shaped phlebotomy instrument; because it is the safest of all the veins, because neither artery nor nerve lies beneath it.
However, it quickly becomes inflamed in some men, when it is not phlebotomized at the first puncture, but that inflammation does no harm.
The first of these is that you should know that phlebotomy is administered only to preserve health and for its hope and prevention of illnesses, and that phlebotomy should be performed in one of the veins that are in the elbow, that is: cephalic, median (or basilica), and basilic; and that phlebotomy should be done at the beginning of spring, on an empty stomach in spring and autumn, and in winter near mealtime, when signs of repletion appear.
And let phlebotomy be performed on the third day or the first, after three hours of the day have passed.
But phlebotomy, which is administered, more when it provokes convenience and necessity for it, either by night or by day, at any hour and at any time.
And it is necessary that a child should not be phlebotomized until they are fourteen years old, and a pregnant woman should not be phlebotomized except from the fourth month until the seventh, and the elderly who have passed sixty years should not be phlebotomized.
And if someone wants to be phlebotomized in any way, they should cleanse their bowels before phlebotomy with a clyster (enema), if they have much retained fecal matter, so that the veins do not draw superfluities into the phlebotomy from the bowels, which are putrid, and that they do not harm the principal members.
And let not patients with persistent nausea and diarrhea be phlebotomized, nor those convalescing from illness or drunkenness until this is remedied in them, nor those suffering from dropsy, and moreover, let phlebotomy be avoided near a colic attack and near vomiting, and near stomach distress, and near excessive coitus and labor and exercise, or fasts or vigils, and any cause that dissolves strength, whether bodily or animal.
And consider carefully the thinning of humors beforehand, if the blood is thick, with foods and drinks, and with medicines, if that is possible for him.
And then enter a bath if no cause prohibits it, or be exercised by some activity so that the blood is thinned.
And place the phlebotomy in the middle of the day, that is around the third hour, as we have said.
And perhaps you should ensure that the patient's feet are protected that day from all harmful accidents, both animal, such as anguish, anger, fear, and all bodily accidents, such as excessive work and exertion, and coitus, and things similar to them.
And at his bedside, let there be present things in whose use it is customary for men to use aromatics and fragrances, and balsams and similar things, according to what is possible.
And let the phlebotomist sit on a cushion that is higher than the cushion of the one who is to be phlebotomized.
Then extend his arm, and let the phlebotomist rub it with his hand two or three times; and then tighten the bandage with a strap and wrap it twice.
And let the constriction be moderate, for if the constriction is not equal, or if the constriction is excessive, then it prevents the flow of blood; or if it is too loose, then it prevents the blood from flowing out.
And before the constriction, it is necessary that the one who is to be phlebotomized rub his hands together until the veins are swollen and clearly visible.
Then let the phlebotomist anoint his fleam with a little old oil; and then place the index finger of his left hand on the vein, below the place where he wants to perform the phlebotomy, so that the vein moves slightly, and the percussion is avoided, because some veins are like a fleeing string, and should be avoided during phlebotomy, and those are full of wind, and when you place the fleam on them it contracts, and the phlebotomist is deceived; and the fleam does not open the vein, and if it opens, it is constricted.
Therefore, the phlebotomist must be careful and attentive to all these things.
Then apply the fleam; but if the vein is opened on the first attempt, that is good; if not, repeat the process below that spot slightly, or above it gently, if the area is not inflamed.
And if the area is inflamed, or the patient is frightened, then leave it for a day or two, and do not tighten the bandage, for it will quickly draw hot pus, nor should they enter a bath.
Then repeat the phlebotomy if necessary.
And if the opening is small and the blood flows slowly, and you fear that the desired quantity of blood will not be drawn, then reopen the vein in that same place,  straightening and enlarging the opening slightly, and do this gently before the area becomes inflamed, because in many men, the area becomes inflamed with even a small opening.
But if you see that it is already inflamed, then do not repeat the procedure there, for it will do no good; and place on it some part of a split olive, for it relieves the body of blood. And olive oil is better in this instance than other oils.
Similarly, administer a split olive to all phlebotomies with which you bleed the veins to prevent blood clotting, and they use theriac of Venice and  *sagzenea* (likely a misspelling or variant of a similar medication) when one of these is applied to the site, because the blood is thinned and  thick blood is broken up.
And if a large abscess forms at the site of the phlebotomy, which happens frequently, and especially to those who have only been bled once, or when the opening in the vein was small, then watch it, and apply a sponge soaked in slightly warm salt water, and compress it for an hour, because it will dissolve (the abscess).
And it is necessary to do this immediately after the bleeding from that vein, or another vein, is complete.
And if some blackness or greenness remains at the site for a few days, it does no harm; and if you wish, apply something made of dissolved aloe and myrrh, or something made from mint juice or calamint juice or something similar.
And abscesses and swellings frequently occur after phlebotomy of the basilica vein.
Then place your hand on it, and if you then find softness under your compression, then that swelling is malignant and bad; and then be careful to apply something of what we have said, because blood will very quickly flow from the artery.
And make a plaster with something that has astringent properties, so that the area is hardened, and then treat it with the other treatment until it is healed.
And it is necessary that you extract blood from each person according to the quantity of their strength and according to the color prevailing in the blood as it appears.
For if the blood is black, then you let it flow until it is red; and similarly, if you see it thick, then you let it flow until it is thinned; and similarly, if it is sharp (or thin), until its sharpness is removed.
And it is necessary for one who is full and strong and needs bloodletting, that the phlebotomy of the vein be amplified and the phlebotomy be wide.
And in one who is weak, the opposite should be done, and it is necessary to extract blood in several times, and that the opening be narrow.
And the best way to administer phlebotomy is that the section be transverse, not puncture.
And this manner of phlebotomy is safer from blood flow and nerve incision, and is more praiseworthy and safer than phlebotomy according to breadth and length.
And to which syncope is accustomed to supervene after phlebotomy, and you must treat that before the phlebotomy with a little bread infused in pomegranate wine or simple warmed oxymel; and extract the blood in three or four times.
And if there is coldness of complexion, then take before phlebotomy bread infused in syrup of myrrh or in syrup of honey aromatized with spices such as pepper, cinnamon, ginger and the like, or in an aromatized and very fragrant syrup.
And if syncope occurs after phlebotomy, and its cause is the loss of much blood, then he should drink meat broth and a very subtly fragrant syrup; and use aromatherapy with rue, and let his feet be bathed with it.
And use the other remedies that we have mentioned in the division in the chapter on syncope by evacuation.
And whoever wants to bleed his arm and dissolve his blood a second time, it is necessary for him, for whom phlebotomy is for great evacuation, and whose strength is weak, that he evacuates the blood little by little, that is according to the quantity of strength in consecutive days.
But whoever wants to bleed his arm, and shed his blood a second time, and his body is strong, then let him do this after seven or nine hours from the first phlebotomy.
But whoever wants to draw blood from his body opposite to the part to which it declines, let him be bled on the second or third day.
But that body in which there is much already heated blood, and it is sharp and causes fever, must have blood drawn from it at once, and a large quantity should be drawn, and the opening should be widened until syncope occurs, provided that you have observed all the conditions of phlebotomy; and that you place your hand on his pulse near the blood vessel, so that death does not result instead of syncope, for this often happens when the phlebotomist is ignorant and negligent.
And it is not necessary, when you want to untie the arm and evacuate the blood a second time, that, if the opening of the vein is already closed and the exit of the blood is made difficult, you press on it with vehemence and bend it slightly extended, for this is very bad.
Having left it until it is bled a second time; or remove this with the sharpness of the phlebotomy instrument which is coagulated blood in the opening of the vein; or place on it theriac alfarach, or  sage, and compress it with gentle pressure until the blood has flowed out.
And if the vein is abscessed, then leave it and do not touch it until the abscess is subsided.
And if necessity compels you to evacuate the blood a second time, and there is no excuse, then bleed him in that same place or in the other arm in another vein.
And the vein called "rope of the arm" is phlebotomized instead of the cephalic or basilic, when they are not found or are hidden, because it is composed of those [veins].
And the quality of his phlebotomy is that the patient should put his hand in warm water until the forearm reddens and the vein appears manifestly.
Then it should be bound above with a moderately tight ligature; and then phlebotomize according to the small transverse, neither latitudinally nor longitudinally.
And let the incision be wide, and perform your phlebotomy with which you phlebotomize it above the joint of the hand a little.
And if the flow of blood is prohibited, then you return the hand to the warm water and let the blood flow into the water until you achieve your need.
But if you are in the summer days, then you are excused from returning the hand to warm water, and the same is true of placing the bowl of blood in warm water in winter time.
And the phlebotomy of this vein is safer than all other veins, because beneath it there is no pulsating vein, nor nerve.
And phlebotomy of the little vein of the right hand is beneficial for liver diseases.
And the quality of phlebotomy of it is that you bind the hand with a bandage or with your hand, after you have placed it in warm water, until the vein is swollen and clearly visible; and then phlebotomize it transversally; and if you incise it completely, that will not harm in any way.
And take care not to extend your cut too far in the phlebotomy, for beneath it are the nerves of the fingers, denuded of flesh.
Then return the hand to the warm water and let the blood flow into it, for if you do not return it to the warm water, the blood will coagulate in the opening of the vein, and the flow will be impeded.
And when the blood has been extracted according to the necessary quantity, then you place oil and salt on the vein, so that it is not quickly consolidated; and similarly it is necessary that you do this in every narrow branch.
But the benefit of phlebotomy from the left hand is that it is beneficial for diseases of the spleen.
And perform phlebotomy on him similarly as you have done on the other.
And the benefit of phlebotomy of the saphenous vein is for diseases that are in the lower part of the body, such as diseases of the womb, and for the retention of menstrual blood, and for the diseases of old sores and ulcers of the thighs and legs, and for similar diseases.
And the manner of phlebotomy on him is that the patient should put his foot in warm water and rub it until the veins appear well; and bind above the joint of the foot with a strap; and the place of the vein is apparent in the hollow between the big toe and the next, and from that it is branched in many small veins on the surface of the foot.
Therefore, phlebotomize the largest branch below the leg near the heel near its articulation, for it is better and safer.
And if you phlebotomize that on the surface of the foot, then beware of the nerves which are below that on the surface of the foot, and perform your phlebotomy in such a way that you phlebotomize across, as if you wanted to incise it.
And let the phlebotomy be skillful.
But if the letting of blood is prohibited; then immerse his foot in warm water and let the blood flow into it until it is evacuated.
And if the phlebotomist errs on the first attempt, then repeat the phlebotomy a little higher, for the location is safe; and do not fear to do harm, but be wary of the nerves as we have said.
And similarly do the same to the saphenous vein of the other foot.
And of the sciatic vein, the location, as we have said, is below the heel, under the ankle bone on the inside.
And the benefit of phlebotomy for him is for hip pain when it is due to hot blood.
And the manner of his phlebotomy is that the patient enter a bath, and quickly and tightly bind his thigh from the hip to above the ankle with a long, thin bandage, for it will not appear otherwise.
And then when it appears, then you phlebotomize it according to whatever method is possible for you and according to the transverse vein, which is better; or incise it by incision or cut it by section, for its location is safe.
And it is often very hidden in many men; and if you find it, and it does not appear to the touch at all, then phlebotomize one of its branches, and that is the one that appears on the back of the foot between the little toe and the ring finger.
And beware of the nerves, and let the quantity of blood flow that you wish.
Then loosen the bandage and place a cotton pad on the phlebotomy site and bind the area tightly, for it heals easily.
Concerning cupping and the qualities of its use.
Cupping glasses are made of horn, or of brass, or of glass.
And cupping is done in two ways: one is with scarification and blood extraction, and the other is cupping without scarification.
And this cupping without scarification is done in two ways, for it is either with fire or without fire.
And the cupping glasses which are administered with scarification and bloodletting are applied to fourteen places on the body, of which one location where cupping glasses are placed is at the nape of the neck, and it is the back part of the head; and the middle of the neck on both sides together; and cupping glasses on the chin below the jaw, below the mouth; and cupping glasses on the shoulder blades; and cupping glasses on the armpit, and it is above the end of the rib; and cupping glasses on the flanks, and they are on the sides of the body; and cupping glasses on the hips; and cupping glasses on the thighs.
And cupping does not extract blood except from the small veins scattered in the flesh, and therefore it does not diminish the strength through them, as is the case with phlebotomy; nor should cupping be done with fire or without fire in any illness caused by repletion until the whole body is evacuated.
But if necessity dictates cupping for illness or for a continuous condition, administer it at any time, at the beginning of the month and at the end of it, and in the middle of it, and at any time.
Therefore, when you see any of those conditions, and especially if it is in the third or middle part of the month, then we order cupping to be done after two or three hours of the day have passed.
And the benefit of cupping the nape of the neck is that when it is applied it relieves the heaviness in the head and that which is affecting the eyes; but this should be done after evacuation of the whole body.
And this cupping is in the place of phlebotomy of the cephalic vein.
And it is not advisable to use it on someone of cold complexion, or in whom there is catarrh, for it causes great harm to such a person.
And therefore, it is not advisable to use this on the elderly, and on those whose heads suffer from cold illnesses.
But to one on whom this is continuously applied, forgetfulness is caused; and therefore you should instruct the cupper to place his hand lightly over the cupping area below, to prevent the generation of forgetfulness.
But cupping of the armpit is in place of phlebotomy of the dark vein (vena fusca) and the basilic vein: and therefore it is beneficial for asthma, and for the constriction of the throat, and for the rupture of the throat's instrument (presumably the windpipe or larynx), and for coughs, and for repletion (fullness).
And it is necessary that the armpit cupping be done slightly higher, for if it is placed lower down, it produces weakness in the body and in the stomach.
And cupping of the temples benefits pains in the head, ophthalmia (eye inflammation), migraine, suffocation, and toothache; and it is in place of phlebotomy of the basilic vein.
And you should instruct the cupper not to press his hand on the scarification, lest he injure the artery and cause a flow of blood.
And cupping below the chin benefits canker sores in the mouth, and corruption of the gums, and similar diseases of the mouth, and it is in place of phlebotomy of the arteries that are in the two lips.
But cupping that is done on the two shoulder blades benefits catarrh, which is caused by an excess of heat (or "fulness of heat").
And cupping on the two inner parts of the thighs is helpful instead of phlebotomy of three veins, that is, the basilic, median cubital (fusca - this is a less certain translation, representing a dark vein; the median cubital is a likely candidate), and cephalic veins; because it draws blood from all those smaller veins that are in the flesh, and those small veins from the other larger veins, until the attraction reaches the three veins.
And instruct the cupper not to proceed too deeply in scarification, because the place is devoid of much flesh, and there are nerves and arteries beneath.
And it is a cupping glass with which one cups above the buttocks and it benefits hemorrhoids of the anus and deeper ulcers.
And it is necessary that you instruct the cupper that it should be a large cupping glass, and that it should be of bronze, because the location requires strong suction; and thin cupping glasses are quickly broken and should be scarified with scarification.
But cupping of the legs is less preferable for evident depletion, because they draw blood from the whole body, and they benefit old pains of the joints and of the womb, and of the bladder; and they provoke menstruation, and benefit a boil and swelling; and they stand in place of phlebotomy of the two saphenous veins, and the femoral veins, and of the two iliac veins.
However, they greatly weaken the whole body and cause fainting in many men.
And of the femoral vein cupping, the benefit is similar to the benefit of leg cupping.
And the quality of the placement of the cupping glasses is that you place the cupping glass initially empty and draw by moderate suction, and do not prolong the placement of the cupping glasses, but place those lightly, and remove those carefully, and that the humors may come to the place by equal admixture. And do not cease to iterate this and continue until you see the place redden and swell and the redness of blood appear.
And then you scarify and iterate the suction little by little, and then consider the disposition of the bodies.
Because that man who is of tender flesh and rare pores, it is necessary that you scarify him once and no more, lest the place be ulcerated.
And command the cupper to amplify the scarification and probe a little, and temper the suction with facility.
And if the blood is thick, then it is necessary that you scarify twice, for in the first time the way of thinning is opened to the blood and to its wateriness. But in the second [scarification], to the scrutiny acquired from the extraction of thick blood.
And if the blood is very foul, then let a third scarification be made so that it achieves the latter [desired outcome].
Finally, when we want to extract the blood little by little or a little, one scarification suffices for us.
And if we want extraction of much blood, we make many scarifications; and if we know that the blood is thick, then it is necessary that we scarify with a deep scarification.
And the term scarification in which there is the depth of the lancet only.
And if the one for whom the lancet is thick, hard, dark, and its pores are tight, it is necessary that the places of the cupping glasses be anointed with lenitive, aperient, and resolvent ointments; if it is in summer, such as aloe oil, violet oil, sweet almond oil, or poppy seed oil; and if it is in winter, then narcissus oil, lily oil, chamomile oil, or blood oil, and those similar.
And if the superfluity is thick and cold, then the oil should be amaranth oil, balm oil, aloe oil, or anise oil, and those similar.
But if the patient has large pores and tender flesh, then the use of oil should be prohibited, and for such patients, the areas for cupping should be washed with vinegar or cold water of solanum, or with poppy water, or with borrage water, and similar things.
And the one whose blood is of much humidity, wash their cupping areas with sour wine, or with myrtle and sumac water, and similar things.
And for the one whose superfluities are thick, wash their cupping areas with old wine, or with wormwood water (which is majoram), or with a decoction of anise or chamomile, and similar things.
And the cupping should be done before a bath; however, it should be administered about an hour or two before the bath, and the patient should sleep after the cupping.
What is it that the patient undergoing cupping or phlebotomy should observe before cupping?
It is necessary to consider at the beginning: if the patient to be cupped or phlebotomized is choleric and has sharp blood and inflammation, then he should take cooling things, such as sour pomegranates, endive in sour wine and lettuce, and succory, and julep, and similar things.
And give him foods such as chicken, and the meat of domestic birds, and foods seasoned with acids, and the like.
And for one whose complexion is cold, he should drink syrup of almonds, or syrup of succory seeds, and sumac, and very fragrant wine, mid-way between old and new; and he should be advised to use moderation in drinking and eating, and give him foods such as chicken, hempseed, peas, small birds, and pigeons.
And it is necessary that on the day of cupping and phlebotomy his drink should be greater than his food.
And it is necessary that at certain times some men be given theriac alpharac, or medicines of musk, that is, nutmeg, or atherita, before cupping or before phlebotomy, or afterwards, so that the principal members may be comforted and the blood may be thinned; and they should not take those things when heated.
But the cuppings that are without scarification should be placed on the liver, and on the spleen and gout, and on the navel, in the places of the knees, and the groin, because these members do not tolerate scarification on them.
And it is not desired for these, but the drawing of blood from a member, just as we place a cupping glass on the breast in the illness of nasal bleeding; and we use it so that cold, invisible flatulence in the member may be dissolved, just as we place it on the belly and the navel; for it rarefies the member and warms it and diminishes the pain because it resolves flatulence.
And it is placed on boils when they become obstructed or suppurated, for by the virtue of strong attraction it quickly opens the obstruction and eradicates the pus from its place.
And similarly it acts when it is placed on the liver and spleen because of enclosed flatulence in them.
And these cuppings are administered empty with suction alone; and sometimes they are administered with fire.
And sometimes they are administered full of tepid water in illnesses of the spleen.
And this is so that the cupping glass is filled and is larger; that is, hot water alone or water in which herbs suitable for this purpose have been boiled.
Method of cupping administered with fire: let the width of the opening be two fingers, according to how we have formed it; and let the length of the cup be half a palm; and let it be placed on the patient's side, in a place that is within the circumference, and half of it; the hole should be small enough that only a needle can enter it.
Let it be made of bronze, copper, or citrus wood, with smooth edges, polished, even, and smooth, so that it does not harm the limb upon its placement.
And let there be a transverse rod of bronze or iron in the middle of it, on which a candle with fire is placed.
And let this cupping glass be larger than the one we have described; and the smaller one smaller than that, according to the illnesses and the age of the one who uses it.
And the cupping glasses for infants and thin people are different from those for young people and those with large bodies.
And the way to place this cupping glass with fire on the limb is to light a small amount of wood fire decently before a small wax candle, and place this on the middle of the transverse rod in the middle of the cupping glass, so that the fire is lit around the area underneath, so that the patient's body is not burned.
And then let it be placed on the patient's limb, and the finger on the hole we have mentioned, until when we hold the cupping glasses and do not need to remove the finger and the vapor escapes through that hole, then the cupping glass is immediately dissolved (i.e., the suction is released).
And then ignite the fire according to its manner, and repeat it if you need to.
But a cupping glass that is used in the illness of pleurisy, with water, in which there is no transverse rod or hole, and is not used unless it is filled with water, and is placed on the limb alone.
And this is its form: And this cupping glass, the larger it is, the better it is, because it can receive a large quantity of water.
Chapter 97.
Leeches are not administered to many limbs, but only to those limbs where the application of cupping glasses is not possible because of their small size, such as the fingers and gums and similar parts; or on a limb lacking flesh, such as the fingers and nose and similar parts.
And the quality of using those leeches is that you should find leeches that are in clean, sweet waters of a spring.
Then let them be left day and night in fresh water until they are hungry, and so that no matter remains in their bellies; and then let the body be evacuated at the beginning with phlebotomy and cupping; and then rub the patient's limb until it reddens; and then let them be placed upon it.
And when they are full and fall off.
And if it is possible to draw blood from the area with a cupping glass, it is even more beneficial afterward.
And if not, then wash the area with vinegar and then with warm water; and let it be rubbed and squeezed.
And if the flow of blood is prolonged after the application of leeches, and it oozes, then dip a cloth in cold water, and place that on top until the oozing stops.
And if the bleeding is excessive, then sprinkle on it crushed vitriol, or gallnuts and similar styptic substances, until the bleeding stops; or place halved, cooked beans on the area, and leave them until the beans stick to the place, and the bleeding stops.
And it is necessary, if needed, to reapply leeches, when it is possible to change those.
And if leeches are prohibited due to a suspension [of bloodletting], then rub the area with fresh blood or prick the area with a needle until blood comes out; and then they may be applied, because when they sense any blood they immediately attach themselves.
And when you want them to fall off, sprinkle a little crushed aloes, or salt, or ash on them, and they will fall off immediately.
Thus begins the prologue of the third part: On Restoration. This chapter is very often necessary in the art of medicine; and it is the restoration of fractures and accidental dislocations in the bones.
O, son, know that foolish physicians and the vulgar boast of this chapter, those who never looked at the books of the Ancients or read a single letter of them.
And for this reason, this method of the learned in our land is kept private; and I have never forgotten this at all; and I have not acquired this except through long reading of the books of the Ancients and study of their meaning, until I extracted the science from them.
And then I applied myself to experimentation and study throughout my life.
And I have already described in this chapter all that my knowledge contains and upon which my experience has passed; since I have abbreviated it for you and freed it from the burden of length; and I have abbreviated it for the sake of brevity; and I have shown it for the sake of clarity; and I have shown in it many forms of instruments that are used in it, as is done by way of explanation, just as I have done in the two preceding chapters.
Chapter One.
Summary and collections concerning the treatment of bone fractures, those things which are necessary to be considered before we begin the discussion of broken limbs and their various types. Therefore, I will say in the prologue of this chapter the main points of the discourse; and the chapters in understanding which the practitioner is first obliged to stand upon the truth of those things; that is, you and those who are prompt to know or learn this noble art, different from you.
And therefore I say that when a fracture, dislocation, sprain, or fall happens to someone, then you should first attend to it with phlebotomy or purging, or both together, if no cause prohibits it, such as weakness, or if the one to whom it happened is a child, or an old person in decrepitude, or it is a time of intense heat, or intense cold.
And furthermore, let him be content with a light diet of fresh herbs and the flesh of birds and rabbits; and we prohibit rich meats and filling foods, and all food that fills the veins with blood, until you are sure of avoiding a hot abscess, and if you do not fear an effusion of matter to the limb.
And then return the patient to his former regimen, to which he is accustomed.
And so, as the broken bone begins to be restored, then the patient should be fed nutritious foods, very rich and heavy in nourishment, in which there is viscosity, such as foods made from wheat cooked with water, and rice, and heads [possibly referring to specific cuts of meat], and feet, and bellies of cows, and eggs, and fresh fish, and thick wine and things similar to those, and with this regimen the consolidation of the fracture is made more easily and better.
And know that fractured bones, when they are in men who are in their first old age and in the decrepit, cannot be rejoined and consolidated according to their nature because of the desiccation of their limbs.
However, nature adjusts and brings to the broken bone from every part some substance similar to glue, in which there is thickness that adheres and binds it until they are together conglutinated and tied together, until they reach the end of strength and firmness, like fire at the beginning, until nothing prevents it from its work.
And for this reason it is necessary that you give the patient foods in which there is heaviness, viscosity, and thickness, as we have said.
And know that the types of fracture are diverse according to the diversity of the limbs, for a fracture of the bone of the leg is different from a fracture of the bone of the head; and a fracture of the bone of the foot is different from a fracture of the bone of the arm; and similarly all the other limbs are different from each other.
And I come with a recollection of every type of fracture, explained in its own chapter distinct from the others.
Many varieties of fracture in itself. And the types of bone fracture are diversified in themselves; for there is an arched fracture, besides those which happen in the stars; and sometimes a fracture is made according to the length of the bone: and these are the fractures of the shaft and splinters and additions proceeding and not proceeding, just as is done in the quill when it is prepared for writing, and there is a fracture with a wound and disruption in the head, and there is a small fissure fracture.
And to each type there is an appropriate device or treatment in its restoration, as will be recounted separately in their respective places.
Many signs of bone fracture. And thus a bone fracture is known: by its crookedness, and by that prominence and appearance of it to the touch, and by it when we compress it with the hand.
And therefore, when there is no apparent crookedness in the place, nor is this felt by your touch when you touch the bone with agitation and the patient does not find great pain, then there is no fracture here.
Having said that, it is possible that there is a crookedness or small fissure; in that case, it is not fitting that you move it with your hand and with complete compression; rather, place upon it those medicines of which mention will be made nearby at the appropriate moment; and then let it be tightened with a subtle bandaging.
And know that if the place is curved and is not split in two or another thing that does not happen to it,  as if the whole part were loosened from its comparison, then you must begin at your hour with its rectification before an abscess happens to it through heat.
And if a hot abscess happens to it, then leave it for some days until the abscess ceases; and then treat it according to whatever manner you can with lightness and ingenuity.
And know that the restoration and healing of it is easier than of a bone in which a wound has occurred.
And then tighten it as the recollection/understanding of it comes.
But if there is a wound in the bone, then extension of that broken limb is necessary from two parts, if it is the hand or the foot; or with your hand if the limb is small; or with two cords or with one cord and your hand.
And be in a position with which you place the limb in such a way as to treat it according to its natural form, while the parts of the broken limb are extended, then it is necessary that you make those additions return with ingenuity and in any way you can to their places.
And take care, according to your strength, that no pain or injury happens to the patient because of your operation; and it is necessary according to your ability that you apply one bone to the other, its companion, according to their best forms.
And it is necessary that at that time you profitably touch that with your hand, and if you see something different here, rectify that and adjust it to the extent of your ability.
And avoid vehement extension and compression, as many foolish doctors do, who many times cause a hot abscess by their operation, or cause contraction in the limb, as we have seen this from their operations many times.
And the quality of the constriction of the quieted limb is that which I have recounted; so that you know that broken limbs are diversified in their smallness and in their greatness and in their form.
And for those that are small, such as the arm and the finger and the penis and similar to those, then it is necessary that the wrapping be of very fine cloth.
But those that are large, such as the thigh or the leg, it is necessary that in those there be a broad and firm wrapping, because the broad bandage connects the large member and tightens it on all sides with even constriction, so that no blemish enters it.
And then begin, properly, your equalization evacuation, placing a bandage suitable for this, on the place of the fracture with three or four wrappings, according to what the member requires; and tighten your hand a little with the bandage.
And then come with that to the most superior part of the place of the fracture, and tighten less than you did your constriction with which you tightened the place of the fracture. And then lengthen yourself with a wrapping of the place of the fracture a little, and soften the constriction little by little, until you take from the place a large part of it.
And then take another bandage and wrap it again over the broken place with a wrapping, and then come with the wrappings to the lower part of the fracture; and let your operation be in the tightening of the wrapping and in the softening of it according to what we have said in the first wrapping above.
And then place between the layers of the bandage linen or cloth with which the crookedness of the fracture is padded, if there is crookedness in it; and if not, do not place anything there.
And then place another bandage over it, and then wrap over these bandages well-made splints immediately, if there is no inflammation or hot abscess in the place, and then place over it that which dries the abscess and removes the inflammation; and leave that for a few days; and then you tighten the splints over it.
And let the splints be of half a cane, smooth and well-formed skillfully; or let them be of pine wood; or of palm branches; and let the width of each splint be according to this form and this figure:
However, it is necessary that the splint that is placed over the fracture be a little thicker and smoother than the other splints, and the length of the splint according to how it fits the limb in size; and then tighten over the splints with another bandage according to your first tightening; and then bind over it with thread properly as we have said of tightening, and it is that your tightening should be greater according to the place of the fracture, and the more it is distant from the fracture, the less the tightening.
And it is necessary that the threads be moderate in thickness and fineness, and be of linen; and if the threads are thick, as I have seen by the operation of some fools placing their threads of twisted rope, and it is a great error, when the tightening lacks equality.
And likewise, very fine threads are not suitable, because you will not be able to achieve with them what you want by tightening, and it is not necessary that between splint and splint there should be less than a finger's width.
And if the patient is harmed by the ends of the splints near the bandages in those places, then place under those places tow, lion-wool, or carded wool until it does not cause him injury.
Sometimes a fracture is accompanied by a wound, and a disruption occurs in the skin, and I will return with a discussion of that in the following chapter according to its particularities.
And know that not every broken limb is bound with splints on the first day; the reason for this is that, if the limb is large, it is not necessary to place splints on it until about five or seven days, or more, depending on your certainty of the development of a hot abscess.
And this is the manner of the plasters with which the Ancients restored [limbs], which are placed on fractures, dislocations, and sprains.
A method of common plaster, a shortened restoration of fractures, suitable for many complexions and especially for women and children, because it is of that which neither heat nor cold overcomes:  it is that you take the powder of the mill, which is the fine flour dust that falls from the movement of the millstone on the walls of the mill.
And make it thus as it is, except that you sieve it with egg white, and make its consistency neither thick nor thin; and then use it.
Another method of plaster restoring fractures, dislocations, and sprains: take of asafoetida, of ladanum, of acacia, of elecampane, and of wild pomegranate root, of each one dram (x); of myrrh and aloes, half a dram (v); of aloes wood, two drams (xx); all should be crushed and sifted and mixed with aloe water or with egg white if the patient's complexion is hot; and then use this plaster, for it is of good composition and restores lightly broken bones, and benefits many people.
Another method of plaster which benefits fractures and sprains: take of wild pomegranate root and of white marshmallow root, one dram (x); of myrrh and of aloes, half a dram (v); of acacia, six drams (vi); of Armenian bole, two drams (xx).
All should be crushed in a mortar with much grinding, and be sifted, and be mixed with water or with egg white and be applied.
Method for a plaster for joints and bones separated from their places, and if pain occurs in those and in fissures and fractures: let unwashed wool be taken and be submerged in sour wine and cooked oil and be placed on the area.
However, this plaster does not have restorative virtue, rather it draws out hot abscesses and expels pain effectively.
Another method of plaster that restores a broken bone: take leaves of wild fig and leaves of wild poppy; crush everything and make a plaster from them.
Method of a brief plaster administered for the restoration of bone fracture and when you want resolution of the remaining abscess: take roots of mallow, of chamomile, and violet flowers, of pea flour, of all an equal part; let all be crushed and be mixed with wine, if the limb is not inflamed.
But if it is inflamed, then mix that with moistened coriander water or with water and use it.
Another method of plaster stronger in resolution than the first, when a hard abscess occurs during the restoration of a limb: take roots of mallow and linseed, and pomegranate, and melilot, marjoram, violet flowers, chamomile, of all an equal part; let all be crushed and mixed with willow water or with fresh water or with wine, all this according to the quality of the limb and the restoration of its color.
However, Hippocrates did not say in his book that it should be placed on the broken limb during its restoration except a cerate made of wax and oil and nothing else; and he recommended that it be of medium thickness.
But in Gaul it is seen that they are placed on the broken limb during its restoration, and the things which cause desiccation with little heat are such as myrrh, incense, and similar things to those we have mentioned.
Method for a plaster that relieves injury and pain: take millet,  wax, shaved human hair or bird down, and mallow, and salt, in equal parts; let them be crushed and sifted and mixed, and let a plaster be made.
But the amount of time the bandage should remain and when it should be loosened is that you consider whether pain or itching has occurred, or if the bone is broken or dislocated; if not, then you do not loosen it for many days. And if vehement pain or itching or inflammation occurs at the site, then you should carefully loosen or untie it immediately, and remove the plaster from it.
And take linen cloth and a moist sea sponge, and submerge it in lukewarm water, and with it wash the area until the itching ceases and the pain is soothed; then let the limb rest for an hour; and then place over it clean wool submerged in sour wine and oil or rose oil, and bind it for a night until you are certain of a hot abscess, and that the inflammation of the limb subsides, and its pain is eased.
Then repeat that subtle binding and small plaster and do not tighten it as much as your first constriction, but refine it until it is healed.
And if you see that the abscess, the redness, the pain, the inflammation, and all the symptoms have subsided completely, and you wish to remove the plaster and binding, then you repeat this as you did at the beginning, similarly.
And if none of the conditions we have mentioned occurs in the limb, then do not untie it before three or four or five or seven days; and sometimes all this is left for twenty days, depending on what appears to you from the unbinding of the limb, as we have said, until the fracture adheres, and approaches the coagulation of the flesh upon it.
And then adjust the binding more than in your first binding, and adjust it to the thickening of the patient's flesh, as his recovery progresses.
But if you see the fracture site drying and thinning more than it should, then know that nourishment is prevented from reaching it; and therefore, bathe it with lukewarm water every time you untie it; and let this be done every three days; and loosen the binding a little, and by this operation, nourishment will flow to the limb, and it will heal easily.
But what foolish restorers of a fractured limb do, when it is not set correctly at the beginning, and is set crookedly, is an error according to their practice, and a great danger; and if this were correct, the Ancients would have enlarged upon it in their books and would have worked with it.
And I have not seen any of them do this, wherefore it is more reasonable not to do it.
Chapter Two: On fractures when they occur in the head.
The types of fractures are many, and their forms are diverse, and the causes are distinct, for some fractures are caused by a blow from a sword, and the blow crushes all the bone into the marrow, which is beneath the bone, just as it does to wood, and for this reason this type is called an axial fracture; or the sword cuts some part of the bone, and cuts its flesh, but the cut does not go through to the back of it; and this type of fracture is called a *levatio absoluta* (complete elevation/separation).
And the wound of these two fractures is either large or small; and of a fracture that is a contusion or attrition; and its cause is a blow with a stone or a fall onto a stone, and similar things.
And this fracture is either penetrating, approaching the membrane that is beneath the bone; or it is on the surface of the bone, and the wound of these two fractures is either large or small.
And there is a fracture that is hidden in the bone, as fine as a small hair, and for that reason this type is called a capillary fracture.
And there is a fracture that is caused either by a fall or by a blow with a stone and the like, which causes some lamina of the bone to enter the inner parts, and is made in a concave place, as happens to the sides of a ram's horn when a blow is struck and a part of it is driven into the inner parts.
And this happens especially in the bones of humid bodies, such as the heads of infants.
And in all these types of comminuted fractures, the pieces are like separated stars. And I will return all of this to its place.
And we recognize all these types of fracture by detection of them and by examination with probes, and by the presence of corrupted flesh that is over them.
And a hairline fracture is known because it is uncovered on the bone, and is wiped clean, and then examined with a probe, for the fracture appears black.
But in the treatment of fractures, consider first the patient's symptoms, and then if you see symptoms that clearly indicate danger, such as vomiting of bile, exhaustion, loss of consciousness, loss of voice, syncope, acute fever, swelling of the eyes and redness of them, and similar symptoms in the worst cases, without doubt it is not healing.
And if you see no unusual symptoms and expect recovery, then you begin his treatment.
The reason is that if the injured person comes to you at the beginning as injured, and this is in the winter days, then you should study the state of the bone before the fourteenth day, according to all circumstances.
And if it is in the summer days, then you should try to set the bone before the seventh day, before what is under the bone is corrupted by the panniculus (flesh), and before the complications that we have mentioned occur.
And if the fracture has already reached the panniculus covering the brain, and is with small, fragmented pieces and attrition, then you must incise the comminuted and atrophied part, as I shall explain to you.
And so you shave the head of the injured patient, and expose the bone according to custom and manner as best you can, according to the nature of the injury, and that it be light upon the patient.
And if you encounter, during the uncovering of the bone, a flow of blood or a hot abscess, then you must oppose it with what is necessary; and this is to fill the area with cloths soaked in rose wine and oil, and let the wound rest until the abscess is settled and the bleeding is stopped; and then begin with the encirclement of the bone and its removal.
And this should be done according to one of two methods of operation.
And one method is that you incise the bone with a narrow scalpel, and this is its shape:  And then use another scalpel, a little wider than that one; and this is its shape:
And then use a wider scalpel than the second.
And it is necessary that you have several scalpels of different sizes, some wider than others; and some of them shorter than others, and sharpened at their ends, and made of Indian or tempered steel.
And use them carefully, striking the scalpel so that you do not strike the head and injure it.
And if the bone is strong, hard, then you must perforate its circumference before you use the scalpels with drills, which are called shallow drills.
And they are not called so except because these do not reach the depth of the skull bone which is near it, because the drill has a round end or edge below its sharp head, similar to an edge or a small circle, which prevents it from being submerged and passing through the thickness of the bone.
And it is convenient that you take a large number of these drills, each suited to the thickness of each bone, so that you have at hand for all parts of the skull a drill whose point is sharp, the length and shortness being according to the thickness of that part of the skull.
And this is the manner of the three types of drills:  The method of perforating the circumference of the broken bone is to place the drill on the bone and turn it with your fingers until you know that the bone is penetrated; then move the drill to another location, placing the distance between each hole to be the thickness of a finger or thereabouts.
And then incise with scalpels what is between each hole in the bone, and make it as thin as possible for ease of removal, as we have said, until you remove the bone, either with your hand or with some other instrument that you have prepared for this, such as fine tongs and forceps.
And it is necessary that you take great care that the scalpel does not touch anything of the brain.
And so, when you have encircled the bone by perforation, and it is separated from the brain if it is continuous with it, and you have extracted it, it is necessary that you scrape and smooth the roughness of that which remains in the bone with another instrument similar to a scalpel, but it must be thinner and more delicate than the other scalpels.
And if any small and jagged pieces of bone remain, then remove them easily with whatever instrument you have; and then treat the wound with liniments and ointments as we have described.
And the other method of operation is easier and less frightening, which Galen described and praised greatly; and this is his account: it is necessary for you at the beginning to begin by uncovering the part of the bone at the location where the fracture is most severe and most evident, until, when you have uncovered that part and placed under it the extremity of that slow and gentle scalpel, of which this is the form:
And it is so that the lenticular part is smooth and does not cut anything, and the sharp part is divided in two on the side facing forward in length, like a wedge; so that the lenticular part may be applied to the brain with its face, while the sharp part cuts into the bone.
And then strike the scalpel on one side with a small mallet until you incise all the bone easily as it is revealed, and you are sure that the periosteum will not suffer any accident that you fear in any way, even if the physician were the most foolish of all men and the most ignorant of them; certainly, even if he were sleeping.
Then, if any substance attached to the bone remains in any place on the periosteum, incise it with the lenticular end of that scalpel, and remove it easily, for it is removed without harm or fear.
And if the fracture of the bone does not penetrate the periosteum, and what is cut away or removed from the bone is its surface, and roughness and small splinters remain, then it is necessary to smooth that roughness and remove those splinters with fine rasps, of which you have prepared several, of different sizes, so that it is possible for you to apply in each place the most suitable and the most appropriate of them, according to what your operation on that broken bone and its shape requires.
And you should begin your rasping of the bone with the coarsest of these rasps, and then gradually use the finer ones, and continue doing this until you end by using the finest and most subtle of them all.
But in all other small, hairline fractures and subtle fractures, care must be taken according to what is needed for their repair.
And it is a matter that is not overlooked by all those who have studied that art. And this is what we have shown above in the case of large fractures.
And if the panniculus (skin and subcutaneous tissue) is retracted when you reduce the bone, then you should take a cloth according to the size of the wound, and soak it in rose oil, and place it over the opening of the wound; and then take another cloth, doubled or tripled, and soak it in wine and rose oil and place it over the first cloth, doing this as gently as you can so as not to compress the wound; and then apply a linen bandage, not tightening it except so much as to hold the wound in place only.
And leave it with this dressing for one or two days until you are sure there is no hot abscess; and then unbind it and apply medicines that counteract excessive dryness, such as linseed, barley flour, and powder of lentils and birthwort, and similar things.
And it is necessary that you make a powder of these medicines to be sprinkled on the wound, once they are dry; and generally, apply any medicine whose property is to cleanse and not bite (i.e., cause further damage).
And take care, according to your ability, that the wound in your treatment remains clean; and that there is no filth of ointment or anything else; and do not let virulence increase there; because when it is applied to the panniculus of the brain, it corrupts and rots it, and this malignancy will then affect the patient.
And if it affects the cranial cavity, as the bone is cleaned, and especially when its treatment is neglected, and there is blackness on its surface; and therefore, if the patient suffers the consequences we have mentioned, know that it is undoubtedly pernicious.
And if the blackness is not caused by the medicine applied, but is due to the medicine's effect, then you should take one part honey and three parts of rose oil, and with these, moisten a cloth, and apply it to the cranial cavity; and then treat it with appropriate healing remedies until it is healed.
Chapter 3.
Concerning the restoration of a broken nose.
Know that a broken nose is not broken into two parts except the most prominent ones, or one of these sometimes, because it has two bones, for the lower part is cartilaginous, and it is not broken and only suffers abrasion, crookedness and inflammation.
But if one of its two parts is broken, then you should insert your little finger into the nose, and reduce the fracture inside with your index finger, and with the thumb outside, until the nose returns to its natural shape. And let this be done by you with ease, and be careful that your operation does not cause the patient pain.
And if the fracture is in the most prominent part of the nose, and the finger does not reach it, then it should be set with the end of a rod of small thickness.
And if the fracture is in two parts, then you do the same thing.
And strive to restore it on the first day of the fracture, if possible; and if not, then around the seventh or tenth day, you should treat the resulting abscess with cautery.
And then introduce into the end of the nose a pledget of linen cloth, if the fracture is in one part, or two pledgets, if the fracture is in two parts, and let the pledget be of such a size as to fill the hole in the nose.
And some of the ancient restorers say that the pledgets should be soaked in vinegar, and changed every day; but it is not so in my experience; rather it is necessary that the pledget be soaked in egg white mixed with powdered myrrh; and then leave the pledget there until the bone is set and the cartilage is hardened.
And sometimes, instead of a pledget, a goose feather, wrapped in linen cloth, is introduced into the nose; and this is especially useful when the nasal fracture is severe and the patient is not prevented from breathing.
And this method is not necessary for you; and if you wish, do this, and if you wish, use pledgets.
And if a hot abscess should occur again, plaster the nose with cerate or with cotton soaked in sharp vinegar and rose oil, or with diachylon.
But if a hot abscess does not occur, then it is necessary to plaster that area externally with sesame flour and powdered incense mixed with egg white; and then place linen cloth over it, and do not bind the nose with anything.
But if the bones of the nose are broken with a small fracture or are comminuted, then it is necessary to make an incision over them, and extract them with instruments suitable for this; and then close the incision, and treat it with that which causes granulation and consolidation, and with plasters suitable for this.
And if a wound occurs inside the nose, then it is necessary to treat it with pledgets and administer lead canulae until it is completely healed.
Chapter 4.
On the restoration of the jaw when it is fractured.
When the lower jaw is broken and the fracture is not accompanied by a wound, observe then if the fracture is only external, and is not broken in two and is bent inwards at the edges, then its diagnosis is easy.
And it is necessary therefore, if the fracture is on the right side, that you insert your left index finger into the patient's mouth; and similarly if the fracture is in the left jaw, then insert the index finger of your right hand; and push with it the hump of the fracture inwards, easily to the outside parts, with your other hand on the outside of the bone; thus decently equalize that.
And if the fracture of the jaw is already separated into two, then it is necessary that you administer extension from two sides according to straightness until its equalization is possible.
And if there is concussion of teeth with disruption, then bind those which you hope will remain with a thread of gold or silver or silk; and then place on the broken jaw a cerate, and then place on it a doubled cloth, and place on the cloth a well-made large splint, or a piece of wood equal to the length of the jaw; and then bind that on top as the binding appears suitable to you and as the application requires, until it is healed.
And command the patient to use rest and tranquility, and give him sorbitive drinks as food.
And if you estimate that the shape is already altered in some way, then you should examine and unbind it on the third day; and then rectify what is altered in it and plaster it with powdered barley, with egg white, or with bean flour, after you have removed the cerate from it, and place wool over the plaster.
And then, when this plaster is attached and adjusted, and the disposition of the bone is not altered, leave it; do not unbind it until it is healed and the fracture is firm; for many times this fracture is healed in three weeks.
And if another time a hot abscess occurs, then administer what we have said many times in its sedation until it is healed, and that abscess is softened.
And if the fracture is with a wound, then consider if a piece of the bone is separated or splintered; then you should carefully remove those splinters with whatever is appropriate for removing them from the wound.
And if the opening of the wound is narrow, then you should widen it with a fleam, according to your need.
And then, when you have removed those splinters, and nothing remains of them, then you should sew the opening of the wound if it is wide; and if not, place on it one of the plasters which is suitable for this and will cause it to heal, until it is healed.
Chapter 5.
Of the restoration of the clavicle when it is broken.
Many times the clavicle is broken in the front part above the muscle, and this fracture is done in one of three ways.
Because it is either broken, or separated, or separated into two parts without splinters; and it is easy to restore it; or it is so that splinters occur in it, and it is difficult to restore it; or it is so that the fracture is with a wound.
And the operation in that case, when the fracture is without a wound, is that you have two assistants present, so that one holds the splint and aligns the broken clavicle, and the other extends the neck towards that part.
Then bind the fracture with your fingers until its shape is made as it should be, and there is neither little prominence nor concavity in it.
And if you need more extension, then you should place under the patient's armpit a pad of cloth or wool, and let its size be according to the amount of your need; and extend and elevate the clavicle and compress the pad with your hand until you bind the fracture as needed.
And if you cannot pull the end of the clavicle to the outer parts, because it is stuck to the sternum, then the patient should be supine on their neck, and place on the muscle a moderately sized cushion.
And the assistant presses the muscle downwards until the bone of the clavicle that is on the sternum above is elevated, and then you straighten the fracture and bind it with your fingers.
But if you feel splinters of the clavicle and they are harmful, then you should incise over it and extract those splinters easily.
And if it is retained in the bone, then you make an incision with one of the scalpels which you have prepared for this, after having placed under the clavicle the instrument that serves the bandage; and this is a wooden or iron instrument of which this is the form:
And it is similar to a spoon, of which this is the concavity; and let its width be according to your need, according to the size or smallness of the bone.
But its length should be as long as is possible for you in the operation; let it have two ends, as you see, and let one end be wide and the other narrow.
And if the disruption of the wound which you have incised when you extracted the splinter from the bone is wide, and you are sure of a hot abscess, then you join the two lips of the wound with a suture.
And if the disruption is small, or you fear a hot abscess, then you fill the wound with cloths and powders according to the size of the wound's incision.
And if a hot abscess occurs, then dip a cloth in sour wine and rose oil and wine, and place it on that.
And above all, let the tablet not be moved from over the broken bone; and for that reason you must see the patient each day, because when the bandage is softened or you see the tablet is already moved, then you rectify that and tighten the bandage.
And then place the patient's pillow under their neck, and place a small cushion under their shin at night on top of the pillow; so that with this the limb is elevated from that side, and thus the fracture of the clavicle is elevated from the muscle; or let their arm be tied to their neck.
And do not untie the bandage unless a boil or abscess occurs at the site, before twelve days.
And then renew the plaster if you see the need, and adjust the reduction and restore it and leave it until the fracture of the clavicle is restored and coagulated.
And it is strengthened and healed in about twenty-eight days, and sometimes in some men it is done in less time than that.
Chapter 6.
Concerning the restoration of a shoulder fracture.
The shoulder blade is broken on its lateral side, and not broken through, but only at the edges.
And therefore, when the shoulder blade is broken — and it is broken in the middle of the shoulder blade — and is known only by touch, then, according to the nature of the fracture,  forcefully prepare it and reduce it to its natural shape in every way possible to you.
Then place on the area powdered  millet with egg white and lion's fluff; then place a dusting of doubled cloth; and then place over it a finely woven linen bandage, according to the size of the whole shoulder blade or a little more.
But if the bandage leaves a concavity in any part of the shoulder blade, then you should fill that concavity with lion's fluff, and then tighten the bandage evenly.
And then bind it above with a long bandage, with decent constriction and firmness of the bandage until it is not moved from its place.
And examine the bandage each day; and whenever it is loosened, bandage it again and tighten it, and reposition the bandage if it has shifted from its place.
And lay the patient on their healthy side.
And the shoulder blade is restored in 20 or 25 days.
And so when that number of days is complete, then you unbind the bandage, and you should know for certain that this is for bones whose beginning is not feared, nor their dissolution.
And if it proceeds from the location of the collarbone and extends under the armpit, then you incise over it, and remove it, and act according to what we have said in the fracture of the clavicle, with cauterization of the abscess if it occurs there.
Chapter 7.
Of the restoration of a fractured foot.
The foot is sometimes broken in the middle, and this heals slowly; but its extremities heal much faster, even if they are crushed and comminuted.
And among its accidents, when the middle of the foot is broken, it inclines inwards, and causes great pain, difficulty in breathing, coughing, strong fever, and vomiting blood; and the cavity in the broken bone is evident and not hidden from the touch.
And its restoration is that the patient should be supine on his back, with a cushion placed between his shoulders; then press on the muscles of the foot, and align the bones with hands on both sides, being subtle in this operation and in the setting, in every way possible and appropriate, until the bone is restored to its proper shape.
Then apply a plaster and lint, and place over it a splint of thin willow or alder wood, or something similar in lightness, after wrapping it in cloth; and be careful in binding it over the broken bone so that it is not disturbed; and bind it circularly to the instep sometimes, and tighten it with a suitable bandage; and check the bandage frequently, and tighten it when it loosens.
And if necessity demands loosening of the bandage because of corrosion or itching, or pain, or an abscess that forms in the area, then carefully unbind it, remove the plaster, and correct what has occurred with appropriate treatment; and reapply the plaster, if it is appropriate; and adjust the bandage until it heals.
Chapter 8.
Concerning the restoration of ribs when they are broken.
Know that a fracture of the ribs only occurs in the thicker parts, which are two; and in their extremities, on the front part, no crushing occurs because they are cartilaginous. And its knowledge is not hidden from the feeling/sense through its examination with the fingers.
And the restoration should be thus:  equalize the fracture with the fingers as much as possible, until it is aligned as needed, and then apply a plaster and tightly bind the broken bone with a bandage, if that is needed.
And if the rib fracture is inclined towards the inner parts, then the patient experiences vehement pain and a stabbing sensation, like the stabbing pain that occurs in one who has pleurisy, and this is because the bone pierces the membrane; and it causes difficulty in breathing, coughing, and vomiting of much blood; and this is difficult to cure.
And the Ancients were ingenious in that [treatment] with many inventions.
And of them it is said: it is necessary that you give the patient foods that create inflation and flatulence, so that the belly is inflated and distended, and the fracture is pushed outwards.
But we would avoid this so that it does not easily cause a hot abscess if it does not occur; and if it does occur, then it helps with that.
And some of them said that a cupping glass should be applied and that it should draw strongly; and this seems reasonable, but nevertheless it is feared that the cupping glass will draw superfluities to the place because of weakness.
And some of them said: the place should be covered with wool that has been submerged in hot oil, and powders should be placed between the ribs until it is filled, so that the bandage is tight as it wraps that roundness; and then the patient should be treated with a treatment for pleurisy, with diet and medicine.
And if a vehement cause constricts the patient, which he cannot bear, and the bone pushes the covering with a painful puncture, threatening the patient, then it is necessary to cut open the place, uncover the broken rib, and then place on it the instrument that preserves the diaphragm (whose mention was given previously), and that we incise the bone easily, and extract it.
And then we adjust the two lips of the wound, if it is large, with stitches, and we treat it with plasters until it is healed.
And if an abscess occurs inside, then you should take and immerse powders in rose oil and place it on the area, and the patient should be treated with what is appropriate for the internal abscess.
And let him be supine on the side on which he sleeps, until he is healed.
Chapter 9.
Concerning the restoration of a fracture of the spine and neck.
Sometimes a fracture occurs in the bones of the neck, and it is slow to heal, and similarly in the vertebrae of the back. And when this happens to someone and you want to know if he will be healed or not, then consider this: for if you see his hands already softened and numb and dead, and he cannot move them, nor extend nor clench them, and when you squeeze them with your fingers or prick them with a needle and he feels no pain in them, then know that he is not healed, and in most cases, it is mortal.
And if he moves them and feels constriction in them with the fingers and puncture, then know that the neck of the bone is safe and that the patient will heal with treatment.
And if the same thing happens to the vertebrae of the neck and you want to know if he will heal or not, then consider his feet.
Then if you see that they are already softened, the same thing has happened to them as happened to the hands, and moreover when he lies on his back, he experiences flatulence and defecation without his will, and sometimes he lies on his back and wants to urinate and cannot, then know that it is mortal, and then do not labor in his cure.
But if none of those things occur, the condition is better and milder.
And the cure for him is that you carefully pierce the abscess to settle it,  placing on the affected vertebra only pure rose oil, or with cooked egg yolks; apply this several times a day until the hot abscess is settled.
And then apply one of the comforting and stimulating plasters, and bind it tightly; and instruct the patient to use rest and tranquility and not to sleep on the side where he feels pain until he is healed.
And if, due to the attrition of the bone, splinters or something that is already separated from it occur, then you must cut it at the bone and remove that bone; and then approximate the two lips of the wound, with suture if it is large; and then treat it with some incarnative ointment, until it is healed.
But if the posterior part of the hip bone is broken, and it is the end of the [thigh] bone, then you must insert the little finger of your left hand into the rectum, and set the broken bone with the other hand as much as possible by counter-extension; and then apply a plaster and splint, if you have them, and then bind it tightly.
And if you feel broken splinters in it, then you should probe there, and remove them, and treat the wound with the previously described treatment until it is healed.
Chapter 10.
Of the restoration of the hip.
The hip bones are rarely broken, and if they are broken, then their fracture is only a separation at the ends of those bones and is incised in length and inclines towards the inner parts; and the patient experiences pain and throbbing in the area, and the leg is numb when fractured.
And the restoration of it is that you extend your hand over it until it is over the fracture, which is its shape.
And if the fracture is only at its extremity, then you bind that according to what is prepared for you by equal binding until it is similar to its natural shape.
But if the fracture is lengthwise or inclines towards the lower parts, then you make the patient lie on their stomach until the restoration of that fracture is prepared by you. And then when you have bound it, place a plaster over it, and then place a splint of wood or bone over that, and bind it tightly so that you do not fear puncture of the fracture or displacement of the splint.
And bind the concavity with something that fills it until it takes the binding equally, and command the patient to sleep on their back or on their healthy side.
But if a hot abscess occurs, then you cease the extension of it and its restoration until the hot abscess is settled, and place on it that which settles it as is preceded; and then return to its restoration, and bind it as is necessary.
And if splinters occur in the bone or are comminuted, then you remove them.
Chapter 11.
Of the restoration of a fractured humerus (or upper arm bone).
The humerus is that which is between the side and the head of the shoulder.
And if it is broken, then its restoration is in one of two ways, of which one is that you take a wooden splint of moderate thickness according to this form:
And let two bandages be tied at two extremities, and then let it be suspended from a raised position.
And seat the patient on a stool; and then lay their broken arm on the splint until it reaches the elbow, in the middle of which the curve of the splint should be attached.
And then suspend some heavy weight from it, or let the attendant extend it downwards; and then let the physician join the fracture with his hands, until the fracture returns as it should.
And the other method is that the patient be laid supine on their back and suspend the arm from their neck with a bandage; and then order two assistants that one of them hold what is above the fracture with their hands; and the other hold the lower part; and each of them extend to their part.
And if you want the extension to be stronger, then you tighten above the fracture with a bandage and above that with another bandage, and each of the two assistants extend to their two parts.
And so if the fracture is close to the end of the muscle, then it is necessary that half of the bandage be placed on the elbow and the other below the fracture near the joint.
And similarly, if the fracture is close to the joint, then it is necessary that the bandage be placed on that place and over that joint.
Equalize that with ease and without effort, and then when it is equalized as needed and is applied with a good application, then tighten it unless a hot abscess occurs.
But if a hot abscess occurs, then leave the binding until the seventh day, and place on it clean wool soaked in sharp wine and rose oil until the abscess subsides, and then you tighten that.
And the way to tighten it is that you place a plaster on the fracture, and then place a bandage of new cloth over the plaster; and then adjust the arm on that support, and place your open hand over its muscle.
And place the cloth and tighten the arm on the support so that the arm is in a fixed position, unless some cause of the broken bone prohibits this.
And then use splints.
And it is so that you place on the fracture that splint which is wider and stronger than the other splints; and place between each splint the width of a finger, and let the length of the splints be according to the fracture with the addition of three fingers on each side.
And then tighten the splints with the bandage which I mentioned at the beginning of the chapter.
And it is so that your bandage over the fracture site should be tighter. And the longer the fracture, the less tight the bandage should be.
And so if you see the placement of the splints and the bandage as we have said at the time when you restore the limb to its proper position, then you do [proceed].
And if you fear a hot abscess, then you leave the bandage and splints until the seventh day, as we have said.
And then consider the bandages in all parts for three days so that swelling or inflammation does not occur at the site; or it is forbidden for food to reach the limb due to the constriction of the bandage; and then rectify all this as we have said.
But if you are confident that none of this will happen, then do not untie the bandage until three days or more.
And let the patient's sleeping position be on their back, and their hands should be on their stomach.
And place over the splint a poultice full of wool, evenly spread, and check every hour of the night and day that the shape of the broken limb is not loosened or dissolved, or that the bandage is softened;  then rectify this all with your skill.
And give the patient food according to the order we have previously mentioned, so that the food is light at the beginning until the binding begins; and then it is necessary to increase their food.
Because it is customary for the splint and their leg to be bound for forty days; and then it is necessary that they be unbound and a bath be administered, and it should be medicated with ointments that rectify this.
And if the fracture is badly crushed, then you should not unbind the bandage and splints from that for ten days or up to two months.
Chapter 12.
Concerning the restoration of a fracture of the arm.
The arm is composed of two bones which are called two focils; of which one is small, and it is that which is next to the little finger, and the other is large and is that which is placed below the little finger, on the lower side.
And very easily the larger focil is broken alone, or the smaller one, and very easily they are broken together.
And when the small focil is broken above, then its restoration is easy, and its healing is easier.
And when the focil is broken below, the fracture is bad, and its healing is difficult.
And worse than that is when both bones are broken together.
Therefore, if the bone that is broken is the small focil above, then it is convenient for the physician, during its restoration, to apply slight extension easily until it is set.
But if the large focil is what is broken, then it is necessary to apply more forceful extension.
And if both focils are broken together, then you must apply the extension much more strongly.
And you must place your hand in position during its restoration and extension stretched out on a cushion, and the thumb of the hand should be at the upper parts, higher than all the other fingers, and the little finger should be lower than the other fingers, and the patient should be lying on a square cushion.
And let there be a cushion in front of him at his height or level, so that the patient does not suffer strain.
Then let the assistant extend the arm from the lower part with his hand or with a bandage, and another assistant extend it from above similarly.
Then the physician should carefully manipulate the bone until he reduces the fracture to the best possible alignment.
And if in the fracture of the bone there is a piece displaced, then you must forcefully reduce all parts to their place with your skill.
And if a separated fragment appears in him, that pushes the bone, and there is no hope of its restoration, then you operate on him and remove that piece according to the method which we have described above.
But if the fracture is accompanied by a wound, I have already dealt with that in a separate chapter, and therefore take care of it accordingly.
And if an abscess occurs near the beginning of your treatment, then you apply a cloth with a plaster made of rose oil and white wax, and let it be of moderate consistency, neither too thick nor too thin, and bind the cloth tightly over it until the abscess subsides; and then remove the plaster and apply a poultice prepared from crushed barley flour with egg white, and then apply a bandage; and the bandage which is applied over the fracture should be tighter and stronger.
And know that the number of bandages on the arm varies depending on the situation, whether the fracture is in one or two places simultaneously.
Then apply your bandage over the fracture site firmly and tightly, and where the bandage is closer to the parts above the fracture or to the lower parts of it, apply the bandage a little more loosely, as was mentioned at the beginning of this chapter.
And the cloths that are wrapped around the fracture should be soft and moist, not hard or rough, and the thread with which it is bound should be of moderate thickness, neither too fine nor too coarse, as we have already recommended.
And examine the limb and the bandage after a few days. And if any problem arises that requires correction, such as itching that occurs in the limb, then you should bathe the limb with warm water until that itching ceases.
And leave the limb unconstrained until it rests, and then reapply the bandage.
And if the constriction is already softened and the bone is already healed and similar to the others, then correct all this with your skill.
And consider further if nourishment is prevented from reaching the limb due to excessive tightness of the bandage, for then you must loosen it a little and leave it so for a few days until nourishment flows to it, and then tighten it again.
But if the patient does not experience any of the problems we have mentioned, then the bandage should not be loosened for about twenty days or thereabouts.
And then the patient's arm should be suspended by its own weight, allowing movement, and have him sleep on his back.
And know that this fracture is healed in thirty days or in thirty-two days, or even quickly in twenty-eight days, and all this depends on the constitution and the strength of the individual.
Chapter 13.
On the restoration of a fracture of the wrist and fingers.
Know that fractures rarely occur in the wrist and finger joints; instead, they often suffer attrition.
And when a fracture or attrition occurs in the hand, then the patient should lie down, and a cushion should be placed beneath him for support, and then place his hand on that cushion.
Then the assistant should extend the broken bones, and the physician should align them until they are joined with a good connection.
Then it is necessary to apply a plaster and lint, unless a hot abscess occurs; and then apply a bandage over it according to the size of the area, and wrap it in linen cloth.
But if the fracture is in the inner parts of the palm of the hand, then make a kind of ball of cloth, and instruct the patient to grasp it with his fractured hand; then it should be bound tightly with a long cloth.
And let the bandage be of leather with cloth in which it is softened, so that the leather may be applied to the palm; and bind it as tightly as necessary.
But if the fracture is on the outer parts, then it is necessary to place a bandage above and another bandage below on the palm, so that the hand is open and straight; and then apply the splint, just as the hand is bound to the splint between the fingers with bandages.
And if a fracture occurs in any of the finger joints, then if it is the thumb, it should be straightened as necessary and then bound to the palm, and if you wish, place a small, straight splint on it so that the fracture is elevated and not moved.
But if the fracture is in the other fingers, such as in the middle finger, or in the index finger, or in the ring finger, or in the little finger, then it should be straightened and bound to the finger next to it; or they should all be bound together continuously, which is better; or place a small splint on it, as we have said for the thumb.
And consider, in your treatment, and alongside it, the disposition of a hot abscess and oppose—with your operation—what is necessary when any of these things occur, according to the repeated account of them.
Chapter 14.
Of the treatment of a fracture of the thigh bone.
The thigh bone is often broken and this is revealed by the feeling, according to whether it is broken in the front part or the more prominent part.
And its treatment is done in this way: a bandage is tightened above the fracture and another bandage below the fracture, and the patient is laid on their stomach and face.
And then the physician stretches the entire bandage to its proper length, according to the nature of the fracture, when the fracture is in the middle of the bone.
But if it is close to the hip joint, then the bandage should be close to the knee on the hamstring side, so that the extension is upwards, and the other bandage below the fracture.
And similarly, if the fracture is close to the knee, then the bandage should be placed near the knee, and the extension should be towards the lower parts.
And then the physician aligns the bone with both hands until he reduces it to its natural shape and the bone is joined by a good conjunction; then it is necessary to apply a plaster and bandage, unless an abscess occurs in the limb. But if an abscess occurs, then you leave it for a few days until the abscess has matured and subsided, and then return to your treatment.
The bandage should be made as follows: you must wrap a firm bandage around the fracture, and double or triple it, removing any excess; and then wrap the leg until it reaches the ankle and the hip joint.
And insert a long strip of cloth between the thigh and the leg near the knee on the lower parts, and let the ends of the cloth come from the upper part of both sides, and then wrap around the leg and thigh what is superfluous of the bandage.
And then place splints on the thigh at the site of the fracture, and place one splint over the bone of the leg.
And then fill the spaces between the leg and thigh with soft cloths, so that the bandage is even and secure.
Then begin with a firm bandage in the middle, over the fracture site, with three or four turns; and the farther you get from the fracture site, the looser, lighter, and softer your bandage should be.
And then extend the two ends of the cloth to the lower parts until they reach the ankle, and tie both ends of the splints on the other side so that the bandage is not loosened from its place.
And then leave the bandage on it, such that it does not cause any corrosion, hot abscess, swelling, or similar problems to the limb; and if any of these problems occur, then loosen the bandage and correct whatever occurred, as we have said many times.
But if there is a piece of bone that is sticking out of the bone, then you must set it as best you can; and if not, smooth it down and keep it in place, and treat it with what has been previously mentioned until it heals.
And sometimes this fracture of the thigh is tightened in addition to the splints being applied, as we have described for the aid of the arm.
However, in the restoration done in this manner, lameness does not occur in the patient; and if it is restored alone, apart from the other leg being applied to it, then it is necessary that he will limp on the affected leg always.
And know that the thigh is bound for forty days, or a little more or a little less, and all this depends on the diversity of complexions and other dispositions (of the patient).
Chapter 15.
Of the restoration of the fracture of the kneecap.
Know that a fracture of the kneecap heals slowly, but often causes attrition (or wearing away).
But if a fracture occurs, then it is only a fissure or hole in its parts, and this is with or without a wound, and on this everything depends, along with sensation (or feeling).
And its restoration is thus: that which is broken of its parts should be aligned with the said parts until it is joined and united as much as possible by equalization, ease, and fabrication (or setting).
Then apply a plaster and place a round splint over it, if you have one; and bind it tightly above with a suitable bandage.
And then consider all the measures which we have recommended in other fractures, such as a warm poultice and similar treatments, so that all complications are countered with what is suitable for him until he is healed.
Chapter 16.
Concerning the restoration of a leg fracture.
Know that in the leg there are two bones, of which one is thick, and is named by the name of the tibia (shinbone); and the other is slender, and is named fibula.
And the same types of fractures occur to each of these bones of the leg as occur to the two bones of the arm, and therefore its restoration is done in the same way as the restoration of the arm, and the operation is the same.
And if the two bones are fractured together, the leg is deformed in all parts.
And if the thinner bone is fractured, the leg is deformed in the front parts.
And if the thicker bone is fractured, you will find that below, and it is one of those things that are not easily amenable to treatment.
Then administer extension, reduction (setting), and ligation of the splints according to that same method.
However, if the leg fracture is extensive, having many fragments, the extension should be less and gentler, and alleviate it with your skill.
And in the leg, there is a certain operative procedure similar to that for the arm.  When you set the splints and complete your operation, you will then take pieces of pine wood which are placed beneath the bandages that are placed on the soles.  They are made expressly from palm branches; choose those of small thickness, not the thin ones, and let their length be according to the length of the leg, from the knee to the very bottom.
Then wrap around each (leg) a cloth in two layers according to its length, and place one on one side of the leg and the other on the other side, and let them extend from the knee to the lowest part of the foot.
Then tie the two splints in three places: at the two ends and in the middle.  For with this structure, the leg is prevented from bending to the right or left, and remains in a good position.
And now a small wooden splint, according to the length of the leg, has been prepared; and let the leg be placed on it so that it retains that (proper) position.
And especially it is necessary that you do this in a fracture, and when there is a wound properly so called.
And then examine the leg each day and study it carefully; and watch it for abscesses, inflammation, or other similar conditions; and if any of these conditions occur, then treat it as necessary until it is healed.
Chapter 17.
Of the fracture of the talus and the bones of the foot and toes.
A fracture of the whole talus does not often occur; but fractures of the bones of the foot do occur sometimes; and fractures of the toes rarely occur, and what happens to them is rather attrition (wear and tear) in the joints.
And if a fracture occurs to the bones of the foot and those bones are raised up among themselves, then the patient should place his foot on the ground prepared in the manner described before.
Then place one foot on that which is raised up from those bones, and then press down on them, and squeeze and manipulate them until they return to their places.
Then apply a plaster and tow over it, and place under the sole of the foot a small board to which two flat pieces are attached.
Then bind that firmly to the foot with a descending bandage, after you have wrapped it with cloths and other necessary materials.
And when three or four days have passed for him, then unbind the bandage, for you will find the bones joined, whether they were broken or dislocated, and the operation on them is as you know.
But if some say they are broken, then restore them and manipulate them as I have recounted to you in the restoration of the fingers of the hand. Then place a splint on the broken finger according to the length of the finger, and let it be a little longer than the finger; and place under the foot that board which I have mentioned to you, and bind it with a suitable bandage.
But if what is broken of the bones is two or three or more, then you place on each finger a splint of its size wrapped in linen cloth, and bind the board at the lowest part of the foot, and let it rest on one of the ends of the board outside the instep so that it holds it with good retention.
And it is convenient for you that you do not forget that you consider all the things which I have said to you in the other fractures of the accidents that we have mentioned; and oppose yourself to every accident with what is suitable.
Chapter 18.
Of the fracture of the woman's hip and of the pubic bone and of the man's penis.
When the hip of the woman is broken, then make her lie down in a lying-down position, and gently incline her to one side a little, and let her be supported from behind.
And then the midwife fills the hip with cotton, and it should be made in her hip like a sphere; and then the woman should be held up, and her hip raised little by little, because everything is put back until the broken part of the hip is like a sphere and the broken bone returns to place.
And then apply powders to her hip, and when she wants to urinate, remove the cotton easily and then she urinates, and reposition and return it according to the manner in which you initially placed it, and then return to the first powder application.
And do this for seven days or thereabouts, for then it will be restored.
And if you wish, take an ox bladder and attach a cane tube to its opening; and insert the whole bladder into her hip, and then inflate it through the tube until the bladder is inflated inside the hip, so that the fracture is set.
And then it should be filled with cotton and remain so for some days as we have recommended, until it is healed.
And when the pubic bone of a man or woman is broken, then administer for its restoration and healing that which we have recommended for the hip bone.
And what is right is not hidden in these proximate fractures which rarely occur, especially for one who studies and uses and understands this my book well; for that fracture indicates to you in the greatest detail the correct way of restoration and setting it, and therefore understand well.
But in the case of a broken penis, take a hen's gizzard and place the penis in it; and then place a cloth bandage over it, and let it be wrapped, and then let it remain for three days or so, and it will be healed.
Chapter 19.
Of the restoration of fractured bones when they are accompanied by a wound.
It is convenient for one who suffers a fracture with a wound, and especially if the bone is large, such as the thigh bone or the humerus, or similar, that you take care and bleed him immediately if the conditions for phlebotomy indicate it as we have said above.
And if the wound flows with blood, then it is necessary that you attend to stopping it, so that you sprinkle crushed egg whites on it, if no other cause is present.
And then begin to restore the fracture on that same day, and do not delay this, lest an abscess form.
But if a hot abscess forms, then you should leave the restoration until the ninth day, until the abscess has subsided, and do not approach it on the third and fourth days at all, for you will cause bad accidents.
But if the broken bone is prominent above the skin, uncovered, then it is necessary that you carefully reduce it and align it with your hands easily and with little extension.
But if extension is not prepared for you and the setting of it with your hands, then you reduce it with your hands with this instrument; and this instrument, which is made of iron,  has a length of seven or eight fingers and a width according to the size of the wound; and for this it is necessary for the physician to have three or four of these, according to the quantity needed for this in the treatment of every type of fracture.
And let it be round, and of little thickness, so that it is not bent by the compression upon it during the operation.
And let it have a sharp end which has a margin at its ends; and let the upper part of it be of increasing thickness, and from the middle of it to the parts.  (This is a difficult sentence due to ambiguous phrasing.  The meaning hinges on "partidas" which could refer to various things in this context—likely parts of the body being manipulated).
And this is its form:
And it is named in Greek "labre volentz atelarem," that is, a small spatula.
Therefore it is necessary that its sharp end be raised above the end of the prominent bone.
And push that in at once until the bone returns, and is equalized with some equality/balance. (The meaning of "engualat am alcuna equacio" is somewhat uncertain;  it suggests a restoration of proper alignment or positioning.)
And then strive to equalize the ends of the fracture between them, and if the broken end of the bone is thin, and does not accept the instrument properly, then it is necessary that you incise the end of that bone until the instrument has power over it.
But if you cannot reduce the bone completely with what we have recounted, then incise it with what is suitable from the incisors which we have mentioned; or saw it with one of the saws in whichever way is possible for you.
And then scrape away what remains on the bone of roughness and small splinters.
And when the bone is reduced, and after the reduction the patient finds vehement and hurting pain, then know that the bone is not returned to its natural place; and then do what you can to confer great benefit upon the patient.
When your restoration of the bone is completed, then submerge a cloth in black styptic wine, and especially if it is summer, and do not place on the wound cerate or anything else containing oil, lest it cause putrefaction and corruption.
And then administer stitches at the time of your completion of the bone's restoration, and leave the wound uncovered so that you incise the opening with scissors and use bandages according to the size of the wound.
And guard yourself with all caution that you do not constrict the wound with the fracture, for many times foolish physicians have done this, and caused death or a corrosive or suppurating illness, that is, madness, upon their patients. And if your constriction is light, soft, different from the constriction of other fractures.
And if the wound is large or a bad wound, and you fear some bad accidents which we have recounted, and find pain in the place, then it is not fitting that you place stitches there, but apply a bandage of hard cloths instead of stitches and bind it tightly with those.
And when after a day or two the wound begins to suppurate, then remove the cloth which you had placed upon it with wine, and then apply poultices, ointments with which it is our custom to treat wounds, such as tetrapharmacon ointment and similar ones.
And it is fitting for you to unbind the bandage and examine the wound each day, morning and evening, until it is consolidated and healed, and it is necessary that the limb be positioned in such a way that the pus flows down from it to the lower parts easily.
If many days pass and the wound is not healed, nor is the pus discharged from it, then know that here there are hidden impediments, for which you must probe the wound with a probe. And of those impediments, those which are separated, remove and extract them; those which are not separated and which constrict the limb and cause pain, you are compelled to incise them, as far as is possible for you.
And if a swelling or ulcer occurs in the wound—that is, stye or other kind of corruption and putrefaction—then it is necessary that you treat each of these with what is appropriate, the treatment of which is described in the preceding chapter.
And here is what my discourse should address, and you should keep in mind: when a large bone is fractured,  apply a dressing to the limb, such as for a fracture of the thigh bone or the humerus, and similar for other large bones, and do not attempt traction or extraction, because death often results; leave it until it suppurates, for it will easily fall away by itself after approximately twenty or thirty days; and then cure the wound if you see fit, and if not, leave it alone.
Chapter 20.
Chapter 20: On the treatment of a swelling that occurs at the site of a fracture.
Often this swelling occurs at the site of a healing fracture, especially near the joints, and distorts the shape of the limb; and it quickly prevents the limb from its natural function.
Then consider if the swelling is recent and administer medicines that have a styptic effect, such as aloe, incense, myrrh, cerussa (white lead), and similar substances;  take some or all of these, and mix them with styptic wine, or with egg white, or with sour wine, and apply this to the swelling on a compress, and bind it tightly.
And leave the bandage undisturbed for many days; then unbind it and apply another, until the swelling is reduced; or apply a lead plate directly, because lead has the property of reducing anything swollen in the limbs.
But if the swelling has already become hardened and constricted and necessitates its careful removal, then incise it in the most suitable place, and cut away the excess and prominent parts, or scrape it with a sharp instrument until it is reduced; and treat it until it is healed.
Chapter 21.
Chapter 21. Of the restoration of a fracture when, after it has been set, the limb remains thin and weak, not according to its nature.
When a bone fracture is set, and afterwards the limb remains thin and weak, this is caused by many things: one of which is the excessive dissolution of the ligaments and their binding not being done as it should be; or by excessive tightness of the bandages so that nourishment is prevented from reaching the limb; or by too much superfluous embrocation; or by excessive movement not at the proper time; or by a lack of blood in the patient's body and their weakness.
And the cure for this is to give the patient nourishing food and make their heart cheerful so that their blood is increased; and administer baths; and provide joy and merriment for them.
And then apply a plaster to the limb, so that the plaster draws much nourishment to it, or continuous embrocation with warm water, until nourishment flows and the limb returns to its natural form.
Chapter 22.
Chapter 22.  Of the treatment of broken bones when they are set crookedly and the proper operation is prevented.
When, after a limb has been set, there is a return of crookedness and swelling at the broken bone and joint, and because of this the shape of the limb is impaired, but the limb is not prevented from its natural function, then you should not believe the person who says that the limb is newly broken.
But there have been many foolish physicians and bone-setters who have done this in our land; and this practice is highly blameworthy, leading to great fear, the sign of which is death.
But if the lameness and swelling are recent, then they should be bathed in warm water in which softening herbs are boiled, such as mallow leaves and roots, melilot, and similar things; and a softening poultice should be applied, such as well-made diachylon; or a mucilage of mallow root should be mixed with white clay or myrtle oil and applied as a poultice; or ripe figs should be crushed with pigeon droppings, and similar things from among those medicines called consolidating unguents.
And sometimes it is resolved with gentle, frequent rubbing with moistened hands, and movement of the limb in all its parts should be administered at all times.
But if the crookedness has progressed and become severe and hardened, and it becomes necessary to treat it with iron, then the outermost layer should be scraped away and the continuity of the bone dissolved, and that which superfluously swells around the bone should be incised with fine scalpels, and care and diligence should be applied to this.
Chapter 23.
Concerning discourse on dislocation.
Dislocation is the displacement of one of the joints from its place, wherefore movement is prevented, and the form of the limb is distorted, and it brings great pain and injury upon the patient.
Therefore, when a dislocation happens to someone, then it is necessary to strive immediately that it be reduced, and not delay that reduction, for if it is delayed, the place becomes inflamed and very quickly thereby the reduction of the dislocation is made difficult.
And for this reason, it should not be moved or stretched at the time of inflammation, because many times it causes spasms and intense pain.
But when this happens, then you should attend to the bloodletting of the patient, and then let it rest until the inflammation subsides; and then the limb should be bathed with warm water and oil, and then it should be reduced with ease.
And every limb should be treated with that which will bring back the memory (or recall the function) to its place.
And I have now ordered the chapters on dislocation according to what precedes in fracture; from the uppermost part of the body down to the lowest part.
Chapter 24.
Concerning the treatment of dislocation of the lower jaw.
If the two jaws are dislocated, it will not delay; and the dislocation of both is done in one of two ways: either they are removed from their places by slight movement, and are softened a little; or they are dislocated by complete and full dislocation, until they are softened at the joint, so that saliva flows from the patient and they cannot hold it in nor close their mouth, and their tongue is entangled in their speech.
But when their dislocation is slight, then in most cases it returns by itself with little intervention.
But if the dislocation is complete and full, then a reduction must be administered lightly, and not delayed at all.
And let the assistant hold the patient's head, and let the physician insert the thumb of one hand into the root of the jaw dislocation inside the patient's mouth, if the dislocation is on one side; or let him insert both thumbs together, if the dislocation is on both sides, and the other fingers of his hands be outside with which he will pull; and he commands the patient to relax their jaws and allow them to move from each side; and the physician pulls the jaw and pushes the jaw until it returns to its place.
And if the reduction is difficult, and especially if both jaws are dislocated together, then administer a vaporization with warm water and oil, until the reduction of both is made easier and do not delay the reduction of both at all, as we have said.
And when they return and are aligned, and the patient's mouth is closed and not softened, then place on it powders of cloth with cerot (a type of plaster), and let it be made of wax and rose oil; and then let it be bound easily with soft bandages.
And let the patient sleep on their back, and their head be positioned between two pillows, so that it does not lean to the right or left; and do not force them to chew anything; before their meal let their food be finely chopped, until when the pains are reduced and the jaws are healed, then let them eat what they want.
And this should be administered easily, and do not work on opening the mouth during eating and drinking and speaking, until the jaw is healed and mended.
And if the reduction of the two jaws is difficult when they are dislocated at any time and are not returned to their places, then many times fevers and persistent thirst occur, and very quickly the patient's belly is distended, and very quickly they vomit pure bile.
And when you see this, then know that it is dangerous; and many times one who this happens to dies within a few days (x days).
Chapter 25.
Of the reduction of the dislocation of the clavicle and of the extremity of the muscle.
The clavicle is not dislocated inwards from its connection with the breastbone; and sometimes it is dislocated outwards, and this is evident to the touch.
And its restoration is that the patient lies on his back and extends his arms. Then constrict the area with your palm with firm compression, for it will return.
Then apply a plaster and powders to that area and bind it tightly.
But the extremity of that which is the elbow and is continuous with it, is not dislocated on any day; then it should be reduced and bandaged as we have said and as is appropriate to you.
Then apply a plaster, powders, and a bandage, and instruct the patient to adhere to tranquility and rest until healed.
And with this same treatment, the extremity of the muscle is reduced when it is separated from its place.
Chapter 26.
Of the reduction of the dislocation of the muscle.
Know that a muscle is dislocated in only three ways, one of which is that it is dislocated from the upper part to the lower part.
And the second is that it is dislocated to the upper part of the muscle, and this is done slowly; and it is not dislocated in the back parts by the shoulder; and it is not dislocated in the front parts by the nerves.
And it is mostly dislocated and protrudes outwards to the lower parts below the upper part, and especially in those whose flesh is scant, it is easily dislocated; but in those in whom there is much flesh, it protrudes with difficulty.
And it quickly happens to some men through a blow or fall, and their muscle is inflamed by a hot abscess, and it is thought to be dislocated because of this.
Then you must examine this carefully before you treat him, and then proceed with his cure.
And the dislocation is known when it is in the lower parts below the nipple; so that you may distinguish between the dislocated muscle and the healthy muscle, for you will find a manifest difference between them; and you will find in the head of the muscle a concavity below the nipple, towards the touching of the head of the muscle like an egg, and the patient cannot bring his hand to his ear, nor move it with all movements.
If it is dislocated towards the feet or upwards, and you then find a clear swelling, and it is not hidden.
And the reduction of this dislocation is easily done when it is fresh and the patient is a child.
And the reduction of it is that the assistant raises his hand to the upper parts; and then place your hands below his nipple, and raise the joint firmly to its place, and the assistant raises his hand, and extends it upwards; and then place it below because it returns easily.
But if by what we have said it does not return, and from the beginning of the dislocation many days have passed, then it is necessary that the patient be bathed in warm water and that a softening and relaxing embrocation be administered, such as boiled roots of mallow, fenugreek, and melilot in water, and it should be applied.
And then the patient should be supine on his back and a wool ball placed under his nipple, of a consistency between soft and firm; and then the physician places his heel on the ball, and raises the head of the muscle forcefully, and pulls the patient's hand so that it is not moved downwards, and another assistant holds the patient's head so that it is not moved downwards, because then it immediately returns to its place.
And if you wish, reduce it in this manner:  have a man present who is taller than the patient, and let him stand on that side, and place his shoulder under the patient's nipple and lift the nipple upwards until the patient is suspended in the air, and another assistant pulls the patient's hand from the lower part of his belly. But if the patient is light, then something else should be suspended with him to weigh him down, because the dislocation returns immediately.
And it is reduced easily in another way: a long, round-topped post is fixed in the ground, like a pestle, neither thick nor thin. Then it is placed under the patient; after placing soft cloths on top of the post, the patient stands along the length of the post, and then his hand is extended downwards on the opposite side; and his body is forcefully extended on the other side, because the joint returns to its place quickly.
And if reduction is difficult for all the reasons we have mentioned, then use this treatment: take a stick two cubits long and four fingers wide, and its thickness should be relieved at the nipple's point in this way:
And then soft cloths should be tied over the rounded head so that the stick does not injure the patient.
Then it is placed under the patient's nipple, and the hand or arm is extended over the stick down to the lower parts, and the stick is tied to the shoulder, arm, and hand.
Then the arm is placed on a rung of a ladder according to its width, and the hand is extended downwards, and the rest of the body is suspended on the other side, for the joint enters immediately.
And when its entry is complete in whatever way possible for you, then you should place under the nipple a ball of wool of equal size; and then apply a plaster prepared from powdered myrrh and egg white over the whole muscle, so that it is rolled over, and then tighten under the nipple with a suitable bandage; and the bandage should be rolled over the plaster, and his hand should be attached to his neck, and it should be left, and his hand should not be moved for seven days.
And the patient's diet should be light until the limb is strengthened, for this makes his healing easier.
Then the diet should be increased after seven or five days, and movement should be exercised; and if it is firm and not softened, then it is healed.
But if the joint is dislocated many times due to humidity that affects it or another cause, then cautery with three holes should be administered in that place, as previously stated in the chapter on cautery.
And if all this is done and after seven days the bandage is untied and the joint is not fixed, and the plaster and the bandage are reapplied several times, and it is not fixed and sags and he cannot raise that arm to the upper parts, then know that his nerves, which are at the head of the muscle, are incised or stretched or softened, and know that the joint will never be fixed in its place.
For the dislocation that occurs between the foot and the ankle or the back parts, the reduction is done with impulse and extension with the hands, until it returns [to its place].
And another bandage should be applied to it, and care for it until it is healed.
And if during healing heaviness occurs in the limb and slowness in its movement, then the patient should use baths many times until that heaviness is alleviated and it returns to its former natural state.
Chapter 27.
On the treatment of elbow dislocation.
Know that the elbow joint is dislocated with difficulty and similarly returns with difficulty; and it is dislocated in all directions, but mostly forward rather than backward.  And the dislocation is not hidden from you, for it is evident to sight or touch depending on how it is dislocated. And when you align the dislocated elbow with its socket, this is clearly evident to you, for the joint is hollowed out and cannot bend the arm, nor can it touch its muscle with it.
And it is necessary that you act quickly and reduce the dislocation before an abscess forms, for if an abscess forms, reduction is difficult, and it is not easily completely healed; and especially when it is in the back part, for it is worse than all other types of dislocation, and more painful, and sometimes death results from it.
And its restoration, when it is possible to reduce it, is that the patient's hand should be extended with two hands, and the arm expanded, and the physician's hands should be on and under the elbow, and he should push the joint with the thumbs of his hands together, or with the root of his palm until it returns to its place.
But if the dislocation is in the front, then reduce it by bending the hand with your hand until you strike the elbow with the base of your palm.
And if the dislocation does not yield to reduction, then administer vigorous and very strong extension.
And it is so that two assistants extend the arm, and two assistants hold that extension so that it is not disturbed during the extension.
And then the arm should be rotated in every direction, once it is wrapped with a long doubled cloth over the patient's hand, or a bandage.
And when the physician touches the joint with his hand, anoint it with some oil so that this aids in the lubrication of the joint with ease; and then push the joint with vigorous pressure until it returns to place.
And after the reduction, it is necessary that he be placed on a plaster which has styptic and drying properties with egg white, and be bound tightly with a descending bandage, and the arm be suspended from the neck, and left like that for some days.
And afterwards it should be unbound; and then if the joint is formed in its place, then you untie his bandage and leave it like that.
And if you see the joint not well-knit, then you repeat the plaster and the bandage, and leave it like that for some days until it is tightened; and then unbind it.
But if there is great difficulty in the reduction of the joint, and the patient's disposition is restless, then administer moist heat in a bath and gentle friction, and compression, until it is eased; or place on the joint  alliative agents, that is, something very oily; and then bind it, and leave it on the bone day and night. And then remove that, and put it in a bath; and when it is softened, then you rub the joint with a tempered friction, and then repeat the application of the alliative agent, that is, very oily ointment, once, and a second time, and a third time. with the aid of a bath, until it is calmed.
And if you wish, place on it a warm, moist cow's bladder,  bound tightly over it; and do this several times, because it is moist and restores it to its proper state.
Chapter 28.
Concerning the treatment of a dislocated wrist, that is, of the joint that is between the arm and the hand.
A dislocated wrist is sometimes easily reduced, unlike other joints; however, speed in reduction is necessary at the time of dislocation, before the place becomes inflamed or a hot abscess occurs there.
And the reduction of its dislocation is that you place the patient's wrist joint on a table and the assistant extends the hand, and the physician places his hand or palm on the prominence of the joint, and pulls it until it returns to its place.
However, it must be considered whether the palm is already turned towards the belly of the hand; then the patient places the back of his hand on a table during extension and reduction. And if the dislocation is on the back of the hand, then let the position of the hand be inverted on the table, so that the physician's hand falls upon that prominence of the joint.
And thus, if it returns immediately, it is good; and if not, then constrict it with a poultice, allowing the inflammation to subside, and leave it; and do not repeat this, for otherwise, you will not be able to endure or succeed in its reduction after days have passed.
However, if the joint remains twisted, and no harm befalls the patient except that the hand is weakened and cannot grasp anything, then know that the nerves are pinched or crushed, and then there is no remedy except to constrict it with a cautery near the injury, and quickly apply some dressing.
Therefore, when the limb is reduced, then apply the poultice we have mentioned, and let it be left and constricted for five days; and then let it be loosened and left, and let the patient's hand be exercised.
But if its movement is impeded and some gravity occurs, then soothe it with warm water and friction several times, until it is relieved.
Chapter 29.
On the treatment of finger dislocations.
Sometimes fingers are dislocated in every part.
And when a finger is dislocated towards the palm or its belly, then stretch the finger and push the dislocation back with your thumbs, until it returns to its place.
Then support the head of the finger, and suspend it away from the part to which it is dislocated, and leave it like that for two days.
Then suspend it and extend it until it is straightened on that same day.
And when it is night, bind it according to that description, and do not cease to unbind it during the day and exercise it with movement, and bind it at night; and do this for several days until it is tight.
And do likewise if it is dislocated on the palm of the hand, and bind it to that part and perform your first operation until it is healed.
And similarly do this when it is dislocated in other parts.
Chapter 30.
On the treatment of the dislocation of the spinal vertebrae.
When a complete dislocation happens to one of the vertebrae of the back or neck, and many vertebrae are displaced from their places, then in that case there is no cure, for death awaits the patient.
And a sign of this is that the patient's excretion is expelled involuntarily, and they cannot retain it; and many times some of their limbs are paralyzed, or two of their legs, or two of their arms, or one of those; or one vertebra is displaced from its place, for many times it is displaced and many times the displacement is to four parts.
Therefore, it is already displaced to the back parts and is called yellowness (jaundice, or possibly referring to a yellowish discoloration of the skin in this context).
But the cure for him is that then you consider if the yellowness (jaundice) comes from purulence (pus), for then in that case there is no cure, nor is there any healing at all.
But in that which comes from a fall or from percussion or similar to those, the Ancients already described the methods of cure with lengthy discourse, of which the most returns with profit; but I have abbreviated it from that of which the little excuses the excess, due to my proximity to my intended explanation, with which I have expounded and formed this from various instruments with which I will show this and explain that.
And of those, only that which occurs in the two (presumably referring to specific locations or types of jaundice) properly, with that which I have recounted, is cured.
And it is that the patient be extended on his face on a cushion near a wall, and a soft instrument be placed under him so that his feet are not hurt.
And then a straight stick should be placed, fixed in the earth at the end of the cushion near his head, and another stick near his feet at the other end of the cushion.
And the assistant should hold the stick, and it should not be fixed in a pit; and another assistant should hold the other one in the same manner.
Then wrap a bandage around the patient's head and under the armpits firmly; and extend the end of the bandage to the stick which is near his head, and tie it there; and then tighten another bandage around his hips, thighs, and legs; and then adjust all the bandages and tie them to the other stick which is near his feet.
And then each assistant should extend the bandage to the part of the stick, and the two sticks and the bandages should not be removed from their places where they are fixed, but nevertheless, they are not fixed in the way we have said.
And the physician should place his palms on the spine with strength until it returns, or place a board on it, and then adjust his feet on the board until it returns.
But if it does not return by this method, then take a board whose width or length is about three braccia, and make a hole in the wall which we have said is near the patient, in which the end of the board will fit. And then place half of the board on the spine, and the physician should place his feet on the other end, and press firmly until the spine is compressed and returns to its place.
And if you wish, use a lathe which is rotated by hand; and you should place in the ground below the patient's head, at the back of the neck, two sticks, the length of each being one braccio, and below the head at the back of the neck, two more sticks; and the distance between each stick should be one palm, and a hole should be made in each stick through which the lathe passes, and each should be firmly fixed in the ground so that it does not move.
And let there be a round stick on which the lathe is mounted, and let it be rotated in the two holes of the two sticks.
And at its end is a hole into which the stick is fitted, whose length is one palm including what is rotated; and the other two sticks are similar to that one.
Then tighten the bandages that you have tied around the patient's feet to the stick which is below their head, and the bandages that you have tied around their thighs to the lathe which is below their feet.
And then beside each lathe let a minister stand who turns the lathe with his hand, and the physician manipulates the vertebra as we have said.
Then, once the vertebra is returned and the location is manipulated, you should apply a drying plaster with egg white, and then lint; and then place over the plaster a piece of linen cloth whose width is about three fingers, and whose length is sufficient to cover the affected area, and the part of the healthy vertebra.
Then it should be bound with the bandage we have mentioned, and nourish the patient with light food until he is healed.
And if any swelling remains in the area at the end of healing, then medicines should be administered that soften and smooth, with the continued application of the linen cloth we have recommended; and a lead plate is applied to that area.
And sometimes swelling occurs behind the vertebrae of the back, and is caused by that dislocation; and it is that bone which already swells, so that no attempt should be made to treat it with this medicine, for it will very quickly cause death.
Chapter 31.
On the treatment of a dislocated hip.
Know that the hip joint and the muscle joint suffer only dislocation, and not what happens to other joints of small movement and concavity.
And the hip joint is dislocated in four ways, for it is dislocated inwards, outwards, forwards, or backwards.
And it is mostly dislocated inwards, and rarely forwards or backwards.
And a sign of its inward dislocation is that, when you compare the patient's affected leg to the healthy one, it is longer and the knee more prominent than the healthy one, and the patient cannot bend their foot without pain, and it is the place where the pain is a hot abscess, because the head of the femur has already arrived there.
And the sign of that to which dislocation occurs outwards is that its symptoms are contrary to these symptoms.
And a sign of that to which dislocation occurs forwards is that he extends his leg completely, yet he cannot bend it without pain in the knee, and if he forces himself to walk he cannot do so forwards; and his urine is retained and his groin is inflamed, and he walks on his heel.
And a sign of that to which dislocation occurs backwards is that he cannot extend the knee, nor can he bend it before bending the hip, and his leg is shorter than the other, and the groin is softened, and the head of the femur is behind that place.
But the reduction of the types of this dislocation is that you consider, then, if the dislocation is old and ancient, that is, it has been there a long time, and you administer its reduction and it remains according to its disposition, then it is not completely cured; and then one should not make a prognosis in that case.
But in the case of one whose dislocation is recent, and is one of the four types of dislocation, then take care that you return the joint and extend it inwards and outwards, and move it to the right and left, for it quickly returns and does not require further treatment.
But, if it does not return in this manner, then you must prepare a strong assistant and extend his leg from the lower part, either with your hands, or with a bandage which is tied above the knee; and another assistant extend the hand of that one from above so that he places his hands below the patient's testicles; and then tighten with a linen bandage around the neck of the femur, and let another assistant hold the end of the bandage.
And let the extension be from the inner part to the groin to the part of the clavicle, or from the back part to the part of the back.
And let the extension of all these be at once until the patient is raised with his body from the ground and remains suspended.
And this type of extension is common to all four (types of dislocation).
And therefore, if the dislocation returns with what we have said, it will be good; and if not, then it is necessary for every type what we shall say about its own cure.
In the reduction of the hip itself, when it is dislocated, and the dislocation is towards the inner parts, the patient should be placed supine on his sound side; and then place the ligatures on the root of the thigh in that place which is between the head of the thigh and the place that is below the groin; and then extend the ligatures upwards from the groin to the highest part of the clavicle.
And then another strong attendant should take his arms, and grasp the thick part of the affected thigh and extend it outwards with a strong extension, for then it will return to its place.
And this type of dislocation is of easier cure, with which this member is reduced, than the other types.
But if it is dislocated upwards and does not yield to treatment with this method of cure, then it is necessary to bind the patient's two feet together with a strong, light ligature, above both ankles and both heels.
And let the length of each [ligature] be the quantity of four digits, and let the affected leg be extended more than the other by the quantity of two digits.
And then let the patient be suspended by the head from a beam, and let him be indoors; and let his height from the ground be the quantity of two arms' lengths.
And then command a strong young man to pull down the head of the thigh, and let another young man be suspended with the patient, and the other young man, pulling the thigh with strength, will push, for the joint will return to its place quickly.
But in the proper reduction, when it is a dislocation to the outside, it is necessary that the patient lie on his back as we have recounted in the case of a frozen limb; and let the ligature be tightened on the affected leg and on his feet.
And then let two beams be placed, one at his feet, and the other at his head; and then let adjusted beams be placed in the middle of the abdomen, upon which wet cloths are wrapped, so that the patient is not harmed because the beam is between his thighs, so that during the extension of the lower parts it is not pulled.
And then each assistant extends to his part, and the physician with his hand performs the reduction according to the art.
And when the dislocation is in the front parts, then it is necessary that the leg be extended slightly, and it is according to this same narrative about the abdomen; and the physician places the palm of his right hand on the patient's hip joint, and then grasps that with the other hand, and with that grasping pulls that extended to the lower parts towards the knee joint.
And if the dislocation is in the back parts, then it is not necessary that the patient be extended to the lower parts, and be elevated above the ground; rather it is necessary that he be placed on a hard surface, just as it is necessary for the elevation if his hip is dislocated outwards, according to what we have said of his lying on two hips; and it is on his face and the ligaments are extended, as we have said, it doesn't matter much.
And it is necessary that compression be applied with a tablet to the place where the joint is.
Therefore, when the reduction is completed as it should be — and the sign of his reduction is not hidden from you, and it is that you extend the patient's two legs, and when you see those equal and the patient straightens his leg and extends it without difficulty, then you know that the limb is returned as it should be — and then you adjust the two hips and apply a plaster and bind it so that the hip is not moved in any direction; and let the patient rest for three or four days.
Then untie the bandages and the plaster, and compare one leg with the other.
Then, if you see them equal in appearance, then you know that the dislocation is now healed, and then let the patient go.
And if you see any sign of loosening, then you return and re-plaster it, and bind it according to your first binding, and leave it for three days.
Then untie it, and have him delay walking for a few days until he is strengthened.
Chapter 32.
On the treatment of knee dislocation.
The knee is dislocated in three ways: outwards, inwards, and downwards (more towards the back); it is not dislocated forwards.
And the sign of its dislocation is that you command the patient to bring his leg towards his thigh; then you will know that the knee is dislocated.
And the restoration for all its types is that you make the patient lie down straight, so that he extends his leg as much as possible on that; then adhere your two hands to his face, and place his foot between your feet; and then adhere his knee to your palms, and hold those between your fingers on his knee firmly; and another assistant extends his foot until the knee returns to its place.
And a sign of its reduction is that his leg adheres to the thigh easily and without difficulty.
And then plaster that and bind the leg to the thigh, and then bind them together with a bandage for three or four days, and then unbind them.
And do not allow the patient to walk for some days, until he is healed and strengthened.
But if its reduction is hindered for you, then administer strong extension with the bandages which were previously described in the treatment of the hip.
Chapter 33.
On the treatment of the dislocation of the talus. (Talus refers to the ankle bone)
The talus is sometimes displaced by a slight movement, and sometimes dislocated completely, and its dislocation is made either inwards or outwards.
And the sign of its dislocation is that sometimes the talus swells, protruding towards the part to which it is dislocated.
But the treatment of its displacement is a gentle reduction, and it is that it be extended easily with the hands and be manipulated until it returns (to its place).
But in its treatment when it is completely dislocated, it is necessary that you make the patient lie down straight, and that a strong and capable assistant hold him from behind at his back in the middle of his body.
And then you take with your right hand the foot from the upper side, and with your left hand the lower part of the foot at the ankle.
And then pull the foot towards you with your right hand, and then with the left hand twice, and then extend with the left; and push the bones of the foot with the right towards the leg without effort.
And do this twice as we have recounted.
And then push the bones of the foot to the leg a third time, and you are at the ankle.
Then it returns in one or two times according to this manner, and if you see the foot set correctly, it is good; and if not, then repeat the operation on it, because it will return.
But if the reduction is forbidden to you with what we have recounted, then have the patient lie on their back on the ground, and tightly fasten a strong rope to the ground, so that it falls between their thighs, and you have already wrapped a cloth around them so that the patient is not harmed.
And then let his assistant hold his thighs, and then another assistant extend the foot with his hands or with a bandage tied around the ankle; and then let each assistant extend against the extension of his pair, and let the rope be extended between the patient's thighs, restraining them, so that the body is not pulled downwards against their extension.
And then the physician sets the dislocation with his hands, and another assistant holds the healthy thigh downwards, because the dislocation easily returns.
And so when the dislocation is reduced and the success of its reduction is clear to you, then apply a plaster and bind it tightly with bandages, and bind the foot to the leg with a bandage.
And it is necessary that you fear or guard against the nerves which are behind the heel, so that the bandage over it is not too tight and strongly harms them.
And then leave it for two or three days; and if the bandage is loosened, tighten it.
And then unbind it on the third or fourth day, and forbid the patient from walking for forty days. But if he is forced to walk before that time, there is no certainty that the dislocation will not be loosened and corrupted again, and then it will not receive a cure.
And if a hot abscess happens to him, then it is necessary that you administer to its healing that which precedes our narrative, in another place of treatment and embrocation, until it is healed.
Chapter 34.
On the treatment of dislocations of the toes of the feet.
It is necessary that the one who is dislocated be healed with little extension without work; and this which is not difficult, is rather light (easy).
But if the dislocation is in one of the bones of the toe, then it is necessary that you make the patient place his foot on the ground or on a table, and be standing as if he were walking.
And then you stand, and place your foot on what protrudes from the joints, and then press that with your foot with force until it returns, and you see that it is healed and no prominence appears in the place.
And then place under the sole of his foot a board that covers the whole foot, to which are attached two caps (possibly meaning splints or supports), and then bind it with a decent and firm bandage for three days; and then unbind it and make him rest from walking for many days, until it is strengthened and its reduction is assured.
Chapter 35.
Of the types of dislocation that are made with a wound, or with a fracture, or with both together.
When any of those causes occur, and you exert yourself in its cure and in his restoration, many times death occurs.
And therefore it is not fitting that one should presume upon the cure of him, except he who is wise in the art, of long experience, merciful and compassionate, slow, not rash or presumptuous; and that he use in the beginning medicines that only reduce hot abscesses, and leave the patient to divine judgment, except in that case in which you hope for salvation from destruction, with alleviation of the sickness, and in which some hope appears. And then strive immediately to effect his reduction at the beginning of the cause, before a hot abscess develops.
And then, if the limb returns as we wish, then administer a regimen which reduces hot abscesses and treat the wound with what is suitable for it of drying ointments.
And if the dislocation is with a fracture and occurs in the jagged separated bones, then you force their alignment, and do in this what we have said in the simple illnesses of what precedes in those places.
And guard and avoid, according to your virtue, that entry into the paths of fear as my preaching has preceded you; for this is better for you before your Creator, and more permanent for your glory, and more salutary to your true body in your time. Thus end the words of Albucasis perfectly, for which may God be blessed. Amen.
