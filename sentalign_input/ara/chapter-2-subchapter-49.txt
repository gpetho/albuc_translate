Chapter Forty-Nine
On the incision of the tumor that occurs because of an artery or vein, and is called aneurysm.
If the artery is wounded and the skin above it heals, a swelling often arises from that. Likewise, a swelling and tumor can also arise in a vein.
The signs by which one knows whether the swelling and distension are from an artery or a vein are these: if the swelling is from an artery, it will be oblong, concentrated in the depth of the body, and if you press the swelling with your finger, you will feel a sort of creaking.
If it is from a vein, the swelling will be round, on the surface of the body.  Incising these swellings is dangerous, especially those in the armpit, groin, and neck, and in many places of the body.  And they are extremely large, so you should avoid treating them with iron.
And likewise avoid those that are in the extremities or in the head. As for the kind that results from the bulging of the mouth of an artery, make a lengthwise incision in the skin over it, then open the incision with hooks, then dissect the artery and free it from the membranes.
Until it is exposed, then insert a needle under it and pass it through to the other side, and tie the artery with a double thread in two places as I showed you in the suturing of the two arteries in the temples, then puncture with a scalpel the area between the two ligatures until all the blood in it comes out. 
And the swelling will subside, then employ the treatment that generates pus until the ligatures fall off, then treat it with suitable ointments until it heals.
If the swelling is from an incision of a vein, you should grasp with your hand as much of the swelling with the skin as possible, then insert a needle below the place where you grasped with your hand and pass it through, with a double thread in it, until you bring it out the other side.
Then tie the swelling well with it, as I mentioned to you regarding tying the uvula from both sides with the ends of the thread. If you fear the threads will slip, insert another needle with another thread under the entire swelling at the intersection of the first needle. 
And tighten your threads in four places, then incise the swelling in its middle so that when what is in it comes out, you cut off the excess skin and leave what was tied off, then place on it a compress that you have soaked in wine and oil.
Then use the treatment that is with bandages and ointments until it heals.
