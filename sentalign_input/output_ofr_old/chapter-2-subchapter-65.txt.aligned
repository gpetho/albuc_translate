And the sign when it is from the tear of the peritoneum, is that it causes sudden pain at the beginning, and the swelling appears varied, close under the skin, and this is because of the exit of the intestine and the body outside the peritoneum.	When it is due to a split in the membrane, the signs will be that it starts with a sudden severe pain, and the lump varies in consistency, appearing close under the skin; that is due to the emergence of the bowel and its passage outside the membrane.	0.765802
And sometimes the omentum descends with the intestine, and is retained within, and causes great pain to the patient, especially when it is compressed.	Sometimes also the excrement comes down with the bowel and gets held up there, and this involves the patient's death, for thence arises an intractable pain and borborygmi, specially when pressed upon.	0.7462695
And in these treatments, using iron is feared, therefore it should be avoided.	The treatment of the varieties of this disease with the knife is dangerous; so be cautious of rushing at it.	0.5819133
And sometimes the white peritoneum that we have mentioned is cauterized, after the incision, for fear of bleeding.	Then apply wool soaked in oil to the wound, and the bandage that we prescribed (sometimes also the white membrane that we spoke about is cauterized after the incision to forestall haemorrhage, for that usually happens) and let the ligatures be until they fall away spontaneously.	0.5362169
For this happens often, and leave the ligature until it falls off by itself; and if it is slow to fall, it should be moistened with warm water, and apply what we have mentioned, until it falls; then treat the wound with other treatments, until it is completely healed.	If they are slow in coming away, then foment with hot water and apply something to sweat them off. Then dress the wound in the usual manner until it heals.	0.6294261
