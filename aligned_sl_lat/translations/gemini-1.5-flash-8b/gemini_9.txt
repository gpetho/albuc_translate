Having completed this book for you, my children, which is the last of the knowledge in medicine with its completion, and having reached its end in its expositions and its declarations, it seemed to me to complete it for you with this treatise, which is a part of the practice, that is, of surgery, with the hand.
Since the practice of surgery has been neglected in our region and our time, entirely private, until perhaps its knowledge perished, and its trace was severed; and nothing remained of it but small descriptions in the books of the ancients, which have been altered by hands, and errors and hesitations have befallen them, until its purposes were closed and its effectiveness diminished: It seemed to me to revive it by the arrangement of this treatise, according to the manner of exposition, declaration, and abbreviation; and to present the forms of cautery instruments and other surgical instruments, with the addition of explanations and the acceleration of necessary procedures.
The reason why a good practitioner of surgery with his hand is not found in our time is that the art of medicine is long, and its author must be trained beforehand in the knowledge of anatomy, as Galen described it, until he knows the aids of the limbs, and their forms, and their connections and separations, and has knowledge of the bones, nerves, tendons, and their number and exit points, and of the pulsating and still veins, and the places of their exits.
And therefore Hippocrates said that a name with a name is much, and with a work is little, and especially in the art of the hand.
However, we have already spoken of that at the beginning of this book.
Since whoever is not knowledgeable about what we have said concerning anatomy cannot avoid falling into error, whereby people are killed; as I have seen many of those who boast about this knowledge without understanding or experience.
This is because I saw a foolish physician cut a scrofulous abscess on a woman's neck, and cut some arteries in her neck; therefore the woman's blood flowed until she fell dead in his hands.
And I saw another physician who presumed to remove a stone from an old man, and the stone was large. Therefore, he reached it and pulled it out with a piece of bladder. Therefore, the man died on the third day.
And indeed I had already been called to remove it, and I saw from the size of the stone and the condition of the sick man that he would die.
And I saw another physician who was receiving payment from a certain Duke of our land for medicine, and it happened to a black eunuch who was with him, a fracture in his leg near the heel: and the physician, in his ignorance, hurried and bound the fracture over the wound with pillows and small splints with strong binding, and did not allow the wound an outlet.
Then he discharged him according to his own desires. Afterwards, he sent him away after a few days, and ordered him not to loosen the binding: and it remained like that until his leg and foot became abscessed and resulted in his destruction.
I was therefore called to him, and I hurried to loosen the binding, and there followed peace, and he escaped his pains.
However, the corruption had already become established in the limb, and I could not restrain it.
Therefore, the corruption ceased to spread in the limb until it perished.
And I saw another physician, who pierced the cancerous abscess: and it ulcerated after days, until his illness worsened with its master.
This is because when cancer is pure from melancholic humor, then it is not necessary to reach it with iron at all, unless it be in a limb that can tolerate its being completely severed.
And therefore, children, it is necessary for you to know that surgery is divided into two divisions: namely, surgery with which health is associated; and surgery with which there is danger in many dispositions.
And I have already brought forth in every place of this book, in which surgery comes, in which there is terror and fear.
Therefore it is necessary for you to beware of it and to diminish it, so that fools may not find a way to speak ill of it and disgrace it.
Therefore, accept the measure with care and protection, and your sick ones with ease and firmness, and use the better way leading by God's grace to health and praiseworthy success: and leave the terrible illnesses of difficult cure: and remove your souls from that which makes you fear, so that hesitation may enter upon your faith and your benefit.
For it is more remaining to your glory, and more sublime in this world, and finally to your possessions.
For Galen already said in some of his admonitions. Do not treat a bad illness, lest you be called a bad doctor.
Now, however, I have divided this Treatise into three chapters.
First chapter.
Concerning the cautery with fire, and cautery with sharp medicine, epitomized and arranged from head to foot, and concerning the forms of instruments, and the implements of the cautery, and everything necessary in the operation.
Second chapter.
Concerning incision and perforation, phlebotomy and cupping, and wounds, and the extraction of arrows, and similar things: and all epitomized, arranged by the forms of instruments.
Third chapter.
Concerning restoration, and dislocation, and the treatment of twisting, and similar things: epitomized, arranged from head to foot, and concerning the forms of instruments.
But before I recall the operation with it, it is necessary that I speak of the quality of its benefits and harms, and in what temperament it is to be used.
I say therefore, that the discussion of the quality of the cautery's benefit and harm is a lengthy and subtle discourse, a science and hidden secret.
Many wise men have spoken on this subject, and disagreed on it; and for my part, a little of their words is sufficient, fearing prolixity.
I say therefore, that the cautery benefits every temperament, whether with matter or without matter, except for the two temperaments which are hot without matter, and dry without matter.
However, they disagreed in hot and dry temperament with matter. For some said that the cautery is helpful in it. And others said the opposite, namely that the cautery is not suitable in an illness resulting from heat and dryness, because the nature of fire is heat, and it is unsuitable that one be healed from a hot and dry illness with heat and dryness.
And he who says the opposite stated that through the cautery a benefit is achieved in every hot and dry illness that happens in human bodies, because when you compare a human body and its humors to the temperament of fire, you find the human body cold.
And I indeed say through his statement: because by experience it has already revealed that to me several times.
However, it is not fitting that one come upon it, unless one who is already proven and practiced in the final exercise of the cautery chapter, and has known the diversity of human complexions, and the disposition of illnesses within themselves, and their causes, and their accidents, and the length of their time.
However, from the remaining complexions there is no fear for you; and especially in cold and humid illnesses. For already all physicians have agreed upon them, and have not disagreed in the benefit of cautery in them.
And know, children, that from the secret of healing through cautery with fire, and its goodness over cautery with burning medicine, is this: because fire is simple, whose action does not reach, except the member that is cauterized; and it does not harm another member joined to it, except with little harm.
However, the action of burning medicine reaches that which is distant from the members; and perhaps it causes illness of difficult healing to occur in the member, and perhaps it kills.
But fire, because of its subtlety and the goodness of its substance, does not do that, unless it overflows.
However, that has now become known to us through experiment, because of the length of servitude and study with the art, and standing on the truth of things; and because of that I am excused from the length of speech.
And if it were not so, because it is not permitted to this book of mine, I would bring to you the secret hidden in fire, and the quality of its operation in the bodies of its expulsion, by which it expels illnesses by a demonstrative philosophical discourse, which would be sharpened by your minds.
And know, children, that they disagree about the time in which the cauterization should be performed, and they place a better time in the spring.
And I say that cauterization is suitable at all times, because the harm that is incidental due to the time is submerged in the benefit that is drawn with the cauterization. And especially if the cauterization is for pains from necessary, strong, urgent pains, which do not tolerate delay, because it is feared from them that a greater evil will happen than the small harm which occurs due to the time.
And do not fall into your minds, O children, that which the common people and foolish physicians do not fear, namely that the illness cured by cauterization does not always return.  They consider that a consequence, but it is not as they think; because cauterization is not, unless in place of medicine, which alters the complexion and dries the humidity which is the cause of why the pains occur.
However, cauterization is superior to medicine in its swiftness of health, and the power of its operation, and the vehemence of its dominion.  And it is possible for the illness to return at some time according to the complexion of the sick person, and the location of their illness, and its power, and that which is prepared in their body from the aggregation of superfluities in it, and that which comes to them in its acquisition from food, and similar causes, unless it is the illness for which cauterization is administered.
A subtle illness in a limb from few superfluities and humidities, like a toothache, because of the pain, and similar to it, it is possible that that pain will not return in it. But that happens in few cases.
But truly the common people's saying, that cauterization is the last resort of medicine, is a true statement; not in the way they intend it, however, because they believe it is not a cure that compares with medicine, nor with anything after the cauterization has passed.
However, the reality is the opposite of that, and the intention that cauterization is the last resort of medicine is not, except when we administer methods of cure in some illnesses, and those medicines do not help; then we administer cauterization at the end of the matter, and it helps.  Then it follows that cauterization is the last resort of medicine, not according to the intention understood by the common people and many ignorant doctors.
However, the ancients said that cauterization with gold is better than cauterization with iron, and they did not say that except because of the equal nature of gold and the excellence of its substance, and they said that the area of the cauterization does not produce pus. But that is not absolutely true, because I have already tested it, and found that it does not do so in some bodies without others.
And cauterization with it [gold] is good, and better than with iron, just as they said. However, when you cauterize with gold in fire, it is not clear to you when it is heated according to the amount you desire, because of the redness of the gold; and when it quickly cools, and if you add further heat to it, it melts in the fire and changes into sheets.
Therefore, the artisan falls from that occupation, and because of that cauterization with iron is faster and more readily available to us, in terms of suitability for the operation.
And indeed I have already ordered this chapter on cauterization, according to chapters, and have arranged them from head to foot, so that they will alleviate the one seeking what he wishes from it.
Chapter II.
This cauterization contributes to the dominion of moisture and coldness upon the brain; these two are the causes of headaches, and of a multitude of flows of humors from the head to the parts of the eyes and ears, and of a multitude of sleep, and toothache, and sore throat; and universally of every illness which arises from coldness, such as paralysis, and headaches, epilepsies, and apoplexies, and similar illnesses to those.
The method of cauterization is that you should instruct the sick person to be evacuated first with a cleansing laxative medicine, cleansing the head for three or four nights, according to what the sick person's strength, age, and custom require.
Then instruct him to shave his head with a razor. Then make him sit between your hands in a square position, so that he has already placed his hands upon his chest.
Then place the root of your palm upon the root of his nose between his eyes. Wherever, therefore, your middle finger shall reach, mark that place with the cautery.
Then apply the olive-shaped cautery to the fire.
Then place it upon the place marked with the cautery, descending, so that your hand is gradually constricted, and you will revolve it. Then quickly lift your hand and look at the place.
If you see now exposed from the bone a quantity of alkiel, or a quantity of zeuherbi, then raise your hand. And if not, repeat your hand with the iron itself, or with another from it if it cools: until the bones, which I said to you, are seen.
Then take some salt, and dissolve it in water, and soak the cotum in it, and place it over the place, and leave it for three days.
Then place the soaked cotum on butter, and leave it over the place, until the eschar of the fire is destroyed. Then treat it with tetrapharmacon ointment, until it is healed.
Now they have said that the more a wound remains open, the more it discharges pus: therefore it is better and more helpful.
And some of them said that the skin should be cauterized to the bone, and the cautery should be held until something of the thickness of bone is burned.
Then that which has been burned from the bone should be scraped away, then treated.
And others say that it is necessary to reach the utmost with the cautery, until it makes a deep impression on the bone, so that the bone falls away, which happens like a kirate shape: or a tool that women use to prick the small alphabet; and they believe that vapors of the head are expelled from this place, and the wound is left open for a long time.
Then it should be treated until it is healed.
However, these two kinds of cautery do not seem to me to be at all useful except in certain people according to the way of fear.
And to leave it, in my opinion, is better with the health of the patient.
For the head is weakened by the disruption of its natural continuity, as we have testified in other limbs; and especially when the head of the sick person is naturally weak.  And indeed the first kind of cautery is safer and better in my opinion, and I use it; therefore operate with it for the health.
Chapter 3.
When chronic pain occurs in the whole head and it is prolonged in the sick person, and he uses leeches, and cupping, and head purges, and oils, and poultices. And especially if it has already been cauterized with the single cautery, which we have described, and none of those things helps it: then consider. For if the head of the sick person is of strong natural constitution, and is not weak, and encounters violent cold, then cauterize with another cautery slightly below the first. Then cauterize the entire area above each horn of his head with a cautery, however, do not penetrate the skin and expose a quantity of bone, as we have described. And cauterize the area on the back of his head, in the location called the *vas*—and it is the place where the cupping vessel is placed—and elevate your cautery there; and do not expose the bone. For the sick person will experience intense pain due to that, differing from the pain of the other cauterizations on the entire head.
And I will say this cautery should be in its place: and it should be a cautery with which the horns of the head are cauterized, and the back of his head with a finer cautery, than that which cauterizes the middle of the head.
Chapter IV.
When pain and throbbing occur in a part of the head, or the pain extends to the eye, and it is relieved by medicines that cleanse the head, and the remaining treatment, which I have described in the divisions of illnesses, is not effective, then cauterization is appropriate in two ways: either cauterization with a burning, sharp medicine, or with iron.
The cautery with a burning, sharp medicine is as follows: take one clove of garlic, and peel it, and cut off its ends from both sides. Then, incise the site of the pain with a broad lancet until a space is made beneath the skin, into which the clove is placed.
Then insert it into the space beneath the skin until it is hidden.  Then tie over it with a suitable constriction of a bandage, and leave it for fifteen hours, then remove it and extract the garlic.  Leave the wound for two or three days, then apply a poultice soaked in butter until the site produces pus; then treat it with ointment until it heals.
And if you wish, do it with certain burning medicines, which I have written about in the twelfth treatise, on Burning Medicines.
However, its cauterization with iron is according to this method. The cautery iron, whose form is this.
And it is called a nail, because the shape of its head is like the shape of a nail, in which there is something curved, and in its middle is a small protuberance.
Then place it upon the place, and hold your hand; and you should turn the iron slowly with speed; and let the quantity that is burned be from the thickness of the skin, like half of it. And lift your hand, so that the artery, which is below, is not burned, and a flow of blood occurs.
Then soak a poultice in salt water, and place it upon the place, and leave it for three days; then place the poultice with butter; afterward, treat with ointment until it heals.
And if you wish, cauterize this hemicrania with the second cautery's knife-edge. And beware of incision of the artery in this hemicrania, not properly ancient.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in an ancient hemicrania.
When treating hemicrania, using what we have said in the preceding treatment, and what we have said in the divisions of illnesses, and if the treatment does not help: and you see from the illness that what we have said regarding the first cautery with medicine, or with cautery with fire, is not sufficient, then it is necessary that you heat the cautery's knife-edge until it whitens, after having marked the place of pain with a line, whose length is half a finger, or something similar; and place your hand in one place, and press it until you cut the artery and reach the bone.
However, it is necessary for you to be careful not to burn the jawbone, which moves during chewing, or the nerve that moves it, lest a spasm result.
And be on guard, and cautious about the flow of blood from the severed artery. For in its severance there is fear, especially for him who does not know what he is doing, and is not studious or experienced; and he abandons the operation at the start.
And I will come with a reminder of the regulation of blood flow arising from the artery in its manner and in its place in this book.
If, however, you see from the sickness that this cautery is not sufficient for him, and you see the body of the sick man tolerating the cautery in the middle of the head, as we have recounted, treat the wound until it is healed.
And if you wish, administer the cautery, which we mentioned in the chapter on the extraction of the artery with a cautery having two knives. For cauterization is better than this and more beneficial.
Concerning the method of cauterization in earache.
When earache occurs due to cold, and is treated with solvents, and the remaining treatment which we have described in the division, and the pain is not removed, then cauterize with fire: and that is what is called the Point, whose shape is this.
Then, after its ignition, apply the points along the circumference of the entire ear, as it revolves; or along the circumference of each ear, if the pain is in both simultaneously. And move the cautery slightly away from the root of the ear, after you have marked the places with ink; and let the amount of cautery be ten points on each ear, and like that.
Then treat the places until they heal.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in a Torture.
Chapter VII.
Torture that is treated with cauterization is only from those species that arise from phlegm, according to what we said in the divisions of illnesses.
And avoid cauterization of the species that arises from desiccation and nerve spasm.
When you treat this species of torture with enemas, and head-cleansings, and gargles, and your treatment does not help, then it is necessary to cauterize the afflicted person with three cauteries: one near the root of the ear, and a second a little lower from its temple, and a third at the junction of the two lips.
And place your cautery opposite the afflicted part. Because softening does not occur unless in the part that appears healthy.
And the form of cauterization is that you cauterize it with a cautery directly at the tip of the upper ear, just beneath the horn of the head; and another in the temple, whose length should be according to the length of the thumb. And hold your hand with the cautery until a quantity equal to half the thickness of the skin is burned.
And this is the form of the cautery, and it is a type from a knife, whose form is previously described; however, it is not a little finer than that, as you see; and it is necessary that the knife have a little excess of thickness in it.
Then care for the places, with what preceded, until they are healed.
Concerning the method of cauterization in ancient apoplexy.
When apoplexy is longstanding, and you have treated it with what we have said, and your treatment does not help, and the sick person does not have a fever, then cauterize him with four cauteries upon each horn of his head, and with a cautery in the middle of the head, as we said, and with a cautery on the back of the head, according to what preceded: and let the method of the cautery be according to what preceded.
Also, he is cauterized with a cautery on the mouth of the stomach; and it is more of a last resort.
Then, let him be treated with what preceded.
Chapter IX.
It is necessary that large hyerae and pills that cleanse the brain be given to the sick person first, in their drink.
Then shave the entire head of the sick person, and place on the back of his head a plaster of the type described in the treatise on plasters concerning sinapis; and apply it repeatedly.
For that is the method of the cautery; and do it according to the same order as I stated there.
If therefore it heals by that, it is good. If not, then make three cauteries on the back part of his head, which shall descend from the upper part of the head down to the lower part of the eye; and place the thickness of a finger between each cautery.
Then treat the cautery with what preceded it.
If however you wish an addition, and the sick person is weak in tolerating it, then make a cautery in the middle. If however you wish an addition, then cauterize him above the two horns.
Then treat him until he is healed; and let the cautery be oily according to the form which was stated previously.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in paralysis, and softening.
Chapter X.
It is necessary that you proceed in cleansing the head with hyæris, and with what we said.
Then shave the head of the sick person; afterward cauterize it with a cautery in the middle of the head, and with a cautery over each horn of the head, and with a cautery over its back, and with three over the vertebrae of the neck.
However, if in the illness there is need for softening the body with more of these, and the sick person is tolerant, and the illness is severe, then cauterize him with four cauteries over the vertebrae of the back, and finally with a cautery, until most of it is burned from the skin, and raise your hand. Then treat him until he is healed; and thus the cautery of Oliuare.
Concerning the method of cauterization in Epilepsy.
An epileptic is not cauterized, unless that whose epilepsy is from phlegm.
Therefore, it is necessary that you first cleanse his brain with leeches, and with the rest of the treatment that we have described in the division: when the sick person is strong, or is tolerant in receiving medicines.
If however, it is a child who does not tolerate medicines, then a gargle and cleansing mastications for the brain are administered, many days prior to that, with the improvement of foods.
Then shave his head, afterward cauterize it with one cautery in the middle of the head, according to what preceded in the manner: and with another cautery on his occiput, and with a cautery on each horn of his head. If, however, the patient is strong and tolerant, then cauterize him with the cauteries that I described in the case of paralysis, and soften the body over the vertebrae of the neck and vertebrae of the back; and let the cautery be olive-shaped according to the method that preceded.
If, however, the patient is a child, then apply a thin cautery, according to this method.
Concerning the method of cauterization in Melancholy.
When the cause of melancholy is corrupted humors and thick phlegm, then cauterize him with the cauteries that we mentioned in the case of paralysis.
And if the cause of melancholy is excess of the downward inclination to melancholy, and the patient's body is moist, then give him a drink that will purify his brain, according to what preceded in the division; then shave the patient's head, and afterwards make a neatly fashioned roll of linen, like a circle.
Then place it in the middle of the head, and the patient, sitting upright, must be held secure on all sides.
Then apply the liniment. And it is better made from old sheep's butter. And heat it over a fire with a moderate amount of heat, which the finger can tolerate when introduced into it. Then apply it to the middle of his head in a circle, and leave it until it cools.
Do this to the sick person once a week, with the rest of his good regimen, until he is healed.
Or if you wish, cauterize it by making many small points on it, holding the hand with the cautery close to it: indeed, let it be by smelling.
For this type of cautery moistens the brain with quality.
Then place on it a cloth soaked in butter, or chicken fat.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in descending water to the eye.
Chapter XIII.
When the beginning of water in the eye is declared to you by the signs, which I have said in the division, then begin and let the weak drink it, with that which cleanses his head.
And keep him from all dampness, and make him sit in a bath, fasting for several days.
Then command him to shave his head, and cauterize him in the middle of his head. Then cauterize him above the two temples with two cauteries, if the descent of water is beginning in both eyes simultaneously; or from one side, if the beginning of water is in one eye; and cut with the cautery all the veins and arteries that are under the skin; and let the cauteries be long in the width of the temples; and beware of the flow of blood.
If you see anything from it, then cut it immediately with whatever medicine is possible; and I will come with the knowledge that is in the extraction of arteries, and the cutting of them, and caution from the flow of blood.
And sometimes it is cauterized on the neck, under the two bones, with two cauteries ultimately produced.
Concerning the method of cauterization in ancient weeping.
When the tears of the eyes are ancient, constant; and are upon the veins and arteries that are in the manifest exterior of the head, it is verified that it is from cold, phlegmatic superfluities; then cauterize with the same cautery that I have described in the beginning of descending water, with a cautery in the middle of the head, and two cauteries above the two temples, and two cauteries on the neck under the two bones. And if it needs addition, then cauterize it on every side of the cavity of the eye, above the extremity of the eyebrow with a small cautery.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in a foul odor of the nose.
When you treat it, with what we have said in the division, and the treatment does not help; then quickly, and give in a drink to the weak person cochlias three nights; afterwards shave his head, and cauterize it with a middle cautery, with an olive cautery. Then cauterize it with a clavicle cautery, with two cauteries, above the two eyebrows under the hairs a little.
And guard against the artery, lest you strike it.
And this is the form of the Clavilli cautery.
Concerning the method of cauterization in the softening of the eyelid.
When the eyelid of the eye is softened by illness or moisture, then cauterize the eyelid with one cautery, with this lunate cautery.
And if you wish, cauterize it above the two eyebrows a little with two cauteries on every part; and let them be distant from the two temples; and let the length of each cautery be according to the length of the eyebrow; and do not bring your hand with the cautery to the limit, but according to the amount that the third eyelid is to be burned.
Concerning the method of cauterizing the eyelid with hairs reversed, stinging the eye.
The cautery is in it according to two methods: either cautery with fire, or cautery with a burning medicine.
In cautery with fire, beforehand tell the sick person to remove his hairs, if he is one of those who cleanses them, until they are elongated and equalized. If, however, they prick him at their origin, then bind his eyes with a bandage so that they do not move until they are born.
When therefore they are born and equalized, then place the sick person's head in your lap; then mark above the eyelids of his eyes with ink, a mark which is according to the shape of a myrtle leaf, and let the beginning of the mark be close to the hairs.
Then place a cloth soaked in egg white, or in psyllium mucilage, over the eye.
Then apply a cautery, whose shape is this.
Then cauterize over the shape that you have marked, gradually in many stages, until the surface of the skin, which is like the shape of a myrtle leaf, is entirely burned away.
And the sign of the success of your work is, that if you see the eyelid now contracting, and the hairs rising at the puncture of the eye.
Therefore raise your hand then, and leave it for three days.
Then place on it a compress with butter, until the eschar is removed. Then treat it with ointment, until it is healed.
If any hair grows back after an hour, and the eyelid softens: then again cauterize that place, as you did at first.
If however the hairs are in the lower part, then cauterize it, until it is raised to its natural place, and made even so that the hairs do not prick the eye.
It is that you should instruct the sick person to let the hairs be, until they lengthen and become even. Make a shape of a myrtle leaf from paper and cloth.
Then take from known soap, and from unsoaked lime, each one a weight of one ounce, or approximately that: then grind them together thoroughly, and do that quickly, so that it does not cool down. Then, spread some of it from the paste onto the paper you have made in the shape of a myrtle leaf, and place it on the eyelid of one or two eyes. And place under the eye a cloth soaked in egg white: and let the head of the sick person be in your bosom.
And place your index finger on the medicine, and press it for a little while. And you should move it whenever the sick person feels the medicine's bite, because its bite is found to be like fire.
While, therefore, this that he finds, the bite, lasts, then release the medicine and move it with your finger. When therefore the bite ceases, then remove the medicine, and wash the eye with water.
And then consider, if you see the eyelid raise, as it raises with a contraction from fire, or with an incision, it is well; and if not, then again put some medicine onto the place where the medicine does not take effect, and does not darken, until your operation is equalized, and the eye contracts.
Then place on it Cotum with butter, until the skin of the burn is eradicated. Then treat it with diaphinicon ointment, or another, until it heals.
And it is necessary for you during the operation to maintain the utmost care, so that nothing from the medicine falls into the eye.
If the eyelid softens after days, and something from the hair fights its way into the eye, then apply medicine again to the place on the eyelid that is softening, as you did at first. Then treat it until it heals.
And this is the form of a myrtle leaf.
And know that the eyes of men differ in size and smallness. Therefore, according to that, let your consideration be; and the way of rectitude is not hidden from him who is diligent in this art.
Concerning the method of cauterization in a tear duct fistula.
When you treat a fistula, in the same way as we have said in the divisions of illnesses, and your treatment does not help, then, it is necessary that you cauterize it according to this method.
Command the sick person to place his head in your lap, and let the attendant hold his head between his hands in such a way that it does not move or shake with his head.
Then place a cautery, soaked in egg white or in psyllium mucilage, over his eye; then apply the cautery, whose shape is this.
Let it be concave, like the shape of a vulture's wing feather from one end, with which the cautery is made; and if you wish, it may extend penetratingly to the other end, and if you wish, it may be held upward in this way.
However, this concave shape is better for your work.
Then express the fistula, if it is open, and extract the pus from it and dry it; and if it is not open, then open it and extract its pus.
Then place the cautery, which is made very hot, upon it.
And hold your hand with the cautery near the eye, towards the nose, so that your hand does not wander or the sick person is not disturbed; and place the cautery on the fat of the eye and corrupt it.
If therefore you reach in the beginning of your cautery's application up to the bone, it will be well. And if not, then repeat the cautery once or twice, if you need it, and leave it for three days.
Then place a cloth with butter, and care for it with a drying ointment, until it is healed.
If forty days have passed and it is not healed, then place upon it a sharp, corrosive medicine, until the bone is exposed; and scrape it according to what is coming in its chapter.
And there is another method of cauterizing fistulas, which some of the first [authors] said. Direct your attention to the location of the fistula, and split it open; then place in the fissure a fine camahan, that is, a fine cannula, whose shape is this. And pour into it a drachma of melted lead, and hold your hand with the cannula firmly, and let the sick person not move at all, so that the melted lead does not run, or reach his eye.
And it is necessary that you place over the sick person's eye a poultice steeped in egg white, or in water.
For lead burns the area of the fistula, and heals it with a marvelous cure.
If the fistula is healed by what we have said concerning the cautery and treatment, it is good. And if not, then it is necessary to administer a nasal passage, and to reduce the fistula to the course of the nose, according to what will come to its own proper place.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in lip fissures.
Often fissures occur in the lip, called hairs, and especially in the lips of children.
Therefore, when you treat these fissures, with what we have said in the division of illnesses, and if treatment does not help, then cauterize with a small knife cautery, according to this form.
And its concavity should be according to the sharpness of the knife.
Then quickly place it, heated, on the fissures themselves, until the cautery reaches the depth of the fissures.
Then treat it with a cautery, until it is healed.
Concerning the method of cauterization in a fistula of the mouth.
When an abscess occurs at the root of the gum, or in the palate, or in the roots of the teeth; then it produces pus, and bursts; afterward it becomes chronic, and pus flows, and a fistula forms; then you treat it, and treatment is of no avail, then it is necessary to cauterize the fistula with a cautery of a size that matches it. Then introduce the heated iron into the opening of the fistula, and hold your hand until the hot iron reaches its depth and its end; do this once, or twice.
Then treat it afterwards, with what we have said about treatment until it is healed.
If, therefore, the pus is cut off and healed, it will be good. And if not, then it is necessary to expose the place, and remove the corrupted bone according to what will be found in its head.
Concerning the method of cauterization in softened gums and teeth.
When the gum softens because of moisture, and the teeth move, and you treat it with medicines, and it does not help: then place the head of the sick person in your bosom.
Then, with fire, a cautery, whose form will come after this, so that you place the Cannula over the tooth: and quickly insert into it the heated Cautery: and hold your hand for a little while, until the sick person feels the heat of the fire already reaching the root of the tooth.
And raise your hand; then repeat the cautery several times, according to what you wish.
Then let the sick person fill his mouth with salt water, and hold it for one hour, and spit it out.
For the moved tooth is strengthened, and the softened gum is tightened, and the corrupt moisture is dried.
Concerning the method of cauterizing toothache.
When toothache is due to cold, either the tooth itself is cold, or there is a worm, and treatment with medicines does not help, then the cautery is applied to it in two ways: either cautery with butter, or cautery with fire.
However, cautery with butter is as follows: take cow's butter and boil it in an iron spoon, or in a pan. Then take a cotton swab and wrap it around the tip of the probe. Then immerse it in the boiled butter and quickly place it on the aching tooth, and hold it until it cools; then repeat it several times, until the fire's effect reaches the root of the tooth.
And if you wish, immerse wool or cotton in cold butter and place it on the aching tooth, and place a heated iron on top of it, until the fire reaches the deep cavity of the tooth.
Its cauterization with fire is as follows: apply a brass or iron cannula. And let there be something of its thickness in its body so that the sharpness of the fire does not reach the sick person's bone.
Then take a cautery, whose form will be shown, and place it on that tooth, and hold your hand until the cautery cools down.
Do this several times, for the pain will be removed, either on that same day or on another day.
And it is necessary, in the application of that cautery, that the sick person fill their mouth with good butter and hold it for one hour; then let them spit it out.
And this is the form of the cautery.
Cauterize with whichever extremity of force is possible; and this is the form of the cannula.
Concerning the method of cauterization in Strophulus.
When Strophulus are from phlegm and from cold humors, and are not obedient to digestion by medicines, and force hastens their digestion, then with a concave cautery of fire, whose form is this.
Having two open extremities, so that smoke may escape from the cautery at one extremity; and place it ignited upon the abscess once, and a second time, if need be, until it reaches the depth of the abscess.
If the abscess is small, then place the cautery according to the size of the abscess.
Then leave it for three days, and place upon it a poultice infused in butter, until that which the fire burned is removed.
Then treat it with tooth ointment, until the form of the cannula is healed.
Concerning the method of cauterization in hoarseness of voice and constriction of breathing.
When moistures overcome the lung passage, and especially when it is with a cold temperament, then it is necessary that the infirm person be evacuated first with dissolving medicines.
Then cauterize it at the root of the throat in the depressed place, and beware, lest you reach the throat with the cauter, nor the skin, unless something of it.
Then cauterize it with another cauter at the junction of the neck at the last vertebra of it, finishing: and let the cauter be narrow according to the manner which preceded.
Then treat it with what preceded until it is healed.
Concerning the method of cauterization in diseases of the lung, and cough.
When cough and disease of the lung are from cold humors, and the sick person does not have fever, nor consumption, and the disease is old, then cauterize him with two cauteries above the fork in low, smooth, empty places. And with another cautery in the middle of the chest between the two breasts: and let the cautery be of a tube according to the form that preceded.
And if you wish your cauterization to be by puncturing with a cautery, called Point, whose form preceded in puncturing the pain of the ears: and let the punctures be from thirty points up to as many more.
Then treat him with what preceded, until he is healed.
And now let the cautery have three branches: according to this form. Therefore, the cauterization will be alleviated when you do it with three cauteries at one time.
Chapter XXVII.
When the head of the assisting cause of humidities is dislocated, and is not fixed at the time of its return from its dislocation, until such time as it is accustomed to returning, then it is dislocated by a slight movement, which happens as we have already testified it, then it is necessary to reduce the dislocation first. Then the sick person shall be placed on their back, or on their healthy side. Then raise the skin that is in the inner titillico upwards with the fingers of your left hand: and if the joint is dislocated inwards.
Then taking a cautery with two prongs. Whose shape is this.
Then cauterize the skin until it penetrates to the other side, and the shape of the cauterization will be with four cauteries.
And sometimes a cauterization is made with a cautery having three prongs, therefore the shape of the cauterization is then six cauteries: and the prongs are according to the thinness of the thread.
And this is the shape of the cautery having three prongs.
And sometimes one is added to this shape, therefore there are eight cauteries.
Then place crushed leeks with salt on the cautery. Then cause the infirm person to adhere to stillness, so that the limb is not moved at any time until it is strengthened.
And if the dislocation is upwards, and that rarely happens, then cauterize it above the shoulder with a hooked cautery, or with many cauteries by pricking.
For the joint is strengthened, and moisture is removed: and the infirm person is healed.
Concerning the method of cauterizing the stomach.
When there are cold and many moistures in the stomach, until they extract it from its complexion, and the catarrhs multiply in it, and frequent modes of treatment, and do not benefit: then it is necessary that the infirm person be laid on their back, and extend their legs, and their hands. Then cauterize with three cauteries, one cautery beneath the spoon-shaped region of the chest, a finger's breadth in size, with a cautery like a nail, and two cauteries below from two sides of the single cautery, until the shape of the cauteries becomes triangular. And lengthen between each so that they do not join, when they will make pus.
And the depth of the cautery should be the amount of two-thirds the thickness of the skin.
And let the shape of the cauteries be according to this form, without addition; and if you wish to cauterize with a large cautery in the middle of the stomach, according to this form, let the cautery by which this is done be single, in the form of a circle, according to this form.
And the stomach is cauterized by pricking him who is terrified by this cautery; and it is, as if signs on the stomach a point according to the amount, which you wish with ink; then cauterize it with the cautery of the point; then treat it with the treatment which preceded until it is healed.
Of the method of cauterizing a cold liver.
When pain occurs in the liver from coldness and moisture, or from thick windiness, until it emerges from its natural complexion by superfluous discharge, and the sick person is treated with what we have said, and it does not benefit him: then it is necessary that the sick person be placed supine on his neck, and mark with ink three cauteries according to this figure, and this same amount, on the lower liver from the hypochondria, where the human elbow reaches; and let the space between each cautery be according to the thickness of a finger; and let the cautery be straight according to the length of the body; and do not press your hand with the cautery much.
And let the amount of what is burned be, from the thickness of the skin, the amount of half of it, not added; and let the sick person be standing on his feet.
If however, he is not standing, then let him be lying down, who has already extended his legs and raised his arms.
This is the form of the cautery.
And it is possible for you, to cauterize these cauteries with a knife cautery, when you have subtlety and prudence in the art.
And guard yourself, so that you do not proceed to the utmost in cauterization, and the thickness of the entire skin is burned, wherefore the whole body is burned, and reaches the intestines: because the skin there is thin, therefore know that.
Concerning the method of cauterizing liver abscesses.
When an issue occurs, and you wish to know if that abscess is in the flesh of the liver, or in its tunic: then if it is in the flesh of the liver, the sick person is afflicted by pain and heaviness without sharpness; and if it is in the tunic of the liver, there is intense sharpness with the pain: and you already see that the treatment has fatigued its physicians.
Therefore, it is necessary that the sick person lie on their back. Then mark the location of the abscess with ink; then apply a cautery heated like a sunbeam. And this is its form. And cauterize with it one cautery, until the whole skin is burned and it reaches the pus, until all the pus comes out; then treat it with the treatment for issues, until it is healed.
And it is not necessary for one to use this type of cautery unless one's study in the art of medicine is prolonged, and through whose hands such illnesses have come together with experience several times; then indeed let one dare to undertake such an operation.
But truly, to leave it is better, in my opinion.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in Pleuritis.
The ancients said that cautery with aristolochia roots is for cold pleurisy according to this method. And it is that you take from the dry long aristolochia roots, one root longer than the others, and of the thickness of a finger. Then immerse it in oil, and light it in fire. Then cauterize with one cautery in that which is between the continuation of the fork with the neck, and with two small cauteries slightly sloping downwards to the part below the beard.
And with two cauteries also in that which is between the fifth and sixth ribs, sloping slightly backwards; and with another cautery in the middle of the chest, and another above the stomach. And with three cauteries from behind: one in that which is between the two shoulder blades; and with two cauteries from the two sides of the chest, below the cautery that is between the two shoulder blades.
And you should not press your hand with the cautery, but rather it should be evident by smelling the skin.
And some ancient ones have said that there are people who use a cautery of iron similar to a rod; and they burn, and introduce it into that which is between the ribs, until they reach with it the abscess itself, and the pus comes out; as we have said regarding the abscess of the liver.
But in this perforation with the cautery there is fear, that either the weak person dies immediately, or a fistula occurs in the place, which has no cure.
Concerning the method of cauterizing the Spleen, Chapter XXXII.
When you treat the illness of the spleen, with what we have said regarding the treatment in the division of illnesses, and if your treatment does not help, then the cautery is used in it according to three methods, all of which are correct.
One of which is to make three cauteries, or four, drawing lines along the length of the spleen according to the figure of the cauteries of the liver, of which the figure preceded.
And let there be between each cautery a quantity equal to the thickness of a finger, or a little more or less.
And let the method of the cautery be, which we said in the cautery of the liver, equally.
And do not press your hand with the cautery: and let the infirm person lie supine on his back.
And another method of cauterization is: that you heat the cautery having two points, which we said in the chapter on the dislocation of the humerus: and raise the skin, which is in a direct line with the spleen, where the left elbow of the infirm person reaches: and let your lifting be such that you lift the skin according to the width of the body, so that the cauteries fall along the length of the body.
Then introduce two very hot points, until with them you penetrate the skin on the other side; then withdraw the cautery; thus, four cauteries are made.
And if you wish to cauterize with another cautery having three points.
Then treat the cautery after you have dismissed it to emit pus for many days: for it is more beneficial than any of the preceding cures.
Concerning the method of cauterization in dropsy.
The cautery does not fall on dropsy, unless properly applied.
When you treat a dropsical patient with the methods of treatment we have mentioned in the division, and the treatment is not effective, then you must cauterize him with four cauteries around the navel, and with one cautery on the stomach, and another on the liver, and one on the spleen, and with two cauteries after the back between the vertebrae, and one in the direct line of the chest, and another in the direct line of the stomach: and let the depth of the cautery be approximately equal to the thickness of the skin.
Then leave the cautery open, that it may discharge pus for a long time.
And do not remove the sick person from treatment after the cautery with him; because it is necessary that two intentions be gathered in him; and healing will hasten to him with God's help.
The shape of the cautery with which the abdomen is cauterized should be a nail, according to its previous shape; and that with which the back is cauterized should be olive-shaped, according to its previous shape.
Concerning the method of cauterizing the feet and legs.
When boils fester in a dropsy patient, and are filled with yellow water, you should cauterize on the back of the foot, in the nocrati, which is between the auricular and annular areas; and raise your hand with the cautery, and do not twist it; then raise your hand; and do not repeat it at all.
For the yellow water will sweat out, and the cautery should be of this form.
Then make two cauteries on each leg, and let the cautery be with the sharp end of the cautery; and let the cautery be along the length of the leg, one below the knee, and the other below that, approximately in the middle of the leg; and make two cauteries on each thigh; and leave the cautery open without treatment for a long time, so that some water may sweat out from it; then treat it with the rest of what we have said.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in abdominal ailment.
Chapter 35.
When the abdominal ailment is from cold and dampness, weakening the retentive and digestive powers in the stomach and intestines, and it is treated by methods of cure but does not heal; and you see the sick person tolerating a cautery of exuberant strength, then cauterize him with a large cautery on his stomach, as was previously done in cauterizing the stomach with a circular cautery, and four small cauteries around the navel, with a small claw-like cautery; and a large cautery on the lower back, or two cauteries.
And if you see excessive moisture, and the sick person tolerates it, then cauterize him with a cautery on the ribs, and a cautery on each hip; and perhaps add two small cauteries near the large one on the stomach.
For it is a beneficial cure, whose aid does not err.
Concerning the method of cauterizing Hemorrhoids.
Chapter XXXVI.
When in the anus there are many old hemorrhoids, or one, and they are from thick, cold humors, or corrupted moisture, and they are treated with what we said in the division, and the treatment does not help: then cauterize with three cauteries on the lower spinal column of the back, under the almeidati somewhat triangularly, and a cautery under the navel, as if by two fingers' width.
And if you think that his stomach is chilled, and his food is not digested, and you see his face becoming pustular, then cauterize him on his stomach with a large cautery, according to what preceded: and cauterize on his liver, and another on his spleen, with a clauili cautery: and leave the cautery open for a time: then treat him until he is healed.
Chapter XXXVII.
When you excise althelul, then cauterize with a cautery that resembles a ray. Then insert it [the heated cautery] into the excised althelul: and with the last of your hand, until the cautery reaches the opening of the vein, from which blood flows: do this once, or twice.
If therefore the althelul are many, then cauterize each one with the cautery according to what we have narrated. Then treat them with what benefits them from the ointments, until they are healed.
And if you cauterize it with a large cautery over alcatin, it is more beneficial in the end.
Concerning the method of cauterizing a fistula in the anus.
Chapter XXXVIII.
When the patient does not obey the incision and the operation that we have described in its place, and is frightened by it, perhaps he is healed with a cautery.
When therefore a fistula occurs to someone, and becomes chronic, pus runs from it, and corrupt humours. Therefore it is more fitting that you probe it with a slender probe. Then ascertain its depth with the probe.
Then heat the cautery, which is similar to a ray. Then introduce the heated cautery into the fistula itself, and note the quantity in which the cautery entered.
And repeatedly apply the cautery to it until all those corrupted bodies are burned, once, or twice, or three times, according to your necessity.
And guard yourself from burning the nerve, if there is one there, or a large vein; or if the fistula goes to the body of the bladder, or to the body of the intestine, then guard yourself from all these locations.
And do not do this unless the fistula is in a fleshy location and you judge it not to be penetrating.
Then treat the location until it is healed.
If however the location is sealed, and the materials are cut away from it, and it remains like this for a long time, then know that it is now healed completely.
And if they do not cut away the materials from it, then know that it is penetrating, or a corrupt bone is in its depth, or something like that from those things; whose mention will come in its place.
Concerning the method of cauterizing the Kidneys.
When pain in the kidneys occurs from cold or from strong wind, and it diminishes thereby the strength of the afflicted person, then it is necessary to cauterize it above the almethen, above the kidneys themselves, with a cautery on every kidney with a nail cautery, whose mention preceded.
And perhaps we cauterize it a second time on the almeidatu itself. Therefore three lines will appear. Therefore the latter will be more helpful.
Concerning the method of cauterizing the bladder.
When weakness and softening of the bladder occur from cold and moisture, so that the afflicted person cannot retain urine, then cauterize it on the lower part of the summit above the bladder, where the hairs of the pubic region begin.  Cauterize from the right side of the summit, and from the left side of it, and let the length of the cauterization on either side be according to the size of a thumb's breadth. And cauterize it with a cautery from the lower back, or with two cauteries if you need them, and let it be according to the previous cautery's closure.
Concerning the method of cauterizing the uterus.
When cold and moisture affect the uterus, hindering impregnation, corrupting her menstrual flow, delaying its discharge, and causing pain during its arrival, then it is necessary to cauterize with three cauteries around the navel, as we said in cauterizing the bladder, and with a cautery above the lower back, or with two cauteries: and let the cautery be closed.
Concerning the method of cauterizing the anus in dislocation.
When mucous humours discharge into the anus and cause its exit from its proper place; and a sign of this is that one leg is extended over the other when compared, and the place of the dislocation is found empty in it.
Therefore, it is necessary to cauterize the affected area above the anus itself with a similar circular cautery, after marking the circumference of the anus with ink as it revolves, so that the anus itself falls within the centre of the circle.
If this cautery is not available to you, then cauterize it with three cauteries, using a large olive-shaped cautery; and let the depth of the cautery be according to the thickness of the skin overall.
Then treat it until it heals.
Concerning the method of cauterization in Sciatica.
When pain occurs in the hip joint, and its cause is cold and moisture; and the patient is treated with what we have mentioned in the division, and the treatment does not help, and it becomes chronic: then it is necessary to free the patient from gross humours with foul pills, or with artificial pills, and similar remedies. Then cauterize it.
And the method of cauterization in it is according to two methods: either cauterization with burning medicines, or cauterization with fire.
Cauterization with fire is according to many methods.
One of them is to cauterize over the hip joint itself with three triangular cauteries, according to this shape. And make them a good or bad depth. And let the space between each cautery be the thickness of a finger; let the cautery be olive-shaped.
Sometimes, however, the cautery is made in the middle over the head of the hip itself. Therefore, there are four cauteries.
And if you wish to cauterize with a circle, whose form preceded in the cauterization of the dislocation of the hip, one: so that the circle contain the entire hip.
And burn the thickness of the entire skin.
This is the method of cautery in sciatica, when the pain is adhering to the hip itself, and does not extend to the thigh and leg.
If however it extends to the thigh and leg, then cauterize it with two cauteries on the thigh, over the place to which the sick person points there, where the pain is, and with your cautery on the calf four fingers to the wild side for a little while: and let the cautery be a knife-like one.
And let the depth of the cautery be according to the depth of the thickness of the skin.
If the sick person indicates that the pain extends to near the toes of the foot, then cauterize it there where he indicates with a puncturing cautery, three, or four, or more, if he needs it.
And if he indicates pain to be below the knee towards the leg, then cauterize it there with one knife-like cautery.
And beware in all your cauterizations, that you do not proceed with the cautery to the point of burning a nerve, or a major artery, and thereby bring upon the sick person a great harm, or contraction.
And indeed I have already seen one and another, of those who have cauterized above the ankle, and have proceeded too far in their cauterization, and the leg has swollen, until the swelling reached the foot, and the whole foot was perforated and corrupted; then there followed a rupture of the belly, and death after that.
If the pain is in two parts simultaneously, cauterize each according to this method.
And some wise men have said in the cauterization of the buttock, whose cautery this is the method. Make a similar cautery of iron, whose diameter is half a palm: and let it be at its opening according to the thickness of a date stone, or a little less: and within that cautery let there be a third cautery.
And let the space that is between each cautery be the size of a thumb's knot: and let the cauteries be open on both sides: and let their height be like a knot, or two knots: and make for them a handle of iron fitting well into the cauteries.
Then it should be heated in fire until it glows red and throws off sparks; then it should be placed upon the affected buttock of the patient lying on his healthy side. Therefore cauterize him with three round cauteries in a single turn.
Then leave him for three days. Afterwards, apply plasters with butter, and leave the wound open for many days. Then treat it with ointment until it heals.
Albucasis says, with this kind of cautery, my children, we have used it little, because of the terror of its appearance, and because we find few who wait upon it.
However, it is a good cautery for him who suffers, and finds its place with him.
A cautery, however, is made with burning medicines, so that you make two samia having a perforated armilla, into which descends the hinge of its door, made of bronze or iron, the length of the wall; on whose height they should have two knots, or similar to them.
And let the space between each be the thickness of a finger, and let them be open below and above, and let them hold each other together in this form.
Then place it on a box of ashes, the sick person lying on their healthy side. And press your hand firmly on the box of ashes. Then pour between the two circles hot water, which has been warmed with fire for a short time, and hold it for a quantity of an hour's time; and let the sick person endure its burning, and its cauterization, for he finds the burning like fire, until the burning subsides.
Then raise your hand with the instrument and wash away the hot water from the entire ash with fresh water; then leave it for three days.
And place butter on it, until the blackness of the burning is removed; and leave it for a few days, and pus will flow from it. For it is the final help.
Then treat it with ointments until it is healed.
If the pain extends to the hip or leg, make a poultice on it, containing water, in the same way as you did for the ash.
And this is the method of hot water; and I have already written it in the treatise on the rectification of medicines. Take alkali and quicklime, each one part: grind both, and place them in a new pot, whose lower part has a single small hole, according to the quantity that the radius will enter: and place another glass pot beneath the bottom of the pot: and pour over the alkali and lime clear water, so that both are submerged by a finger's breadth; then press them with your hand by pressing well; and leave the pot until the sharp water descends into the lower part of the glass pot.
Then collect all that water and pour it over more lime; and strain it until it is renewed.
For it will then be very strong and sharp, which is administered in many medical operations, and in the cauterization of other limbs. Because it produces the operation of fire itself.
And from medicines are those with which the ankhs are cauterized, also like tesisie, and honey of the anacardi, and lime with soap, so that both are mixed together.
And Galen himself, recounting, reported the cure of a certain man from the ancients, by which the pain of the ankh and sciatic vein was cured: and he magnified that it was very great. And he said, because he did not need any other cure, and because he was healed in one instance, until he reported, that perhaps he had entered a bath carried, and exited from it already healthy.
And it is to be taken from green seitaragi: and if green is not found, take dry, fresh: and it is to be ground a lot with some fat, and placed upon the ankh, where the pain is, or the leg, or in the thigh: and it is to be bound, and left for a quantity of three hours, or for the quantity that the infirm person feels a calming of the burning. Then put him into the bath.
When therefore his body is made moist, put him into a chair. For the pain recedes, and he is healed.
And know that it is not necessary for someone to use a cautery with these remedies unless after evacuation of the body.
And Dioscorides, who also said that goat dung, when cauterized with it the sciatic vein, helps it: and the cautery is done in this way. Let wool be taken and soaked in old oil, and placed on the deep place, which is between the big toe and the sole, and is closer to the sole.
Then take dry goat dung, and burn it in fire until it becomes charcoal.
Then place it on the wool, and let it be until it is extinguished. Then repeat it. Therefore do not cease to do that, until feeling comes to the middle, down to the ankle, and the pain rests.
And this method of cautery is called the Vaccinum cautery.
Concerning the cauterization of back pain.
Sometimes pain in the back occurs from many causes, either from an accident, or a blow, or an evacuation of superfluities, and similar things, from the infusion of cold and damp material: and indeed the cautery does not apply, except in this sole case, which is done from the infusion of cold material.
Therefore, after the patient's evacuation with foul pills, and similar things, let three lines be made on the back, where the pain is, according to the width of the afflicted area itself, after marking with ink five cauteries on each line, or more according to the amount tolerated by the patient's strength: and let the cauterization be performed with a pointed cautery.
And if you wish, cauterize with three or four cauteries, with a middle-clawed cautery, according to this form.
Concerning the method of cauterization in the beginning stages of a humpback.
This illness often happens to young infants.
And the sign of its beginning in children is: that a constriction occurs in their breathing upon elevation and movement; and you find at the lower part of the dorsal spine and its joints, that it has already begun to protrude above the other vertebrae.
Therefore, when you see it, and wish to treat it, then cauterize it with a cautery that is circular in this shape.
And let the cautery cover the entire area of the vertebra equally; and if you wish to cauterize the circumference of the vertebra with a pointed cautery, make two or three lines of points, and let the points be close together.
Then treat the location until it is healed with what we have said.
And beware, that you do not apply the cautery to the hump, which is formed by the spasm of the nerve.
Concerning the method of cauterization in gout and joint pains.
When the pains of the joints are from cold humors, which are poured forth to any member of the body, then when the pains occur in the feet, it is customary for physicians to name it gout properly.
Therefore, when gout of a cold cause is treated with methods of cure, and the pains are not removed, then the cautery removes them.
And it is that you cauterize it after evacuation, around the joint of the feet, with many cauteries: and let the cautery be olive-shaped.
And if you need to puncture on the surface of the foot, then do it with a pointed cautery. If the pains ascend to the knees, or other joints, and that often happens, then cauterize it above each knee with three or four cauteries on all sides, with this same claw-shaped cautery.
If, however, more cauteries with this cautery are needed, then cauterize it. And do not immerse your hand with the cautery, but rather let it be about the thickness of the skin only.
If, however, the pains ascend to the knees and back, then administer what we have said concerning the cautery in its chapter.
If the pains are only in the hands, then puncture in a circular pattern around the foci, as if two lines revolved.
If, however, pain remains in the fingers, then puncture them, above every knot, and above the palm of the hand.
If, however, the pains ascend after days to the elbows, or to the shoulders, then cauterize both from every side.
And do not evacuate the sick person from a good regimen, from the reception of medicines. For if a good regimen is made, and phlegm is evacuated, it will be healed with the help of God by this cautery.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in Ruptures.
When a rupture occurs in the groin, and the intestine, or the scrotum, descends to the testicle, and that it is beginning to approach it: then it is necessary that you order the sick person to cease eating on his/her day. And that he/she uses from the lenients, so that excrement descends from his/her belly.
Then let him sit between your hands on his back, and order him to hold his breath until it emerges, or the scrotum, or intestine appears.
Then reduce it with your fingers, and mark with ink under the rupture over the pubic bone, with a mark whose extremity is similar to half a circle towards the upper part of the body.
Then cauterize with a cautery, whose form this is, until it becomes white and throws off sparks. Then reduce the intestine, or scrotum, to its concavity. Then let the attendant place his hand on the place so that the intestine does not come out: and you have now opened between the legs of the sick person, and placed a cushion beneath him, and another servant on his legs, and another on his chest who holds his hands.
Then place the cautery on that mark, your hand holding the cautery straight. And hold it until you meet with it the mouth; or again with it another time, if you have not met with it at the mouth the first time.
And prudently observe the exit of the intestine during your cauterization, lest you burn it, and death or great harm befall the sick person through it.
And know that when you do not meet with the cautery the mouth, your operation is of no benefit.
And the cautery for children should be fine, according to their measure.
Then treat with the remaining ointments, until it is healed.
And let the sick person lie on their back for forty days, until the wound is sealed.
And it is necessary that you put nourishment for the duration of his healing, which will ease his stomach, so that his intestines do not exit with straining and evacuation.
Then, when he wants to rise after forty days, then administer a properly made bandage, and let him keep it for another forty days.
And lessen his labor, and the fullness of food and drink, and loud voices.
For when he uses this regimen, he is thus healed with complete healing.
And I will speak of the treatment of Ruptures with incision in his chapter.
When, however, Ruptures occur in the rest of the belly, and are incipient, and there is a will that they not increase, then cauterize the Rupture with a round cautery according to its quantity; and let that which is seared from then on be like a third of it. Then treat him with what we have said, and it will not increase.
And some early ones have already said that the Rupture should be cauterized with a triangular cautery, according to this shape.
After it is marked with ink, and a line is placed which is through the width in the upper side of the Rupture, and another line to the lower one. And place your hand in the middle with the cautery tongs.
But the first cautery is easier and better.
Concerning the method of cauterization in pains due to a fall or a blow.
Chapter XLVIII.
When in certain limbs pain arises from a fall or blow, and that pain persists for a long time, and treatment with medicines does not help, then it is necessary to cauterize with a pointed cautery.
And let the cautery of every limb be a cautery according to its size, and its smallness, and its weakness, and its strength, and the location of the twisting, and the pain from it.
If therefore it is healed by the first cautery, it is well. If not, then repeat the cautery upon it.
Because it is customary for these pains to shift from one limb to the one next to it. Therefore, it is necessary to pursue them with cautery until the infirmity is healed.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in Leprosy.
Leprosy patients are sometimes greatly helped by cauterization. And especially the type of leprosy that arises from the putrefaction of phlegm and melancholy: therefore, when you wish to cauterize it, consider that.
If therefore the leprosy is stubborn, and you have treated it with what we have said in the division, and it does not descend, nor does it stand; and you fear for the sick person that corruption will encompass his entire constitution: then cauterize him on his head with five cauteries: one in the middle of the head known, and a second below it toward the forehead at the end of the hair, and two upon the two horns, and one behind upon the nape of the neck.
And hold your hand with the cautery for a little while, until it makes a small impression on the orifice, and the cortices are loosened from it: so that the expiration of gross vapors from it may be relieved, and cauterize with the cautery also upon the spleen itself, according to what has gone before.
But if the leprosy is already spread over the sick person, and appears manifestly: then it is necessary that you cauterize with those cauteries which we have said for the head, and with a cautery on the tip of the nose, and with two cauteries on the two jaws, and with two cauteries on the vertebrae of the neck, and with six on the vertebrae of the back, and with one large one on the haunches near the tail and one above it, on the very buttock; and with two on the thighs: namely, one on each thigh, and with two on the knees: one on each knee, and with two on the shoulders, and with two on the elbows, and with two on the soft parts of his chest: and cauterize him on every joint, from the joints of his fingers of his hands and feet: and cauterize on every heel of his feet, and the knuckles of his hands.
And beware of the nerves that are on the back of the heel, so that you do not burn them.
And sometimes a cautery is applied to the sternum, and another to the stomach, and another to the liver.
And know that the more you add cautery, the more help and benefit there is.
And know that the sick person does not find pain in the cautery, as healthy people do, because his body is already numb.
And there should be cauteries of large and small size, according to the limbs and joints, as has been previously described in the types of instruments.
Then treat the cautery with herb flour and honey, and with other remedies until healed.
Concerning the method of cauterization in a state of numbness.
When any limb is numb and is treated with medicines, oils, and plasters, and is not healed, then cauterize that numb limb with cauteries, according to the size of the limb, whether large or small.
And let your cautery penetrate the skin a little. Then treat it with ointment until it is healed.
And sometimes it is cauterized for some numbness that occurs in the hand and foot, in the vertebrae of the back at the exit of the nerves that move that limb: and the numbness is removed.
But let no one presume upon it unless he is wise in the anatomy of the limbs and the exit of the nerves that move the body.
Chapter LI.
When Albaras is old and nothing from the arts of medicine is of use in it, then cauterize over it itself with a deep cautery for a short while, according to the thickness of the skin, until the whiteness is removed and its color is changed.
Then treat it with flour of herbs, and lentils with rose oil, and leaves of arnoglossa, and dove's blood, and swallow's blood; of each, take one part; mix these things together, and apply them to a cloth, and let them adhere to the place until it is healed.
Concerning the manner of cauterizing in Cancer.
When the Cancer is beginning, and you wish to stop it, then cauterize it with a circular cautery around it, just as it revolves.
Wise men, however, said that it should be cauterized with the final cautery in the middle.
However, it does not seem right to me, because I fear that it will ulcerate: and I have already seen that happen several times.
And it is better that it be cauterized around it with a circle, as we said, or with many cauteries.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in Adubelati.
When someone has Adubelati, and it is delayed in maturation, either because of excess causing it, or because of the patient's age, when they are feeble with little blood, or because of the time, and the need to hasten the maturation of Adubelati, then cauterize around it with many small cauteries by puncturing. Then leave it. For it will hasten with maturation.
If however you wish to perforate it with a cautery, then heat the cautery, whose form is this.
And place it in the middle of the Adubelati, until it penetrates the skin: and let the cautery be from the one following the sick person, so that the course of pus may be alleviated.
Then treat it until it is healed.
Concerning the method of cauterization in a corroding evil.
Chapter LIII.
A corroding thing is nothing other than corruption walking in a limb, and it corrodes it; just as fire consumes dry wood.
If therefore you see a corroding thing in a place that can tolerate a cautery with fire, then apply many cauteries of fire, small and large iron cauteries, according to what is suitable to the place where the corroding thing is.
Then cauterize it from every side until you eradicate the entire corruption, and nothing of it remains at all.
Then leave it for three days, and put on the cauterized places powdered sulfur with oil, until all the eschars and all corruption are eradicated.
Then treat it with ointments that generate flesh.
If therefore you see that after three days healthy flesh is born, in which there is no corruption, it is good.
And if not, then repeat the cautery on whatever remains of the corrupted places.
And it is sometimes cured by corroding medicine. For it itself arises in the place of the cautery.
However, cautery with fire is of quicker benefit; and indeed I have already said that cauterization with sharp medicine is in division; therefore, take it there when you need it.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in corns and warts.
Chapter LV.
This ailment frequently occurs in the lower parts of the feet: and it is a thick, filtered thing that hurts the foot.
And cautery in them is indeed according to two methods: cautery with fire, and cautery with hot water.
As for cautery with fire, you should heat a concave cautery similar to a vulture's wing, made of iron, according to the size that encompasses the corn on all sides, and have thin edges.
Then place it, heated, upon the corn. Then rotate the hand with the cautery around the corn, until the cautery reaches the depth of the corn, and leave it for three days, until it begins to discharge pus. Then apply a plaster to it with crushed wild herbs and salt, and leave the plaster on it overnight. For it will be eradicated from its roots.
Then treat the area with a generative flesh ointment, until it is healed.
If they are not transformed, and often occur on the surface of the body, especially on the hands and feet, then apply a cautery to them with hot water.  And it is that you should take a cannula of bronze, or iron, or of a vulture's feather, and place it on the corn, or the callus. Then pour a small amount of hot water into the cannula.  Hold your hand and rotate it with a gentle pressure, so that the edge of the cannula presses on the root of the corn and the hot water finds its way deep to the root of the corn.  Let the patient wait a little while on the soaking of hot water for an hour.
Then leave him, for the corn is eradicated with its roots.
Do this with each of them, one after the other, until you have dealt with all those that are on the body.
Then treat them after they are eradicated with that which generates flesh from ointments.
Concerning the method of cauterization in Tremor.
When tremor occurs in someone due to cold in a nerve, or from a quartan fever, or from another cause: then it is necessary to cauterize it with four or five cauteries on the vertebrae of the back, and between each vertebra with a cautery, and on its chest with a cautery, and on its stomach with a cautery.
For tremor rests with the cautery of olive oil, and the health of the cold ailment hastens.
Concerning the method of cauterizing Albathir.
Chapter LVII.
Sometimes foul Albathir, that is, pustules, are expelled in the body, which are formed from corrupted gross matter.
Therefore, when they appear, it is necessary first to cauterize every head of the pustule with a fine cautery made of myrtle wood, whose tip has been ignited with fire. Or with the root of long aristolochia. Or with a lenticular cautery.
And sometimes they are cauterized at the beginning of their expulsion in this manner, and they do not increase, and the superfluity which makes them is broken, and they are healed from them.
However, it is necessary that this be done after evacuation with phlebotomy.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in a blood flow from an artery in a wound.
Many times a blood flow occurs from an artery which is cut in a wound that happens externally, or at the incision of an abscess, or a cauterization of a limb, and things similar to them; and it becomes difficult to cut it off.
Therefore, when this happens to someone, then quickly apply your index finger to the opening of the artery; and press it firmly, until the blood is blocked under your finger, and nothing more emerges from it.
Then place small, olive-shaped cauteries, and many large ones, in the fire; and blow upon them, until they become very hot.
Then take one of them, either small or large, according to the wound and the place where the artery has been severed, and place the cautery upon the vein, after you quickly remove your finger; and hold the cautery until the blood is cut off.
If it is expelled when you lift your finger from the opening of the artery, and extinguish the cautery, then quickly take another cautery from the cauteries prepared in the fire.
Therefore do not cease to do this one after the other, until the blood is cut off.
And beware, lest you burn the nerve which is there, and some other harm befall the sick person.
And know that when blood flows from the artery, then it is not possible to cut it off: especially when the artery is large, unless by one of the four methods. Or with a cautery, as we have said. Or with extraction, when it is not extracted. For when it is extracted, its extremities contract, and the blood is cut off. Or it is tied with a strong ligature. Or medicines of a property to cut off the blood are placed upon it, and it is bound with a suitable constriction with a cushion.
However, whoever administers its excision with a ligature and constriction with a cloth, or by applying burning things and similar items, does not benefit it completely, unless rarely.
If, however, this happens to someone, and a physician or medicine is not present for him, then he should begin with the application of the index finger upon the opening of the vein itself, as we have described, and with its strong constriction, until the blood is obstructed from the upper part of the wound, and above the artery. And the finger is not to be removed, over it continually with very cold cold water, until the blood is congealed and thickened, and severed.
And meanwhile, let him consider what it needs from a cautery or medicine.
Concerning incision, perforation, and phlebotomy in wounds, and similar matters.
We have already said in the first chapter about all illnesses in which it is fitting to use cautery with fire and burning medicine, and its occasions, its causes, and its instruments, and the forms of cauteries.
And I placed there chapters from the head down to the foot.
And I will proceed in this chapter along the same path, so that the seeker may have his question alleviated.
And before I begin that, it is necessary for you, children, to know that in this chapter is the terror of that which is in the first chapter concerning cauterization.
And because of that, it is necessary that there be greater caution in it, since in the operation that is in this chapter, frequently evacuation occurs with blood, with which life stands at the opening of a vein, or incision upon an abscess, or opening of an exit, or treatment of a wound, or extraction of an arrow, or incision upon a stone, and similar things: from all of which is associated trembling and fear, and death occurs in many of them.
And I warn you, lest that which causes hesitation fall upon you, for sometimes the ways of men with the ways of infirmities come upon you in this art. For among them is he who is angry with his illness, and death is light to him, because of the intensity of that which he finds from his illness and the length of its malice. And with illness is the fear that signifies death.
And among them is he who gives his money, and enriches you with it, hoping for health, and his illness is harmful.
Therefore, you should not agree with him who comes to you from among them, whose manner is such. And let your caution be greater than your greed and your rapacity. And do not presume upon anything from it, unless after certain knowledge, which verifies for you that to which a praiseworthy succession has arrived.
And use in the treatment of all your sick, prognostication and indication of that to which health is fittingly to be given.
For in that is help for you in the acquisition of fame and glory, and of memory and praise.
May God inspire you, O children, with His understanding, and may He not take away from you direction and inspiration; for it is in His hand.
And I have indeed arranged this chapter by distinguishing it into chapters, according to what preceded in the chapter on the cautery, from the neck to the feet: so that your seeking of what you desire from it, and what you need, may be eased.
Concerning the treatment of water that gathers in the heads of children.
Chapter 1.
Know that this illness often occurs to children at birth, or when the midwife tightens the child's head without ease.
And sometimes it happens also from a hidden cause that is not known.
And indeed I have not seen this illness in others than children, and death has hastened to every one whom I have seen of them: therefore it seemed to me to omit the treatment for it.
And indeed I saw one child of them, whose head was filled with water, and the head grew in every day, until he could not sit upon himself, because of the size of his head: and the moisture increased, until he died.
And this moisture, indeed, either gathers between the skin and the bone, or gathers under the bone above the sinus.
And the treatment in him, if the moisture is between the skin and the bone, and the abscess is small, then it is necessary that you make a single fissure in the middle of the head, in width: and let the length of the fissure be like two knots, until the moisture runs out.
And this is the form of the lancet.
If therefore the moisture is more increased, and the abscess is larger, then place those two fissures, according to this form.
And if the moisture is under the bone, and the sign of it is that you see the sutures of the head open on every side, and water is depressed when you press it with your hand towards the interior, and it is not hidden from you, then it is necessary that you make three fissures in the middle of the head, according to this manner.
And after the incision, extract all the moisture. Then bind the fissures with cloths and lint. Then apply a liniment of wine and oil to it until the fifth day.
Then loosen the bandage, and treat the wound with tents and ointments.
And do not allow the head to be bound equally. And feed the sick person with all dry food with little moisture, until the limb is strengthened and healed.
And another method of incision is to consider where the size of the abscess and the collection of water appear.
Because sometimes there is more in the occiput, or in the forehead, or in the right, or in the left.
Therefore, ascend with the incision where the abscess and collection of water appear to you: and cut it according to what is possible for you.
And observe, lest you cut an artery, and a flow of blood occur, and the sick person die from that flow with the evacuation of moisture.
Concerning the incision of Arteries which are behind the ears.
Chapter II.
When catarrhs occur to someone in the eyes, or in the chest, and it is prolonged, and treatment with medicines does not help, then the ultimate treatment in that case is the incision of these two arteries.
Therefore, when you wish to cut them, it is necessary that the sick person shave their head. Then rub the place with a rough cloth, so that the arteries appear. Then let the sick person tie their neck with any cloth they have. Then consider where the vein beats. And the places of both are the places that are depressed behind the ears: and it is rarely hidden, except in some men.
Then mark with ink on both sides: and cut both with a scalpel carefully on both sides, the incision reaching the bone: and let it be across the width of the head.
And if you wish, insert the scalpel under the artery, and cut it upward with the incision.
And let the length of the incision be like two fingers joined together.
For when a vein is cut, blood flows out with a pulsating exit, which leaps inward with frequent leaps.
If however the artery does not appear to the senses, then it is necessary to measure from the ear a space of three fingers' breadth. Then mark with ink, and cut until the bone.
And that which it is necessary to emit of blood, is VI ounces, and perhaps you emit from it more, or less. All of that according to the quantity which appears to you from the weakness of the infirm person and the fullness of his artery.
Then consider the wound. Then if anything remains on the bone from the sifac, then cut it, so that a hot abscess does not occur; then bind the wound with linen strips.
Then treat it with ointment, until it is healed.
Concerning the extraction of arteries which are in the temples.
Chapter III.
When a man suffers from chronic hemicrania, or acute catarrhs due to acrid humours, and heat in the temporal muscles, or chronic, severe pain, and similar ailments: and is treated with the methods of medical treatment, and it does not help: then we are experienced in these illnesses in the extraction of the arteries from the temples, or their cauterization, as we have narrated.
And the method of the operation in extracting them is that the weak person should shave the hairs that are in the temples, and aim at the artery appearing in the temple. For it indeed shows itself to you by its pulse, and is rarely hidden except in a few people, or by extreme cold.
If it is hidden from you, then let the weak person bind his head with any cloth of his: then rub the place with a rough cloth. Or warm the place with hot water, until it appears to you by clear manifestation. Then take the spatula, which I have made a little while ago. Then scrape the skin with it with ease, until you reach the artery. Then insert a hook into it, and pull it upwards, until you pull it out of the skin, and cause it to escape from the layers beneath it on every side.
If however the artery is slender: then wrap it with the end of the hook. Then cut a part from it according to the amount by which its ends will be elongated and contracted, and so that no flow of blood occurs. For if it is not cut, and if it is not severed, the blood does not ascend completely.
Then evacuate six ounces of blood, up to three.
If the artery is large, then it is necessary to tie it in two places with a strong double thread, of silk, or of al-hohod cords, so that putrefaction does not quickly occur in it before the wound heals, and a flow of blood happens.
Then cut away the excess that is between the two ligatures. Do it at that hour, or after another hour.
And if you wish, cauterize it with a cautery up to the bone, with a knife cautery, until its ends are cut, and it will stand in place of the same work.
And it is a better work, unless the sick person has a fever, or is of a hot complexion. Because cautery is from among those things that help to end humidities. Therefore, it is a better aid.
And after the extraction of the arteries, the place should be filled with old cotton; and cushions made neatly should be placed upon it.
And after the removal, treat it with dry medicines that cause flesh to grow, and with bandages, until it is healed.
If, meanwhile, during the operation, a flow of blood occurs from an artery, then quickly cut it with a cautery, or fill the place with zegi, and bind your hand tightly until the blood is cut off. If none of those are present for you, then place your finger over the place until the blood congeals. And embrocate the place with water of intense cold, until the sharpness subsides, and it is bound as necessary.
And since that which is lighter and easier to remove from an artery is a vein, cauterize the vein with this cautery having two blades; and the sharpness of the two blades should be similar to an almond. However, they are of much less sharpness than two blades. For if they are sharp, like two blades, the cold rushes to both of them; and they do not cut the flesh with speed. Therefore, since there is some thickness in them, the heat of the fire is held within them, and the flesh is cut quickly; with this, therefore, the work is better than any other work, and lighter, and easier.
And this is the form of the cautery.
And let the space between the two blades be the thickness of a finger, after you mark two places with ink; and place both of them intensely hot, until they reach the bone, and cut the vein in two places, so that the distance between its ends may be lengthened. For they do not completely consolidate with this cautery.
Chapter Four.
Concerning the treatment of persistent, acute tear flow from the eyes.
When the tears are persistent, and their flow is from the veins situated on the exterior of the cranium: and no medicinal treatment with remedies helps them, and you see the patient's face already reddened, and he feels a crawling sensation on his forehead, like the crawling of ants: and his eyes are weakened, moist, so that the hairs are already corroded with the corrosion: and his eyelids are heated by the intensity of the tears: then the ancients used this operation in their treatment, and they named that treatment with the Sword.
And it is that you should instruct the patient to shave the hairs that are on his forehead. Then make three equally spaced incisions along the length of the forehead: and let the length of each incision be about two fingers, and let one incision be equidistant to the length of the nose in the middle of the forehead, and the second slightly offset from the movement of the temples, and the third on the other side: and be careful not to cut the arteries that are on both sides: and keep your hand away from the line of the two lower jaws, and let the space of each incision be the size of three joined fingers: and have a piece of sponge prepared, or many dried cloths, with which you dry the blood.
Then insert a spatula with two sharp ends, whose following is the form. From the incision on the temple side, up to the second incision: and scrape with it all the skin, which is between the two incisions, with the sifac, which is above the bone. Then do that also from the middle incision to the second incision. Then withdraw this spatula, and insert into the first incision again another instrument, called a sharp scalpel, one side smooth, the other side not sharp. And this is its form.
And place its sharp side towards the flesh attached with the skin, and its smooth side towards the bone: and drive it, until it reaches the middle fissure: and sever with it all the vessels that descend from the head to the eyes: except what continues the incision up to that which appears of the skin.
Then do that in the middle fissure up to the other fissure.
And after an equal quantity of blood runs out, express the places from the clots of coagulated blood.
Then place in every fissure a linen cloth from old cotton, and place over them cushions soaked in wine, or oil, or vinegar. And see that a hot abscess does not occur.
And on the third day, loosen the bandage, and administer a plentiful infusion with lukewarm water. Then treat it with basilicon ointment, and the other things with which wounds are treated, until it is healed.
Chapter V.
Concerning the treatment of acute tears and catarrhs in the eyes from interior parts of the head.
When acute, severe, persistent catarrhs befall someone, and you see their eyes weakened, small, and their gaze already impaired; and the eyelids ulcerated, and hairs fall from them, and there is a sharp, damaging pain deep within the head, and a subsequent sneezing; then, from these occurrences, understand that these matters, and catarrhs, do not arise unless from many veins.
And the better treatment for them is this. And it is that you should order the sick person to shave their forehead. Then, make one incision in the middle of the forehead, or another slightly wider, and begin the incision from the left temple to the right temple; and let the incision reach the bone; and move your hand away from the temporal muscles, which move during chewing, until the bone is exposed; and you will dry the entire blood with a sponge.
Then separate the two lips of the incision with old cloth, or with linen strips. Then bind them from above with pledgets: and soak the pledgets with wine and oil, so that a hot abscess does not occur.
And when you loosen it, and see that the hot abscess is already lessening, then you should rub the bone until flesh begins to grow on it.
Then treat it with a drying regimen that promotes the growth of flesh; for example, if you take two parts of wheat flour and four parts of resin, and prepare a plaster from them, and administer it for the growth of flesh in these wounds.
Chapter VI.
Concerning the treatment of that which falls into the ear.
Everything that falls into the ear is one of four kinds: either a mineral stone, or something similar to a stone, such as iron and glass; or it is from a plant, such as chickpeas and beans; or it is a liquid substance, such as water, vinegar, and similar things; or some animal.
Therefore, when a stone, or a kind of stone from those that do not adhere nor grow in the ear, falls into the ear, expose the ear to the sun.  If you then see the stone, instill into the ear some oil of violets or sesame. Then administer its extraction, and cause sneezing with condiments, and plug the nostrils at the advent of sneezing, after you have placed in a circle around the ear fragments of cloth or wool, and you extend the ear upward.
For it often emerges with this treatment.
If, however, it does not emerge, then administer its extraction with gestures, that is, with fine tweezers: whose shape is this.
If it therefore emerges with the tweezers, it is good.
And if not, then administer its extraction with a fine, single-pronged hook.
If it still does not emerge by that, then make a tube of bronze, and insert the end of the tube into the ear hole deeply, and seal what is around the tube with softened wax mixed with oil, so that there is no way for air except through the tube; then extract with your suction device with strong pulling.
For many times it emerges with what we have described. If, however, it does not emerge in this way, then take a small amount of helkalimbat, or of viscus, that is, prepared glue, with which birds are caught, and place it at the tip of the rod after you have carefully wrapped a cloth around it; then insert it into the ear hole easily, after you have dried the ear from moisture.
If, therefore, it does not emerge with all that we have described, then hasten to incision, before a hot abscess or spasm occurs.
And the method of the incision is, that the phlebotomist first make a weak incision in the cephalic vein, and extract from it blood according to the measure of his strength. Then make the sick person sit between your hands, and turn his ear upwards, and make a small incision at the base of the ear near his fat in the depressed area there; and let the incision be shaped like a crescent, until you reach the stone; then remove it with what instruments you can.
Then close the incision quickly with your suture, and care for it until it is healed.
If the thing falling into the ear is one of the grains that grow and swell, then administer its extraction.
If, however, it does not yield to you for exit, then take a thin, slender spatula, of this form.
And administer with it the excision of that kind of grain which falls into the ear, and do not do it when you think that the grain is already moistened by the ear's vapor, until you place many small pieces of it; then extract them with hooks, or with a thin probe, or with suction, as we said, for its extraction is thereby eased.
However, in the water that enters the ear, it is necessary for the afflicted person to use a sneeze, first of all; and already he has filled his ear with some old cotton; and he is lying on that ear, in which the water is. If, therefore, it exits through that, it is good.
And if not, then take many stones, according to the length of a finger, thin, smooth, and heat them with fire for a short time, and let the afflicted person insert one of them into the opening of his ear; and let him jump on his foot on that side, and strike with another stone the stone that is in the ear. Therefore, he should not cease to do that with stone and stone, until all the water emerges.
And now the water emerges in such a way that you take one from papyrus or from rushes, and insert one end of it into the ear; and set fire to the other end with fire, until most of it is burned. Then again use another rush, and do that many times, until all the water emerges; and extract it with a cannula according to what was previously stated about the stone.
In the extraction of an animal entering it, if it is of small body, like a flea, and similar to it, treat it as I said in the division.
But if it is of large body, which appears to the senses, then administer its extraction with forceps and hooks; and its removal is easier than all those that are held in the ear.
In the extraction of a worm generated in the ear, when you treat it with what we have said in the division and in the treatise on distillations, and your treatment does not help: then you ought to look at the ear in the sun. If therefore anything of the worms appears there, then extract it with forceps, or with fine hooks.
If however nothing appears there, then take a cannula, of which this is the form, narrow below, wide above; and introduce the thin end into the ear according to the amount that the infirm person tolerates; then suck with it a strong suction. Do this many times, until all the worms come out.
If, however, they do not yield to you for exit, then smear the circumference of the cannula with wax, as I said in the stone.
If they do not come out with what we have said, then administer the distillations which the ancients have already tested for the destruction of worms; and you will find it in the treatise on distillations.
And let your pouring of oils and medicines into the ear be with this instrument, whose form is depicted here. As you see, make it from silver, or bronze, narrowed at the bottom, having a small hole, wide at the top.
Let the part that pushes, which is in the concavity of the cannula, be made of bronze, properly made. And if you wish, take a rod, and wrap lint around its end with a suitable wrap; then pour oil, or juice, or whatever medicine you wish from among these into the cannula; and let it be in the ear; then insert the rod with the lint on top, and press it with your hand with moderate pressure, until the oil is propelled into the concavity of the ear, and the sick person feels it inside; and that which is poured into the ear should already have been warmed a little with fire; and beware that the thing that is distilled into it be not very cold, for medicines do not tolerate that.
Chapter VII.
Concerning the treatment of an accidental obstruction of the ear.
Sometimes infants emerge from their mothers' wombs unperforated.
And it also happens to some people that the ear passage is obstructed by a wound or flesh grown there.
And this obstruction sometimes occurs deep within the ear cavity, where vision does not reach; and sometimes it happens near the exterior of the cavity, and vision follows it.
Therefore, that which happens deep within the ear, and which the gaze does not encompass, is in many cases difficult to heal.
And in that which is visible, you should place the patient's ear in the sun, and look at it.  Then if you see the obstruction, open it with a slender probe, whose shape is as follows: its end should have a small width, one part being pointed; and the remainder of the probe should have two smooth sides, so that it does not injure the ear.
If therefore the obstruction is from flesh grown in the ear canal, then hold it with a fine hook and cut it out with gentle force, until all the flesh is removed.
If the obstruction is deep within the ear, then take a thin, smooth rod and warm it slightly with fire; then insert it into the ear canal.
If, therefore, you feel an obstruction with which the patient experiences a dullness of hearing, attempt its opening with care; and be cautious not to injure the ear's nerves.
Then apply a compress to the ear, corresponding to the size of the wound, wrapped in Egyptian ointment.  Do this for several days, until you are certain of the wound's healing.
Or take a compress and soak it in rosewater, and sprinkle powdered zegi on it, and use it.
If you see the ear already suppurating, then you should remove the compress and apply another one, wrapped in a cloth made with rose oil, until the hot abscess subsides; then treat it until it is healed.
If, however, bleeding occurs, then immerse a sponge or cloths in cold water and apply it to the ear.  And use the remaining treatment, which stops bleeding as described in the treatise on distillations.
Concerning the treatment of ulcers of the eyelids.
Chapter VIII.
These ulcers that occur on the eyelids are sometimes moist and sometimes dry.
Therefore, you should hold them with forceps or a hook, and cut them with a scalpel from their roots. Then place pounded zegi on the affected areas.
If blood flows from them, then cauterize them with a fine, lens-shaped cautery.
And to cauterize them is better after the incision. For they often return when something remains from their roots. And when they are cauterized with fire, those roots are burned, and they do not return.
On the treatment of Granularities of the eyelids of the eye.
Chapter IX.
Many times something happens in the eyelids which is similar to Granulation in its strength and hardness, and on account of that is called Granulation: and it is an aggregation of thick moisture in the upper eyelid and the lower eyelid.
Therefore, the operation on them is, that you should then consider, if it is Granulation proceeding in that which appears of the eyelid, and moves to every part, and its matter is easy.
Therefore, make a fissure over it by its width. Then scrape it from every part with ease, until it comes out. Then suspend it with a hook, and cut it off.
If, however, its excision is not prepared for you, unless after you penetrate the eyelid with a small incision, then that harms the sick person in some way.
If the fissure is large, then gather it together with sutures, and treat it until it is healed.
And if it is small, no harm will come to you from it. For ointment restores it and heals it.
And if the swelling is sloping inward toward the inner surface of the ear, then invert the eyelid, and suspend the swelling with a hook; besides which, you need an incision, and press it from every side.
If the eyelid is lengthened by incision, that will not harm it in any way.
Then wash the eye after the swelling's incision with salt water, and treat the area with what heals, until the sick person is healed.
Concerning the treatment of the swollen eyelids.
Chapter X.
Axirnath is a fat that is generated in the tissues of the upper eyelid; it most often occurs in children, and it weighs down their eyes, and they have cataracts in the mornings, and cannot look at the sunlight, because tears rush to them, and because of that you see them lying on their faces constantly, and they sleep on them, and their eyelids beneath their eyebrows are moist, which swelling has already covered; and the prominence of the Axirnath is visible to the eye, and when you press the area with your fingers, you feel the Axirnath between them.
And the method of its operation is that the sick person should place his head in your bosom.
Then take a linen cloth, and prepare on it strips, and make a circle from that strip according to the quantity that Axirnath contains on all sides. Then place it upon it, and press with your fingers on all sides, so that the Axirnath is gathered in the middle of the circle.
Then make a small incision into the middle of that moisture with a lancet, along its breadth, and let the incision not be larger than that which is made in phlebotomy in the depth.
Or it is necessary to pierce the whole skin until you reach the Axirnath, for in many arrangements the Axirnath proceeds from the incision according to the form of a piece of white fat.
Therefore extract it with the cloth, which you have placed between your fingers toward the outside; and you will turn your hand to the right and left, until it is dispersed; and beware, lest you put in the incision, so that you do not reach the eye with the lancet, and injure it.
However, if Axirnath does not appear to you at the beginning of the incision, you shall add a little to the incision with ease, until Axirnath proceeds. Then extract it, as we have said.
Then immerse the cloths in vinegar and water, and place them over the area, and bind it with bandages.
And of men there are those who grind salt, and place it in the concavity of the incision, so that it liquefies that which remains of that moisture.
Then treat it until it is healed.
If however there occurs in the place a hot abscess, then treat it with sedative plasters, until it is healed.
Concerning the methods for Ataxmir of the eye, that is, when the eyelid of the eye is softened, whence it happens that it is wrinkled as it should not be.
Chapter XI.
When superfluous hairs sprout in the eyelids, beyond the natural hairs, and grow old: then they harm the eye, and cause various illnesses, such as constant tears, and softening of the eyelids, and white discoloration, until it becomes a cause of the eye's destruction.
And indeed, Ataxmir of the eye is cured according to four methods. Or by cauterization with fire. Or with a sharp medicine, according to what has been previously stated in the chapter on cauterization. Or Ataxmir is cured by incision and suture. Or by tubes, according to what I will say.
It is necessary that you place the head of the sick person in your bosom. Then turn the eyelid of the eye with your left hand.
If therefore it is turned, it is good. And if not: insert a needle into it, in which there is thread from the lower part of the eyelid, and cause the needle with the thread to penetrate from above, and let it be near the hairs themselves, that is, near the edge of the eyelid, where the hairs sprout: and pull the thread upwards with the eyelid, and turn it with the radius.
Then find in the inner part of the eyelid beneath the added hairs with a spatula moving from the larger tear duct to the smaller tear duct.
Then pull out the thread, and place a small cushion of cotton, or cloth, beneath the eyelid; then mark upon the eyelid with ink, which shall be like the figure of a myrtle leaf.
However, it is necessary that the figure be made according to the size and elevation of the eyelid, since it is already diversified in humans.
For among them is one who needs a large amount to be cut from the eyelid, according to the amount that softens from the eyelid.
Then, with a spatula, find above the two lines you have marked, and begin from the larger tear duct to the smaller tear duct, and let the incision be near the natural hairs, as thick as a ray.
Then introduce the hook into one of the two angles of the skin. Then scrape off the entire thing. Then bring together the two lips with a needle and thin wool thread, and wipe away the blood, and make that which is left over from the threads adhere to the two eyebrows with certain inconspicuous things, if you wish to do it: and if not, do not bother.
Then leave the sutures and threads until three or four days, afterward care for it.
And if you wish, leave the wound without sutures, and care for it with that which dries and constricts. For the eyelid is lifted during the sealing of the wound and its bringing together: but it will be better.
This method of treatment the ancients taught.
However, there is care for the sick person in it, and it is from good operation, and there is no fear in it.
And another method is in Ataxmir also: and it is, that you mark on the eyelid a figure, which is like the figure of a myrtle leaf, as we have related.
Then lift the eyelid with three separate hooks, or joined together, according to this following form, then cut what is superfluous with small scissors, according to this form, with equal incision.
If however it is not possible for you to hold the hook, and it is not made equal: then take a needle in which there is a thread, and insert it in the middle of the figure; and insert another thread near the larger tear duct, and a second thread near the smaller tear duct; and join the threads between your fingers with equality.
Then raise your hand with equal elevation; and raise the skin on which the mark is made, as we have related.
Then join the two lips of the wound with sutures: and care for it until it is healed.
If however an abscess occurs at your incision, or your fissure: soothe that abscess with a cauterizing agent, and similar things, from soothing ointments.
And sometimes it happens to the eyelids also, that its hairs are turned.
Therefore, you ought to use what we said about the incision: but the suture is more artificial for both. Concerning the treatment of Ataxmir with canes.
And it is, that you turn the eyelid, and cut the fissure which is within, according to what I have narrated. Then, skillfully make two canes, or two thin pieces of wood, whose length should be according to the length of the eyelid, and their width be less than the width of a spatula; and you have already incised at the extremities of each on both sides where you hold the threads.
Then carefully apply each to the excess of the eyelid, and tightly bind the two canes on both sides with a strong ligature, and leave it for several days. For the tightened skin will die, and turn black, and putrefy, until it falls off by itself.
If it is delayed, then cut it with scissors. Then treat it until it heals.
When it is consolidated, the eyelid is lifted; and the hairs do not prick.
And this is the form of two canes, which you shall make according to this figure, and quantity in length and breadth.
Chapter XII.
Concerning the lifting of pricking hairs in the eye with a needle.
The operation in it is that you shall take a slender needle, and introduce into it a slender, smooth thread of silk. Then gather its ends, and make a very fine knot on each side: and let the length of the threads be one palm.
Then place under it, in a short while, another slender thread in the Alinxotati, and knot its ends if you wish.
Then let the sick person place his head in your bosom, and be close to the sun so that the operation is revealed; because it is a subtle or minute operation.
Then introduce the needle with the alinxotati into the root of the eyelid, and make it penetrate the eyelid quickly, until you draw it out above the natural hair.
Then pull the hair up to the alinxotati: and introduce that hair into the alinxotati: if it is one, or two, or three, not more.
Then pull your hand with it, until the hair emerges with the alinxotati into the eyelid with the natural hair.
However, if the alinxotati is pulled and the hair does not emerge with it: pull the alinxotati downwards, with the thread that you have placed on it, until the alinxotati emerges from the upper opening, and you see it with the vision of the eye: then pull the alinxotati, and the thread; and remove both, and close the eye; and leave it closed for two days, or three, until the hair adheres to its place, and flesh grows over it.
If the hair is short, then either associate a long hair from the natural hairs with it, and it is lifted with it; or leave it, until it elongates after a time, and then lift it.
Chapter XIII.
When this Alxatrati happens to the eye, it is called Leporina.
And this Alxatrati is either natural or accidental.
Accidental, therefore, it arises from the consolidation of a wound, or incision, or cautery, and things similar to them.
And the method of operation in it is that you should find that consolidation, and separate its edges, and place in what is between them a linen cloth, and tie it, until it is healed.
And it is not necessary that you use in its treatment things which dry and constrict: for if you do that, the Alxatrati returns worse than it was: indeed, use in it things which soften, such as fenugreek; and embrocate with water in which marshmallow, linseed has been cooked; and with the ointment dyaquilon, which has been liquefied with some of the oils; and wrap with it a linen cloth, and treat with it.
And the treasure of your treatment is that you should strive with all ingenuity, so that it is not consolidated according to the form it first had.
And this operation which we have described is only a certain rectification of the Alxatrati, so that the shape of the place does not return to what it entirely was.
Concerning the treatment of Alxatrati which occurs in the lower eyelid, and is a wrinkling or contraction upwards to the right and left.
Chapter XIV.
This Alxatrati which occurs below, is the one truly called Alxatrati. And it is natural, and it is accidental.
And the accidental one arises from a wound, or a fissure, or a cautery, and things similar to those.
And the method of treatment in it is that you should take a needle, on which a double thread is fastened, and dip it into the flesh, and make it penetrate from the left tear duct to the right tear duct, until the thread reaches the flesh at both ends.
Then, stretch the flesh upward with the needle, and cut it with a broad spatula. If, therefore, the shape of the eyelid returns as it should, it is good.
And if not, take a probe, and place it in the fissure, and with it turn the eyelid: and make two fissures in the inner side of the eyelid, and let the ends of the two fissures be from the two angles of the incision, until they meet and form an angle from them: until, when they are brought together, their shape becomes this shape, and it is the Greek letter lambda.
Then remove that flesh by the amount that is its sharp lower side, from that which follows the eyelid. Then bring together the separated parts; sew it with a wool thread.
Then treat them with what we have said, about softening medicines, and compresses, until they are healed.
And if a laceration occurs from the fissure, and suture, or cautery: then it is necessary that you make a flat fissure under the hairs of the eyelids, even as before. Then separate between the two lips with a compress, as we said.
And the summary of treatment for Alxatrat, when it is above or below, is that the operation should proceed according to the form of the Alxatrat preparation.
For it has many diversities in form, and a prudent artisan prepares an ingenious method in any way possible to it, until it restores the figure to its natural form, or nearly so, and the weakened one itself, according to what is suitable for it from the operation and instruments in various arrangements.
Chapter 15.
Concerning the adhesion of the eyelid to the conjunctiva or cornea.
Sometimes this consolidation occurs in many people, so that the upper eyelid consolidates with the white of the eye and prevents it from its natural operations.
Therefore, you must introduce the tip of a probe under the eyelid, and lift it upwards, or extend it with a hook; then cut the adhesion with a fine spatula, which should not be sharp, but slightly blunt, so that the patient is not disturbed during the operation, and the spatula is removed, and injures the eye with its sharpness; and your incision should be like scraping that adhesion away easily, until the eyelid returns to its natural form, and the entire adhesion is healed.
Then pour salt water into the eye, washing it with the water; or distil it onto it from a sieve made from dissolved ziniar with water.
Then separate the eyelid and the eye with flax thread; and place wool soaked with egg white over the eye; and after three days use a sieve, and with consolidants, until it is healed.
Concerning the incision of the nail and the eminence of the tear ducts.
Chapter XVI.
Know that the nail is according to two modes. Or it is nervous: and it is similar to hard, fine sinew. Or it is not nervous, similar to frozen white moisture: which when it touches iron, or you try to grasp it with a hook, is cut off, and the hook does not fasten to it.
And both species do not begin, unless from the larger tear duct, until it gradually extends, until it covers the sight, and obstructs the light, and the movement of the eye.
And the method of operation in its incision is: that the sick person should place his head in your lap. Then open his eyes, and raise the eyelid with your hand. Then collect the nail with a hook of a few folds, and extend it upwards. Then take a needle, and insert into it a hair from a horse's hair, or an ox's, or a cow's: and let the thread be strong, and double the end of the needle a little, and fix it in the middle of the nail: and pierce it with the needle, and tie the nail with the thread, and extend it upwards: and scrape with the hair the side of the nail which follows the pupil, as if you were sawing it with the hair to its last part.
Then cut the remainder at the root of the tear duct with a thin spatula, or with small scissors: and leave the natural tear duct tissue, so that a continuous flow of tears does not occur from its incision.
And sometimes the nail is extended with a hook alone, or with a thread, as we said. Then scrape with a gentle spatula, whose form is this.
And be careful that the spatula does not touch the corneal membrane, and a rupture occurs in it, and the pupil is pierced.
Then, after the incision, put some ground salt into the eye, or a paste made from ziniar, and leave it until the next day. Then care for it with what is necessary until it is healed.
If the nail is not nervous, and you cannot insert a needle into it, nor is a hook fixed in it, then this type of nail is treated many times with medicines, and is healed as I have described in the division.
If you wish to cut it, then open the patient's eye and take a fine, gentle, weakly pointed spatula, according to this form. And scrape the nail from above with delicacy. If you see that it becomes thin and breaks, and the scraping marks it, then distil from your hour glass into the eye a solution made from ziniar, or from red sief, or from crushed salt: and bandage the eye until another day.
Then repeat the operation on it, until the entire thing is removed. Unless there is a hot abscess in the eye; then leave it, and treat the abscess until it heals.
Then repeat the operation on it with scraping, until it heals.
However, if the fleshy prominence of the tear duct causes a great injury to the eye, it should be suspended with a hook, and a portion of it cut away; and do not make the incision too deep, so as not to harm the tear ducts.
Then instill into the tear duct a red, or prepared, ziniari, until it heals.
Concerning the incision of Alguardenic, and the flesh growing in the eye.
Chapter XVII.
Sometimes in some people's eyes, red flesh grows, either composed or superimposed, until it covers the pupil, or approaches it, or presses on the eyelids, and perhaps turns the eyelids outward: and it resembles a rose-hip.
And the operation in it also is, that the sick person should place their head in your lap. Then open his eyes, and gather all that flesh with suitable hooks: and hold it with a single forceps, or tongs.
Then cut the flesh in the first place, until its whole is finished with a scalpel. And beware of the eye, so that you do not injure it during the operation: and let your incision, by which you cut it, be either with a lancet, as we described in the incision of the hoof; or with small scissors, with which the asabel is gathered, according to its form after this chapter.
When therefore your incision is completed, and the entire alguardenici is removed, then fill the eye with crushed salt; or distill into it red powder, and similar corrosive medicines; and place over the eye externally a cloth with egg white: so that it is protected from a hot abscess.
If anything of the alguardenici remains, and hot blood dominates you, and you fear a hot abscess: then leave the eye, and treat it with that which calms the abscess.
Then repeat the operation on it, until it is healed.
And similarly do with the added flesh which occurs in the eye of this kind.
However, it is necessary that you avoid the treatment of every weak eye by natural or accidental means, operating with iron; and do not put your hand in any of these operations, until you see that the member is tolerant of that operation.
Concerning the collection of Sebel from the eye.
Chapter XVIII.
Sebel are red veins that are woven over the eye, and they impede the eye's operation of vision; and they weaken the eye with the length of days.
Therefore, it is necessary for you first to consider if the eye in which the Sebel is present is strong, and there is no other illness in it besides the Sebel; then collect its Sebel.
And it is so that you should instruct the sick person to place his head in your bosom.
Then suspend those veins with one hook, or two according to your prudence; and let the hook be a thin double hook, according to this form, or let there be two hooks graded on one body, according to this form.
Then collect those veins with fine scissors with precision, and wipe away the blood hour after hour, until you see those veins removed from the eye and dissolved; and beware of injuring the eye with the extremities of the forceps.
And let your operation be in the midday before the sun, and be very firm in your operation, so that you do not injure anything other than those veins.
And when you have finished, then instill into the eye a green or red sieve, so that its sharpness corrodes what remains of the scab.
However, if it is not possible for you to collect it all in that hour, then plaster the eye with that which soothes the pain of the eye, and leave it for a few days until its pain subsides and it is safe from a hot abscess; then again over it according to the same method until it is healed.
And this is the form of the forceps.
Concerning the repositioning of the fractured nose.
Chapter XIX.
Physicians call the fistula Arissati, which you treat with a cautery, or with a burning sharp medicine, according to what its description preceded.
And if it does not heal, then there is no skill in it; unless you split open the abscess at its origin, and extract all the moisture and pus within it, until the bone is exposed.
When therefore the bone is exposed, and you see corruption or blackness in it, then scrape it with an instrument, whose shape is this.
And it is called the Asperi head.
Let it be made of tempered iron, and let its head be round like a *azir*, which should be pointed by filing or by a fine *aliskilferi* point, and place it upon the corrupted place of the bone.
Then revolve it between your fingers, and you press your hand for a short while, until you know that the corruption has been scraped away; and do this several times.
Then restore the place with drying, astringent medicines.
Therefore, if the place consolidates, and flesh grows in it, and the flow of pus ceases; and it remains for forty days, and is not renewed, and does not become an abscess, and no mishap occurs in it; then you shall know that it is now healed.
And if not, then there is no remedy for it, except to reduce the fistula to the nostril opening, according to this form.
And it is, that you uncover the bone from the second with iron, or with a sharp medicine; and when the bone is uncovered, then take a drill according to this form, let its iron tip be triangular; and let its wood be a tapered pyramid down to the tip, as you see.
Then place it upon the bone itself; and let it be close to the tear duct; and move your hand a little away from the eye. Then revolve your hand with the drill until it penetrates the bone, and the infirm person feels it; by this, that he finds wind issuing from it when he holds his hand over his nose.
Therefore then restore the place with astringent drying medicines, as I taught you.
When therefore flesh is born, and the place hardens, then the matter that was flowing outwards returns to the nose; therefore it is lighter for the infirm person.
Concerning the reduction of the prominence of the Eye.
Chapter XX.
When the eye protrudes in its entirety, and no harm or diminution occurs in vision, then you should release the patient; then bleed him; afterward, apply cupping to the neck without scarification, but with suction.
Then apply to the eye a liniment made of acacia, aloe, olibanum, and sarcocolla. Then bind the eye from above with a plaster with many bandages.
And the method of the bandages is: that you take many soft cloths, and double each cloth over four; make many of them; then place them one over another, according to the amount the eye needs; then bind over them with a hard cloth with a strong binding.
And repeat the cupping with suction without scarification.
Then remove the cupping, and leave the eye bandaged day and night.
If however the bandage softens again, then it is necessary that it be bound tightly; then remove the bandage after a day and night, as we said.
If therefore you see the eye has now returned the uvea tunic, it is good; and if not, then repeat the plaster, and bandages, and binding, and cupping, until it is healed.
Concerning the incision of the uvea tunic.
Chapter XXI.
When a rupture occurs in the uvea tunic, then it protrudes and proceeds outside the eyelids like a uvea grain, and disfigures the appearance of the person because of it, and one wishes to cut it: then the operation in it is as I describe: and it is to insert a needle into the root of the uvea from the lower to the upper part.
Then insert another needle, on which a double thread is, from the tear duct side, and cause it to penetrate; and leave the first needle according to its position.
Then cut the place of the double thread, and tie with it the part of the uvea in the circumference of the needle; and tighten it a lot.
Then withdraw the needle, and place on the eye wool soaked in the white of an egg; and leave it until the thread falls with the uvea.
Then treat the eye with that which strengthens it, until the wound is healed.
And sometimes the uvea is tightened from every side with a circle of cloth, until the eye adds great prominence.
Then it is pierced with a thin spatula, which reaches the depth of the eye, and the white moisture runs out, and the eye descends, and immediately enters; then tighten it until it is healed.
Concerning the treatment of Alcomnat.
Chapter XXII.
This illness, called Alcomnati, is nothing but pus that collects in the eye, similar to descending water, and is not the eye itself.
And the method of operating on it is to make the infirm person sit on a prepared seat, or upright.
Then take its head in your hands at two sides, and move it, until you see the pus reach the lower parts of the eyes. Then let it be fixed, and not descend, and the light be released: and let the infirm person see things as they were seeing: and if it does not descend lower, know that it is water.
If, however, the descent of the pus is not prepared with what we have said, then make the infirm person sit between your hands. Then take a thin spatula, and cut with it on top of the horny membrane a little at the junction of the conjunctiva with the cornea, at the crown, until pus comes out.
When it comes out, then instill into the eye warm water in which you have mixed honey; or water in which you have already boiled fenugreek and honey; then treat with the rest of the treatment, until it is healed.
Of the treatment of water that descends into the eye, or cataract.
Chapter XXIII.
We have already discussed the types of water in division, and which is suitable for perforation, the speech stating and explaining it; then take that same one according to health.
Then it is necessary that you make the sick person sit between your hands, square, opposite the light, near the sun; and bind his healthy eye, and tie it tightly; then, with your right hand, if the eye in which there is water is the left eye; or with your left hand, if the eye is the right. press the eyelid of his eye.
Then take with your right hand an almagda, if the eye is the left; or with your left hand, if the eye is the right.
Then place the extremity of the almagda near the crown, by the thickness of a ray, on the apparent white of the eye, of the smaller tear duct; then push the almagda with force; and you revolve your hand with it, until it penetrates the white of the eye; and you feel that the almagda has already reached the empty thing.
And it is necessary that the measure of the almagda's journey to the depth be the measure of the space that is from the pupil to the end of the blackness; and it is the crown of the eye. For you will see them in the pupil itself of the eye's vision, because of the clarity of the cornea.
Then place the almagda up to the place where the water is. Then press it below, one time after another.
If therefore the water descends immediately, then the sick person sees that upon which he opens his sight immediately, and the almagda in his eye.
Then rest a little. If therefore the water descends, then put it down a second time, apart from which the almagda emerges.
When therefore it is fixed, and does not ascend: then extract the almagda with ease: and you turn your hand gradually.
Then dissolve some of clear gem-salt in water, and wash the inside of the eye with it. Then place a whole piece of lint, or wool soaked in rose oil and egg white, outside the eye, and bind the healthy eye with it.
We, and those who are of our time, place crushed cumin with egg white on it.
If the almagda does not obey you in entering the eye because of its hardness, since it is from humans whose eye is very hard, then it is necessary to take a spatula, which is called Alberid, of which this is the form.
Therefore, scrape with it only the conjunctiva itself, and do not put your hand into the opening; and there is nothing other than to make a subtle path to the almagda's place.
Then introduce the almagda, according to what we said.
And at the completion of your work, prepare for the sick person a properly made sleeping place, in which he sleeps on his back in a dark house; and forbid him all movements and coughing; and place his food that which soothes his nature; and let him not move his head to the right, nor to the left at all.
And let the bandage be according to its arrangement until the third day.
Then loosen it in that dark house, and test his vision; and make him see things. Then reapply the bandage until the seventh day.
And it is not fitting that he do it at the time of the treatment, or immediately after the incision; rather, it is fitting that he postpone it; because water ascends quickly due to a forceful look.
However, if a hot abscess occurs, then it is necessary that you loosen the eye before the seventh day; and treat it with that which soothes the abscess, until it is soothed; then, free its vision, and place over his face an oral [something] by which his vision is governed under those days, while he is in that dark house.
Then let him emerge from the house gradually, and let him mingle in his own houses.
And know that in zaltea a student is not excused from vision on any occasion; then, let him dare on the operation.
And indeed, there has come to us someone from those who are of Alayrach, who said that a perforated magdan was made in Alayrach, from which water is drawn.
However, I have not seen anyone in your land who has done that; nor have I read it in any of the books of the ancients; and it is possible that it is new.
And these are the forms of species from the magdan, so that he who is ignorant of them may stand upon it.
Let them be made properly of bronze; and let their extremities be triangular with this same subtlety, and their extremity pointed.
Chapter Twenty-Four.
Concerning the care of flesh born in the nose.
Sometimes diverse growths of flesh are born in the nose, among which is something resembling a scorpion with many feet; and from it is cancerous, stony flesh, of a dark color; and from it is flesh that is soft, not of a dark color.
Therefore, in the soft flesh from among these growths, which is not deceitful, nor cancerous, you should have the patient sit between your hands facing the ground, and open his nostrils; then introduce a hook into the flesh; next, draw it outward, and cut off what you have grasped with a fine, sharp spatule, on one side, until you know that the entire growth has been removed.
If anything remains of it that cannot be removed, then scrape it with one of the fine instruments with ease, until nothing of it remains. However, if blood dominates you, or a hot abscess occurs; then apply to it what is appropriate; or if it is from malignant abscesses, then hasten to cauterize it, until the blood is removed and all the flesh is taken away.
Then, after the incision, vinegar, and water, or wine, should be applied to the nose. If however, the nose opens, and moisture flows from it to the palate, then know that it is now healthy.
If, however, the moisture does not penetrate as it should, then know that within it is flesh grown on the upper nasal bones, to which the instrument did not reach with the incision.
Then it is necessary to insert a linen thread of some thickness, and tie many knots in it; and place between each knot a quantity of a finger, or less; and let the sick man, with a rod, or with whatever is possible for him after having made it similar to a saw, place one end of the thread into his nose; and pull out his offensive matter, until it reaches the bottom, and emerges above his throat.
And many times indeed, children in schools do a thing similar to this; and it is an easy thing for him who wishes to do so.
Then place the two ends of the thread, one end that emerges above the nose, and the other that remains in the nose. Then remove the flesh shavings with the knots that are on the thread. Do that until you know that the flesh is now with the knots of the thread.
Then pull out the thread, and place in the nose, after washing away the blood, a cloth soaked in Egyptian ointment: do this for three days, or longer, until the ointment corrodes all that remains of the flesh.
Then place at the end of the thing in the nose a lead cannula, for some days, until it heals.
If however it needs a treatment that will dry it out, use that.
For making nasal douches, with which oils and other medicines are instilled into the nose, make it of silver, or bronze; that it be similar to a small lamp, open like a seashell; and its passage be likewise.
And if you wish to make a closed cannula, like a tube.
And the seashell instrument for nasal douching should be full, uncovered; on whose back end there should be a handle, with which you hold it, when heating oil, or whatever you wish of juices, and runny substances, in it.
Chapter XXV.
Often a wart is born at the tip of the nose, and it grows larger and larger with the days, until its appearance becomes unsightly.
And therefore it is necessary, that one cut it off at the beginning of its appearance, and remove the entire thing. Then place on the area either a cautery or a burning medicine in its place.
If, therefore, its excision is delayed until it grows, then consider, if it is stony, hard, of dark color, and with little sensitivity: then do not touch it with iron, for it is a cancerous abscess.
For often I have seen that when someone incised such an abscess, great harm resulted for the one who had it.
And if the abscess is soft to the touch, not dark in color, and you see that incision is possible throughout its extent, then evacuate the pus and cut it without fear, without hesitation: and treat the area with something that dries and contracts it, until it is healed.
Chapter XXVI.
Concerning the suturing of the nose, lip, and ear.
Know that when a separation of continuity occurs in one of these cartilages, little benefit results from any operation, unless in certain individuals.
Therefore, when something of that sort happens to someone, you should consider if it is a fresh wound with its own blood: and then bring together the edges of the wound with sutures; then treat it until it heals.
And if the lips of the separation of continuity are already separated, and each part is sound: then you ought to scrape away all the part from its apparent skin until it bleeds. Then bring together the two lips with sutures, and bind them tightly, and powder over it the blood of the dragon, and powdered frankincense: and place upon the powders a piece of a diafinicon plaster, and some other of the consolidating plasters; and leave it bound for two days, or three. Then loosen it, and change the medicine; and leave it until the threads are severed by themselves. Then treat it with ointment until it heals.
The method of suturing is, that you bring together the separation of continuity, either with needles, as we have narrated in the suturing of the belly; or bring the separation together with thread, as I have made you know.
Chapter XXVII.
Concerning the extraction of lip nodules.
Many people frequently have hard abscesses like grains of grass in the interior of their lips: and some of them are smaller, and some larger.
Therefore, it is necessary to turn back the lip and cut over every nodule on it, and to suspend it with a hook and cut it from every side.
Then fill the place after the incision with pounded zegi until the blood ceases.
Then wash it with vinegar and treat the place, where there is astringency, with it until the wounds are healed.
Chapter XXVIII.
Concerning the incision of fleshy tissue grown over the gum.
Often flesh grows over the gum, which the ancients call abuluss.
Therefore, it is necessary to suspend it with a hook; or to hold it with forceps, and to cut it at its root, and to allow the pus, or blood, to run.
Then apply to the place ground zegi, or other astringent, drying powders.
If that flesh returns after treatment, for it often does, then cut it a second time, and cauterize it; for it does not return after the cautery.
Chapter XXIX.
Concerning the extraction of teeth with an iron.
Sometimes rough, foul, and sometimes blackened, or yellowish, or greenish, hard masses gather on the surfaces of the teeth from the inner and outer sides, and between the gums, until corruption from them reaches the gums, and the teeth become unsightly because of it.
Therefore, you should have the sick person sit between your hands, with their head in your lap, and scrape the molar and tooth, where the hard masses, like sand, appear, until nothing remains of them, and similarly deal with the blackness, greenness, and yellowness, and other such things, until they are cleansed.
If therefore that which is in them is removed at the beginning of the scraping, it is good; and if not, then repeat the scraping on them another day, a second time, and a third time, until finally you attain the desired result.
And know that a tooth requires scrapers of various shapes and forms, according to what the preparation of your operation requires; therefore, the scraper with which the tooth is scraped from the lower part is different from the scraper used for scraping between the teeth, according to different shapes.
And these shapes of scrapers should be prepared by you, which you see.
Chapter XXX.
Concerning the extraction of toothache.
You should treat the tooth from its pain with all your skill, and be slow in its eradication. For there is nothing to replace it when it is pulled out, since it is a superior substance. Until when there is no excuse for its extraction, then it is necessary when the sick person is forced to pull it out, that it be strengthened, and that you, the tooth, aching tooth, be assured.
For often pain deceives the sick person, and he thinks that it is in the tooth itself and pulls it out.  Then the pain does not recede until the sick person's tooth is pulled out.
For we have already seen that from the operation of phlebotomists.
Therefore, when the aching tooth itself is assured, you should make incisions around the tooth with a lancet, in which there is something of virtue, until the gum is loosened on all sides.  Then move it with your fingers, or with delicate forceps, at first gently, until you break it.
Then place large forceps in a good position on it, and hold the patient's head between your knees. What you have now firmly held, so that it does not move. Then pull the tooth straight, so that you do not break it.
If it does not come out, then take one of those instruments, and insert it under it from every side with ease, and try to move it, as you did at first.
If, however, the tooth is perforated or decayed, then you should fill that hole with cloth and bind it with the end of a fine reed, so that it does not break at the time of your constriction upon it with forceps.
And it is necessary to carefully make incisions around the gum on every side very much.
And maintain your strength so that you do not break it, and a part of it remains, and returns to the patient from that evil which is greater pain than his first pain.
And beware that you do not do that which ignorant phlebotomists do in their haste and boldness in their eradication of it, beyond what we have described.
For they often cause great illnesses in men, which are more difficult to break, and the roots of it all, or some of them, remain; or to extract it with some of the jawbones, as we have often witnessed.
Then it should be rinsed after its removal with wine, or with vinegar and salt.
If a flow of blood occurs from the places (for it often does), then take some of the zegi and fill the place with it; and if not, cauterize it if the zegi does not help you.
The shapes of the fine forceps with which the tooth is first moved should have long extremities, a short handle, and be thick, so that they do not double when pressed against the tooth; they should be like the handles of thick things, until, when you tighten them, they do not yield or double: with short extremities, and they should be made of strong iron or good steel, with straight extremities; and on their extremities should be teeth, some of which enter into others, and bind with a proper, strong tightening.
And sometimes the extremities are shaped like the mouth of a bird called a stork, and have a strong grip.
Chapter XXXI.
On the removal of teeth, and the extraction of fractured mandibular bones.
When, during the extraction of a tooth, something is left behind, you should place a poultice of butter on the area for one or two days, until the area softens.  Then, introduce algasti, or forceps, whose extremities are shaped like the beak of a stork. The form of these forceps is...
Let their ends be made like a file inside, or like an aliskilfegi.
If therefore it does not yield to you for extraction with these forceps, then it is necessary that you carefully work around the root, and expose all the flesh, and insert the instrument called a small lever, whose form is this.
Let it have a short, somewhat thick end, and let it not be soaked, so that it does not break.
If therefore the root emerges through it, it is good; and if not, it is necessary to assist with these other instruments whose forms are these.
The form of the first is triangular with a certain thickness at the end.
The form of a triangular, slender end.
And with other instruments and tools that have preceded in the reasoning about teeth.
Also, there is help with this instrument that is like a large hook, of this form, with a twisted triangular end, where there is something of thickness so it does not break, and it is not soaked.
And know that instruments for teeth are many, and similarly the other instruments are not counted, and a skillful craftsman, subtle in his art, finds for himself the instrument according to which the operation and the illnesses themselves signify to him.
Because there are illnesses for which the ancients did not say an instrument, due to the diversity of their species.
If, however, a bone breaks from the jaw, or from other bones of the mouth, or putrefies, then probe over it in its place with what suits it from the instruments and forceps that I mentioned in the extraction of roots, and assist with a pick, whose form is this.
Let there be something of thickness gradually, so that the bone is tightened or held with it, and does not flee and go, until the bone emerges; and restore the place with the appropriate medicines for it.
If however there is a small putrefaction in the bone, then scrape it from its putrefaction, and treat it until it is healed.
Chapter XXXII.
Of the sawing of prominent teeth above others.
When teeth protrude not according to their natural course, an ugly form is produced by it; and especially when this happens in women and girls, namely those of easy virtue.
Therefore it is necessary that you consider. For if a tooth has grown after another tooth and does not have its place, or its sawing or filing is not possible, then extract it; and if it is joined to another tooth, then cut it with this instrument, of which this is the form.
It is similar to a small beak, and is made from hard iron, with a very sharp tip.
And let your incision, by which you cut it, be over many days, and because of the hardness of the tooth, and so that another tooth is not moved.
If however it is prominent, exposed to its filing, then file it with a file of hard iron, whose form is this.
Let the whole be of hard iron, and its handle with very small points, like the file with which needles are made; with which the tooth is filed gradually over many days with ease, so that the tooth is not moved and falls out; then gently smooth it, and at the end shave it with some razors.
If a tooth has a part that has broken off and hurts the tongue, then it is necessary to file it, until the roughness of that fracture is removed and it is made even, and flattened, and does not hurt the tongue, nor spoil speech.
Chapter XXXIII.
Concerning the retention of teeth with gold threads.
When the front teeth are knocked and moved by a blow or fall, and the weak person cannot bite on what they eat so that it does not fall out, and you have treated them with astringent medicines, and the treatment was not successful, then a way exists to bind them with gold thread, because silver becomes green and rots after days, but gold never changes.
And let the thread be medium in thinness and thickness according to the amount that it will take between the teeth.
And the method of retention is to take a thread, and insert double its length between two healthy teeth; then weave the two ends of the thread between the moved teeth, whether one or more, until you reach with the weave to a healthy tooth on the other side. Then repeat the weaving back to the place where you began: and bind your hand with delicacy and skill, until it is completely fixed; and let your binding of the thread be near the roots of the teeth, so it does not come loose.
Then cut off the excess ends of the thread with scissors; and join both together, and twist them with a twist; and hide them between the healthy tooth and the moved tooth, so that it does not injure the tongue; then let it be left thus fastened as it remains.
If however it comes loose, or is cut, bind them with another thread, and it will hold with it thus for the entire time.
And this is the method for teeth, and the manner of retention of two healthy teeth, and two moved teeth, as you see.
And sometimes it happens that a single tooth, or two, return after falling into their places, and are retained as we have described, and remain; and an artful, prudent, and experienced person does not accomplish this.
And sometimes a suitable piece of bone is fitted; and it is made in the shape of a tooth, and placed in the place from which the tooth is strengthened and bound, as we said; and it remains, and serves with it for a long time.
Chapter Thirty-Four.
Sometimes this ligament that occurs under the tongue is either natural, with which a man is born, or accidental, from a wound that has already healed.
And the operation on it is that you open the mouth of the sick person on his head in your lap, and raise his tongue; then cut that nervous ligament along its width, until the tongue is released from its retention.
If there is something of hardness and knotting in it, and it is from the consolidation of a wound: then insert a hook into it, and split it along its width, until you cut the ligament, and the knotting is loosened.
And beware, lest there be a fissure deep in the flesh, and you cut an artery there, and a flow of blood occurs.
Then it should be rinsed at the site of the incision with rose water, or with vinegar, or with cold water.
Then place under the tongue a linen bandage, which the sick person should hold all night: so that it is not consolidated again.
If however a flow of blood occurs, then place pounded zege over the spot. If, however, blood overcomes you, then cauterize the place with a lentiginous cautery, suitable for it; then treat it with the remaining treatment, until it is healed.
Chapter XXXV.
Sometimes a boil occurs under the tongue, resembling a small frog, preventing the tongue from its natural function; and perhaps it grows so large that it fills the mouth.
And the operation in it is to open the mouth of the sick person before the sun, and consider the boil.
If therefore you see it to be of dark color, or black, hard, to which the sick person has no feeling: then do not touch it, for it is cancer.
And if it is inclined towards whiteness, in which there is moisture, then thrust a hook into it, and cut it with a fine scalpel, and free it from every side. If blood overcomes you during your operation, then place on it pounded zegi until the blood ceases; then return to your operation until you extract it with its entirety.
Then wash it with vinegar and salt, and treat it with the remaining appropriate treatment for it, until it heals.
Concerning the treatment of an abscess of the two tonsils.
Chapter XXXVI.
Sometimes there occur between the throat, that is, glands, which are similar to almonds, that occur externally; and are named two tonsils: which when you treat with what we said in the division, and they do not heal, then consider.
If therefore it is a hard abscess, of a dark color, with little feeling, then do not touch it with an iron.
And if it is of a reddish color, and its root is thick, then do not touch it even with an iron, fearing a flow of blood, but rather leave it until it ripens. And then either you will pierce it, or it will break open by itself.
And if it is of a white color, round, and its root is thin, then it is necessary to cut it.
And the operation on it is that you should consider, before its operation, if its abscess has rested and completely calmed down, or is diminishing with some reduction: then, therefore, make the sick person sit in front of the sun, and let his head be in your lap; and open his mouth, and let the servant take in their hands, and press his tongue downwards with an instrument, whose shape is this.
Let it be made of silver, or bronze, which is as thin as a knife.
Therefore, when you press the tongue with it, and the abscess is revealed to you, and your vision falls upon it, then take a hook, and fix it into the tonsil, and pull it outwards as far as you can, besides which, you should pull out with it something from the coverings.
Then cut it with an instrument, whose shape follows this. It resembles scissors; however, its ends should be curved, so that the opening of each is in line with the other's sharp point: therefore, take care that it is made of tempered iron, or soaked in alfuled.
If, however, this instrument is not present, then cut it with a spatula, whose shape is this. One side should be sharp, the other side should not be sharp.
And after you cut one tonsil, cut the other according to this same method of incision.
Then, after the incision, let the sick person gargle with cold water, or with vinegar and water.
If, however, a flow of blood occurs, let him gargle with water in which the peels of pomegranates have been boiled: or with myrtle leaves, and things similar to them that are astringent, until the flow of blood is stopped: then treat him until he is healed.
And sometimes other abscesses arise in the throat, besides the two tonsils. Therefore, cut it according to what I said in the incision of the two tonsils equally.
And I myself have already treated a woman from an abscess that had arisen between her throat, which was drawing towards blackness, with few sensations, which had nearly closed her throat: and the woman was breathing from a narrow passage, and I had already forbidden her food and water: and she had already come to death if she had remained for one or two days.
And the abscess had risen so much that it had sent out two branches, until they had emerged above the two nostrils.
Therefore I quickly hastened and fastened a hook to one of them. Then I pulled it, and a large portion came away from it.
Then I cut it off where I grasped it from the nostril.
Then I did the same to that which emerged from the other nostril.
Then I opened its mouth, and pressed its tongue; and afterwards I fastened a hook into the abscess; then I cut a portion from it, and only a little blood flowed from it; therefore the woman's throat was healed, and she immediately began to drink water, then took food.
Therefore I did not cease to cut from that abscess many times for a long time, and the abscess succeeded in the place where I cut, until it was prolonged too much and with it that.
Therefore I devised and cauterized the abscess between the throat.
Therefore it stood apart; then I walked away from her, and I did not know what God did with her after me.
Concerning the incision of an abscess of the uvula.
Chapter XXXVII.
When the catarrh descends to the uvula, and it becomes an abscess, and it is long, then it is called perpendicular; and if it is in the lower part thick, round, then it is called a grape.
When it is treated with what we have said in the division, and the treatment does not help; and you see that the hot abscess has quieted from it, and it is thin; then it is necessary to incise it.
And whatever is collected from it, round, and has no length, and is blood-red, or dark-brown, or black, and has no feeling: then it is necessary to avoid its incision. For in it is fear upon the infirm.
Therefore, when you see it according to the way I have described, from its whiteness and length, have the infirm sit before the sun; and press his tongue with the instrument, of which the account has preceded; then fasten a hook into the uvula, and pull it downwards; and incise it with one of the two instruments which I have said concerning the incision of the two tonsils.
And it is necessary not to incise from it, except that which is added beyond the natural limit without addition.
For if you incise from it more, you will injure the voice and speech.
Then, after the incision, use that which we have described in the incision of the two tonsils, and care for it until it is healed.
However, if the infirm is frightened by the incision, then it is necessary to use ingenuity in cauterizing it without fear and terror.
And the mode of the cautery on it is not, except with sharp water, and it is, that you place the head of the infirm in your bosom. Then press his tongue with the instrument that we have mentioned. Then take from the water I spoke of to you in the chapter on cauterization, and make with it lime not extinguished, and place it neither thick nor thin, and fill with it the concavity of this instrument, whose form is this.
Let the concavity in which the medicine is placed be like the concavity of a spoon's radius.
And place the instrument with the medicine upon the uvula itself: and let the sick man lie on his side, that the saliva may run from his mouth from the internal medicine, so that nothing may descend from it to his throat, and hurt him.
Then hold your hand with the medicine. And you shall keep it on the uvula for a quantity of half an hour, until you see it already blackened, and the biting of the medicine quieted.
And if you wish to take a clot, and wrap it around the extremity of the radius, and infuse the clot with the medicine, and introduce the radius with the clot into the cannula from above, until the clot adheres to the uvula.
Do this many times, until you achieve what you desire concerning the cauterization of the uvula. Then leave it; for it will dry and fall off after three or four days.
If you need to repeat the medicine, repeat it: and after the cauterization, wipe around the uvula with a clot soaked in butter, and cleanse with it what is around it from the medicine; and rinse with cold water.
And treat it externally with embrocations, and internally with gargles, until it is healed.
This method of treatment is therefore healthier and further from danger than incision.
And sometimes the uvula is also treated with something more delicate than cautery and incision: for it is treated with fumigation, according to this method. Take calamus, hyssop, oregano, rue, sseah, chamomile, and wormwood, and similar herbs to them: and gather them all, or some of them, in a pot, and immerse them in vinegar, and boil them: and let the pot be smeared with clay properly: and let there be a hole in the middle of the pot, over which a concave instrument is to be placed in this manner.
Let it be made of silver or bronze: and let the end, in which there is a pomegranate, be inserted into the sick person's mouth, until the vapor ascends to the uvula over the cannula, until the uvula becomes very dark.
Then repeat over it many times, until it dries.
And beware, do not perform this treatment at the beginning of the abscess's onset. For it usually adds to the abscess: and you should not do it unless at the decline of its hot abscess.
If however this instrument is not present for you, then take a reed and place the rind of an egg at its end, so that the sick person's mouth is not burned; because the egg rind prevents the vapor from burning the mouth: and this is from good treatment with health.
Concerning the extraction of thorns and bones from the throat.
Chapter XXXVIII.
Often a bone, or a fishbone, or something else, adheres in the throat.
Therefore, it is necessary to extract whatever of them is apparent upon which the sight falls, after pressing the tongue with an instrument near the sun, and it is declared to you what is in the throat.
And what does not appear to you and is hidden in the throat, it is necessary to make the vomiting weak before the food is digested in the stomach. For perhaps the attached thing will come out through vomiting.
Or let the weak person swallow a piece of turnip, or a root of lettuce, or swallow a piece of dry bread; or let him take a piece of soft dry sea sponge, and tie it to a thread, then let him swallow it. When therefore it reaches the place where there are spines, or bone, and it is extracted, then it comes out.
If therefore it does not come out with what we have said, then use an instrument of lead according to this form.
Let it be thicker than a Radius a little, and at its extremity let there be a bend, which he should introduce into his throat with ease; and let him have his head elevated upwards.
And let him beware of touching his epiglottis, lest coughing should befall him, and push with it the bone, or spine, or let the physician introduce it with his hand.
But that which the sick person introduces is better, on account of his knowledge of the place of the thing attached; and let him push downwards, or pull his hand with the instrument upwards, the whole of it according to the quantity which is prepared for him, until it comes out.
Concerning the extraction of the Leech.
Chapter XXXIX.
When a leech is medicated with what I have said in the division concerning treatment with medicines, and it does not help, then consider in the throat of the sick person in the presence of the sun, or in the sun, after you have pressed his tongue with the instrument which I have described to you.
If therefore your sight falls upon the leech, extract it with a small hook, or with fine forceps skillfully.
If it is not possible with them, then take a hollow cannula, and introduce it into the throat of the sick person up near the throat; then introduce into the concavity of the cannula a heated iron with fire. Do this many times; and let the sick person abstain from water the whole day.
Then let him take a vessel full of cold water, and open his mouth in it; and let him rinse his mouth with it, and not swallow anything from it; and let him move the water one hour after another with his hand. For the leech immediately, when it feels the water, falls.
If however it does not emerge with what we have described, then fumigate the sick person with fleas, or with asa, with the instrument that I have described in the fumigation of the uvula.
Do that many times, since it will fall itself.
And the method of operation in fumigation is, that you take a pot in which are live coals with fire; and the pot be covered with a cover, in the middle of which be a hole; and the extremity of the instrument be placed in that hole.
Then, direct the fumigation, and let the sick person place his mouth on the extremity of the cannula, and close his mouth, so that the fumigation does not escape, until you know that the fumigation has already reached the leech. For the leech will fall immediately.
If it does not fall, then repeat the fumigation many times.
And let the sick person tolerate thirst, and eat salt and garlic, and not drink water.
Therefore, it is necessary that it depart with this regimen.
And this is the form of the instrument with which the leech is extracted from the throat, when it falls upon it visibly.
It is similar to forceps, as you see: except that it has this curvature that is inserted into the throat. And its tip is like the beak of a bird called a stork, in which there is the roughness of a file: when it grasps something, it does not let it go completely.
Concerning the opening of abscesses, and their incision, and their general care.
Chapter XL.
Abscesses have many species, of many kinds, according to the recollection of them, that is, one, and one in this book: and they are diverse in their perforation and incision by two methods.
One of which is from the species of an abscess in itself, and in that which it comprises from the humors.
And the second method is because of the locations in which it occurs in the body.
Because an abscess occurring in the head is different from an abscess occurring in the anus; and an abscess occurring in a fleshy location is different from an abscess occurring in the joints; and each of them has its own judgment from the operation.
And among abscesses are some that should not be pierced, unless after the maturation of the pus in them, and its completion; and of them are some that should be pierced while they are raw, and do not mature according to completion.
Such as abscesses that are near the joints.
Because an abscess, when it occurs near a joint and prolongs its being until that which is around it decays, perhaps the ligaments or nerves of that joint are corrupted: therefore, it is a closer cause of contraction of that member.
Or it is an abscess near a principal member: because if you delay its incision until it matures, it will harm either that or the principal member through it.
Or it is near the anus, therefore pierce it unripe; and it is not fitting to pierce a raw abscess, not of complete digestion, except that which is near the anus, so that it does not decay deeply, and extend to the interior of the anus, and become a fistula, or become in its end that which does not heal.
It is necessary that you know the hour of piercing the abscess, which has matured according to completion: and it is in the calming of the pain, the recession of the fever, and the diminution of redness, and pulsation, and sharpness of the head of the abscess: and the other signs.
And it is necessary that you make the same incision in the lower place of the abscess, and of greater prominence: and let the incision be proceeding in the length of the body, if the abscesses are in the parts of the hands and feet, and in places of tendons, and cords, and nerves, and arteries, and finally in all equal places where there is no reflection.
In those, however, which are reflected, proceed with the incision according to that member.
When, however, the abscess is in fleshy places: then it is better that you leave its incision, until its digestion is confirmed, as we said according to completion.
Because if you incise it before that, the course of the virus from it is prolonged, and there is much pus and filth, and perhaps its lips are hardened, and its depth.
And some abscesses are incised across the body's breadth when necessary, or according to the member it needs.
And it is necessary that you administer a small incision in small abscesses, and a large incision in large abscesses, or many incisions similar to the size of the abscess.
And there are abscesses in which the skin must be hollowed out, and incised when it has already become like a cloth, and reached its limit, that it is already dead, like that which happens in many boils and buboes.
And of them there are some which are incised with an incision having three angles. And of them there is one which is incised like the shape of a myrtle leaf.
Like the groin abscess.
And of them there are some in which a round incision, and a crescent-shaped incision, and similar incisions are administered.
That which does not have a head, like mild superficial abscesses, should be perforated with a superficial or merely flat perforation.
And when the abscess is large, and has already collected much pus, and you perforate it, you should not be hasty and extract all the pus at that time; rather, extract a part of it. Then, close the abscess until another day. Then extract some more pus again.
Do this repeatedly according to the degree, until it comes out; especially if the sick person is of weak constitution, or a pregnant woman, or a young child, or an old decrepit person: for the animal spirit of the animal is repeatedly resolved with the discharge of the matter, and perhaps the sick person dies, and you do not perceive.
Therefore, beware of this chapter with great caution.
And after your perforation, with which you perforate these abscesses, it is necessary that you cleanse the wound: and consider. If therefore the wound of the abscess is small, or is a flat incision, then apply bandages of linen, or old cloth. And if the abscess is large, and the perforations' fissures are many, then it is necessary that you introduce a bandage into each fissure, until they meet each other.
And if in the abscess you have removed a piece of skin, or hollowed it out in a circle: then it is necessary that you fill it with old cloth, or as when a cloth is woven, or shaved with flax fibers without moisture: and bind it tight for up to three days.
Then remove it, and treat it with what is necessary of ointment, until it is healed.
If however, bleeding occurs during your operation, then apply cold water and vinegar, after which a cloth is soaked in them; and place it repeatedly over the site of the bleeding.
If however the bleeding persists, then it is necessary that you administer the regimen and treatment and powders, which I have described in many places of this book of ours, and in its division.
If however it is in wintertime, and the site of the abscess is near many nerves, then it is necessary that you apply heated pads of wine and oil and place them over the affected areas.
And if it is in summer, and the areas are fleshy, then it is necessary that you place pads soaked in water and oil, or in wine and oil, and all of it cool. Until when it will be the third day, as we have said, then it is necessary that you open the abscess, and cleanse it, and administer in its treatment that which is suitable for it, until it is healed.
This therefore is what is necessary from the knowledge of the treatment of abscesses universally.
Following the path of distinction, however, I have already spoken of every abscess, how there is a way to cure it, itemized and individually.
Chapter XLI.
Concerning the incision of abscesses that occur on the scalp.
Small abscesses occur on the scalp, and they are of the type of bumps, which are contained by the tissues that are like sacks to them; as if they were the sacs of a hen.
And their types are many.
Some of them are oily; and some of them contain moisture like mud; and some of them contain moisture like gruels and porridges; and similar to them, and some of them are hard, stony.
And there is no fear in the incision of all of them, and their extraction, as long as the incision does not encounter an artery.
And the operation in their incision is, that you should test them with an instrument, whose form will come after this, which is called an Intromissum, until you know what they contain.
For if it is that which contains moisture, then cut it with a superficial longitudinal incision, according to this form.
And begin with the incision from line b to line g.  When the moisture is evacuated, then scrape the cyst which contains that moisture, and do not leave anything of it at all.
For it often returns if anything remains of it.
Then immerse the clot in Egyptian ointment, if it is present; and if not, in water and salt; and fill the wound with it, and leave it until the next day. For it will corrode what remained of the cyst.
Then apply the Egyptian ointment again over the clot, a second and third time, and if you need it, until you are confident that nothing remains of the cyst, for then treat the wound with the ointment until it is healed.
If the abscess contains a fatty tumor, then cut it according to this shape, the incision having the form of a cross; and insert hooks between the two sides of the incision, and scrape it from every side; and try your skill in removing the membrane that contains it.
If however the artery resists you, then do what I will tell you later.
And similarly do in the abscess, if it is stony, by the same incision and treatment, according to what we said.
And the incision upon a stony abscess is easier, because there is little blood and moisture. And sometimes there are some of these abscesses which are in the head in some people, in which there is absolutely no moisture.
That is: because I incised an abscess on the head of an old woman, and found the abscess like a solid and hard stone, rough, white, which could not be broken; and if anyone struck it with something in order to throw it, it wounded them.
In other abscesses occurring in the head, however, apart from these abscesses which occur in the heads of children, and near the roots of the ears, the incision of all of them should be a superficial incision.
Or make a perforation of them always from their lower part, so that the course of pus is relieved downwards.
Then treat it with whatever is appropriate for them from the treatment.
Concerning the incision of the Strophulae in the neck.
Chapter XLII.
Often these abscesses occur in the neck, and under the armpits, and in the groins: and sometimes they occur in the rest of the body.
And those that occur in the neck from them, are one, and many: and are generated from each other: and every Strophula from them is inside its own proper tunic, as is in the knots and abscesses of the head, as we have related.
And the types of these Strophulae are many. And from them are stony ones; and from them are those that contain moisture; and from them are malignant ones, which do not obey treatment.
In that, therefore, which of them you see well-disposed to the touch, whose proximity to the skin color is manifest, and it moves to every part, and is not attached to the nerves of the neck, nor to the guidegi, nor to the artery, nor is deep: it is necessary to separate it by a superficial incision from the upper part to the lower part of the body from line, b, to line, g, and to scrape it from every side: and extend the two lips of skin with a hook, or with many hooks, if you need it, as we said in the abscesses of the head, and gradually extract it.
And it is a precaution that no vein or nerve be cut.
And let the scalpel not be very sharp, so that it does not add to your hand with the incision, or trouble the sick person, and cut what is not necessary.
If, however, you cut a vein or artery, or it hinders you from the operation, then put crushed zegi into the wound, or certain powders that cut off blood, and bind the wound, and leave it until the sharpness of the abscess subsides and the wound softens, or it begins and wants to putrefy.
For the blood is cut off then. Return therefore to your operation, until you complete it.
Then investigate with your index finger if anything remains of the other small strophes; therefore cut them and clean them.
If there is a large vein at the root of the strophe, then it is necessary not to cut that strophe from its root; rather, it is necessary to tie it with a strong doubled thread and leave it until it falls off by itself without harm.
Then fill the wound with old cloth, which you have already soaked in Egyptian ointment. Then care for it.
If the entire strophe is cut, then it is necessary to bring together the two edges of the wound, and suture it immediately, after you see that there is no more excess.
If, however, you see that excess remains because of the size of the strophe, then it is necessary to aim to cut its root, and to remove it; and administer the suture that we have described.
And whatever humours the strophes contain, pierce it with a superficial puncture, so that the place of its maturity appears to you; and place the puncture from that which follows below the body, as we said.
Then, after the puncture, apply strips with ointment, and things like them, to corrode what remains of the corruption, until when you see the wound already cleansed; then care for it with a generating flesh ointment, until it is healed.
Chapter XLIII.
Concerning the incision of the epiglottis from an abscess occurring within the throat.
The ancients said that this incision into the epiglottis should be made, and I have not seen anyone in our land who has performed it; and this is the writing of their saying.
However, in those suffering from synocha, the incision of the epiglottis should be avoided; because no benefit is gained by it; for all the veins and lungs are weak.
However, in those who have a hot abscess in the mouth, or throat, or both tonsils, when there is no illness in the passage, it is necessary to use an incision of the epiglottis, to avoid the harm that results from suffocation.
Therefore, when we wish to do this, we must cut the epiglottis beneath three or four circles of the epiglottis, with a small incision across the width, at the point between two circles, so that the incision is on the membrane, not on the cartilage.  This place is indeed suitable for incision, because it is free of flesh and the blood vessels are distant from it.
If the surgeon is timid, then it is necessary to stretch the skin of the throat with a hook. Then he should split the skin until he reaches the passage; he should avoid blood vessels, if he sees any of them.
Then he should cut the membrane that we described; and it is signified by the incision of the passage by the phlegm that emerges from it, together with the rupture and the removal of the voice.
And leave the wound open for a time.
When therefore the hour in which suffocation is feared is removed, bring together the two lips of the wound of the skin, and sew it itself alone without cartilage.
Then administer medicines that cause flesh to grow, until it is healed.
Says Albucasis. The summary of this account we have given is not an exposition unless they see that some of these abscesses have already closed the throat of the sick person: and the sick person is raised above death, and his breathing wants to be cut off: they go to cut the epiglottis, so that the sick person may breathe over the place of the wound with a certain breath, and be saved from death: and for this reason they prescribed to leave the wound open until the malice of the illness is consumed, and its malice is three days, and like itself: then therefore they prescribed to sew up the wound, and care for it, until it is healed.
And that which I saw by myself is that a certain maid took a knife, and thrust it into her throat, and cut a portion of the lung passage with it.
And I was called to treat her, and I found her groaning, like the groan of a dead person.
Therefore I examined the wound, and found little blood that had come out of the wound. Therefore I was confident that she had not cut a vein, nor a ligament; and wind was escaping from the wound.
I therefore hastened, and treated her wound, and cared for it until it was healthy; and nothing happened to the maid, except hoarseness in her voice; and she returned after days to her better condition.
Therefore I say: that there is no fear in the section of the epiglottis.
Concerning the section of the hernia of the throat.
Chapter XLIV.
This abscess, called hernia of the throat, is a large abscess, according to the color of the body; and it is very common in women.
And it is in two ways: either it is natural, or it is accidental.
In the natural one, certainly, there is no talent.
The accidental one, however, is in two ways: one of which is similar to fatty tumors. And the other way is similar to an abscess that arises from the knotting of an artery. And in it there is fear, and it is not appropriate to presume to use iron upon it unless it is small; and you should probe it and investigate it with an instrument. If therefore you find it similar to a fatty tumor, and it is not connected to any blood vessels, then cut it, as tumors are cut; and extract it with whatever it contains from the cyst, if it is in a cyst; and if not, then thoroughly explore its entirety. Then treat the area with whatever is appropriate for healing until it is healed.
Chapter XLV.
Concerning the cutting of various types of tumors.
There are many kinds of tumors, and I have already described all their types in the divisions; and it is necessary for me to describe here the difference between a tumor and a boil, since it is a source of doubt.
Therefore, I say that when a boil is present, there is heat, fever, and intense pain until the ebullition of the excess fluid subsides and the putrefaction is complete; then the fever and heat cease.
However, with a tumor there is no heat, fever, or pain, and it contains a sack-like cyst, which is its own pouch, and is similar in color to the body; and its beginning is like a chickpea and it becomes like a batecha, and larger or smaller.
And they are of two types: either fatty, or containing moisture. And the colors of moisture are many, according to what I said in the division.
Therefore, when you arrive at the treatment of a tumor, you should examine it, and inquire into its form first, with the instrument called the *Intromissum*, in the way its form will be shown in the chapter after this one.
And the method of investigating abscesses and all tumors is that you should take this instrument, and insert it into the moist place you find in the abscess; and you should turn your fingers with it gradually, until you know that the instrument has now penetrated the skin. Then place your hand at the size of the abscess.
Then withdraw the *Intromissum* and consider that which emerges in its wake.
If, therefore, running moisture, of whatever color, emerges, then cut it with a superficial incision, as I have said in the other abscesses.
And if no moisture emerges in the wake of the *Intromissum*, then know that it is fatty; therefore, cut over it with a cross-shaped incision, according to this shape, as I taught you; and suspend it with hooks, and peel the skin from all sides with ease; and if you can, keep a *kistin* over it to extract the healthy one with the tumor.
If, however, the *kistin* breaks during the operation, and it is not possible to extract the healthy one—for this often happens—then extract it piece by piece until nothing remains of it.
For if anything small or large remains of it, the tumor returns most often.
If it defeats you, and a small amount remains, then fill the wound at your completion with certain sharp corrosive powders; and constrict the wound, and place over it what sits on a hot abscess, and treat it with the remaining treatment, until it heals.
If, therefore, the tumor is large, then sew its two lips together, and treat it with what causes healing.
If, however, there is a pulsating or non-pulsating vein there, then hurry, and fill the place with ground zegi, and leave it constricted for two or three days, until the wound becomes putrid, and the boiling of the blood ceases; then return to cutting what remained of the tumor.
Chapter XLVI.
Concerning the instruments for incision and perforation.
Among them are the forms of instruments of insertion, and they are of three kinds.
For among them is a large one, and among them is a medium one, and among them is a small one.
Let them be made of tempered iron, with square ends, suitably, so that they may quickly enter the abscess.
And these are the forms of instruments, and no, that is, piercing instruments: and one of them is called a *beris*, that is, a piercer: and they are of three kinds.
For among them is a large one, and a medium one, and a small one.
They are suitable for investigating abscesses, and exits, and fistulas, and buboes, from that which is between them from the bones.
And others are made round, smooth, and gentle, like large needles with which saddles are sewn, namely of citron, or of bronze, or of iron, or of silver.
And the best of them are those made of citron.
And experiments are also made with black lead, which are suitable for experiencing fistulas, whose concavity has reflections, so that they may be reflected with their gentleness with those reflections.
And they are again of three kinds. Because some of them are long, some of them are medium, and some of them are short, according to the quantity of the fistula's breadth and its constriction.
The shape of hooks, and they are of many kinds.
Because some of them are simple, namely those which have one curvature: and they are of three kinds as you see, Large, Medium, and Small.
And of them are blind hooks: and they are of three kinds.
And of them are hooks having two curvatures, and they are of three kinds: and of them are hooks having three curvatures, and they are of three kinds: and all these are necessary in their place.
And these are the shapes of scalpels, with which nodes and abscesses are cut and scraped: and they are of three kinds: because of them there is a large, medium, and small one.
Their cutting edges are sharp, other edges are not sharp: and they are not placed thus, unless that with them help be given in scraping nodes, for fear of cutting a vein or nerve: and so that the sick person may be healed by them and find a little peace from the burning which he finds in the scraping of an abscess.
They are made of air, and are similar to the radio with which alcohol is made: and at the broad end is hidden the point of a spatula: and on it runs to the interior, and to the exterior when you wish, as you see.
The shapes of spatulas that are hidden between the fingers when puncturing abscesses: and the sick do not perceive them: and they are of three kinds, large, medium, and small.
The forms of cupping glasses with which the flow of blood is cut off: and they are of three kinds, large, medium, and small.
They are made of air, or of amber, round, a little in length, as you see: and be of a fine delicacy.
And it is necessary that these kinds of cupping glasses be large and small with you, so that you may cut off blood with speed in case of need, and then when there is no medicine present for you.
However, do not use them for the cutting of blood in every place of the body, and use them only on fleshy parts: such as the calves of the leg, and the thighs, and the arms, and the breasts, and the abdomen, and the groins, and similar fleshy, moist parts.
And sometimes small instruments like those made of hazelnut shells, in their shape, are made from them; with which blood is cut off when it flows from a place of phlebotomy, or at the incision of a vein or artery; and sometimes they are made round, in this form.
Chapter XLVII.
Of the care of the breasts of men which resemble the breasts of women.
Sometimes the breasts of some men become swollen at the time of their sexual arousal in sleep (that is, when they begin to pollute themselves in sleep) until they resemble the breasts of women: and they remain foul-looking abscesses.
Therefore, whoever abhors that, should cut above the breasts with a crescent-shaped incision, according to this form, from line b to line g. Then scrape off all the fat. Thereafter, fill the wound with a flesh-forming medicine. Then bring together the two edges of the wound with sutures, and care for it until it heals.
However, if the breast inclines downwards and softens due to its size, as happens with women, then it is necessary to cut it open on its upper two sides with two incisions resembling a crescent shape, each of which is held together with the other at the edges of both, until a larger line contains a smaller one, according to this form, from line b to line g. Afterwards, scrape off the skin that is between the two edges, and remove the fat, and apply what we said about sutures and powders, which is necessary for the treatment, until it heals.
However, if you do not complete the incision that you should make, due to the patient's distress, or due to the flow of blood, then you should fill the wound with lint soaked in a corrosive ointment, and leave it until it corrodes what remains of the fat. Then care for it until it heals.
Concerning the perforation of an abscess, which occurs beneath the armpit.
Chapter XLVIII.
These abscesses which occur beneath the armpit, are of the species of hard Strophulae, which contain cysts, and of those that contain moisture.
Therefore, those of them which contain moisture, must be incised with a lunate incision, according to this shape, from line b to line g.  When thus the entire pus from the abscess is evacuated, then fill it with old lint, and leave it until another day.
Then remove the lint, and treat it with a suitable ointment for it, until it is healed.
If the abscess is of the species of knot-like Strophulae, then make an incision over it, as we have said in the section concerning Strophulae, equally.
If however the wound extends in such a way as to emit pus, then apply a cautery to it, according to what we have said in what has gone before.
Chapter XLIX.
Concerning the incision of an abscess that occurs due to artery and vein.
When an artery bursts, and the skin above it consolidates, then an abscess frequently results from this. And similarly, if a vein bursts, an abscess and swelling occur.
And the signs by which one knows that the abscess and swelling are due to an artery and vein are these: because, when the abscess is due to an artery, it is long, clustered in the deep part of the body, and when you press the abscess with your fingers, you feel as if there is a creaking sound.
And that which is due to a vein is round on the surface of the body.
And incision upon this abscess is an error, and especially that which is under the armpits, and in the groin, and neck, and in many places of the body: and it is very large. Therefore, its treatment with iron should be avoided, and that which is also from them in the extremities, or in the head, should be avoided.
Therefore, upon that which is from them due to the inflation of the artery's opening, make an incision into the skin lengthwise. Then, open the incision with hooks, afterward the artery: and free it from its coverings, until it is exposed.
Then insert a needle beneath it, and cause it to penetrate to the other side, and tie the artery with a double thread in two places, according to how I taught you in the extraction of the two arteries that are in the temples.
Then pierce the place, which is between the two ligatures with a lancet, until all the blood within it issues forth, and the abscess is resolved.
Then administer a treatment that produces pus, until the ligatures fall off; afterward, treat it with suitable ointments for it, until it heals.
If there should be an abscess because of the incision of a vein, then it is necessary that you hold with your hand what you can of the abscess with the skin. Then insert a needle beneath the place you held with your hand, and cause it to penetrate; and let a double thread be on it, until you pull it out from the other side. Then tie the abscess itself with a good ligature; according to what I told you in the ligature of the grape, from two sides with two ends of the thread.
If however you fear that the thread will be pulled out, then insert another needle with another thread under the entire abscess at the incision of the needle; press, and tighten your threads in four places.
Then cut the abscess in its middle, until what is within it emerges; then cut away the excess skin, and let that which is tied be from it.
Then place on it a poultice which you have soaked in wine and oil. Then administer treatment, which is done with lint and ointments, until it heals.
Chapter L.
Concerning the abscess that arises from the twisting of nerves.
Just as an abscess occurs in the artery and vein, so too does an abscess occur in the nerves: this occurs in them through blows, or arises from excessive labor, and similar things; and it most often occurs in the aidor regions, or the heel, and in every place where the joints move: and it is a serious abscess.
Its color is similar to the rest of the body, and it is in many dispositions without pain; and when it is squeezed with force, the afflicted person feels a similar sensation to numbness in it.
And it is not a deep-seated, aggregated abscess, but rather is beneath the skin, and it moves in every direction, and does not go forward or backward.
Therefore, those that are in the joints should not be lanced with an iron instrument. For perhaps contraction will result.
In that which is on the head, or forehead, cut the skin with a scalpel. If it is a small abscess, then grasp it with forceps and cut it away from its root.
And if it is large, then suspend it with a hook, and scrape it: then remove it, and stitch the wound, and treat it until it heals.
Chapter LI.
Concerning the incision of an abscess that occurs in the abdomen.
Some people frequently get growths in their bellies and other parts of their bodies, which are called Fungalia, by reason of their resemblance to fungi.
Their root is slender, and their head is thick, and their lips are turned inwards. And some of them are small; and some of them grow very large.
And I myself have seen a man who had two growths in his belly which were more like fungi than other things: there was no difference between them, they were white, with slender roots, and their lips turned inward and split, and moisture flowed from them constantly.
Therefore I cut them, and found one to weigh about ten and eight ounces, and the other about six ounces.  And the procedure for cutting them is, if the patient is moist, and the color of the growth is white, moist, with a slender root, then cut it with a broad scalpel, and have cauteries present in fire.
For often much blood is expelled at its cutting; therefore, hurry if blood overwhelms you, then cauterize it.
If you see the patient fearful and timid of cutting with iron, then take a thread of lead properly made, and bind the tumor with it: by the method we described, and leave it for two days.
Then add to the lead bandage. Therefore do not cease binding the lead, whenever it presses on the tumor, until it is severed, and falls off by itself without effort.
If however the tumor is of large root, then in its incision is something of fear and terror, especially that which is in the belly.
However, it is possible to cut half of it. Then cauterize it, so that it does not return.
Then treat it until the wound is healed.
And beware that you do not presume to cut a tumor that is dark-colored, with little feeling, and of foul appearance: for it is indeed a cancerous abscess; and I shall come with a recollection of Cancer after this.
Chapter LII.
Concerning the treatment of the navel prominence.
The navel prominence arises from many causes. Or from fissures in the skin over the abdomen; and from it protrudes wind, or an intestine, just as happens in other ruptures. Or from blood that flows from a vein or an artery, as previously stated. Or from confined air in it.
If however it is due to a fissure in the skin, and protrusion of a foul thing, then the colour is like the colour of the body, and it is smooth, without pain, and appears in various locations. And if it is due to the exit of an intestine, then its location, with the diversity we have described, is more severe. When therefore you press it with your fingers, it disappears; then it returns, and perhaps with a sound; and it greatly enlarges at the entrance of the bath, and with considerable exertion.
If however it is due to moisture, it is smooth, then it does not disappear when you press it with your hand, nor is it tightened, nor does it increase.
If however it is due to blood, then with these signs the abscess appears with a blackness from the bottom.
If however it is due to generated flesh, then the abscess is severe, large, hard, and fixed in a single quantity.
If however it is due to windiness, then its touch is smooth.
And the operation in that is, that you should consider then, if the prominence of the navel is due to blood of the artery, or vein, or windiness: then it is necessary that you abstain from its treatment. For in that there is fear and dread, as I taught you in the chapter, in which I said abscesses due to artery and vein.
If the navel's prominence is due to the intestine or to a hernia, then it is necessary to instruct the sick person to hold their breath and stand extended. Then mark with ink around the entire navel. Afterwards, instruct him to lie on his back between your hands. Then encircle with a wide spatula around the navel over the place you marked with ink. Afterwards, extend the middle of the abscess upward with a large hook. Then tie it firmly around with thread, or with a silk cord or firm bandage; and let the knot of the bandage be tied tightly.
Then open the middle of the abscess extended above the bandage. If therefore you find it already caught by the bandage, then extract the tightly bound, and insert your index finger into it, and push the intestine towards the interior of the belly; and if you find a hernia, then take it with a hook, and cut off its excess.
If however an artery or vein is contrary to you, then surround it much. Then return to your operation. And take two needles, and insert in them two strong threads; and insert the two needles in the circumference which you have made around the abscess in the form of a cross, which you make penetrate.
Then tighten the abscess in four places over the needles; and if you wish, remove the needles, and leave the place, until the extended flesh rots: and it falls away by itself; or cut it when it is softened and rots.
Then treat it with what is necessary from ointments, until it is healed.
If the eminence of the navel is from flesh there in it, or from moisture, then it is necessary to hollow out the abscess, as we said. And draw out the blood, or moisture, which you find in it.
Then treat it with that which solidifies the place.
Chapter LIII.
Concerning the treatment of CANCER.
We have already spoken in the division of the species of Cancer, and how there is a way to cure it with medicines; and we have warned against using iron in its treatment, so as not to ulcerate it; and we have spoken of Cancer generated in the womb, and the caution in treating it.
And the ancients said that sometimes Cancer is in a place where its eradication is possible, such as Cancer in the breasts or in the thigh, and similar locations on the extremities, by removing the whole of it, especially when it is small and beginning.
However, when it is old and large, you should not approach it.
For I myself could not cure anyone from it, nor did I see anyone before me who achieved it.
And the treatment for it, when it is located as we have said, is to proceed, and to relieve the afflicted from the black cholera on occasion. Then phlebotomize it if you find it with clear fullness.
Then prepare the patient with the preparation, in which it will be placed with the operation.
Then apply hooks suitable for the Cancer. Afterwards, hollow it out from every side with the skin, according to the examination, until nothing remains of its roots: and let the blood flow, and do not sever it quickly, rather press the areas, and wipe away all the thick blood with your hand, or with what is possible there from the instruments.
If however the flow of thick blood from an incision of an artery, or vein, gives you trouble, then cauterize the vein until the blood stops. Then treat it with the rest of the treatment, until it is healed.
Concerning the treatment of dropsy.
Chapter LIII. We have already described in the division of the species of dropsy, and how the gathering of water occurs; and the signs of each species, and its treatment with medicines.
And that which is treated with iron is only the species of ascites alone: and it is not approached with iron for the species of tympanitis: nor for the species of hyposarca completely; for that is mortal.
When you have already treated this species of tympanitic dropsy with medicines, and your treatment has not availed, then consider. For if weakness has already overtaken the patient, or there is another infirmity with him besides the dropsy, such as if there is a cough with him, or looseness of the belly, and things similar to those: then beware lest you treat him with iron, for there is fear of it.
If however you see the patient of exuberant strength, and there is no illness with him besides dropsy alone: and he is not a child, nor an old man: then the method of operation in him is that you raise the patient standing between your hands, and a servant behind him presses his belly with his hand, driving the water to the lower part of the chest.
Then take a pointed spear, according to this form. Let it be of two sharp parts, long, and sharp at the end like a spear. However, let it have something of shortness gradually, so that you do not proceed with it in the operation all the way to the intestines, and harm him.
Then consider. For if there is a generation of dropsy from the intestines, then you must extend the incision from the navel by the quantity of three fingers, downwards in a straight line above the pubic bone.
If, however, the generation of dropsy is due to a disease of the liver, then let your incision be to the left of the navel by three fingers.
And if its generation is due to the spleen, then let the incision be on the right side; and it is also not necessary for the incision to be on the side on which the sick person wishes to lie, so that the fluids do not flow to that weak spot.
Then pierce the entire skin with the instrument. Then insert it into that incision, and raise your hand with the spatula between the skin, and do so as if you were scraping it; and let the quantity that is scraped be the quantity of a fingernail, or approximately that.
Then pierce, doing so until the spatula reaches the empty space, and that is the place of water. Then extract it, and insert into the hole the instrument of which this is the shape. And it is similar to a cannula; it is made of silver, or bronze, or brass, smooth and polished; in whose lower part is a small hole, and on its sides are three holes, two on one side, and one on the other side; and the end of it is cut, according to the manner of cutting a reed, as you see; on its upper end is a ring.
For when the instrument reaches the water, then it itself descends immediately upon the instrument, thus evacuating a medium quantity from the water.
Because if you evacuate more from it than is necessary, perhaps the sick person dies in an hour through the resolution of his animal spirit; or a fainting spell occurs, which approaches death.
But evacuate from it according to the quantity of its virtue, and according to what the disposition of the sick person signifies to you from the strength of his pulse and from his well-being.
Then withdraw the instrument, and retain the water.
This is because it is retained immediately due to the skin that retains the opening which is on the sifac: about which I have recounted, that you should perforate it according to that manner.
Then again use the instrument on the following day, if you see the sick person can tolerate it, and also extract a small quantity from the water.
Do this for several days without fear, and guard yourself from error, until only a small amount of water remains.
However, if you fear for the sick person and you remove a large amount of water, then treat him with burial in warm sand, and with much sweat in a bath and in the sun, and let him endure thirst; and treat him with drying medicines until he is healed; and cauterize over the stomach, and liver, and spleen, after the extraction of water, according to what I have recounted in that which preceded.
On the treatment of infants born in places where their urine passages are not perforated.
Chapter LV.
When any infant emerges from its mother's womb, and the opening of its urethra is not perforated, or is a tight opening, or is in the wrong place.
Therefore, it is necessary to assist with its perforation immediately when it is born, with a very fine Spatumilus, according to this form.
Then place a thin leaden nail in the opening, and tie it; and hold it for three days, or four.
When, therefore, it wishes to pass urine, it should be removed, and it will urinate. Then return it.
And if you do not place lead, it is now possible that the urine which flows over the area will not allow it to close.
However, he whose opening is constricted is treated with lead, as we have said, for many days, until it is enlarged.
However, those in whom the opening is in an improper place are harmed. For this reason, in those born with the opening at the end of the penis, they cannot urinate forward until they raise their penis with their hand to the top. Nor is there procreation for him, therefore, because the semen cannot reach the womb in a straight line; and it is a very foul sickness.
And the method of the operation in him is that the sick man be laid on his back. Then, extend his penis with your left hand forcefully, and cut off the head of the penis from the glans area, with a sharp scalpel or a sharp spatula.  Just as one cuts a reed, or just as you shave something so that its middle is similar to a penis head, and that the opening is in the middle as is appropriate.
And beware of blood flow during your operation. For this often happens. Therefore, apply to it whatever stops the bleeding, and treat the wound until it heals.
Concerning Albucasis's matters that occur in the foreskin and the glans penis, and concerning corruption, blackness, and adhesion.
Chapter LVI.
These things of Albucasis happen often in the penis, and there is a prominence of foul flesh.
And from it is another that is malignant, and another that is not malignant.
Therefore, the non-malignant one, you should suspend with a fine hook, and cut it off, until you cleanse the whole of it. Then place over it a poultice steeped in Egyptian unguent. Then treat it afterward with the unguent dyafinicon, until it is healed.
If it is malignant, of foul colour, then you should administer a cautery to it after its incision and scraping.
If however the Albather is on the foreskin of the uncircumcised, and part of the Albather is inside the foreskin and part of it outside, then you should remove the Albather that is inside first, until when it consolidates, then treat it externally. For when you treat it simultaneously, the foreskin will not be safe from being pierced.
And they also occur in the testicles, and the foreskin, a blackness and corruption. Therefore, it is necessary that you cauterize all that is already blackened, and that which is about to corrupt, or that which is already corrupted.
Then apply a line over it afterwards with honey that has already been mixed with the flour of pomegranate bark, and crushed, sifted herbs.
Then treat it with the remaining treatment, until it is healed.
If, however, a flow of blood occurs, then apply a cautery with a lunar cautery, according to this form.
For cautery is helpful for two dispositions at once, namely for the flow of blood, and for a wound when it corrupts.
If the head of the rod is corroded, and the whole is destroyed in an hour, then it is necessary to insert a lead cannula into the urethra, so that the patient may urinate upon it.
However, in the adhesion of the foreskin to the head of the rod, and this adhesion does not happen except in one whose foreskin is healthy, and circumcision is not required upon him: and sometimes adhesion occurs because of a wound, or an abscess: it is therefore necessary to scrape it with a blunt Spatumili, until the ligament is loosened, and the head of the rod is freed from every part.
If it is difficult to distinguish them precisely, then it is necessary to scrape some of the head of the rod, and from the foreskin. This is because the foreskin, when it is thin, is perhaps perforated quickly because of its thinness.
Then separate the foreskin and the head of the rod with a thin linen cloth, which has been soaked in cold water, so that they do not adhere again.
Then treat it with astringent wine, until it is consolidated.
Chapter LVII.
Concerning the cleansing of infants and the treatment of errors that befall them.
Circumcision is not a solution of continuity, like other wounds; however, since it is an operation of our own making, done by our own will, and its use is specifically in children, it is necessary that we mark it with an operation more beneficial and a path leading to health more easily.
Therefore, I say that the ancients did not mention circumcision in any of their books, since they do not use it in their laws, and it is only what we have acquired through experience.
Because I have found most of the surgeons and phlebotomists using cleansing, circumcising with a razor and scissors; and they use cauterization, and tying with thread, and incision with a knife.
And I myself have already tested all these methods, and have not found a better cleansing than with scissors, and tying with thread.
Because in cleansing with a razor, the skin often slips away. Because the skin of the foreskin has two layers; therefore, perhaps the upper layer of skin is cut, and the lower layer remains; therefore it is forced to cut again to cut the other, and there will be pain. And with cleansing that is done by cauterization, that is, digital, which the surgeons use, the incision of the extremity of the male member is not secured; because perhaps it enters its opening.
However, in cleansing with a nail, perhaps the iron slips out and spoils your operation; and the boy's skin is of a short nature, and many times they are born in such a way that they do not need cleansing; and I have seen that.
However, cleansing with scissors, and ligature with thread, has shown me a good experiment; because scissors are proportionate to the incision; because the sharpness that is above is like the sharpness that is below. Therefore, when you press your hand, the two sharpnesses are proportioned, and they cut according to one operation at one time; and a compression is made in a similar shape, containing the skin of the penis on all sides, with which no error falls at all.
And the proper method of operation is, that you cause the boy, especially if he is one of those who understand a little, to be aware that you do not do anything except tie a thread on his penis; and you leave him until another day.
Then make him rejoice and be joyful in every way possible to you, from that which he receives with his understanding. Then make him stand between your prepared hands, and let him not be seated; and hide the scissors in your sleeve, or under your foot, so that the boy sees them not at all, nor anything of the instruments.
Then introduce your hand to his penis, and blow into the skin, and pull it upwards until the head of the penis emerges. Then cleanse it from the filth that collects on it.
Then tie the marked place with a double thread. Afterwards tie a second ligature a little below that. Then hold the lower ligature's place with your index finger and thumb, with a good grasp, and cut between the two ligatures. Then quickly lift the skin upwards and extract the head of the rod. Then allow the blood to run slowly (for this is better) and place powder on top; and over the powder a cloth on which is spread the yolk of a hard-boiled egg in rosewater, mixed with good fresh rose oil; and leave it on top until the next day; and treat it with the remaining treatment until healed.
The shape of the scissors for cleaning is this.
Let the two ends be blunt and meet; so that the nail branch does not protrude from them; and let the length of the two sharpened parts be equal to the length of the two handles.
However, an error in the cleaning process is: that perhaps the inner skin is entirely or partly lost at the incision.
Therefore, you should extend it from your time with your fingernail before the location becomes an abscess, and cut it according to equality.
If you cannot hold it with your fingernail, then extract it with a hook, and cut it.
However, if three days have passed and what is under the rod remains swollen, abscessed: then leave it until the abscess is warm and ripe, and peel it off easily, and cut it according to what is prepared for you, and beware of the head of the rod. For it will not harm it.
Therefore, treat it with what consolidates wounds from the powders we have described in the treatise on powders.  And if it is cut from the skin beyond measure, and extends upwards, that will not harm it either.
Therefore, treat it with what we have said, until it is healed.
Chapter LVIII.
Concerning the extraction of retained urine in the bladder.
Retention of urine in the bladder occurs from an obstruction caused by a stone, or congealed blood, or pus, or a growth of flesh, and similar things to those we have mentioned in the methods of treatment in the division.
And if the urine is not discharged, and you see that its retention is due to a stone, which is already in the neck of the bladder, then it is necessary that he be weak and bent over his knees. Then let his feet be placed upon his back, and let him extend his abdomen from the upper part of his back, and let the weak man strain his breath as much as possible. Thus, it is forced with the neck of the bladder to expel the stone backwards: wherefore the urine is released.
If it is not released with what we have said, and the matter is severe on the patient, then it is necessary to administer its extraction with an instrument called a syringe, whose form is this: Let it be of silver, and let it be slender, smooth, concave like a bird's quill cannula in thinness, one and a half palms in length, to which let there be a slender cannula at its head.
And the method of the urine's exit through it is that you take a doubled thread, and tie to its end wool, or tow, with a good ligature; and insert the end of the thread into the lower part of the syringe; and cut with shears if any excess of wool remains, but insert it into the cannula with force, like a lever.
Then anoint the syringe with oil, or with butter, and egg white; and make the patient sit on a seat, and embrocate the bladder, and its penis with moist oils, and olive oil, and tepid water.
Then insert the syringe into the penis with ease, until it reaches the root of the penis.
Then double it upwards from the navel.
Then drive the syringe inside it, until it reaches the bladder, and the patient feels it has already reached the empty space; and this is not done in this order, unless because the passage, in which it travels, is one in which there is tortuosity.
Then extend the thread with wool gradually. For urine will follow the wool.
Then pull it out, and make the urine run through the urinary passage; and repeat the syringe, and do not cease to do that until the bladder is emptied, and the patient finds relief.
Concerning the quality of bladder clysterization with a clepsydra.
Chapter LIX.
When a sore occurs in the bladder, or blood congeals in it, or pus is collected in it, and force is applied to pour water and medicines into it: then it is done with the instrument called a Clepsydra, and this is its form.
It is, in fact, deaf, that is, closed. And in it are three openings, two on one side, and one on the other side, as you see.
And the hollow space, in which that which impels it is located, should be according to the amount that fills it without addition, until, when something is pulled with it, moisture is drawn out; and when it is impelled, it is expelled along with it to a distance; according to how a clepsydra works, by which naphtha, that is, Greek fire, is projected in naval battles.
Therefore, when force is to project the moisture into the bladder, introduce the end of the clepsydra into the moisture, and pull with that which impels it upwards, for the moisture is drawn into the concavity of the clepsydra.
Then introduce its end into the tube, as we have described in the syringe. Then propel the moisture with that which impels it, for that moisture reaches the bladder immediately, so that the sick person feels it.
A fine form of clyster with which the bladder is clysterized.
Let it be made of silver, or brass; its head should be higher, similar to a small alca, and below it a sinus into which a ligament falls.
Then take the bladder of a ram, and place in it the moisture with which you wish to clyster the bladder. Then tie it between two sinuses with a strong ligature made of doubled thread; and warm that moisture a little over the fire.
Then introduce the end of the clyster into the tube, afterwards grasp your hand over the bladder containing the moisture with a fitting constriction, until the weak person feels that the moisture has now reached the bladder.
If, however, you do not have a bladder present, then take a piece of parchment, and make a circle from it, and pierce it all around its circumference. Then introduce a strong thread into those openings, as they revolve. Then assemble the circle, as a flask is assembled; after you place in it that which you wish from moistures, and oils, and waters.
Then tie it to the instrument, and do with it as you did with the bladder by pressing with your hand, until the moisture reaches the bladder.
Chapter LX.
Concerning the extraction of the Stone.
We have already spoken in the division of the species of Stone, and its treatment with medicines; and I have described the difference between a stone generated in the kidneys and the bladder, and its signs in their entirety; and I have described the stone in which operation by hand and incision is required; and this is the stone generated in the bladder properly; and that which is fixed in the urethra; and I am recounting it with clear explanation and brevity.
Therefore, I say that a stone generated in the bladder most often occurs in children.
And among its signs is that the urine passes from the bladder like water in its subtlety; and white sand appears in it, and the afflicted person rubs their urethra, and struggles with it, and frequently has to lean over. Then it rises and the anus discharges with it in many of them.
And the cure is easy for children, as long as they do not reach fourteen years of age. And it is difficult in the elderly. However, in young people, it is moderate, in that it is between those two things: and if the stone is larger, the cure is easier; and if it is small, the cure is the opposite of that.
Therefore, when we come to the treatment, it is first necessary to cleanse the sick person with an enema, which will extract all the faeces that are in their intestines; for it sometimes prevents the finding of the stone during the investigation.
Then let the patient be taken with their feet, and shaken and moved downwards: so that the stone may descend to the bottom of the bladder, or leap from a high place sometimes.
Then have him sit between your hands prepared, and let his hands be under his thighs, so that the entire bladder will be sloping downwards.
Then examine him, and touch him from the outside.
If therefore you feel a stone in the space, then immediately proceed with a section upon it.
If, however, it does not fall under your touch at all, then it is necessary that you wipe your index finger with oil from your left hand, if the patient is a child; or your middle finger if he is a full grown youth; and that you insert it into his anus, and search for the stone, until it is under your finger; and turn it gradually towards the neck of the bladder.
Then press upon it with your finger, and drive it outwards against the place, whose section you desire; and command a servant to press the bladder with his hand, and command another servant to extend the testicles with his right hand upwards; and with his other hand, to remove the skin, which is beneath the testicles, in the part from the place where the section is.
Then insert the Spatumile, which is of this form. And find it in that which is between the anus and the testicles, and not in the middle, to the side of the left buttock; and let the incision be upon the stone, and your finger be in the anus; and let the incision be transverse, so that the incision be wide on the outside, and narrow on the inside, according to the amount that it is possible for the stone to exit from it, not being larger.
For perhaps the finger, which is in the anus, compresses the stone at the incision, and it exits without difficulty.
And know that the stone has angles and edges, wherefore its exit is difficult because of it.
And if it is smooth, like a gland, and round, its exit is easy.
Therefore, to the one that has angles and edges, add in the fissure.
If it does not exit thus, then it is necessary that you devise above it: either that you string above it with a properly shaped instrument, the extremity of which is like the Moon, which strings above the stone, and does not slip from it; or that you introduce a thin instrument with a curved extremity beneath it.
If however you cannot above it, then enlarge the opening a little. If anything from the blood overcomes you, cut it with a zegi.
If however the stones are more than one, then drive the largest first to the opening of the bladder. Then cut above it. Afterwards drive the small one after that; and similarly do if there are more than two.
If it is very large, then it is ignorance to cut above it with a large incision. For if one of two things happens to the sick person, either to die or to suffer constant dripping of urine, because the place is not entirely consolidated.
But administer its expulsion until it emerges; or fashion instruments in its fracture with forceps, until you extract it bit by bit.
When therefore you have completed your operation, then fill the wound with frankincense, and aloe, and dragon's blood; and bind it, and place over it a cloth infused with oil and wine, or rose oil, and cold water, so that a hot abscess may be seated.
Then lay the sick person on their back, and do not loosen the bandage, until the third day. When therefore you have loosened it, embrocate the place with water and much oil.
Then treat it with dyafinicon ointment, and basilicon ointment, until it is healed.
If however in the wound a hot abscess is added, and corrosive, and similar things: such as if blood is congealed in the bladder, and the urine is prevented from flowing out: and this is recognized from the excretion of blood with the urine. Therefore, insert your finger into the wound, and extract the blood. For if it remains, it provokes corruption of the bladder, and its putrefaction.
Then wash the wound with vinegar, water, and salt, and apply whatever is appropriate from the treatment, until it is healed.
And it is necessary in the hours of the entire treatment, that you bind the two thighs, and the buttocks, on account of the medicines which are placed on the place.
If a small stone is in the urethra, and is stuck in it, and prevents the exit of urine: then treat it with what I have mentioned before you get to the incision. For often you will be spared the incision by this treatment, for I have already proven it.
And it is, that you take a perforator of iron, whose form is this: triangular tip, pointed, fixed in wood.
Then take a thread, and tie the urethra below the stone so that it does not return to the bladder.
Then introduce the piercing iron into the urethra with ease, until the perforator reaches the stone itself: and revolve the perforator with your hand on the stone gradually: and try to pierce it, until you cause it to penetrate on the other side.
For the urine is immediately discharged.
Then press your hand on that which remains of the stone from the outside of the urethra. For it breaks itself and comes out with the urine, and the sick person is healed.
If however this treatment is not prepared for you, because of something that prevents it: then tie a thread under the stone, and another thread above the stone. Then cut above the stone on the urethra itself between the two ligatures. Then extract it. Afterwards, loosen the ligature, and cleanse the congealed blood that forms in the wound.
And a ligature of thread under the stone is not necessary unless to prevent its return to the bladder; and another ligature above, unless that when the thread is loosened after the stone's removal, the skin returns to its place and covers the wound; and for that reason it is necessary for you to elevate the skin upward when you tie the upper thread, so that it returns to its proper position and covers the wound, as we said.
Chapter LXI.
Concerning the extraction of a stone in women.
Little stone is produced in women.
However, if a stone happens to any of them, then the cure is difficult, and it is prohibited due to many methods.
One of them is: that a woman is perhaps a virgin.
And the second is, because you do not find a woman who reveals herself to a physician, when she is chaste, or from those having husbands.
The third is, because you do not find a woman well knowing this art, especially the operation with the hand.
And the fourth is the distance from the location of the stone: wherefore it needs a deep incision, and in that is fear.
If necessity provokes to that, then it is necessary that you take a woman physician, well knowing: and little is found.
If truly you isolate her, then seek a chaste, skillful physician, and present a skilled female midwife knowledgeable in women's matters, or a woman who indicates a part of the art in this skill:  make her present, and especially for her to do whatever you command her from the examination concerning the stone.
First of all, that she examine if the woman is a virgin: then it is necessary that she insert a finger into her anus and seek the stone.
If therefore she finds it, she should grasp it beneath her finger, and then command the midwife to insert her finger into the vagina of the sick woman, and inquire about the stone, after she places her left hand upon the bladder and compresses it with a good compression.
If therefore she finds the stone, then it is necessary that she gradually move it from the opening of the bladder downwards with all her skill, until she reaches it with the root of the thigh.
Then she should cut upon it at the point opposite the middle of the vulva at the root of the thigh, from whichever side it is prepared for her, and she feels the stone in that part: and her finger should not be removed from the stone, grasping it underneath; and let the incision be small at first. Then insert a rod over that incision.
Then insert a rod over that incision. If therefore she feels the stone, then she should add to the incision according to the proportionate amount that the stone emerges from it.
And know that the types of stone are many. For from these are the small, and the large, the smooth and the rough, the long, and the round having branches.
Know therefore its kinds, so that this may be made clear to you regarding that which you wish.
If therefore blood overcomes you, then add in the place of crushed zegi, and hold it for one hour, until the blood is severed.
Then return to your operation, until the stone emerges; and do so, preparing for yourself from the instruments, which I have said in the extraction of stone in men, so that you may assist in your operation by means of them.
If, however, a flow of blood overcomes you, and you know that the expulsion of blood is from an artery that has been cut, then place powder over the place, and bind it with linen bandages in a fitting constriction; and do not change it; and leave the stone, and do not extract it. Perhaps, indeed, the weak woman will die. Then treat the wound.
When, therefore, the sharpness of the blood subsides after days, and the place becomes putrid, then return to your operation, until the stone emerges.
Chapter Sixty-two.
Concerning the incision of a watery hernia.
A watery hernia is not, unless it is an aggregation of moisture in a white sifac, which is beneath the skin containing the testicle, and is called sifac.
And sometimes it is in its own membrane, which nature prepared for it in the part of the testicle, until it is putrid: which is another testicle, and is the skin of the testicle between the white sifac, which we said: and this does not happen except rarely.
And the generation of this hernia, indeed, is from the weakness that happens to the testicles: therefore this matter is poured out to them. And sometimes it happens from a blow on the testicles.
And this moisture has many colours. For either its color is inclined to yellowness, or it is blood-red, or foul, black, or watery white, and that is what is more.
And the signs by which it is known where the collection of water is, are these. For if it is in the white sifac that we mentioned, then the abscess is round, somewhat elongated like the shape of an egg: and the testicle does not appear, because the moisture contains it on every side.
And if the moisture is in the proper tissue to itself, then the abscess is round like a part of an egg, and therefore a man estimates that it is another egg.
And if the moisture is between the skin of the testicles and the white sifac, then it falls under the senses.
Therefore, when you desire knowledge of the color of the moisture, then experience the color of the moisture in the abscess with the introduced square, whose form preceded. Therefore, according to that which emerges in the track of the Intromission, judge about that which is between it.
Therefore, when we come to treatment with iron, then it is necessary that you order the sick person to be bled if it is possible for him, and you see his body full.
Then let him lie on his back upon a slightly raised surface, and place many cloths beneath him.
Then sit you on his left side, and order the attendant to sit on his right, who shall extend his rod towards one of the two sides of the skin of the testicles, and towards the part of the navel of the belly.
Then take a broad spatula, and cut the skin of the testicles from the middle lengthwise, until near the pubic bone; and let the incision be according to the straightness of an equidistant line which divides the skin of the testicles, until it reaches the white sifac that encloses it: and scrape it and observe it, or beware of this, that you separate it: and let your scraping with which you scrape it, be from the part that hangs with the more egg; and subtly scrutinize it with your scraping according to the amount that is possible for you.
Then pierce the sifac full of water with a large perforation, and draw out all the water.
Then separate the two lips of the incision with hooks, and extend the sifac upwards, and do not touch the skin of the testicles that encompasses it: and cut the sifac however it is possible for you to cut it, either with its entirety, or in pieces, especially its thin side. For if you do not meticulously investigate, security is not achieved in its incision, lest the water return.
If, however, the egg protrudes outward from its skin during your operation: then, when you have completed the incision of the sifac, return it. Then bring together the two lips of the scrotal skin with sutures.
Then treat it like the other wounds until it heals.
If you find a corrupted egg with a different blackness, then you must tie the vessels that are the suspensory ligaments, fearing the flow of blood.
Then cut off the testicle with the suspensory ligament, and remove the egg; afterward treat it with what we have said.
If, however, water is collected in two parts, then know that there are two branches: therefore, cut the other part in the same way you did to the other one, equally.
And if it is made equal for you, so that it is one operation, then do it; afterward wipe away the blood. And introduce into the sections wool soaked in oil, or in rose oil; and place outside wool that you soaked in wine and oil, and spread it over the two testicles, and the belly's wound; and place over it doubled cloths, and they are pillows; and tie them above with a ligament, which has six according to this form.
Then take two cloths, and sew them together, and fill them with dyed wool, according to this likeness; and let the edges with which it is pressed be made of cotton or damp wool; and let them be gathered with a constriction at the lumbar region of the breeches; and one edge shall take hold above the anus as far as the back, and the second edge shall take hold at the side of the pubic region; and two edges above the two thighs below, and two other edges above the two groins, and let the entire constriction be gathered in the lumbar region of the breeches.
And sometimes this branch is artificially treated with a cautery in the place of the incision with iron: and it is that you should take a small, knife-like cautery, and with it cut the skin of the testicles; and it is ignited, as we have described; until, when a white, water-containing substance is revealed, then take the cautery, according to this form.
It resembles a Greek letter.
Then pierce it with it, and let it be ignited, until all the moisture comes out.
Then spread the sifac with hooks, and scrape it with a heated fine cautery, and cut it as much as possible, until you eradicate the whole of it.
And be careful, from the egg, lest the fire touch it.
And know that this operation is safer, and farther from blood flow, and better than the operation with incision.
However, if it presents opposition to you at the time of incision, or at the time of cautery a hot abscess, or blood flow, or anything else: then you must treat whatever causes opposition to you from it with the treatment that suits it, according to what has been stated.
However, if the patient is timid and does not await this operation, due to its horror: then administer the perforation as I describe it; and it is so.
When it is certified to you by what we have said concerning signs that the ramex is watery, then you must have the patient sit on an elevated seat.
Then perforate the abscess in its lower part with a broad spatule, and make the perforation along the length of the body, and let the opening be wide, until all the water runs out.
Then place a poultice on the location, and bandage it, and allow it to run out the remaining water; then treat it until the wound is healed.
If, however, there is an obstruction to the outflow of water at the hour when you perforate it; and this is only because a white pannus obstructs the wound's opening and hinders the exit of the water: then it is necessary to insert a pen into the wound, or an instrument with which the water of hydrops is extracted, the form of which has preceded; or add a little to the wound's operation.
And know that the water returns and collects after six months, or about that. When it therefore collects, then let it be perforated in the same manner, and the sick person will pass their days.
Chapter LXIII.
Concerning the treatment of fleshy Ramicis.
Know that in the section above this Ramic, there is fear leading to harm in many dispositions. Therefore it seems to me that its dismissal is to be saved from it.
And I am recalling the operation in it, and the appearance of the abscess.
I say, therefore, that many abscesses occur in the bodies from which the testicles are composed; and that is produced from many causes, namely.
Or from acute or acrid superfluity, which is poured out to the testicles. Or from a blow.
And the color of the abscess is according to the color of the body, and no pain is found in it; and it is a serious abscess.
And perhaps it is a stony abscess, whose color is dark, and there is no feeling in it.
And sometimes it arises from the knotting of arteries and their inflation, as its recollection has already preceded; or from the inflation of veins.
Therefore, that which arises from the inflation of arteries is recognized by the disposition of the abscess, when you press it with your fingers. And you should not touch it completely.
However, that which arises from the inflation of veins, nothing is dispersed from it upon compression with the fingers.
And it is now possible that a section be made upon this species and upon the rest of the flesh; and it is as if you were to separate the skin of the testicles. Then raise the egg upwards and draw it out with a white sifach; and free the suspensorium from the vessels, and tie the vessels; and cut the suspensorium after you have freed it from all parts of the egg.
If therefore the egg is consolidated with those nascent flesh parts, then it is necessary to draw out the egg, and to cut it.
And if there is an adhesion between something of the siphaket, or in that which is between the vessels, then it is necessary to free all that adhesion, and to cut it with a round incision.
If however there is a nativity of flesh in the place of adhesion which is behind, then it is necessary to cut all of it and draw out the egg, as we said.
When therefore your operation is complete, then fill the wound with wool soaked in rose oil and wine; then treat it with the rest of the treatment, until it is healed.
Chapter Sixty-four.
Concerning the treatment of Ramicis, which is with Vite.
Vitis is an abscess enveloped in a certain wrapping, similar to a bunch of grapes, with a softening of the testicles; and it makes difficult for the sick person movement and exercise, and walking.
And in the treatment of this illness there is fear, because of that which preceded, as remembered.
But it is necessary that we should say the operation in it according to what the first ones did.
I say therefore, that it is necessary that you make the sick person sit on a raised seat. Then push down the suspensory ligament of the testicles. Then grasp the skin of the testicles with your fingers, along with the vessels that are close to the penis; and let another attendant hold them, and stretch them with a forceful extension.
Then, with a broad, sharp scalpel, make a transverse incision directly over the vessels, until the vessels are exposed.
Then scrape away from every side, as we told you in the extraction of the arteries that are in the temples.
Then insert a needle with a double thread into them, and tie it in the first of the places where the veins occur; and tie it again in the last of them. Then cut it in the middle, in a straight section along the length of the body, and extract what is collected from the putrid, foul humors.
Then treat the wound with the treatment of other wounds, in which the force generates pus, so that the vessels nourishing one testicle may fall. For there is no evil through it.
However, if all the vessels are affected, then it is necessary that the testicles, with the vessels, be removed; so that the egg is not deprived of nourishment, because of the incision, and it withers or dries up, and there is no benefit with them.
Chapter LXV.
Concerning the treatment of intestinal colic.
The outcome of this colic is from a section, which occurs in a sifach extended over the abdomen in the groin area from a mirach of the belly.
Why do the intestines descend from that rupture to one testicle? And this rupture is either from a sifach, or its extension.
And these two types occur from many causes: either from a blow, or a jump, or a shout, or the lifting of a heavy object, and similar things.
And a sign, when it is from the extension of a sifach. It is that which happens gradually over a long time, and does not happen suddenly: and it is an abscess equal towards the depth; because the sifach compresses the intestine.
And a sign of it, when it is from a section of the sifach, because it makes a severe pain occur suddenly at its beginning: and the abscess is diverse, appearing under the skin nearby; and that is because of the exit of the intestine, and its course outwards from the sifach.
And sometimes it emerges with the intestine in a circle; and this is called a ramified intestine, and zirbia; and sometimes it happens with flatulence.
And sometimes faeces run into the intestine and are retained there: and this is a harm to the sick person, because it causes a dull pain, and especially when pressed.
And in the treatment of these types of illnesses, there is fear with iron; therefore, a fall must be avoided in it.
And the method of operation is that you should instruct the sick person to draw back the intestine with their hand into the interior cavity of their body, if it yields to the withdrawal. Then he should be laid back on his neck between your hands, and elevate his legs.
Then extend the skin that follows the skin upward, and cut the skin of the testicles entirely lengthwise. Then fix hooks in the two lips of the incision, according to what you need to open the incision with them; and let the incision be according to the amount, that it may be possible for the egg to emerge from it.
Then scrape the siphak, and what is under the skin of the testicles, until when the white, hard siphak is exposed on every side; then insert your index finger into that which follows the testicle, into that which is between the white siphak, which is under the skin of the egg, and the second siphak, and detach with it the adhesion that is on the posterior part of the egg.
Then move with your right hand the skin of the testicles inward; and with this, extend the white siphak upward with your left hand; and elevate the egg with the siphak towards the incision; and order the servant to extend the egg upward; and you sever the adhesion, which is behind the complete separation.
And examine with your fingers that there is nothing there of the intestine wrapped in the hard white siphak. If however you find something of it: then push it towards the lower abdomen.
Then take a needle, in which is a thick thread, made of linen from ten threads; and insert it at the last siphak, that is, the tunic, which is under the skin of the testicles which follows the incision; then cut the ends that protrude from the thread, until there are four threads. Then place some of them over some with a figure that is in the form of a cross; and bind with them the alsifach, of which we spoke, because it is under the skin of the testicles with a strong ligament, until no vessels, which nourish them, can send anything to them; so that a hot abscess does not result from it. And place another ligament outside the first ligament, distant from it by no more than two fingers. And after these two ligaments, leave from the siphak, which is under the skin of the testicles, a quantity the size of a finger; and cut the rest entirely around, and remove the egg from it.
Then cut into the lower part of the skin of the testicles, from which blood and pus runs, as we described in what has gone before.
Then apply wool soaked in oil, and place it on the wound; and apply the bandage that we have described. And sometimes the white siphak that we mentioned is cauterized after its incision, fearing the flow of blood. For this often happens. And leave the bandage until it falls off by itself.
If however its falling is delayed, then it should be soaked with hot water; and place upon it what we said, until it falls off.
Then treat the wound with the rest of the wound treatment, until it is healed.
Chapter LXVI.
Concerning the windy ram.
In this ram, I have not seen anyone who dared to use iron for its treatment.
And the first ones said that it happens as we have described in the ram with the vine. That is, tie the vessels after the incision, then cut in the middle, and finally treat with whatever opens it until the vessels fall out; and treat the wound as we described until it is healed.
Chapter LXVII.
Concerning the rupture that occurs in the groin.
When rupture occurs in the groin, as we have said, and the area bulges, and nothing from the intestines descends to the testicles; and if it does descend, it is little and returns every hour; but if the time with it is prolonged, a fissure is added in the scrotum, until the intestines descend into the scrotum.
And that happens from the stretching of the scrotum, which is in the groin, as we said. That is because the scrotum is stretched; then the area softens and becomes an abscess, and bulges.
And its treatment is with a cautery, as its preceding description.
And sometimes it is cured with an iron, according to this method: and it is that the sick person lies on their back between your hands. Then cut the place of the ulcerated and bulging rupture, cutting across its width, according to the size of three fingers.
Then press the scrotum and what is under the skin, until when the white scrotum is exposed, which is under the skin that follows it.
Then take a rod, and place it upon the bulging place of the scrotum, and press it to the depth of the belly.
Then sew the two bulging places on the end of the rod from the scrotum, and connect one of them to the other with a suture; then pull out the end of the rod.
And do not cut the scrotum at all, nor stretch the egg, nor anything else, just as I have made you know in the treatment of the intestinal hernia.
Then treat it with the treatment of wounds. When therefore you cut the threads, cleanse it, and restore the wound, until it is consolidated.
For the scrotum contracts, and no bulge of the rupture is added.
And the cautery is better in this place, since it is closer to health.
Chapter LXVIII.
On the softening of the skin of the testicles.
Often the skin of the testicles is softened in some men, because of which the flesh that is between them is softened, and its appearance is disfigured.
Therefore it is necessary for whoever is asked to treat it, to have the sick man lie on his back, and to cut all the softened skin over the natural skin.
Then he should bring together the two lips with sutures: and if you wish, first sew up the excess of softened skin with three or four sutures, and secure the suture.
Then cut between the sutures.
Then treat the remaining wounds with care until they heal and the threads fall out.
Chapter LXIX.
Concerning Castration.
Know that castration is forbidden in our law; and because of that, I might not have mentioned it in this book of mine; and its mention is not necessary unless for two reasons.
One of which is that it should be in the knowledge of a physician when questioned about it, and so that he may know the treatment of whoever has it.
And the other reason is that we often require the castration of certain animals, for our benefit through it, such as rams, goats, and cats, and similar animals.
Therefore, I say that castration is done according to two methods. Or by attrition. Or by fissure and incision.
In that which is done by attrition, the method of operation is that we make the animal sit in warm water until its testicles soften and loosen and hang down; then rub them with your hand until they dissolve and are no longer visible to the touch.
In castration by fissure and incision, it is necessary that you hold the animal and press the skin of its testicles with your left hand.
Then tie the suspensory ligament, and cut above each testicle with one incision, until two testicles are exposed; then cut them after you have peeled back each, and do not leave any sifak on them apart from the thin sifak that is above the vessels.
And this method of castration is better than that which is done by attrition, because attrition perhaps leaves some part of the testicles, wherefore the animal desires intercourse.
Then treat the wound until it heals.
Chapter LXX.
Concerning the treatment of a hermaphrodite, there are two methods.
A hermaphrodite is from men in two ways. One of these is that, as it appears, there is a space following, or in the skin of the testicles, in the space between the two testicles, a figure like a woman's vulva, in which there are hairs; and sometimes urine runs from that which is in the skin of the testicles.
In women, however, there is one kind, and it is a woman's vulva upon the pubis like very small male testicles protruding outwardly; of which one is like a man's penis, and two like two testicles.
And the treatment of three kinds, two from men, and one kind from women, is: because it is necessary to cut away the added flesh, until their impression disappears. Then treat them with the treatment of the other wounds.
In the second kind of men, however, from which urine issues, which is in the skin of the testicles, there is no operation, nor is there any treatment at all.
Chapter LXXI.
Concerning the incision of the labia, and the protruding flesh in women's vulvas.
The labia may perhaps be added to the natural condition until its appearance becomes ugly and foul; and sometimes in some women it becomes so large that it spreads out like in men and reaches the point of sexual intercourse.
Therefore, you should hold back the excess of the labia with your hand, or with a hook, and make an incision; and do not cut too deeply, especially into the root; so that a flow of blood does not occur.
Then treat it with the treatment of wounds until it heals.
However, the flesh that grows is flesh that arises in the opening of the womb until it fills it; and perhaps it emerges outwardly in the likeness of a tail; and for that reason, some earlier writers call the illness the "tailed illness. Therefore, it is necessary to cut it as we cut the labia, and treat it until it heals.
Concerning the treatment of the Alratica, which is the unpierced vulva of a woman.
Chapter LXXII.
Alratica is when a woman's vulva is not perforated, or the opening is small. And it is either natural or accidental.
Accidental is from an illness that preceded it; indeed, it is made either from added flesh growth, or by a subtle or thick sifach; and it is made either deep within the womb, or in its sides, or in its upper or lower part; and it prevents intercourse and impregnation, and childbirth, and perhaps it prevents menstruation.
And its recognition is made through the obstetrician's observation, if an apparent obstruction is nearby.
If however it is not apparent, then seek it with your fingers, or with a probe.
If however the obstruction is from a thin sifach, and is close to the two lips: then hurry, and break it apart.
And it is, that you place pads on the two lips.
Then place your index fingers of both hands together, and let the woman be on her back with her legs spread. Then extend the two lips with strength, until the thin sifach is broken, and the obstruction is opened.
Then take wool, and soak it in oil, and place it on the location: and let the woman do this every day, so that the location does not solidify again.
If however the sifach is thick, dense: then it is necessary to cut it with a spatula wide similar to a myrtle leaf.
If however the obstruction is born of flesh, then suspend it with hooks, and cut it: and let there be with you medicines that assuage the flow of blood without mordication, such as acacia, and dragon's blood, and frankincense mixed with the white of an egg.
Then administer a wide lead cannula, so that the wound does not heal quickly, keep it for a few days: and administer a linen bandage, then proceed with the rest of the treatment, until it is healed.
And sometimes other flesh births occur in the womb: therefore, it is necessary that they be cut in this way: while it is not a cancerous abscess; for a cancerous abscess in the womb, there should be no opposition with iron at all.
Chapter LXXIII.
Concerning the treatment of hemorrhoids, Athehelil, and red Bothor in women's vulvas.
Hemorrhoids indeed are the opening of the veins' orifices, until a lot of blood flows from them constantly.
When hemorrhoids become chronic, they become thelil; and I have already stated their species and signs in the division; and I will state here which receive treatment from them and which do not.
Therefore, I say that hemorrhoids which are in the orifice of the womb, and do not appear to the senses, then there is no treatment with iron for them.
However, those of them which are in the orifice of the womb upon which the senses fall, are those which are cured.
Therefore, it is necessary that you introduce the woman into a cool house. Then extend the thelil with forceps, or with a rough cloth, and cut them from their roots.
Then powder over them, at the flow of blood from one of the incisions, without chewing: such as acacia, and dragon's blood, and frankincense, and similar to them.
Then let him propel her feet against the wall for one hour. Afterwards, place her in cold water.
If the flow of blood persists, then make her sit in a decoction of sumac, and quince bark, and gallnuts, and similar things.
Then take barley flour, and make it into a paste with honey and vinegar, and make a plaster with it on her back.
If therefore the blood is cut off with it, it is good; and if not, make cupping vessels adhere to her back and under her arms, without scarification.
Then take wool, and immerse it in the juice of tarathit, or the juice of arnoglossa, or the juice of the alaulat branches, that is, aglanter, Pontic wine, and apply it to the wound.
When therefore the abscess subsides, then treat the area with ointments until it heals.
Albarth is indeed red, similar to the heads of alhaasse, and is of harsh appearance.
Therefore, you should cut away what appears from it, according to what I said in the thelil equally, and treat it until it heals.
Chapter LXXIV.
Concerning the perforation of the exit that occurs in the womb.
Many kinds of abscesses occur in the womb, such as cancer, and stony abscess, and ulcers, and abrasions, and alekilati, that is, herpes, aestiomemus, and fistulas, and hemorrhoids, and ragadiae, and thelil, and a hot abscess.
And I have already discussed all these ailments and their types, and their signs, and their cures in the division: it is necessary to describe in this treatise the hot abscess that occurs in the womb, when it is from the abscesses which collect pus, and you wish to know how its opening is made with an iron.
Therefore, it is necessary to consider. Then if the pain of the abscess in its beginning is sharp with its percussion, and inflammation, and fever: and you see it red: if the sensation falls upon it, then do not hasten with its perforation: and treat it with that which helps in its maturation, until when the sharpness of the occurrences subsides.
Then it is necessary to have the woman sit on a seat that slopes two seats, and to lean, or lie down on her back, and to draw her feet to the lower part of her abdomen: and let her thighs be spread out, and let her place her arms under her knees, and bind each with a suitable bandage to it.
Then let the midwife sit on the right side, and administer the instrument with which the opening of the womb is opened.
And it is necessary, when you wish to administer this instrument, to fix it with the rod deep within the woman's womb: so that that which enters from the instrument is no more than the depth of the womb, and does not harm the weak one.
However, if the instrument is more than the depth, then it is necessary that you place cushions upon the tissue of the womb's depth: so that the entire instrument's entry into the womb's depth may be prevented: and it is necessary that he place the rotation, which runs on the instrument, from the upper side; and that he hold the instrument, and that the minister rotate the rotation, until the womb's depth is opened.
When therefore the exit appears, and is touched by the hand, and is smooth and soft, then it is necessary to separate it at its head with a wide spatula.
When therefore the pus is evacuated, then it is necessary that you place on the wound a linen cloth soaked in rose oil, or green oil, in which there is some astringency; and place the cloth, and extract the section into the depth of the womb.
And place externally over the womb, and over the pubis, clean wool soaked in water in which mallows have been boiled.
Then treat it after two days with the ointment that suits it, until it is healed.
And sometimes the womb and wound are washed, so that it is flushed with water and honey; then with water in which the root of lily or long aristolochia has been boiled; then return to the ointment.
If the wound is hidden inside the womb, then it is necessary that you refrain from treating it with iron, rather treat it with what we said in the division.
Chapter LXX.
Teachings on Midwifery, how living embryos are treated, having emerged in a non-natural form.
It is necessary for the midwife to first know the form of natural childbirth.
Therefore, among its signs is this: when you see a woman pressing downwards, desiring to smell the air, and relief is upon her regarding the birth, and the embryo's exit is hurried: then know that this birth is according to the natural form, and its exit is upon her head, and the afterbirth with it: either hanging or suspended from the navel.
Therefore, when you see these signs, then it is necessary that her abdomen be compressed, so that the embryo descends quickly.
For when it descends upon her head, the afterbirth descends with it, and it is cleansed from those superfluities by good cleansing.
However, any birth besides this one is unnatural, blameworthy.
For sometimes the fetus emerges upon its feet, and its body emerges before its head, and its feet, and its hands together, or one foot: or its head and hand emerge: or the belly emerges: and perhaps it turns upon its neck, and similar things are among the blameworthy figures.
Therefore, it is necessary for the midwife to be prudent, subtle in all these matters, and to beware of error and deception: and I am showing every form among them, and how the skill is in it, and how it is signified by it, and how to stand upon it.
When the fetus emerges upon its head in its natural emergence, and it becomes violent upon the woman, and her labor becomes difficult, and you see her strength already weakened: then have her sit on a seat, or let women hold her; and apply vapors to her vulva with decocted fenugreek and with moist oils.
Then let the midwife insert a small spatula between her fingers, and split the afterbirth with it, and cut it with her nail until that which is within it runs out from the moisture; and press the woman's abdomen until the fetus descends.
If, however, it does not descend, then it is necessary for the woman to be cleansed with a clyster of fenugreek mucilage, with sesame oil.
Then prescribe to her after the clyster that she compress herself; and make her sneeze with condiments, and hold her mouth and nose for one hour. For the fetus will emerge immediately.
If, however, two hands of the fetus emerge first, it is necessary that you reduce them with ease gradually. If, however, it does not yield during entry, then place the woman on a seat, and raise her feet upwards; then shake the seat on the ground; and let the woman be held so that she does not fall during the shaking.
If, therefore, the hands do not emerge, and the fetus dies: then cut them, and remove the remaining fetus; and tie its hand with cloth, and extract it with equality; for it will emerge.
The exit of the embryo is upon its feet. When the fetus emerges upon its feet, then it is necessary to push them upwards; then turn the fetus gradually; afterwards, equalize it.
Then take one of its feet and extend it gradually.
When, therefore, they emerge up to the hips, then command it to be compressed, and make it sneeze with condiments; for it will emerge, if God wills.
And if it does not emerge with what we have described, then return the fetus gradually until you place it in its natural form. For it will then emerge with easy exit.
If it is prevented by all that we have described, then take from marshmallow mucilage, and sesame oil, and dissolved gum, and pound all in a mortar with a good pounding.  Then line with it the vulva of the woman and the lower part of her belly. Then make her sit in warm water until she experiences hypocondria.
When therefore you see that her lower parts are already heated, then make her a poultice of myrrh, and apply it. When therefore the poultice has held for one hour, then make her sit on a seat. Then make her sneeze, and pinch her nose and mouth, and press the lower part of her belly with gentle pressure. For the pus will come out immediately.
The exit of the fetus is upon the knees and hands. When it emerges in this manner, then gently insert her hands into it. Then the woman shall lie on her back with her feet hanging down, lying on the bed, and her hands folded. Then press gently on her abdomen. Then pull out what is under her feet from the pillows until it is prepared at the lower part. If the fetus does not emerge, then take her feet and move them with a forceful motion. Then press gently on what is above the hypochondria until the fetus ascends to the upper parts. Then let her insert her hands, and gently adjust the fetus; and instruct the woman to compress until the fetus emerges.
The exit of the fetus hangs sideways from the hands. Her hand should be skillfully employed in the reduction. If however she cannot reduce it, then lift the woman, and make her walk.
If, however, she cannot walk, then have her lie on a bed and shake her legs with a forceful shaking.
Then administer the liniment which you prepared from mucilaginous substances.
If childbirth takes it (the pain), then have her sit on a seat. Then strive in the reduction of the hand, and arrange the fetus according to its natural form; and make the woman sneeze, and command her to compress herself, until it emerges.
The exit of the fetus is upon her neck, with outstretched hands, and its face is towards its mother's back. The midwife should hold the hand of the fetus, then gradually turn it and arrange it with ease.
When it is thus arranged, then place upon its vulva what we have described, of oil and mucilages.
Then command her to move gradually. When you have done that, then have her sit on a seat, and command her to lean to her right side. Then command her to be compressed; and make her sneeze with condiments.
The exit of the prepared fetus on the side. When it descends to the opening of the womb in this manner with the afterbirth, then cut the afterbirth with your fingernail until it is emptied of moisture.
If therefore it hangs over the face of the fetus, and its neck, then cut it from the navel: so that it is not retained, and dies.
Then push the fetus inward, until you place it as it ought to be: and command the woman to compress herself several times: for it will exit with an easy exit.
The exit of twins, or many fetuses. Know that twins are often born, and sometimes three, and four are born. However, that is unusual and rarely happens.
However, five is a thing beyond nature, and they do not entirely live: and a single afterbirth contains them, although they multiply, and they are separated by a partition, distinguishing them, tied to the umbilical cord of each of them.
And sometimes they emerge just as a single fetus emerges by a natural, easy exit, and they emerge by that praiseworthy exit, as we have narrated.
If some of them are difficult at birth, and reach that which we have said of unnatural shapes, then treat them as we have narrated; and let the midwife be subtle, and do what she does with ease and slowness, and devise according to every shape with that which is prepared for her from ingenuity leading to health.
A reminder of what is formed in the womb from embryos, and miscarriages.
Sometimes one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, and more than ten are formed in the womb; and it has already been verified by me that a woman miscarried seven, and another fifteen, all formed.
That which was done by the measurement of the glorious wise man.
Therefore, all this must be in the knowledge of the midwife. For perhaps a similar case will come to her: therefore, let her oppose it with that which is necessary.
Chapter LXXVI.
Concerning the extraction of a dead fetus.
When you treat a dead fetus with what I have said in the division of medicine, and it does not emerge, and you are forced to use an operation with your hand, then it is necessary that you consider.
If then the woman is of sound constitution, and is not afflicted by any of the accidents from which harm is feared for her: then it is necessary that the woman be laid supine on a bed, on her back, and her head lowered, and her legs raised; and let the attendant hold her by two sides, or let her be bound to the bed, so that her body is not moved during the extraction of the fetus.
Then moisten the mouth of the womb with humid oils, with the mucilage of marshmallow, fenugreek, and flaxseed.
Then let the midwife anoint her hand with these oils and mucilages; then let her introduce it into the womb with ease. Then let her seek with it the place where she can fix the hooks on the fetus, and suitable places for this.
Therefore consider then, if the fetus is prepared to descend upon its head: then fix the hooks in its eyes, or in its neck, or in its mouth, or in its palate, or under its chin, or in its fork, or in places near the ribs, and under the hypochondria.
If however the descent is upon its feet, then in its pubic bone and its middle ribs.
And it is necessary that she hold the hook with her right hand, and place its curve in that which is between the fingers of her left hand, and introduce it with her hand with ease, and fix the hook in any of those places which we have mentioned, until she reaches the empty space.
Then she should fix another, or a third hook, if necessary, opposite it, so that there is equal contraction, and it does not deviate to one side.
Then let it be extended with equal extension, and let the extension not only be in a straight line, but rather be moved in every direction, so that its exit is eased; just as is done with a tooth during its extraction.
And it is necessary for that which is between them to be softened by the extension. If a part of it remains, then the midwife should anoint some fingers with oil, and insert them from the side, so that she may turn with them that which remains.
If therefore a part of the fetus emerges, then the hooks should be moved to another place that is higher; do this until the entire fetus emerges.
If therefore a hand emerges before the other, and it is not possible to return it, because of its constriction, then it is necessary to wrap a cloth around it. Then pull it out until when the entire one emerges, cut it either at the ankle joint or at the elbow; and thus it is necessary that you do to the other hand, and to the two feet.
If however the fetus's head is large, or constriction occurs in its exit, or water has accumulated in its head: then it is necessary to insert a thorny Spatumile between the fingers, and to split the head with it, and to extract the water; or to break it with the instrument called Almisdac: whose shape comes with the shapes of the other instruments in the chapter that is after this.
Similarly, he should do so if the fetus is of a large-headed nature, then it is necessary to sever it with algengematu, or to extract it with misdach, as we said. Then pull the bones with forceps.
If the head emerges, and is constricted at the fork, then it is to be split, until the moisture that is in the chest is discharged.
If, however, it is not entangled, nor yields to exit: then cut the head into pieces, as much as possible for you.
If, however, the lower belly has an abscess, or has dropsy in it: then it is necessary to pierce it, until moisture runs from it.
If, however, the fetus is above its feet, then its extraction is easy, and its direction to the mouth of the womb is slight.
If, however, it is constricted at the belly or chest, then it is necessary to extract it with a cloth which you have wrapped around your hand: and to split the belly or chest until that which is in them flows out.
If, however, the rest of the limbs are removed, and the head returns: then the midwife should insert her left hand. If therefore the mouth of the womb is open, then she should insert her hand deep into the womb, and search for the head with it, and pull it with her fingers to the mouth of the womb: then insert one or two hooks into it and pull it with them.
If, however, the mouth of the womb is constricted, because of a hot abscess that has occurred to it: then it is not necessary to work on it, but rather it is necessary then to administer the effusion of humid, fatty things; and to administer plasters; and to sit in waters that soften and moisten.
If the fetus is on its side, then it is possible to equalize it: then let what we said about a living fetus be administered.
If that is not possible, then it should be cut into pieces and extracted.
And it is necessary that you not leave anything of the afterbirth inside at all.
When therefore you have completed your operation, then administer what we said about hot abscesses which occur in the wombs.
If a flow of blood occurs, then let it descend into astringent waters, and administer the rest of the treatment.
And indeed I have already seen a woman, in whose womb a dead fetus was: then she became pregnant over it again, afterwards another fetus died as well. Therefore, a long time after, an abscess occurred in her navel, and it swelled until it opened: and it began to emit pus.
Therefore, I was called to treat her, and I treated her for a long time: and the wound did not heal.
Therefore, I placed over it some plasters of strong attraction: and a bone came out from the place. Then a few days passed, and another bone came out. I was therefore surprised by this, since there is no bone in the belly.
I therefore thought that they were from the bones of a dead fetus.
I then searched for the wound, and extracted many bones, the woman being in her best condition; and she thus lived a long time, and emitted a little pus from the place.
And I have not established this extraneous thing here, unless because there is knowledge and aid in it for the work that a skillful physician manages with his healing hand.
Chapter LXXVII.
Concerning the shapes of the necessary instruments in the extraction of a fetus.
Shape of the pivot by which the womb is opened.
Here below is the shape of the Forceps, by which books are equalized, to which are equally two pivots at the two ends of two pieces of wood. However, this pivot ought to be finer than the forceps; and so that it is made, either of ebony or of boxwood.
And the width of each piece of wood is about two fingers; and the edge of each of them is about one finger, and the length of each of them is a palm and a half; and in the middle of the two pieces of wood are two additions of the same kind of wood, which are now fixed to both, whose length is half a palm and a little more; and the width of each is about two fingers, or a little more.
And these two additions are introduced into the opening of the womb, so that it may be opened with them when you turn the two pivots.
Another form, similar to that one, finer, and lighter.
Let it be made of ebony wood, or boxwood, according to the likeness of forceps. However, at its extremity let there be two additions, as you see here above: and the length of each of these additions is about a handspan: and the width of each is two fingers.
When therefore you wish to open the womb with it, then make the woman sit on a bed, with her feet hanging down, and the space between her legs open. Then insert these two joined additions into the womb: and you are holding the lower end of the instrument between her thighs. Then open your hand with the instrument, as you do with shears, equally according to the amount you wish of the opening of the mouth of the womb, until the midwife does what she wants.
Another form of Vertigo, which the ancients called the Impelling Form, by which the fetus is impelled.
The Almisdac form, by which the large head is crushed; and it is likened to a pair of tongs, which have teeth at the end, as you see.
And sometimes it becomes elongated, like tongs according to this form, as you see, which have teeth like saw teeth, by which it is cut and crushed.
The form of a hook having one spine.
The form of a hook having two spines.
The form of a spatula with two ends for severing the head.
The form of two spatulas, also broad.
All these instruments are used, and the more their types are multiplied, and they are prepared by the craftsman, the swifter is his operation and the higher he is esteemed among men because of their quantity.
Therefore, do not despise any instrument from among them without having it prepared. For their necessity is inexcusable.
Chapter LXXVIII.
Concerning the extraction of the Secundine.
When the Secundine is retained at birth, then it is necessary to instruct the woman to hold her breath. Then cause her to sneeze with spices: and press your hand upon her mouth and nostrils. If therefore it emerges by this means, it is good.
If not, then take a pot, and pierce a hole in the lid: and place in it herbs that open the mouth of the womb, such as calamint, rue, dill, chamomile, asafoetida, cinnamon wood, and centaury: take all these herbs, or some of them, and immerse them in water, and place them over the fire.
Then place a reed tube over the hole of the pot's lid, and the other end in the mouth of the womb: and let her hold it until the vapor reaches the cavity of the womb.
Then cause her to sneeze, as we said. For the afterbirth will emerge with ease.
If however it remains after this treatment, and does not emerge: then instruct the midwife to immerse her hand in sesame oil, or marshmallow mucilage. Then let her insert it into the vagina, and search for the Afterbirth with it. When therefore she finds it, then let her take it, and extend it gradually.
If however it be attached deep within the womb, then let her insert her hand, according to what we have described, until when she finds the Afterbirth, and pull it out gradually in a straight line, so that the womb does not fall during the violent pull; rather, it must be shifted easily to the right and left sides; then let the amount of pull be increased. For it then yields, and is preserved, and escapes from adhesion.
If the mouth of the womb is constricted, as we have already described: treat it with sneezing and by medicine of a pot with herbs.
If, however, it does not emerge with all that we have described, then be careful not to tire yourself out in repeated extraction.
But it is necessary that what emerges from it to the mouth of the womb be tied to the woman's hip. Then administer an enema to her with the four-drug ointment. For it will putrefy it after days, and it will dissolve, and it will emerge.
However, when it putrefies, a bad odor rises from it to the stomach and head, and harms the weak one. Therefore, suitable fumigations should be administered to it.
Some of the ancients have already experienced fumigation with nasturtium and dried figs.
Form of the instrument with which to fumigate a woman in retention of the Secundinae and menses.
Let it be made of glass similar to alabaster, or of earthenware: and let the wide end be placed over the fire: and let the fumigation be placed over the prunus: let it hold it, until that fumigation is consumed: and again another.
Chapter LXXIX.
Concerning the treatment of an unperforated anus.
Many children are born with their anuses unperforated, which a fine sifac has already obstructed. Therefore, it is necessary for the midwife to pierce that sifac with her finger; and if not, to pierce it with a sharp spatula; and let her be careful not to touch the flesh.
Then place upon it wool soaked in wine and oil. Then care for it with ointments until it is healed.
If, however, you fear that it will become obstructed, then place a lead cannula in the opening for many days, and remove it when the child wishes to evacuate.
And now, obstruction of the anus also happens from the consolidation of a wound, or an abscess. Therefore, it is necessary that that consolidation be cut, then treated with what we said concerning treatment and lead.
Chapter Eighty.
Concerning the treatment of Fistulas that occur in the lower part.
Fistulas that occur in the lower part are swellings and enlargements that occur near the anus externally, or in the space of one of the parts: and it is one fistula, or several.
When that swelling has become old, it opens, and watery white moisture, or thin pus, runs from it.
And sometimes there are penetrating fistulas from these. Therefore, penetrating ones are recognized by that which emerges from excretion and windiness, when the sick person uses excretion: and perhaps worms emerge from them.
And some of them are fistulas when, being penetrating, they are in the space leading to the bladder, and to the urethra. And some of them are penetrating as far as the hip joint, and as far as the tailbone.
By this, however, a penetrating fistula to the anus is recognized, even from a non-penetrating one, that you insert your index finger into the anus, and insert a thin probe into the fistula, from air or iron; when there is no winding.
If there is winding in it, then insert into it a thin probe of lead, or a hair from a horse's mane, until you feel the probe or hair in your finger.
If you do not feel it completely, and nothing emerges from the opening in terms of expulsion, nor wind, nor worm as I said, then know that it is not penetrating; therefore, hasten to treatment.
And when the fistula is penetrating to the bladder, or to the urinary meatus, then its indication is the discharge of urine from it, and its prevention from this that the place be consolidated with medicines.
If however it is penetrating to the hip joint, or to the hip bone, then its sign is that the probe reaches that place, if there is no winding to the bone; and the discovery of pain in the surrounding area, and that pus emerges from it always; and that no medication works on it, nor is it consolidated with ointment.
And in all these penetrating fistulas, there is no cure at all; and their treatment is labor and vanity for him, from foolish physicians, upon whom it is formed.
However, in that which is not penetrating and not old, healing is hoped for with a saw, according to what I tell you, and I have already proven; and it is that the sick person lies on their back in your hands; and raise their legs above their hips, and their hips are inclined toward their stomach. Then introduce a lead or bronze probe, if there is a winding in the fistula, until you know where the probe reaches.
If, however, the sick person feels it around the anus, then you should introduce your index finger into the anus.
If therefore you feel the probe has already penetrated itself, detected, beyond what you feel between your finger and the fistula, or flesh: then you know for certain that it is penetrating; therefore do not labor on it, for there is no cure for it, as we said.
However, they say that in some people the flesh heals, and from the medication from which they hope for help, it is that you heat a thin cautery according to the width of the fistula, as before, and introduce it heated into the fistula until it reaches around the anus. Then repeat it twice or three times, until you know that all those added filtered flesh that are like the hollow quill of a bird are already burned.
Then treat it with lint wrapped in butter, until those burned flesh come out; then treat it with ointments that generate flesh and consolidate it.
If therefore it heals, it is good.
And if not, then it will never heal with any other treatment.
And if the probe emerges, and does not reach your finger in the anus, and there is a thick layer of flesh between it and the probe, or if such a thing happens, and you see a fistula in what follows the skin surface, then cut the skin from the beginning of the fistula, and you proceed cutting along with the probe that is in the fistula, until the cut reaches where the probe's end reaches, and the probe is released and falls out.
Then cleanse those filtered tissues, which resemble the hollow of a bird's feather, so that nothing remains of them.
However, if blood overcomes you, and separates you from your operation as you cut those tissues, then it is better, and more quickly helpful, to cauterize it with fire, or with a sharp medicine.
Because cautery with fire gathers good qualities, to burn those added tissues, and to cut off blood, and to dry out the moistnesses.
Then treat it with bandages soaked in butter, or with crushed herbs, until the place discharges pus, and those burned tissues are discharged in the pus.
Then treat the wound with consolidating ointments, which produce hard flesh: and there are medicines in which are astringency and drying.
For when it is restored, then it is already healed: and you do not fear a recurrence.
If however the fistula has already reached the depth of the anus, and extends from the body's superfluity: then insert your finger into the anus, and investigate with it.
If therefore you feel a tension, and between you and it is a veil of sinew or flesh, and it is close to penetration: then there is no operation on it, except according to the path of trust and hope.
That is, because one of three ways is administered in it: either to cauterize it itself, as we said: or to dissect it, until you reach its concavity, so that it is possible for you to insert ligatures, and a cure from close by. And do not proceed far with the section, so that you do not cut the muscle containing the anus, and cause a sudden exit of excrement from the sick without their will. Then treat it with what we have said.
Perhaps it will be healed. Or you will extend the veil and cleanse it after you have cut it close to the anus, as we said, either with a probe or with another instrument with a sharp end. Then cleanse those filtered tissues that are in the section, until you can reach it with exploration.
Then attempt the restoration of the entire wound with the incision and the upper opening where it consolidates; and a fistula will remain open in the interior part of the anus, and it will be less severe on the sick person.
And sometimes the fistula is sutured in this way: and it is, when you insert a probe into the fistula; and it is on the side of the anus around the surface of the body with the skin and the margin of the anus; then take a probe with a perforated end, which is like an alef needle, that is, for preparing skins, according to this form. And insert into it a thread wrapped with five threads, and so on. Then insert the probe with the thread into the fistula until it reaches its concavity.
If, therefore, it penetrates the inner margin of the anus nearby, then pull the thread out of that opening; so that you insert your finger into the anus, and pull out the end of the thread, and bring the two ends together; and tighten each, and leave it for one or two days; and the more the thread cuts into the flesh, the more tightly you should tighten it, until those parts of flesh between the two ends of the thread are cut and fall off; then treat the wound until it consolidates and heals.
If however the opening of the fistula is not penetrating, then make it penetrate in whatever way is prepared for you, unless it is very deep. For it is not in your power to do that for fear of injuring it.
Then do with it as we have said, until it heals.
Shape the pointed spatula with which the fistula is cut, whose curvature is very sharp, and the other part is not sharp, so that it does not cut what is not necessary, as you see.
Chapter Eighty-one.
Concerning the suturing of hemorrhoids, from which blood flows from their incision: and the treatment of fissures.
There are hemorrhoids in two ways. For they are either inside the anus, like the bladders of carbon, or of prunes: or as if they were themselves grapes. And from them are small, and large: and blood flows from them always, and there is one, and there are many. And they are outside the anus, and at its extremities.
However, those which are outside the anus, are for the most part few in moisture, from which flows yellow water, or little blood with continuous flow: and they are according to the colour of the body.
And the treatment of that which is inside the anus is that you command the sick person to sit; and it is squeezed, until it emerges from the anus, and the athelil appear to you. Therefore, also suspend them with hooks: or hold them with your fingernail. Then cut them at their roots.
If, however, the hooks are not retained in them, because of their moisture and their softening: then take them with a rough cloth, or with a cloth from double-layered wool, and extract them with your fingers. Then cut them and, after the incision, sprinkle some hot powders over them, so that they will stand in place of a cautery. Or cauterize them according to what has preceded in the chapter on cauterization. Then treat them with the rest of the treatment, until they are healed.
If the anus does not yield to expulsion, then inject the sick person with an enema containing a small amount of mordication, so that it washes away what is in the anus, and yields to expulsion quickly, when the sick person expels it.
If, however, the piles are external to the anus, then their removal is easy; and it is to grasp them with your fingernail, or grasp them with a hook, and cut them. Then treat them with what we have said, until they are healed.
And whoever shuns incision with iron, then it is necessary to treat their sutures in this manner. Take a wrapped thread, and insert it into the needle. Then pull the pile upward, and cause it to penetrate with the needle at its root on the other side; and wrap the two ends of the thread, at the lower part of the needle, and let them be lengthwise; and bind the pile with a strong constriction. Then tie the thread, and remove the needle.
Do this with all the piles, and leave one of them; nor tie it, so that superfluity of blood may run from it.
Then place a cloth soaked in rose or cedar oil over the anus, and place it over the anus; and command the sick person to rest. Then leave it until it falls.
When therefore the piles fall, treat them with ointments and the other treatment, until they are healed.
Concerning the treatment of Fissures. Indeed, they often occur from the drying of the stool and constriction of the nature.
When therefore they become old and medicine is of no avail in them, then it is necessary that you scrape them with a pointed spatula, or with your fingernail, until they become moist, and the upper crust that prevents their consolidation is removed. Then treat them until they are consolidated as is necessary.
If however they do not consolidate, then scrape them again with a more forceful instrument than the first, until they bleed much, and are excoriated, then treat them until they heal.
Concerning the treatment of inverted and non-inverted almirmars, and of dry athelils, and of ants.
Chapter LXXXII.
Know that an Almirmar is nothing other than a round swelling the colour of the body, similar to the head of a nail, and it occurs throughout the body, especially in the lower parts of the feet and toes, and pain arises from them when walking.
Therefore, it is necessary to cut what is around the nail, and to hold it with scissors, or with a hook, and to uproot it from its root.
Then treat it, and if you wish, cauterize it according to what was stated in its chapter.
From dry athelil, one is a small, rough, filtered, round eminence above the surface of the body. And they frequently occur on the hands of children.
And its treatment is to extend the athelil and cut it; or to bind it with silk thread; or with a hair, until it falls off. And if you wish, cauterize it according to what has been previously stated with fire, or with a sharp medicine; and now inverted athelil are eradicated, and not inverted with the instrument that I shall name.
A formica, however, is also a small, filtered, thick eminence above the body's surface, penetrating deeply; and when cold finds it, a sensation similar to an ant bite is felt in it, and it spreads throughout the body; and most of it occurs on the hands.
And its treatment is to take a cannula from a goose's feather, or a strong vulture's feather; and to place that cannula over the Formica until the cannula's circle contains its parts. Then turn your hand with the cannula until you sever what is around the Formica; and place it into the depths of the flesh, and eradicate the Formica from its root.
And if you wish, do it with a cannula of air, or iron, according to this form.
Let the cannula's top be at a height that pulls the enclosed part upward, so that the grasping and turning of it and itself might be lightened.
And if you wish, cauterize the Formica according to what was previously stated in the cauterization of Athelil in the chapter on cautery.
Chapter Eighty-three.
Concerning the forms of instruments administered for enemas in diseases of the anus, and for bowel evacuation, and colic.
Sometimes an enema is made of silver, or of bronze, or of cast brass, or of hammered brass.
And sometimes it is made from these instruments, small and large, according to those in which they are administered.
Therefore, that which is administered in the treatment of young children should be small; and likewise their enemas, for those whose anuses are weak or painful.
Large enema.
Its tube, that is, the upper end where the bag is tied, should be wide in this manner; and it should have a distinction so that the bag is tied as you see, and its lower end, which is inserted into the anus, should be closed, that is, not open, smooth, very much so, drawn to a thinness; and on one side of it should be two openings, and on the other side one opening.
And the size of the opening should be according to the thickness of the rays, and a little thicker; and the bag, in which the medicines are placed, should be of an animal bladder, or of parchment, which should be according to the shape of a small asofrat, the root of which is one palm.
And it should be pierced with many holes as it is rolled, and the space between each hole should be the thickness of a finger. Then insert a strong thread, made of ten threads or so, through those holes, and attach the bag to it like an asofrat. When the bag is thus placed in it, the top of the enema should be tightened between two distinguishing constrictions with a strong constriction. Then irrigate with it.
And this is the shape of the bag depicted here, and of the holes.
The method of irrigation with it is: fill the bag, or bladder, with medicine that has been heated according to the patient's tolerance; and beware that it is not overly hot or overly cold.
Then the patient should lie on their back, and raise their legs upwards; and place a cushion beneath them, that is, a hide upon which people lie, or a linen cloth.
Then anoint the tip of the enema with oil, or with egg white, or with the mucilage of fenugreek, or similar things. Then insert it into the anus with ease. Then let the attendant grasp the bag with both hands simultaneously, and express it with force, until everything in the enema is evacuated into the intestines.
Then remove the enema, and let the patient raise their legs towards the wall.
If the medicine compels him to an outcome, then let him hold it as long as possible. And if he sleeps with it all night, it is more beneficial.
If, however, you administer an enema for ailments of loose bowels, and its exit is hasty, then administer an enema again, until he is healed.
If there are hemorrhoids or damaging abscesses in the anus, then let the enema be very thin, gentle, from enemas with which children are enematized.
And this should be the form of a thin enema, above which the skin should be tight.
Chapter LXXXIV.
I have already said in the division of the treatment of wounds that it was suitable for the book, and I will now describe their treatment with the hand, and with medicines, according to its completion.
Therefore, I say that wounds are diversified according to the means by which they are made, and according to the place on which the wound falls.
The things by which wounds are often made are, like the throwing of a stone; or the incision of a sword, or a knife; or the impact with a spear, or wood, or an arrow; and by similar things from many such.
And the wounds that are made according to the places of the body are, like the wound that falls upon the head, or the neck, or the chest, or the belly, or the liver; and similar ones from those members.
And I am narrating the treatments of certain wounds, that I may set forth the reasoning and rule concerning the remaining wounds.
And I will begin with simple wounds of the head, because the recounting of compound wounds will come at the beginning of the third chapter.
I say therefore. When a simple wound occurs on the head, and there is no fracture of the bone: consider then, if it is from a stone's throw or similar things, and has only broken the skin: and is a large wound, and you fear a bad outcome of a hot abscess: then hurry, and perform a cephalic phlebotomy immediately; and do not delay it; and draw from his blood according to the amount of his strength: if nothing forbids it from the phlebotomy, especially if the blood that emerges from the wound is little. And let the phlebotomy be from the opposite side of the wounded part.
And let the phlebotomy be from the opposite side of the wounded part. And let the sick person beware of repletion, and wine, and heavy foods.
If however something prevents diminution, then let the food be lessened, and let him not approach meats, nor wines.
And if a hot abscess happens to him, apply a poultice soaked in rose oil alone, or with wine that contains astringency, over the wound.
If however you are certain of the absence of a hot abscess, then apply, if it is recent with its own blood, and the air has not changed it, the powder I will describe shortly; and if the air has already changed it, then apply certain ointments until it is healed.
If however the wound is large, or is from a sword cut, and similar things; and its lips do not come together by means of pledgets, then bring them together with stitches, according to what I will describe regarding the sutures of belly wounds.
If however the wound is already exposed to the bone, and hangs, and its retention is only in a small suspensory, then cut it. Then treat the wound with medicines, and restore the hard flesh in place of the skin, and instruct the sick person to eat foods with bulk, such as heads of grain, and cooked wheat, until it is like a pulp; and similar things.
If you find putrefaction in the skin, and it does not adhere to the bone, then cut away all the putrefied part, and cast it out; then treat it.
If however in these wounds there is an artery, or vein from which blood flows; and it is not stopped by remedies, then investigate the artery. If therefore you find it not severed, then cut it with a Spatumili, or tie it. If necessity compels when that which we have said does not help, then cauterize it until the blood is stopped.
If however these wounds are small, simple, then their treatment is easy, light; so that you powder over them this powder, because it consolidates them before air changes them.
Method of the flesh-producing powder. Take one part of frankincense, and two parts of dragon's blood, and three parts of quicklime: thoroughly grind the whole, and sift it: and fill the wound with it, and bind it tightly with a good bandage, until it adheres well to it, and coagulates with the blood.
Then bind it from above with bandages, and leave it, and do not unbind it while it remains, so that it does not fester. For the medicine is not removed from it until it is healed.
And sometimes lime alone does it, when you do not have frankincense and dragon's blood present, and the latter also performs the same operation in many large wounds, when it is appropriate to put it on them and bind them, and are fresh wounds with their own blood, which air has not altered.
If it has already been altered by some alteration of the air, especially when it is summer, then the application of this powder is not effective. Therefore, treat it with what we have said, by applying some digestive ointments to it, or place poultices of barley flour, made with water and honey, until it discharges pus. Then treat it with the rest of the treatment, until they are healed.
However, if a fracture occurs with a bone wound, and it is small, then extract it with forceps; and I will now describe the treatment of head fractures in what follows.
Concerning wounds of the Neck.
However, if a wound occurs in the neck, then there is no difference in treatment between it and a simple head wound.
However, if the nerve of the neck, or artery, has already been cut: then if it is a nerve, there is no skill in it, except that its treatment should be avoided, along with anything that creates strong astringency, such as ziniar, and zegi, and similar things. Because they harm the nerves and contract them.
And do not put anything cold on the wound at all: because the substance of the nerves is cold, and its continuation is with the brain, which is higher than the limbs: and let that by which it is treated be gentle, such as lime washed with sweet water, infused with oil sometimes, or with rose oil, and tuttia, when washed also with sweet water; and the remaining mineral stones in this manner, and moist ointments.
If however the wound is large, then administer a suture: or narrow its edges with pledgets. Then treat it until it heals.
If however the wound has depth, or there occurs a sinus in its lower part, in which pus is already collected, then pierce it in the more depressed place in it.
If indeed an artery has been cut in the wound, and its blood flow has resulted, then separate or cut it, and tie it: or cauterize it, if necessity prompts it.
If however the windpipe has been cut, or the entire one, and the other parts have been saved, then join the skin edges with a suture over the windpipe, and do not touch the windpipe, rather straighten it, and bring it back to its natural form. Then bind it with a suitable bandage, and leave it for a few days. Then treat it with ointments containing astringency and desiccation, until it is healed.
If however the wound has already made an impression on the bone, then investigate it: then if there are bone fragments within it, extract all or as many as you can of them: and what cannot be removed, leave it, until the wound rots, and its discharge is separated and relieved.
If the wound is recent, then powder over it the powder I have described. If however bone is seen in the wound, and it becomes a fistula, then treat it with what is recounted in its chapter.
Concerning wounds in the shoulder blades.
If there is a blow from a lance or a knife, and you see its depth, then consider. If therefore wind issues from the wound, when the sick person gasps from it, then know that the wound is mortal.
But if it is not deep, and is fresh with its own blood, then do not put powder on it from the first hour, nor bind it, so that the blood is not retained in its depth and returns to the heart and kills the sick person; but put attracting ointment on it and loosen it twice a day.
If however the ointment is not present for you, then put an old cloth in the wound opening, so that it will suck that which emerges from it of the humors; and make the sick person sleep over the wound, so that that which is gathered in it may run.
However, if three days or more have already passed since the wound, and no spasm has occurred in the sick person, nor bad heart tremor, nor constriction in breathing, and you see the rest of their condition good, then know that the wound is safe. Therefore treat it with bandages and the rest of the treatment until it is healed.
If however its healing is excused, and it continually opens, then know that it has now become a fistula. Therefore treat it from its own chapter.
And if the wound is from the incision of a sword or knife, and is simple on the surface of the chest or back, then treat it with what preceded regarding sutures, if it is large, or with powder, if it is small.
If however it has already made an impression on the bone, and chipped pieces from it: then investigate the wound, and hasten to extract those pieces, if they are detached. If however they are not detached, then leave them until the wound putrefies, for the extraction of them will be alleviated.
However, the treatment of other accidental wounds in other limbs is judged by the judgment that we have said.
Concerning wounds of the belly, and the exit of the intestines, and their expulsion.
The rupture which occurs in the belly is great, medium, and small.
From the great one, therefore, sometimes the intestine, or a number of intestines, emerges.
Therefore, their introduction, and their more vehement and difficult suturing, occurs.
And a small rupture also becomes difficult in another way. Therefore it follows, that their reduction is more difficult if you do not hasten their introduction to their place immediately, since it is inflated, opened, and thickened: therefore its entrance becomes difficult.
For this reason, therefore, the middle rupture of ruptures is better, because with it the reduction of the intestine is not difficult, as it is difficult in these two types.
Know that the suturing of the belly is according to four ways.
Two sutures common to the suturing of the belly and the suturing of the other wounds of the body, and two other sutures properly belong to other wounds. However, they are more properly associated with the suturing of the belly, and I will describe each with explanation and clarification.
Therefore, I say that when the wound is small, and something from the intestine protrudes from it, and it becomes difficult to reduce it, then that is due to one of two ways. Either because of the smallness of the rupture, as we said, or because there is inflation in the intestine due to the cold air.
Therefore, when this is so, then it is necessary to warm it, just as you would immerse a sponge or a damp cloth in lukewarm water alone. Or boil it in water with squinancy, cyperus, and spike, and apply it to the intestine with it until the inflation resolves.
Sometimes wine with astringency does this, and it is better than plain water in resolving the inflation.
When therefore you see the inflation already resolved, then moisten the intestine with water in which marshmallow or mallow has been boiled. For by that, its entrance is eased with a small thing.
If however its return is excused after this treatment, then make a small incision in the rupture with the instrument with which hemorrhoids are cut.
And the first treatment is better when it is prepared, than the incision; and no coercion is made to cut after necessity and instrument failure.
Let one part of it be twisted, sharp, and the other part not sharp, and let the slender extremity not be with the slenderness of a spatula, but rather somewhat blunter: and it is that which is similar to a cabbage leaf, as you see.
Therefore, when the wound is enlarged and the intestine enters, then it is necessary that its reduction be according to its natural form in its proper place, if possible over it; because it is better.
When, however, the rupture is large in the lower part of the belly, then it is necessary that you make the sick person lie on their back, and raise their legs higher than their head. And if it is in the upper part of the belly, then place his head and chest higher than his lower parts.
And similarly, if the rupture is in one of the two parts of the belly, then place your attention and your consideration always on this, that the part in which the wound is be higher than the other part.
And thus it is necessary that you administer it in large wounds and in medium-sized wounds.
In small wounds, however, place it according to what is prepared for you.
Then have a pious attendant present between your hands, who should hold the entire rupture with his hand, and draw together its lips. Then uncover from it for the one who follows the suture something after something: and this is the common method of a single suture.
And it is that you should take a needle, or a number of needles according to the quantity of the wound's breadth. Then release from the extremity of the rupture a quantity of the ring finger, that is, the physician's: and fix one needle past that into which you insert thread at both ends of the skin, with the two ends of it (the thread) being what is under the skin from the insides, until you cause it to penetrate from the other side, and you have already brought together the two extremities of the skin, and the two ends of it (the thread): and four rows are made.
Then tighten with a double thread in the circumference of the needle several times from both sides simultaneously, until the two lips of the wound are brought together in a decent aggregation.
Then release the thickness of a finger also, and fix another needle in them; afterward, thread it with the thread, as you did with the first needle. Therefore do not cease to do that with the needles you need until you complete the constriction of the entire wound.
And let the needles be intermediate in thickness and thinness; because very thin needles pierce flesh very quickly, and thick ones are difficult to enter the skin; for that reason, they ought to be intermediate in thinness and thickness.
And it is not necessary that the needle be fixed in the two close extremities of the skin very much, so that the flesh is not pierced quickly and the wound opened before it is consolidated, and also not to be extended too far with the suture, so that the wound is not prevented from consolidating.
Then cut the ends of the needles so that they do not harm the sick person in their sleep; and place cushions of cloth on every side, which will hold the ends of the needles; and leave them until you know that the wound is now consolidated.
And this type of suture with needles is indeed more suitable in small wounds. Because one, or two, or approximately that number of needles is sufficient for their suture.
However, the second common suture is to gather together with the suture four extremities: two extremities of the skin, and two extremities of the stuff, at once, with a needle in which is wrapped a thread equal in thinness and thickness.
Then, when you have pierced with the needle these four extremities, withdraw the needle from the side from which you began, in the same way, so that the thread drawn back falls from the upper part of the wound; so that there is a suture, like a suture of cloth with which cloths are tied together, and place between each suture an amount of thickness less than a little finger.
However, men know this suture.
And with this suture I sewed up a wound that had occurred to a man in his belly, who had been wounded with a knife, and the wound rupture was greater than one palm: and approximately two palms of the middle intestine had come out, and there was a rupture in the middle of the belly.
Therefore I returned it after his intestine had stood outside the wound for twenty-four hours.
Therefore the wound was consolidated in a space of approximately fifteen days: and I cured him, and he was healed; and he lived after that many years, engaged in his affairs.
And the physicians had judged that it would not be healed.
And it was miraculous that I did not cure it with ointment. Because I was in a place where no ointment, nor anything of the medicaments, was to be found. Therefore I placed an old linen cloth over the wound twice a day, and I diligently washed it with honey water, until it was healed.
I will now describe two specific types of sutures, according to the account of the text.
And it is, that you begin with a sharp suture: and introduce the needle from the exterior to the interior part.
When therefore the needle penetrates the skin, and going into the muscle, along the length and breadth of the entire body: leave the extremity thus on the side in which you inserted the needle, and cause it to penetrate on the other extremity from the interior part to the exterior on the other extremity mirach.
When you have caused it to penetrate, then cause it to penetrate according to this on the same extremity mirach from the exterior part to the interior: and leave the extremity sifac, which is on this side, and cause the needle to penetrate the other extremity from the interior part to the exterior: and cause it to penetrate with your penetration, in which you cause it to penetrate on the sifac extremity mirach, which is on its part, until it penetrates the whole thing.
Then begin also from this same side, and sew it with the extremity, which is from sifac on the other side, and draw the needle out of the skin which it has penetrated.
Then reduce it into that skin, and sew the extremity sifac, which is on the other side, with this extremity mirach: and draw it out of the skin which is from its part, and do it one time, and another: and do it turn by turn, until you have sewn the whole exterior according to that example.
And the sum of this suture is that it should be like the suture of leather workers when they sew hides: so that you should sew sifac at one time from one part of one skin's extremity: and that you should leave it at another time from another part, until you complete it.
Second species of proper suture, which Galen said.
His discourse recounts that one should sew it according to the likeness in which certain physicians sew them, in such a way that they gather every part to its suitable counterpart by nature: and they apply the extremity sifac to its other extremity, and the extremity mirach to its other extremity. And that is done according to what I tell you.
One must place the needle in the extremity of mirach nearest to you from the outer side, and cause it to penetrate to the inner part in that alone; and leave the two extremities of sifac. Then turn the needle, and cause it to penetrate from the outer to the inner side in the two extremities of sifac, namely on both sides.
Then turn both, also causing both to penetrate from the inside to the outside, into the two other extremities of mirach, which are on the opposite side.
And this method of suture is better than the common easy suture, and is a suture whose remembrance precedes.
This is therefore the speech of Galen also.
And some said. The suture of the belly is rectified with two needles. That is, introduce one thread into each of them: and begin with the introduction of the needle, from where it is with you, and make it penetrate to the other side, according to the suture of those who sew skins equally.
And know that when there is a rupture in the middle of the belly, then its suture is more difficult than the other places of the belly.
The judgment of the treatment of a wound, is the judgment of the other wounds.
That is, when you obtain a fresh wound with its blood, before the air alters it, and you replace the intestines, and adjust them, and adapt them, then place it on the incarnative powder.
If the air has already altered the wound, then place upon it certain ointments, which are present to you, until they produce pus; and the threads fall away, and the wound is consolidated by means of sifac, and mirach. Then treat it as is the treatment of other wounds, until it is healed.
However, if the medicines are not present to you, then immediately place upon it, from the moment it begins to emit pus, old lint; and change it twice a day, as I have taught you, until it is healed.
For you do not require any other medication in many dispositions, when the wounds are simple.
If, however, you fear that the wound may communicate with the principal members in the injury, then it is necessary that you immerse soft wool in oil of moderate warmth, or in rose oil, and place it around the areas that are between the groin and under the armpits.
If, however, he feels pain, or prickings, or putrefaction in his intestines (for this often happens), then administer an enema to him with astringent, black, lukewarm wine; especially if the putrefaction has already reached the intestine, and has made a penetrating exit to its concavity.
And know that that which is from the large intestine is of easier healing; and that which is from the small intestine is of more difficult healing.
However, the intestine called the Jejunum does not accept healing from a wound that occurs in it at all; and this is because of its multitude of veins, and their size, and because of the subtlety of its body, and the proximity of its nature to the nerves.
If, however, that which proceeds from the wound is a zirbum, and you obtain it fresh, reduce it according to your reduction, by which you reduce the intestines equally.
If, however, a space has passed it, and it has already become green, or black, then it is necessary to bind it with thread above the place which has been blackened by it, so that a flow of blood does not occur. For in a zirbum there are veins and arteries.
Then cut what is beyond that ligature, and place the two ends of the thread hanging from the lower part of the wound outside it, so that the traction of it may be alleviated upon you, and the extraction of it at the occurrence of a zirbum, and the emission of the pus of the wound.
A recollection of the wound that occurred in the Intestine.
When a rupture occurs in the Intestine, and it is small, then it is possible that it might be restored in some people; for this reason, because I saw one who was wounded in his belly with a spear thrust, and there was a wound on the right side of his stomach, and it was an old wound: and it had become a fistula, and excrement and wind came out of it.
Therefore I applied treatment, until I was not confident in his healing; nor did I cease to refine it, until he was healed, and the place was consolidated.
After I saw the place already consolidated, I feared for the sick person, lest an evil accident occur in his belly; and no such evil accident occurred to him from that. And he remained in better dispositions, eating and drinking, and engaging in sexual activity, and entered a bath, and exercised in his daily activities.
And now some of the experimenters have said that when a wound occurs in the Intestine, and it is small, then it ought to be bound in this manner. And it is as if you take ants of large heads. Then bring together the two lips of the wound, and place one ant of those which have an open mouth upon the two lips of the wound. When therefore it takes hold of them, and closes its mouth, cut off its head, for it adheres and does not detach.
Then place another ant near the first, and do not cease to do this with ant after ant according to the amount of the whole wound.
Then reduce it, and suture the wound. For those heads remain attached in the intestine until the intestine is nourished and healed, and no harm comes to the sick person at all.
And now it is possible that the intestine be tied even with a fine thread: which has been scraped from the animal's intestine, attached to it after it is inserted into the needle.
And it is that you take the end of this thread from the intestine, and it is extensively scraped. Then tie a fine linen thread wrapped around its end. Then insert that thread into the needle, and sew the intestine with it. Then reduce it to the disruption.
And this method of sewing with ants and intestine is only according to the way of trust and hope.
Know that a wound which is large, extensive, especially if it is in one of the small intestines: then there is no remedy but refinement, nor is its healing complete.
Concerning the treatment of ulcers and fistulas.
Know that any wound, or abscess, when it grows old and becomes an ulcer, and does not heal, and constantly discharges pus, and is not cut off: then it is universally called a fistula, wherever in the body it is, and we call it Zuchemen.
And a fistula, in truth, is a filtered, hard, white knot, with no pain, having the hollow cavity of a bird's feather; and because of that, some call it Risati, that is, feather.
And it is in some hours moist, which discharges pus. And perhaps the moisture is cut off in some hours. And sometimes this moisture is abundant, and sometimes it is scant; and sometimes it is thick, and sometimes it is thin.
And I have already mentioned in the division, when I said about wounds, that every ulcer which does not heal, nor flesh grows in it, is not so except for one of nine causes.
Of which one is, either because of the scarcity of blood in the body; or because of its bad quality; or because between it and the edges of it is hard flesh, preventing the growth of flesh; or because there is much filth and dirt; or because the ulcer itself is putrid, and the matter that is applied to it is of bad quality; or because the medicine is inappropriate for its treatment; or because the corruption descending on the region is a kind of pestilence, or by a property in the region, as happens in Caesaraugusta, in which there is a difficulty in digesting illnesses, and the healing of abscesses by nature is delayed; or because there is one bone, or a number of bones, in it.
And I have already shown all these causes and their signs, and their cures with medicines in the division: and it is necessary here to make you know the cure of Fistula and Zuken, which is done by means of surgery with the hand.
Know therefore that Fistula occurs in all members of the body. For of them are fistulas which reach large veins and arteries, or nerves, or sinews; or to the intestine, or to the bladder, or to any of the ribs; or to any of the vertebrae of the back, or to any of the joints of compound compositions, such as the hand and foot; and of them are those which go to the vicinity of the main member, and similar ones.
Therefore, whatever of these fistulas is of this kind, is of illnesses difficult to heal, and does not receive a cure, and dealing with it is labor and ignorance.
If there is any fistula whose depth does not reach these places which I have said: and you hope and trust in its cure, and wish to attain knowledge of it, then take a probe of air or iron, if the fistula tends in a straight line, and search for it with it.
If however there is twisting in the fistula, then investigate it with a probe of fine lead. Because lead, with the lightness of its body, is alleviated and is bent around the twisting.
If the fistula has many openings, it is not possible for you to mark it with a probe. Therefore, irrigate it from its openings.
For the moisture you irrigate it with, goes towards the other openings, and runs out of them.
Then, inquire carefully in what way it is possible for you to know whether there is a bone or nerve, and the fistula cavity is distant or near; or if it is a single fistula with many openings, and stand over the entire area with all your strength; with your questioning, in which you question the sick person, and the discovery of pain upon compression with your hand on the area, and with similar signs and causes of accidents relating to abscesses.
Therefore, once you have stood over all those areas correctly, then proceed to treatment with confidence.  And consider whether the fistula is a near, apparent fistula, or in a safe place far from a joint, or a nerve, or artery, or vein, or one of the locations I have mentioned to you; then cut the fistula as previously described in my explanation, and remove what is within it by filtration, and the corrupted flesh, that grows in its opening from flesh, or boils, and similar things; and treat it until it is healed.
However, if the fistula is of distant, deep location, and is in a straight line, then you must cut it as deeply as possible. Then cleanse it from all its corrupted flesh.
Then apply bandages soaked in sharp medicines, and insert them into the cavity of the fistula that you have grasped with the iron.  Do this repeatedly until the sharp medicine has consumed all that remains in the fistula cavity from the corruption.
Then restore it with ointments that generate healthy flesh, until it is healed.
If, however, it does not heal by that, then cauterize it according to what we have described.
If the cause of the fistula is bone, and this is ascertained by you, then investigate it and cut it as I have told you, if nothing from a vein, nerve, or main limb prevents you, as we have said.
If bone is discovered by you, and there is some corruption and blackness in it, then scrape it until all its corruption is removed. Then treat it with that which causes it to flesh over, until it is healed.
If it does not heal, and discharges pus as it did, then know that you have not achieved the complete eradication of the corruption.
Therefore, expose it again, and meticulously perform its scraping and cleansing with all your strength.
Then restore it. If it heals, well and good; and if not, then know that that corruption is in a distant deep part of the body, which you have not reached. Therefore, you have no skill in it, except to leave it to nature.
If the small bone is decayed, and it is possible for you, extract it with fine forceps suitable for it.
If, however, there are many bones, then carefully extract all of them, and do not leave any of them behind with your strength.
If, however, any moisture offers resistance to you, and there is no fear or error in cutting them: then cut those moistures and flesh, if there is any, and free the bones.
If, however, you are not prepared to remove the bones from your time, then place over the wound something that will putrefy it, and leave it until that which is around those bones from the flesh and moistures is putrefied.
And guard the wound so that it does not heal. And constrict the incision that you made in your operation. Indeed, place over it, if you fear it, a cloth soaked in ground sulfur mixed with oil, or a cloth soaked in Egyptian unguent, or any green unguents.
For when those humidities, namely, putrefy, and the bones are separated from them, the removal and extraction of them is eased.
If however there is one large bone, such as the bone of the leg or the bone of the hip, and similar to them, and that which is corrupt from it is a large part: then scrape it with the utmost scraping until that blackness and corruption is removed. Then restore the wound.
If however that which is corrupt within it is a large part, and the corruption has already reached the bone marrow, then it is necessary to saw it, and cut it completely up to the place where the corruption has reached: then treat it until it is consolidated.
And I narrate to you a case, which happened to a man in his leg: that you may set it as an example and aid in your operation.
There was a young man about thirty years of age, who suffered pain in his leg, from a cause which originated within his body, that is, from the interior, until the matter reached his leg, and it became a large abscess: and there was no external cause.
Therefore, time passed with the physicians' error, until the abscess was opened, and many matters ran together with it. And his treatment was delayed, until the leg became fistulous, and many openings were made in it: which all emitted pus and bodily humours.
Therefore, a multitude of physicians treated him for about two years, and there was no one skilled in the art of medicine among them, until I was called, and saw his leg, and the matters that were running from those openings with great force: even the entire man's body was already wasted, and his colour was yellowish.
Therefore, I inserted a probe into one of the openings, and the probe reached the bone.
Then I probed all the openings, and found them to reach each other from all parts of the leg.
I therefore hastened and cut over one of those openings, until I exposed a part of the bone: and I found it corrupted: which was already gnawed, and blackened, and rotten, and perforated, until it had penetrated to the marrow.
I therefore cut what was revealed to me, and prepared it from the corrupted bone.
And I judged that there was in the bone only that corruption which I had cut away and sawn. And I had already eradicated it.
Then I placed the restoration of the wound with consolidating medicines for a long time. And it was not consolidated.
Then I tried, and I discovered a second bone above the first discovery: and I found continuous corruption with the bone: and I sawn what appeared to me to be also from that corruption.
Then I attempted its restoration. And it was not restored.
Therefore, I again uncovered it, and did not cease to cut the bone piece by piece, and to attempt its restoration: and it was not restored, until I cut approximately one palm's breadth from the bone, and extracted it with its marrow.
Then I restored it with medicines, and it was quickly consolidated and healed: and this repetition in its operation and section was not necessary, except because of the disposition of the weakened patient, and his/her lack of tolerance, and my fear for him/her of death: since it happened to him/her at all hours from an excess of evacuative syncopes, which were bad.
Therefore, he/she was healed with complete healing: and hard flesh grew in the place of the bone, and a good disposition was established in his/her body, and his/her strength returned; and he/she was restored to his/her previous disposition; and no harm was done to him/her in walking at all.
If, however, a prominent bone in the body has already been fractured, then it is necessary to saw it, according to this method: and it is that you should take a ligature, and tighten it at the extremity of the prominent bone; and instruct someone to raise it upward; and place another thicker wool ligature over the first ligature. Then tie it over the flesh which is under the bone; and extend its extremity, so as to draw the flesh downward; and you uncover the flesh over the place you wish to saw, so that the saw does not injure the flesh.
Place wood, or a plank, underneath the bone below properly, because when you do this, it does not prevent the sawing of the corrupted flesh.
And it is necessary that the sawing be over the corrupted place a little, so that there is no corruption in the concavity of the bone; and it does not appear in its appearance to the senses, and compel sawing of another place.
If the bone is corrupted, and not prominent, but rather its part continues with another part; and the corruption is in its middle, or in a part of it: then uncover the flesh from all sides entirely. Then place wood below.
Afterwards saw it from the first side, where the corruption is, until the sawing continues on the other side; and let the sawing be along the length from the corruption a little, as we have said.
If the corruption is in the joint, cut the corrupted joint itself, and saw the bone where it continues on the other side.
If, however, the corruption is in the continuation of two joints, then there is no remedy in it except abrasion.
If the corruption is in the comb of the hand, or in the comb of the foot, then the matter is very difficult in it. But you must investigate how the corruption appears to you. And abrade it, and cleanse it according to whatever arrangement is possible for you, and with whatever remedy is rectified for you: when it does not cause you opposition from the vein or nerve.
And know that there are many incisions and saws for cutting these bones, according to the position of the bones, and their preparation, and their thickness and thinness, and their size and smallness, and their hardness and their rarity. Therefore, it is necessary to prepare an instrument suitable for that operation for every type of operation.
And know that these operations show you the type of instrument you need when you have prolonged study with you. And knowledge of the methods of this art is a witness to the methods of illnesses: for then you will already find for yourself that which is appropriate for it from instruments for every ailment.
And I am establishing for you at the end of this chapter the number of instruments, which you will set as examples upon which you will make incisions, and the test by which you will experiment upon others.
Shape of another saw.
Shape of the joints of a razor. Let the head of this razor be, according to the shape of the head of a star-shaped nail, and its points be according to the shape of the points of an elischetfegi.
And it does not agree, unless the heads of the joints are rubbed with it, when they are corrupted, or the bone is large and great.
Shape of the larger razor.
Shape of the broad razor.
Shape of the razor in which there is a concavity.
Shape of the other, slender razor.
Shape of the other razor with a curved end.
Shape of a small, slender, taut razor.
This is similar to a saw, and its end is like a saw; it is shown in many places from the reason of bones.
Shape of the razor suitable for the scraping of that which is perforated from the bones.
Its end is triangular, with sharp edges.
It is made of Indian (metal). And similarly, it is necessary that all that we have said be made of razors, and knives, and saws.
Concerning the incision of extremities, and the sawing of bones.
Extremities putrefy, either from an external cause, or an internal one.
Therefore, when you have treated that corruption with medicinal remedies, and the treatment does not help; and you see the corruption spreading in the limb, to which nothing responds; then it is necessary to cut that limb as far as the corruption extends, so that the afflicted person escapes death, or a greater harm which is from the lack of the limb.
And a sign that this occurs is that the limb darkens until it stinks; that fire has burned it, or it rots after darkening; until that rot is cut away down to the healthy part of the limb, and spreads to the whole body.
Therefore, act quickly with its incision, and similarly if the cause of the corruption is from the sting of some venomous creatures, such as a sea scorpion, a viper, a rattlesnake, and similar ones.
If therefore the corruption, or the injury, is in the extremity of the finger, then cut off the finger, and do not give space to the corruption, so that it advances to the rest of the hand.
And similarly if it happens in the hand, then cut it off from the root of the forearm, and do not give space to the corruption, until it takes hold in the forearm.
And if it invades it, then cut off the arm at the elbow in its joint.
If however the corruption passes, and you see it approximately at the elbow, then in that is the death of the weak one. And to administer beyond that from the cure, is a measure of virtue.
And similarly do with the foot, when corruption invades the toe, then cut it off at one of the joints; and if it takes hold in the arch of the foot, then cut off the entire foot. If however it ascends to the knee, then cut off the leg at the knee joint.
If however the corruption has already reached above the knee, then there is no skill in it, except dismissal, and leaving the sick person to death.
And the method of cutting or sawing off a limb is such that you should tighten the ligament below which you want to cut, and tighten another ligament above the place. And let the attendant extend one ligament downward, and let the attendant extend the other ligament upward. And you should separate the flesh which is between the two ligaments, with a broad spatula, until the entire flesh is exposed. Then it should be cut or sawed.
And it is necessary that you place linen cloths on all sides, and that the saw does not touch a healthy part; and that the infirm person suffers additional injury, and a hot abscess.
If, however, internal bleeding occurs during your work, then cauterize the place quickly, or place some powders that stop the bleeding upon it. Then return to your medication, until it is completed.
Then bind the wounded limb with a suitable bandage, and treat it until it is healed.
And I tell you what happened to a man in his foot, this same accident that I am telling you.
Because it happened in his foot a blackness, with a burning similar to the combustion of fire: and that corruption first happened in his toe, until it began the entire foot.
Therefore the man hastened himself, after seeing the corruption fall upon the limb with its vehemence, which he found from its pain and burning: and it struck him at the joint, and he was healed.
And after a long time passed, that same corruption happened to him in the index finger of his hand.
Therefore he came to me, and I tried to remove that excess with what I put on his hand from medicines after the cleansing of his body: and the excess was not repelled, and it began to proceed to another finger, until the corruption began in his hand.
Therefore he called me to cut his hand: and I did not want that, hoping from me about the repulsion of that excess: and I also feared for him at the cutting of his hand death. Because the man's strength was over the case.
After he therefore despaired of me, he returned to his land: and it came to me about him, that he hastened, and cut his whole hand: and he was healed.
And I have not brought this account, unless that it may be a help concerning that which falls from the genus of this sickness: and that it may be a sign by which it may be signified, and according to which it may be done.
Concerning the treatment of Sinuses, and the quality of enemas with medicines.
When an abscess occurs in certain fleshy members, and the space of the abscess prolongs itself until it collects pus: then it breaks open, or is pierced, and that which is in it of pus emerges, and a hollow space remains, as if it were a vessel; and the skin which is above it is like a cloth which has already been thinned out; and it does not reach the ultimate stage in its corruption, nor does it impinge upon the mouth, nor the nerve, nor the ligament: it deserves to be called a Sinus; and it is not called a Fistula: however, if its space is prolonged, until the corruption impinges upon any of these members, then it is called a Fistula, or a zuken.
And its treatment is to cut away that entire skin, as it is rolled up; and especially when it has been thinned out, and made like a cloth; and you are confident that it does not adhere to the place, because of its corruption.
However, if you hope that the skin adheres, and that corruption does not result from that ultimate consequence; and if there is a thickness of flesh in the skin, then treat it with an enema; and it is, that you should consider the Sinus.
If it is large, and the pus that is emitted from it has a foul odor, then enema it with Egyptian medicine, which is vinegar, and oil, and ziniar, taking equal parts, and combining them in a vessel; and they should be boiled over the fire until the medicine turns red; and it comes to the consistency of honey.
Then take from it what you need; and dissolve it with water and honey, and enema the Sinus with it; and constrict its orifice, and leave the medicine in it for a quantity of two hours.
Then draw it out with pressure; do that for so many days, until the Sinus is cleansed, and the foul odor is removed.
And sometimes it is enemated with ashes water, when this medicine is not present to you; and it is, that you should take ashes of vine wood, or ashes from holly wood, and pour water over it. Then strain it, and enema with it, until you are confident that the Sinus is now cleansed.
If the sick person does not tolerate the Egyptian medicine, nor the water of ashes, then enema him with water and honey, to which some crushed ziniar has already been mixed. Or enema him with mixed honey and wine, since the property of honey is to cleanse and wash away; and wine causes the Sinus to adhere, especially when there is an excess of astringency and dryness in the wine.
When you have done this several times, and are confident that the corruption of the Sinus is now removed, then enema him with that which causes flesh to grow in it.
And it is that you take from the diafinicon plaster, and dissolve it with rose oil and astringent wine; or enema him with some medicines and other ointments, whose properties I have written in the treatise on ointments.
If the opening of the Sinus is narrow, into which the enema cannula does not fit, then widen it a little with iron, or place in it a linen cloth wrapped in Egyptian ointment, or in Basil ointment, until it is widened.
And similarly, if the opening is also wide, then bring together its lips with sutures, and leave in it a quantity into which the enema will enter without addition.
And similarly, if the opening from which pus runs is elevated upwards, then cut it in the lower place within it, so that pus runs from it downwards; because pus, when constricted in the depth of the Sinus, prevents flesh from growing there.
If it is not possible for you to cut the sinus roughly below it as you wish, then try to prepare the limb in such a way that pus runs from it easily according to how it is prepared for you. Try to prevent any pus from being retained there at all, and take consolidating medicines that are placed on a mark, appropriate to what you wish. And spread them over a linen cloth. And let the cloth be of such a size that it covers the entire sinus. Then, with scissors, cut a hole directly over the opening of the sinus, slightly larger than the sinus opening. Then spread some mild ointments onto another cloth, according to the size of the hole, and place it over that in a position slightly distant from the sinus opening, so that the pus from it may be alleviated; and do not remove the large cloth, unless after a few days, at one time.
However, the one over the sinus opening is the one you remove every hour, so that what accumulates in it of pus may come out; and so that you may know whether the matter flowing from it, the virus, is much or little; or digested or undigested.
And with this, again consider the location of the sinus itself, whether its master feels pain there, or if there is no pain there, and whether there is an abscess there, or if there is not an abscess there.
Therefore, when your treatment proceeds thus, and you see the matter that emerges from the sinus opening, then know that the sinus is now adhering, or approaching adherence; then, therefore, loosen it in the morning, or on the third day; and when you loosen the wound, then change the cloth and renew the ointment.
However, if a thin virus emerges from the sinus after a long period, then do not despair of its adherence, for its healing is approaching, since among people are those who delay the generation of flesh in their wounds, and among them are those who act contrary to that.
If, however, undigested pus emerges from the sinus after many days, then know that the sinus does not adhere.
If, therefore, the adherence of the sinus is delayed and its matter prolonged, then add in the drying of the medicines, but let the physicians arrange that the medicines are humid in their substance and dry in their virtue, like the unguentum dyafinicon, when superfluous addition of zegi is added to it.
And from the most ultimate of its cures is that you take the unguentum dyafinicon, and let it be dissolved with rose oil, and let ancient wine be sprinkled over it equal in its substance.
Then mix it with that, and use it.
And it does a similar action to this, when the unguentum dyafinicon is not present for you, honey, when you boil it until it thickens, and use it. Or take myrrh, and aloes, and frankincense: grind the whole, and powder it over honey while it is over the fire. Then line a cloth over it, and bind it over the sinus; and line it with the honey which you boiled until it thickened; and powder spices over it, and place it over the cloth, and bind it.
And sometimes long aristolochia, and the roots of the celestial lily, and the lily, and herb flour, and centaury are administered in it. Use them, simple or combined, grind them, and sieve them: and powder them over the honey which I have described, and use it.
If the sinus condition is prolonged and not cured by this treatment, then know that there is corruption deep within it: or it is already making an impression on the bones, or on the other hard members or ligaments; then treat it by the treatment for fistulas, as previously described.
Concerning the treatment of whitlow, and of a worn-out nail, and of a superimposed finger, and of a section.
A whitlow is an abscess that arises under the nail of the thumb of the hand, or of the foot; and perhaps it arises on the other fingers.
When therefore its condition is prolonged, and its treatment is neglected, and it becomes an abscess with a hot abscess: or it becomes corrupted and emits pus, until it corrodes the root of the nail; and perhaps it corrupts the whole of it, and perhaps the corruption reaches the bone, until it has a foul odor; and the end of the finger becomes wide, and its color becomes dark.
When therefore you treat it, with what we have said in the division, and your treatment does not help, then it is necessary that you cut with iron the entire excess that remains of the nail. Then cauterize the wound after that. For cautery is very helpful.
If however the bone is healthy, and the nail also is healthy, and the superfluous parts of the nail are now pressing the flesh inwards, and begin to prick it and injure it, then it is necessary that you place a thin reed under the angle of the nail which pricks the flesh, and drive it upwards; and cut the flesh with ease, and place on that which remains of the flesh burning, corrosive medicines, until the whole of it is removed. Then treat it with ointments until it is healed.
If however the corruption has already penetrated the bone, then it is necessary to cut the bone and extract it; for it will never be healed while the corrupt bone remains in it.
If you see corrosion and corruption proceeding into the finger, then cut it at one of its joints, according to its previous description. Then treat it until it is healed.
If, however, there is a rubbing or striking of the nail, and a severe pain occurs in it, then it is necessary to first bleed the sick person. Then cut the nail with a sharp spatulum in a transverse section from above.
And beware that the cut does not reach the flesh beneath the nail, for you will cause severe pain to the sick person by that, and it will be a cause for the birth of additional flesh in that place.
Then treat the place with what soothes the pain.
However, the extra finger that arises in some people's hands is perhaps entirely fleshy; and perhaps some have bone in them, and perhaps there is a nail on it; and some arise at the root of the joint, or its origin is in some nodes of the finger. Therefore, the one that arises in some nodes of the finger does not move; and the one that arises near the joint of the finger perhaps does move.
Therefore, the one that is fleshy among them, its incision is easy. That is, cut it at its root with a broad spatula.
However, the treatment of the one whose origin is at the root of the joint is difficult. Therefore, abstain from its incision.
However, in that which arises in the finger at the last knot, then you must first cut its flesh in a round incision, all the way to the bone. Then saw the bone with one of those saws suitable for it. Then treat it until it heals.
And the consolidation that occurs between fingers often happens either from the man's birth, that is, it is born with him, or from a wound's consolidation, or from burning by fire, and similar things.
Therefore, you must separate that consolidation until the fingers return to their natural form. Then place between them strips, or cloths soaked in rose oil, so that they do not become quickly consolidated, and separate them; or place a thin sheet of lead between them, until the place has been consolidated as it ought to be.
And similarly, if consolidation occurs between certain fingers and the palm, then cut that consolidation, according to what is prepared and suitable for the member's shape.
About the incision of a defect.
Ulcers are veins wrapped, thick, full of melancholic superfluities that occur in many body members; and their effects are most frequent in the legs, especially in the legs of those who travel, work, and carry burdens.
Therefore, it is necessary to administer a shaking of the body from black cholera sometimes with strong shaking.
Then phlebotomize the patient's basilica vein.
However, their treatment with iron, is according to two methods. One of them is that they be cut, and the black blood be drawn out. And the other method is that the vein be lifted, and the whole thing be drawn out.
However, the incision of it is according to this method. First, soak the leg in a great deal of hot water until the thick, foul blood is dissolved. Then, bind the sick person's leg from the upper part of their thigh down to the lower part of their knee with a bandage. Then cut the vein in one, or two, or three places with a wide incision.
Then raise, that is, draw the blood in your hand from the lower part of the leg up to the top, and the physician must first do this on the sick person. Then cut the nail down to the bottom, until an amount of blood sufficient and which the sick person's strength can tolerate is released.
Afterwards, tie it [the wound]; and order him to abstain from foods that generate black bile; and repeat the evacuation and bloodletting, when the veins are full and it harms the sick person.
Its raising, however, is in this way. Shave the leg of the sick person if it has many hairs on it. Then immerse him in a bath; or apply a warm water embrocation to his leg, until it reddens and the veins swell; or, if a bath is not available, have him exercise vigorously, until the limb is heated.
Then cut the skin in a straight line along the vein: either at its end near the knee, or at its lower part near the heel.
Then open the skin with hooks, and scrape the vein from all sides until it is apparent to the senses: and its appearance is that you see it, inclining from red to black. When it therefore emerges from the skin, you see it white, as if it were a string.
Then introduce a probe beneath it, until, when it is lifted and emerges from the skin, suspend it with a gentle, blunt hook.
Then cut another section near that section by three fingers' breadth. Then scrape the skin from the upper part of the vein until it appears. Then lift it with the probes, as you did, and suspend it with another hook, as you did at first.
Then cut another section, or several sections, if you need them. Then lift, and cut it at the very last section near the heel.
Then pull it out to the section that is above it.
And do that until you pull it out from the section that is above, or higher than all the sections, until when it emerges whole: then cut it.
If however it does not obey you in pulling and lifting it: then insert an awl with strong thread doubled, and tie it, and pull it out; or insert a rod beneath it; and revolve your hand in every direction until it emerges. And be careful not to cut it. For if it is cut, it becomes difficult for you to lift it greatly, and harm enters upon the weak from it.
When therefore you have pulled it out whole: then place upon the wound site wool soaked in wine and rose oil, or oil; and care for it until it is healed.
If the vine is contracted, having a twisting to which there is wrapping to the sides, and it is not as we have said in terms of straightness, then it is necessary to cut along it in every direction of its twist and its points of wrapping.
Then suspend it with hooks, until you have lifted it all: and be careful at your incision upon it not to cut a vein, or wound it: for it will become difficult for you to lift or extract it. Therefore preserve your prudence.
Shape of the incident by which the vine is healed.
Shape of the blind hook.
It does not have a curvature like the other hooks, nor is it sharp at the end so as not to injure a vein: and it is of a thick, gentle flexure, because if it were thin, it would cut a vein with its thinness: indeed, let its thickness be superfluous, as we said.
Of the extraction of the vein of the leg.
This vein is generated in the legs in hot lands, such as Al-Jazirah and the land of the Arabs, and in arid, hot lands, few in tenderness, that is, in which neither grass nor tree grows.
And perhaps it is generated in other parts of the body besides the legs.
And indeed its generation is from the putrefaction which occurs beneath the skin, just as serpents and ascarid worms and worms generated between the skin and flesh occur.
And a sign of the beginning of this vein's occurrence is that a violent inflammation occurs in the leg. Then the place becomes blistered. Then the vein begins to emerge from the place of that blistering, as if it were the root of a plant or an animal.
Therefore, when its extremity appears from it, then it is necessary to wrap a piece of lead, weighing from one drachma keil to two drachmae, around it and tie it, and leave the lead hanging from the leg.
Whenever anything emerges from it to the outside, wrap it in lead and tie it. If it extends a long way, then cut part of it and wrap the remainder. And do not cut it at the root before the whole of it emerges. For if you cut it, it retracts and enters the flesh, and causes an abscess and putrefaction in the place, and a bad ulcer.
Therefore, it must be gently handled and pulled out gradually until it emerges from its outermost part and nothing remains of it in the body; and from this vein indeed, in some men, there emerges what is five palms and ten in its length. And it has now come to my attention that it emerged from a man at twenty palms.
However, if it is incised in the time of your medication, then insert a probe into its opening, and pierce it with a long probe, along with the body, until all that is in it of matter is evacuated; and treat the putrefaction of the place with medicines for several days. Then treat it with the treatment for abscesses.
And this vein sometimes has many branches, especially when it appears in the joint of the foot, or in the foot itself; and many openings occur to it, and a branch emerges from each opening.
Therefore treat it, as we said in the division, and with what has been stated before.
Concerning the incision on worms generated under the skin, and it is called the Cattle Disease.
This ailment is called in a certain land among us the Cattle Disease; because it often happens to oxen, and is a small single worm that is born between the skin and flesh.
And it goes throughout the body, ascending and descending; and it is shown to the senses by its movement from limb to limb, until it breaks wherever it breaks through the skin, and emerges.
And its generation is from the putrefaction of certain humours. As happen worms and snakes, that is, roundworms, and threadworms in the belly.
And it is feared because of its malice. Because when it moves within the body, and rises to the head, and reaches a place, then perhaps it bursts there, and emerges, and destroys the eye; and that happens many times.
Therefore, when you wish to cure it, and extract it, then it is not done except at its movement and its appearance to the senses.
Therefore, it is necessary to bind that which is above it and that which is below it with a strong binding ligature. Then cut above it, and extract it.
If it has sunk into the flesh, and you do not find it, then place a cautery with fire over the place, until it dies.
And the greater fear is its corruption, by which it corrupts the eye, as we have said.
If however you see it already having reached the head near the eye, then bind beneath it the eyebrow with a good ligature. Then cut above it, and extract it.
And it is necessary for the sick person to use cleansing of their body, with medicines that dissolve the bad putrid humours.
And let him beware of foods that generate putrefaction.
Concerning the incision above the illness of Nakir.
This illness is called Nakir in our land: and it is a pain that occurs in certain limbs, then changes from limb to limb.
And I myself have indeed seen it, as I tell you. I was summoned to a woman ill in certain villages. And she exposed her arm, and I saw a small swelling in the vein of the arm's cord.
And after I remained an hour, I saw one swelling move with the pulse, like a worm moves, ascending to her shoulder more quickly than it can be: so that it is like quicksilver when it runs from place to place.
Therefore, the pain receded from that place, and it settled in the shoulder.
Then I sat for an hour, and it ran to the rest of the body, until it reached the other arm.
Then she told me that it circulated throughout her whole body, according to what I saw.
Therefore, I marvelled at the speed of its change from limb to limb. And indeed, I had not previously seen this illness with my own eyes in such a way. However, I have seen many who find pain shifting from limb to limb; and I have not seen it in this way with my own eyes, as I saw it in the woman.
And I do not think it is anything but because the woman was one of those whose dry bodies have detected veins; hence, that windy movement appears to the senses.
And it is necessary that they not appear in this way in those who are delicate, and with moist bodies, and hidden veins.
When therefore you wish to treat it, and the patient feels the pain there: then if it is apparent to your eye, as we said, then tighten above it, and below it quickly; and cut above it, until that constricted windiness emerges; and cauterize the place.
If, however, you do not see it with your own eyes, then treat it with shaking of the body, and with that which expels winds, and calms them with foul pills, and pills of serpent, and similar things.
On the extraction of Arrows.
Arrows are diversified according to their kinds, and according to the places in which they strike the body.
Their diversity is indeed, because among them are those which have large points, and small: and concave, and blunt. And among them are those which have three angles. And among them are those with tongues. And among them are those with stars.
Those, however, which are according to the members on which they fall, are according to two ways. For either the members are from the principal concave members, such as the brain, and heart, and liver, and lungs, and kidneys, and intestines, and bladder, and things like them. Therefore, when it falls into any of these members, and signs of death appear to you, which I tell you later, then you must avoid the extraction of that arrow from them, for death follows it in whomever it is, in many dispositions. And when these bad signs do not appear to you, and the arrow is not hidden deep within the member, then extract it, and treat the wound.
For the signs of the brain when an arrow falls into it, and pierces the bone, and emerges through the covering above the brain, are: because there happen from it violent headache, and scotoma, and dizziness, and redness in the eyes, and swelling, and redness of the tongue, and spasm, and confusion of the intellect, and vomiting of cholera. And perhaps blood emerges from the nostrils, or ears. And perhaps speech is cut off, and the voice is destroyed. And white moisture like gruel emerges from the place of the wound. And from it emerges something like the watery part of flesh.
If therefore these signs appear to you, then abstain from treatment, and remove the arrow if it does not emerge.
The signs of an arrow striking the heart are: that it is near the left breast; and that one feels as if it were fixed in a hard thing, not in an empty thing. And perhaps the arrow's movement is similar to the pulse's movement: and black blood runs from the wound. And that is followed by coldness of the extremities, and cold sweat, and fainting. Know therefore, that death descends undoubtedly.
And a sign of an arrow wounding the lung is the exit of frothy blood from the wound: and the vessels which follow the neck fester, and the sick person's color changes. And he breathes out a large, deep breath: and seeks the attraction of cold air.
If an arrow strikes the membrane, which is in the chest: then it is near the small ribs: and there is a large gasping with intense pain, with a sigh: and all the arm members move.
And if an arrow strikes the stomach, then perhaps something undigested food exits from the wound.
And if an arrow strikes the belly, and is fixed in it: something of excrement, or zirb, or intestine that is already ruptured, exits from the wound. Therefore, there is no hope in its treatment, nor in extracting the arrow.
If an arrow strikes the bladder, and urine exits: and something proceeds from it to the exterior, and the pain is stronger than the weakness: then know that it is fatal.
However, the remaining members, such as the face, and neck, and throat, and shoulder blade, and the arm, and the vertebrae of the back, and the collarbone, and the hip, and the leg, and similar members are saved according to various conditions, when the arrow does not strike an artery, or a nerve, and the arrow is not poisoned.
And I tell you what I have seen of the nature of these arrows, so that you may signify through it upon your treatment.
Because an arrow struck a man in the tear duct of his eye, at the root of his nose. Therefore, I extracted it from the other side, under the fat of his ear; and he was healed, and no harm came to his eye.
And I extracted another arrow from a Jew, which struck him in the fat of his eye under the lower eyelid; and the arrow was already hidden, and I obtained from it only a small tip, with which it adheres to its shaft; and it was a large arrow from the bows of the Turks, with soft iron, in which there are no ears.
Therefore, the Jew was healed, and no bad accident happened to his eye.
And I extracted another arrow from the throat of a Christian.
And it was an Arabic arrow, and it is the one which has ears. Therefore, I cut above it between the two guides: and it was already submerged in his throat. Therefore, I worked with it, until I extracted it: and the Christian was healed.
And I extracted another arrow from the man which had fallen into his belly: and we thought that he would die from it.
Therefore, after thirty days had passed, and nothing of his conditions had changed upon him, I cut above the arrow: and I worked upon it, and I extracted it: and he was healed, and no bad accident happened to him.
And I saw a man on whom an arrow fell on his back, and the wound on it was healed. Therefore, after seven years, an arrow exited at the root of his hip.
And I saw a woman on whom an arrow fell into her belly, and the wound on it was healed, and the arrow remained inside her: and no change was made in any of her conditions, and the woman did not find any harm to her in any of her natural operations.
And I saw another man, on whose face an arrow fell: and the wound was healed, and it remained, causing him not much pain: and many similar to these.
And I extracted an arrow from the king's chief men, which had fallen into the middle of his nose, and had already deviated slightly to the right side: and the entire arrow was hidden.
Therefore, I was summoned for his treatment after the arrow's fall up to three days. Therefore, I found the arrow wound to be very tight.
Therefore, I searched for it with a fine probe, and did not feel it: and indeed he found a prick and pain under his right ear. Therefore, I hoped that that prick was from the tip of the arrow.
Therefore, I plastered the area with a plaster in which there was attracting and digestive virtue, trusting in myself that the area would become an abscess, and that I would see a sign of the arrow, so that I could cut over it: and there was no sign in the place indicating that the arrow had reached the place.
Therefore, I applied the plaster to him for many days: and no sign appeared, and the wound healed meanwhile: and he remained weak from the extraction of it for many days, until he felt the arrow one day inside his nose. And he told me that.
And he told me that. Therefore, I applied a sharp, corrosive medicine to that wound for many days, until it opened: and when I probed it, I felt a thin arrowhead adhering to the wood.
Then I continued to apply the sharp medicine to the wound opening, until the arrowhead became visibly apparent: and approximately four months passed with him during this time.
Then, after the wound had enlarged, and I was able to insert forceps into it and move it, and it did not yield to extraction, I did not cease to refine and devise methods concerning it, until one day I used forceps properly made, as will be shown in the form of them at the end of the chapter, until I extracted it. Then I restored the wound.
And indeed, physicians judge that the cartilage of the nose is not restored. Therefore I restored it, and the wound was consolidated, and the infirm was healed with complete health; and nothing at all harmed him.
And I narrate to you the quality of the extraction of certain arrows, so that you may posit it as a rule and significance over that which I have not said.
Because the parts of this art and their distinctions are not comprehended with the narration; nor does the book comprehend it, and a skillful craftsman compares little things to great things; and with that which is present, to that which is absent; and finds a new operation and a new instrument in the descent of foreign things of this art when they occur.
I say, therefore, that arrows do not emerge from the members on which they are fixed, except in two ways. Or by traction from the place from which it entered. Or by the contrary of another part.
And that which emerges from where it entered is either an arrow proceeding in a fleshy place, and is drawn out, and emerges.
If it does not yield to exit at the hour in which it falls, then it is necessary to leave it for some days, until the flesh that is around it rots, and its traction is eased, and its exit.
And similarly if it is fixed in the bone, and does not yield to you for exit, then leave it also for some days, and repeatedly apply traction and motion every day, until it emerges.
If it does not yield to you for exit after days, then it is necessary to pierce around the arrow in the bone itself from every side with a fine drill, until the arrow's surrounding material is enlarged. Then pull it, and extract it.
If, however, the arrow is already hidden in a place of the body, and is concealed and hidden from sight, then search for it with probes. If you feel it, then pull it out with certain instruments that are suitable for its removal.
If, however, you cannot remove it because of the constriction of the wound, and because of the arrow's length deep inside, and there is no bone, nor nerve, nor vein there, then cut around it until the wound is widened, and it is possible to remove the arrow.
If it has ears by which it is held, then free the flesh fixed to them from every side, by every method you can; and if that method is not sufficient to free the flesh from the breaking or twisting of the ears, continue until it escapes.
And when you perform the removal of the arrow, wherever it is, then use the twisting of your hand, with forceps on all sides, until you make it escape; and with the utmost delicacy, so that the arrow is not broken, and its extraction becomes difficult for you.
If you cannot remove it within one hour, then leave it for several days until those surrounding it rot. Then try again: for it will then be easier.  But if a flow of blood opposes you, then administer what we have said about its treatment in its chapter; and guard your skill from incision of a vein, or nerve, or tendon.
And employ every method possible for the arrow's escape; and let it be with ease and tranquility, or slowness and firmness, as I have told you.
And it is necessary, when you pull out the arrow, that it be weak in accordance with the shape in which the arrow was lodged. Because it is more helpful. If however it is not possible for you, then administer what is possible to you from the figures.
However, if an arrow exits from the opposite side, either something is already protruding from it outwards, or the arrowhead causes a swelling on the skin near the upper part, and you see it protruding; therefore cut over it, and let the incision be according to the amount that the forceps can grasp.
Then pull it out; for it becomes easy to remove.
If however it is retained in the bone, then twist your hand according to the roundness, until the arrow strikes the bone, and enlarges itself; then pull it.
And if not, leave it for a few days; then try it again, until it comes out.
If the arrow's shaft is in it, then push it out with it.
If however the shaft has fallen away, and you wish to administer a push, then insert a concave instrument into it, so that its concavity enters the arrow's tail; then push it out with it.
If however the arrow is concave, then push it out with an instrument entering it. For the arrow is relieved by it.
If the arrow is poisoned, then it is necessary to cauterize all the flesh in which the poison is, if it is possible for you. Then treat it with whatever is appropriate for it.
If the arrow is lodged in the chest, or in the belly, or in the bladder, or in the side; and it is close enough to what you touch with probes, and it is possible for you to cut above it, then cut, and be careful not to cut a vein or a nerve, and pull it out.
Then stitch the wound, if you see fit, and treat it until it is healed.
And this is the form of the forceps with which arrows are extracted.
Let the extremities be similar to the beak of a bird, made of iron: when they grasp the arrow, they do not release it.
And many forms of them are made, large, small, and medium, according to the quantity of the arrow's size, and its smallness, and the width of the wound, and its constriction.
The shape of the pushing concave one.
And the shape of the pushing deaf one.
This is the deaf extremity, like a ray, so that its entrance into the concave arrow may be eased, and it may be propelled with it.
Concerning the phlebotomy of veins.
The veins to be bled, whose use runs through the body, are thirty.
Of these, sixteen are in the head: two pulsating veins, which are behind the ears, called the two Herbs; and two arteries, which are visible on the two temples; and two veins that are at the two tear ducts of the two eyes, which are called the Looking ones; and a prepared vein in the middle of the forehead; and a vein that is at the end of the nose. And two Guidegi, which are in the neck. And two veins which are in the upper lip of the mouth. And two veins which are in the lower lip. And these are the veins called Algecherich. And two veins which are under the tongue.
The veins, however, which are opened in the arms, are five veins in each arm.
One of them is the Cephalica, and it is from the wild side: and the common people call it the vein of the head. And the Fusca. And it is the Middle vein, and it is composed of a branch of the Basilica, and a branch of the Cephalica: and the common people call it the vein of the body. And the Basilica, and it is situated on the domestic side: and it is also called the Titillicaris. And the common people call it the vein of the belly. And the Cord of the arm, and it is situated above the fossa: and it is that in which bloodletting is performed, and it is that which appears above the thumb by clear appearance.
And the Saluatella: and it is the vein that is between the ring finger and the little finger: and it has two branches.
And in the leg and in the foot there are three veins. One of them is that which is under the curve of the big toe on the wild side. And the second is the Saphena: and its place is at the heel on the domestic side. And the vein Nesse: and its place is at the heel on the wild side.
And in the other leg there are three veins similar to those.
Concerning the phlebotomy of two veins behind the ears.
Phlebotomies of the two veins behind the ears are beneficial for old colds, and hemiplegia, and headaches, and old, bad head ulcers.
And the quality of the phlebotomy is as I describe. And it is done by shaving the patient's head, and rubbing the back of his head in the place of the two veins with a rough cloth, with a good friction. Then let the patient tighten his neck with a bandage until the two veins appear. And their locations are behind the ears in two depressed areas of the head. Therefore, seek them with your finger, and where you feel their pulse beneath your finger, mark those places with ink.
Then take a phlebotomous knife, and that is called the Incidens. Then insert it beneath the vein in the skin, until the phlebotomous reaches the opening. Then raise your hand with the vein and skin upward, and cut the vein with the skin with a sloping incision. And let the length of the incision be the amount of two joined fingers, or about that: and cause as much blood to issue as you wish.
Then bind it with bandages, and leave it until it heals.
And already previously in the beginning of the book was the incision of them, and the cauterization of them.
Phlebotomy of the two arteries located in the two temples is helpful in mitigating old hemiplegia, and in addressing crookedness, and persistent ophthalmia, and the excessive flow of acute, shed tears to the eyes.
And the quality of phlebotomizing them is according to what I tell you. Let the infirm person strain their neck much, until two veins become clearly visible to the senses, and their pulse is demonstrably felt under your finger. Then, mark the locations with ink.
Then, lift the skin above the vein upwards with your index finger, and insert the incision-making phlebotom, and lift the vein upwards. And cut it, as you did in the other two veins: and make blood flow according to your need.
Then loosen the infirm person's constriction, and place your finger upon the vein for one hour. Afterwards, place a bandage and pads upon it, and bind it tightly above the constriction: and release it, until it is healed.
And already the remembrance of them, and their incision, and their extraction have preceded at the beginning of the book.
Indeed, the benefit of phlebotomy of the frontal vein is after phlebotomy of the cephalic vein, for old facial illnesses: and for hemicrania, and redness: and foul ulcers.
And the quality of its phlebotomy is, according to what I tell you. The sick person tightens their neck with a bandage until the vein appears. Then take the instrument called Fossorium.
Place the prominent point that is on the head of the Fossorium over the vein itself, and strike upon it with a comb, or with something else in its manner: and allow the blood to run according to the quantity that you wish. Then loosen the wound of the sick person, and bind it until it is healed.
And sometimes it is opened with a wide phlebotome. However, it should not be a phlebotome with a sharp end, like the other phlebotomes, rather it should have a broad end. And phlebotomize it along the transverse direction, because the bone is close by: and perhaps the phlebotome will break in it when it is slender.
However, the relief of the two veins that are in the two tear ducts of the two eyes, is for an eye afflicted with scabies and redness; and for a scab on the eye, and ailments of the face.
And the quality of their phlebotomy is such that it tightens the weak neck with a bandage. Then phlebotomize them: and you be standing over his head.
And let the phlebotomy be made transverse to the length a little, with a small phlebotom, somewhat broad, for there is no flesh in the place. For if the phlebotom is of a delicate extremity, perhaps it is broken.
Then make the blood run out as much as is necessary for you. And place a bandage on them, and tie them for one night, and untie them.
Phlebotomy of the veins of the Nose is useful for acute fevers, and violent headaches, and diseases of the face, such as hemicrania, and redness that occurs in the face, especially when it is of long standing.
And the quality of its phlebotomy is such that the weak man tightens his own neck. Then hold his nose with your left hand, and take a slender, long lancet, and place it in the middle of his nostril, between that which divides the nose according to its straightness. Since the vein is not apparent to the senses there, and because blood begins to flow immediately.
And it is necessary that you hold your hand with the lancet for a little while, and cause blood to flow according to your need. Then tie it with a single bandage. For it is quickly restored.
The benefit of the two phlebotomies of Guidegi is for constriction of breathing, and the onset of leprosy, and melancholic illnesses, and impetigo and bad ulcers, and those that corrode, that is, shingles.
And the quality of their phlebotomy is that the weak person is held by the two ligatures on his neck, and the craftsman stands over the head of the weak person, and the weak person sits on a seat.
Then the phlebotomist should open the vein to a width suitable for the phlebotomy for a short while. Then extract from the blood a moderate quantity, or according to that which you see from necessity for that. Then do likewise with the other vein.
Afterwards, loosen the ligature, and tie the two veins with a middle constriction, so that the weak person is not overly choked. And leave it until morning. For the wound heals.
On the phlebotomy of veins, Algeberich. The veins, according to Algeberich, are a help in phlebotomy: because they contribute to sores in the mouth, and gum corruption; and bad ulcers; and lip fissures, and bad ulcers, even those that are on the nose and its surroundings.
And the quality of phlebotomy of them is such that you make the infirm sit before you, and bind his neck with a strip. Then roll back his lip and look at the two veins: one of which is on the right of the lip and the second on its left; and the demonstration of both is by the blackness of both. And that is true, because around them are small, black veins. Therefore, cut each with a single incision.
If, however, there is doubt upon you, and you do not know which of them it is, then direct yourself to the incision of the larger of them, and the more evident of them.
And similarly do with the two veins that are on the upper lip; and indeed, most custom runs with it; and cut the two veins which are on the lower lip.
Concerning phlebotomy of the veins under the tongue after phlebotomy of the cephalic veins. However, the benefit of phlebotomy of the two veins which are under the tongue is that phlebotomy of the cephalic vein is for the suffocation which is in the throat, and the illness of the uvula, and the illnesses of the mouth.
And the quality of phlebotomizing them is that the sick person should sit between your hands in the presence of the sun; and lift his tongue, and look under his tongue on one side of it for a vein, and on the other side of it for a vein; and the color of each is sloping towards blackness.
Therefore, phlebotomize each one; and guard that you do not put your hand to the utmost in phlebotomizing them. For under it are arteries, and perhaps a flow of blood will occur from those arteries.
However, the three veins that are phlebotomized in the elbow are those whose phlebotomy has run in custom among all men.
And their phlebotomy is done according to two methods. Either by pricking with a broad myrtle phlebotome, or an olive-shaped one, to a degree of steepness, or by cutting with a knife phlebotome, and it is Alnesil. And this is its form.
And of them are broad and narrow types, according to the width and constriction of the veins.  The shape of the myrtle phlebotome should be broad, as you see. And it is suitable for opening concave, full, proceeding, apparent, large veins, and those containing thick, turbid blood.
And this phlebotome is of lesser width, and of a finer extremity.
And it is suitable for the phlebotomy of slender veins, which contain subtle, yellowish blood.
The Basilica vein, which is one of these three veins, is a help in phlebotomy. Because it draws blood from ailments of the throat and neck, from thence following the chest and belly; and it befits the phlebotomist, when phlebotomizing it, to be cautious and to be wary of it, for there is an artery beneath it. If therefore he errs, and adds to the puncture of the phlebotomy, he will strike that artery, and there will be an occurrence of blood flow. Therefore it is necessary that he not phlebotomize it with a phlebotomizing instrument; rather, he should cut with an Alnesil.
If, however, the Basilica vein does not appear clearly, then it is necessary to abandon it and to switch to another, or to seek a branch of it; or to phlebotomize the Brachial vein instead. For it is indeed manifest, and cut it with a phlebotomizing Anesil instrument, as we said.
If however you wish to phlebotomize the same vein, then it is necessary, before the constriction of the arm, that you touch the place, until you recognize the place of the pulse. Then mark the place with ink, afterward the arm, and cut the vein with a concave incision using the Alnesil instrument, as we said. And beware that the blow does not fall in the space from the place of the artery.
And when you see, when you constrict the ligament, an inflation in the place which you marked with ink, then that inflation is the inflation of the artery: therefore avoid it.
If you see blood at the phlebotomy leap, like the urine of a child, and it is thin blood, red: then know that it is from the blood of the artery. Then quickly, place your finger over it for a long space, then remove your finger. If therefore blood is cut off (for it is often cut off), then constrict the arm, and release it; and let the patient beware of its movement; and let it be upon his fear.
And let him not move it for several days, until it is healed.
If however the blood is not cut off, and overcomes you; and there is no medicine present for you in your moment, then cut the artery, if it appears to you. For its extremities contract, and blood is cut off.
Or take the bark of the fig tree, and split it; take one half, and tie it over the place of the vein with a proper constriction, with a bandage and lint until another day.
Then if the blood is cut off, it is good. And if not, then treat it with that whose recollection preceded from the place of powders cutting off the flow of blood; and the cutting off of its blood is not difficult in many dispositions, because of the small place of the wound, and the possibility of a bandage from the arm.
Phlebotomy of the Fusca vein is beneficial, because it draws blood from the upper part of the head and the lower part of the body; because it is composed of a branch of the Basilica vein and a branch of the Cephalica vein, as we have said.
And it befits the phlebotomist that it be above fear from its phlebotomy, for a nerve is beneath it. Therefore, if the phlebotomist adds in the puncture, and finds a nerve, numbness occurs in it, and its healing becomes difficult, and perhaps it is not healed completely.
And this nerve often appears to the senses. However, if it is hidden in some people, and is subtle and not shown, then it is necessary that you place your phlebotomy, so that you phlebotomize it, incision with a lancet, and avoid the nerve with your skill.
If the vein is between two nerves, then split the vein lengthwise.
Concerning the cephalic vein. Phlebotomy of the cephalic vein is beneficial, because it draws blood from the head, and contributes to eye ailments.
And it is necessary in this vein especially, if you wish, to phlebotomize it by pricking with an olive-wood lancet, or with a myrtle-wood lancet: because it is the safest of all veins, because there is no artery nor nerve beneath it.
However, it is fitting for you in phlebotomy to avoid with the lancet only the head of the muscle, and to seek a smoother place: and it does not harm it if it is not found with the first blow, so that it may be repeated over it with phlebotomy several times.
However, perhaps it becomes inflamed in some people when it is not phlebotomized on the first strike, but that inflammation does not harm them in any way.
Concerning the usefulness of Phlebotomy, and the precautions to be observed in it. However, the quality of Phlebotomy, and its consequent accidents, which you must consider in its correction.
First, you should know that phlebotomy is not administered except in the preservation of health, and its endurance, and caution against the onset of illnesses.
And so that phlebotomy is performed in one of the three veins that are in the elbow, namely the Cephalic, and the Basilic, and the Median cubital. And so that phlebotomy is performed in the beginning of Spring on an empty stomach, in Spring and Summer; and in Autumn and Winter after eating, when signs of fullness appear.
And let phlebotomy be performed on the first day, or on the third, after three hours have passed of the day.
However, phlebotomy administered in illnesses does not have a set hour; but when convenience and necessity call for it, at night, or day, and at all hours, and at all times.
And children should not be bled until they reach fourteen years of age. Nor should a pregnant woman be bled, except from the fourth to the seventh month. Nor should the elderly be bled, who have already passed sixty years.
Therefore, when someone wishes to be bled for whatever reason, it is necessary that they cleanse their bowels beforehand with a mild clyster, if there is much retained stool in them, so that the veins during the phlebotomy do not draw out putrid, harmful superfluities from the intestines to the principal members.
Nor should a patient be bled who is suffering from a surfeit, nausea, or drunkenness, until that has been removed from them. Nor should a sick person with dropsy.
And phlebotomy should be avoided again after colic, vomiting, diarrhea, excessive intercourse, labor, exercise, vigils, fasting, and anything that weakens the body's or animal's strength.
Then consider the subtlety of the humors before that, if the blood is thick with foods, drinks, and medicines, if it is possible to do so.
Then he should enter a bath, if nothing prevents him; or he should exercise with some exercise, so that the blood may be made thinner.
And place his phlebotomy on his chest, around the third day, as we said: and strive that his chest be emptied that day of all evil animal accidents: such as anguish, and anger, and fear; and of all bodily accidents, such as labor, and pain, and excess of intercourse, and similar things.
And let him have present in his seat things with whose use custom has run among men from aromatics, and scents, and dancing, and similar things in the greatest possible quantity.
Then let the phlebotomist sit on a cushion which is higher than the phlebotomist's cushion; afterwards let him pull his arm out and let the phlebotomist rub it with his hand twice or three times. Then tie the bandage with a strap, and wrap it twice.
And let the constriction be moderate, for when the constriction is unequal, or through excess in the constriction, then it hinders the course of blood; or in relaxation, then it also hinders the course of blood.
Then after the constriction, it is necessary that the phlebotomist rub his hands together until the veins swell and are made apparent to the senses.
Then let the phlebotomist wipe the phlebotomized area with a little old, proper oil.
Then let him place his left index finger slightly over the vein itself, beneath the place where he intends to make the phlebotomy, so that the vein does not move and the blow is not missed. Because there are veins that are like a fleeing string during phlebotomy; and there are those that are full of airiness; and when you place the phlebotom on it, it contracts under the phlebotom, and the phlebotomist is deceived, and the phlebotom does not open the vein; and if it does open it, it is constricted.  Therefore, it is necessary for the phlebotomist to be firm and careful in all these things.
Then he should lay down the phlebotom. If therefore the vein is opened at the first attempt, then it is good. And if not, then repeat it another time under that place slightly, or above it with haste, if the place is not inflamed.
If, however, it becomes inflamed, or the patient becomes weak, then leave him for a day or two, and do not tighten the ligature. For perhaps it will draw a hot abscess. Nor let him enter a bath.
Then repeat the bloodletting, if he wishes.
If the opening is small, or the blood flows subtly, and you fear that not the quantity of blood you desire will exit, then repeat the bloodletting in the same opening according to the straightness, and add a little in the operation.
And do it with haste, before the place is suppurated, for a suppurated place is in many people in a small operation.
If therefore you see it already suppurated, then do not repeat on it at all, for it does not excuse anything to you. And place something of the dregs of oil upon it, because it alleviates the flow of blood. And it is better in this place than the oil itself, and than the other oils.
And similarly administer the dregs of oil in all your phlebotomies, where phlebotomies open veins against the prohibition of blood flow: and the Tyriac alfarach, and sagzenea do this, when one of them is placed upon the place.
For blood is made thinner and resolved when it is thick.
If a large abscess occurs at the phlebotomy site, for it often happens, especially to one who is not a phlebotomist except on that occasion, or if the opening of the vein is small, then hurry and place a sponge soaked in water and salt, warmed a little, upon the place: and bind it for one hour: for it dissolves.
And it is necessary that you do this after the blood has exited the vein itself, when it is full, or from another vein.
If some blackness or greenness remains in the place after a few days, it does not harm: and if you wish, put some aloe, or dissolved myrrh, or some of the juice of mint, that is, of balm or similar to it, upon it.
And very often indeed abscesses and prominences occur at phlebotomy in the Basilica.
Therefore, place your hand upon it; then if you find softness upon compression with your hand upon it, then that prominence is bad. Therefore, beware that you put something upon it of that which we have said. For perhaps blood will flow from it of the artery.
But make a plaster on it with that in which there is astringency, so that the place may be hardened. Then treat it with the rest of the treatment, until it is healed.
And it is necessary that you extract from every man's blood according to the quantity of its virtue. And that which appears from the color prevailing over the blood.
For if the blood is black, then let it be allowed to exit until it turns red; and similarly, if you see it thick, then let it be allowed to exit until it becomes thin; and similarly, if it is sharp, until its sharpness is removed.
And it is necessary for one who is full, strong, and needs bloodletting at once, that the vein's phlebotomy be widened and the phlebotomist be broad; and in the one who is weak, be the opposite of that.
And it is necessary that he extract it in portions, and that the opening be narrow; and better what is administered in vein-letting is that it be a transverse incision, not a puncture.
And this method of bloodletting is safe from a flow of blood, and from the incision of a nerve; and it is more praiseworthy, and safer than bloodletting by width and length.
And to whom it is accustomed to come to fainting in bloodletting, it is necessary that he eat before bloodletting a little bread soaked in pomegranate-water; or secaniabin, if it is heated; and extract from his blood in three or four portions.
And if he is of a cold temperament, then let him take before bloodletting bread soaked in myrrh syrup, or in syrup of spiced honey, or in fragrant aromatic syrup.
If fainting occurs during bloodletting, and its cause is the abundant outflow of blood, then it is necessary that he take in a drink water of flesh, and a subtle fragrant syrup; and let him use aromatics with almug; and let his chest be lined with it; and let him use the rest that we have stated in the division in the chapter on fainting from evacuation.
Whoever wishes to evacuate his arm and release his blood a second time, it is necessary for him whose bloodletting is for a great evacuation, and whose strength is weak, that he release blood gradually by the amount of strength over consecutive days.
However, whoever wants to evacuate his arm and release his blood a second time, and his body is strong, then let him do it after seven or nine hours from his first bloodletting.
Whoever wishes to draw blood from his body to the opposite part to which it inclines, it is necessary that he be evacuated on the second or third day.
In whose body, however, is much blood already heated, and sharpened, and causes fever to occur: it is necessary that blood depart from it in one instance, and a large quantity be drawn from it; and the opening be enlarged until fainting occurs; after you have observed all the conditions of bloodletting; and that you place your hand upon his pulse at the flow of blood, so that death does not occur in place of fainting. For often that happens, when the bloodletter does not know, and negligence falls.
And it is not necessary, when you wish to release the arm and release blood a second time, when the opening of the vein is already closed and the exit of blood is difficult, that you press upon it with violence, and rapidly bend or extend it. For that is very harmful; indeed, leave it, until it is bled again.
Or remove with the sharpness of the bloodletter that which has clotted from the blood in the opening of the vein, and place upon it something of dissolved salt in water. And place upon it something of al-thiryac al-faruq or sagzenea, and place it with gentle compression, until the blood issues forth.
If however the vein is already ulcerated, then leave it, and do not touch it, until the ulcer subsides.
If, however, necessity provokes you to draw blood a second time, and there is no excuse, then either bleed him above that place or in another arm in another vein.
However, the arm's vein should be lanced at the place of the Cephalic and Basilic veins, when they are not found, and are hidden, because it is composed of them.
And the quality of the bloodletting is such that the infirm person should immerse his hand in warm water until the skin reddens, and the vein becomes clearly visible.
Then tie it above it with a ligature with a moderate constriction. Then lance it transversely, gradually, not laterally, nor longitudinally; and let the opening be wide, and your incision be over the joint of the hand for a short time.
If the flow of blood is impeded, then immerse the hand again in warm water and allow the blood to flow into the water until you achieve your desired result.
If, however, you are in the days of summer, then you are excused from the repetition of immersing the hand in warm water. And indeed, the flow of blood is placed most frequently in warm water in wintertime.
And the incision of this vein is safer than all veins, because there is no pulsating vein nor nerve beneath it.
Phlebotomy of the right hand's Saluatella vein is beneficial for liver ailments.
And the quality of its phlebotomy is such that you should constrict the mahason of the hand with a bandage, or with your hand, after you immerse it in warm water, until the vein swells and becomes very apparent to the senses. Then, incise it transversely. And if you cut it completely, it will not harm him in any way.
And be careful not to finish your hand with the lancet. For beneath it are the nerves of the fingers exposed from the flesh.
Then, return the hand to warm water, and let the blood run in it. For if you do not return it to warm water, the blood coagulates in the opening of the vein, and is prevented from flowing.
When therefore you have drawn out the necessary quantity of blood, then place oil and salt upon the vein: so that it does not quickly consolidate.
And similarly it is necessary that you do so with every tight branch.
The benefit of phlebotomy from the left hand, however, is: because it is beneficial for ailments of the spleen: and similarly do in its phlebotomy as you did in the second equally.
The benefit of saphenous phlebotomy is for illnesses that are in the lower part of the body, such as ailments of the womb, and the retention of menses, and illnesses of the kidneys, and old sores of the hips and legs, and similar illnesses.
And the quality of its phlebotomy is that the sick person should immerse their foot in warm water: and do friction upon it until the veins swell: and bind above the joint of the foot with a strap. And indeed the vein's location is at the heel, appearing toward the big toe: and from it branches out many branches on the face of the foot.
Therefore, phlebotomize it in its larger branch, or at the heel in its aggregation, because it is better and safer.
If you phlebotomize it on the foot's surface, then beware of the nerves that are under it on the surface of the foot.
And place your phlebotomy instrument so that you phlebotomize it across, as if you wish to cut it: and let the phlebotomist be Nesil.
If however the outflow of blood is prevented, then repeatedly place his foot in warm water, and allow the blood to flow into it, until it is evacuated.
If the phlebotomist errs in the first instance, then he should repeat the phlebotomy a little higher up, for the place is safe, and you do not fear harm from it, when you beware of the nerves, as we said.
And similarly with the saphena of the other foot equally.
The Sciatica vein's location, as we said, is near the heel on the wild side.
And the relief of phlebotomy is for it, for the pain of the knee, when it is due to hot blood.
And the quality of its phlebotomy is such that the patient should enter a warm bath, and hasten: and he should bind his leg from the side of the knee up to the heel by four fingers, with a long, thin bandage: for it does not appear except on account of that.
When it therefore appears, then the phlebotomist should cut it according to whatever skill is possible to you, or according to a transverse method; and it is better either to cut it with an incision, or to sever it by a section. For its location is safer, and it is very hidden in many people.
For its location is safer, and it is very hidden in many people. If, however, you do not find it, and it is not at all apparent to the senses, then the phlebotomist should cut some branch of it, and that is the one which appears on the back of the foot, and towards the ear; and beware of the nerves, and cause as much blood to flow as you wish.
Then loosen the bandage, and place leather over the phlebotomy site, and bind the area. For it quickly heals.
Concerning Cupping, and the quality of its use.
Cupping instruments are made from horns, and from brass, and from glass.
And cupping indeed is done according to two methods. With scarification, and the extraction of blood; and the other is cupping without scarification.
And this cupping which is without scarification, is according to two methods. Or indeed it is with fire. Or it is without fire.
And cuppings that are administered with scarification and the extraction of blood are fourteen places of the body. Of which one is the cupping Alnocrati, and it is at the back of the head; and Alkehel, and it is in the middle of the neck; and the cuppings Alhagdahim, and they are two flaps of the neck at both sides together; and the cuppings of the chin, and it is below the jaw in the lower part of the mouth; and the cuppings of the two shoulder blades; and the cuppings Alachosos above the end of the tail; and the cuppings of the two armpits, and they are in the middle of the two arms; and the cuppings of the two thighs; and the cuppings of the two calves.
And cupping indeed does not extract blood from the small veins scattered in the flesh, and because of that, virtue does not fall from them, as is the case with phlebotomy. Nor should cupping, whether with or without fire, be administered in any illness arising from fullness until the whole body has been evacuated.
If necessity prompts cupping for illness or because of custom, we administer it at any hour at the beginning of the month, at the end of it, in the middle of it, and whenever it may be.
This is because there are people in whom when blood multiplies within, until it needs extraction by cupping, they find heaviness and soreness in their head.
And some of them find fullness and redness in their face, head, and neck. And some of them find itching in their face and forehead, and darkness and dullness in their eyes.
And some of them scratch the site of their cupping. And some of them have increased laughter. And some of them find the taste of blood in their mouth; or the tongue becomes suppurated, and they spit blood. And some of them have increased sleep. And some of them see in their sleep blood and redness, and the slain, and wounds, and things similar to them.
Therefore, when we see any of these things, and especially if it is in the middle third of the month, we then order a letting of wind, after two or three hours have passed of the day.
The benefit of letting wind from the nape of the neck is: because it contributes to the heaviness in the head, and what is poured out to the eyes. However, it is necessary that it be after the evacuation of the whole body.
And this cupping is in place of a head-vein incision.
And it is not permitted to use it on one of cold temperament, or in whom there is a cold. For it brings him great harm.
And therefore it is not appropriate that the aged, and those with cold ailments on their heads, use it.
But if one is continuously on top of it, forgetfulness is generated in him.
And therefore it is necessary to order the wind-dresser to lay his hand for a little while lower with the wind, fearing the generation of forgetfulness.
Wind-dressing, or Alkehel, is in place of the phlebotomy of the Fusca and the Basilica phlebotomy, and therefore it is beneficial for asthma, and constriction of breathing, and fissure of the breathing instrument, and coughing, and fullness.
And it is necessary that the Alkehel cupping glass be impelled for a little while, because if it is placed lower, it generates weakness in the heart and stomach.
Wind-dressing, however, of the alhagdahim, is beneficial for accidental pains in the head, and ophthalmia, and hemicrania, and perforation, and pain in the roots of the teeth: and it is in place of the phlebotomy of the Basilica.
And it is necessary to instruct the wind-dresser not to press his hand with the scarification, so that he does not strike an artery and cause a flow of blood.
Wind-dressing, however, under the chin, is beneficial for ulcers in the mouth, and corruption of the gums, and similar to them of diseases which are in the mouth: and it stands in the place of the phlebotomy of alieherich, which are on the two lips.
Wind-dressing of the spatulas, however, is beneficial for alchafacham, which is produced by repletion and heat.
Wind-dressing, however, of the inner parts of the two foci, is beneficial as a substitute for the phlebotomy of the three veins, Basilica, and Fusca, and Cephalica: because it draws blood from all those small veins that are in the flesh; and those small veins draw from other larger veins than themselves, until the drawing reaches the three veins.
And it is necessary to instruct the wind-dresser not to proceed too far in the scarification, because the place is denuded of flesh, and under it are nerves and arteries.
A cupping vessel, however, that is cupped above the alchausos, is beneficial for hemorrhoids of the anus and lower ulcers.
And it is necessary to instruct the wind-dresser that the cupping vessel be large and made of air, because the place needs strong suction, and perhaps the thin cupping vessels will break; and it should be scarified with a large scarification.
Cupping of the legs diminishes noticeably: because they draw blood from the whole body, and they relieve old pains in the kidneys, and the womb, and the bladder; they provoke menstruation, and are beneficial for botor and ademenul; and they stand in the place of phlebotomy of the two saphenous veins and alhorcobeni.
However, they weaken the body greatly, and cause syncope in many people.
And the benefit of alhorcobeni cupping is close to the benefit of cupping the two legs.
The quality of placing the cupping vessels is that you should first place an empty cupping vessel and apply moderate suction. And do not prolong the placement of the cupping vessels, but place them quickly and remove them quickly, so that the humors come to the place with equal arrival. And do not cease repeating this and continuing it, until you see the place already reddened and inflamed, and the redness of blood appears: then, therefore, scarify, and repeat the suction gradually. Then consider the disposition of the bodies.
For those who are of delicate flesh, with rare pores, it is necessary to scarify them once, no more, so that the place is not ulcerated.
And instruct the cupper to enlarge the scarification and deepen it slightly, and to moderate the suction with ease, speed, and smooth movement.
If there is thickness in the blood, then it is necessary to scarify it twice. In the first instance, a path is opened for the thinning of the blood and its becoming watery; and in the second, for a careful examination of the extraction of thick blood.
If, however, the blood is very foul, then let the scarification be performed a third time, so that it may achieve its final result.
And finally, when we wish to extract blood gradually, or for a short time, a single scarification suffices for us. If we wish for a large extraction of blood, we scarify many times.
And if we measure that the blood is thick, then it is necessary that it be scarified with a deep scarification; and the equal limit in the scarification is the depth of the skin.
What is that which ought to be administered from oils at the placement of Cupping, and what should the cupper beware of?
In that one whose skin is thick, hard, dark, and whose pores are tight, it is necessary that the places of cupping be anointed with oils that are opening, soothing, and resolving: if it is in summer time, such as the oil of alkeiri, or the oil of violet, or the oil of sweet almonds, or the oil of pumpkin seed.
And if it is in winter time, then narcissus oil, or lily oil, or camomile oil, or sarbantine oil: and similar to these.
If however the superfluity is thick, cold: then the oil should be amaracin oil, or balsam oil, or alben oil, or anise oil: and similar to these.
If however the cupper is of large pores, tender flesh: then it is necessary that he abstain from oil, and it is necessary that those ones wash the places of cupping after cupping with rose water, or with cold water, or with soothing water, or with pumpkin water, or with purslane water: and similar to them.
However, he whose blood is of much moisture, should wash the cuppings with vinegar, or with myrtle water, and sumac: and similar to them.
However, whose superfluities are thick, should wash their cuppings with old wine, or with sorrel water, or with anise decoction, or camomile: and similar to them.
And it is necessary that cupping be avoided in a bath, or in the vicinity of a bath, indeed it is necessary that it be administered after exiting from the bath by an hour, or by two hours.
And it is not necessary that anyone sleep after cupping.
What is it by which it is necessary that the Ventosandus, or Phlebotomist, be governed before cupping?
And after it, it is necessary to consider first: if the Ventosus or Phlebotomist is choleric, and sharpness and inflammation overcome his blood, then it is necessary that he take refrigerants, such as pomegranate juice, and also endive with vinegar and lettuce, and secaniabin, and iuleb, and similar to them.
And place his food chickens, and mutton sekebiget, and foods seasoned with gooseberries, and similar to them.
And whose complexion is cold, it is necessary that he take in his drink syrup from honey, or from almiua, or alsecaniabin made from seeds: and let him take medium scented wine, which is between old and new: and let him be instructed to use little food. And place his food chickens, and canebir, and sparrows, that is, small birds, and young doves issiadebet.
And it is necessary that the drink on the day of the ventosation and phlebotomy be more than the food; and it is necessary that, in some men, in the hours of tyriaca alfaroch, or a medicine of moss, that is, musk, or alesselithe be given in the drink before the ventosation, and before the phlebotomy, or after, so that the principal members may be strengthened, and the blood may be refined. And it is not necessary that they take it in heated drink.
Concerning ventosations without scarification. However, ventosations that are without scarification are ventosations that are placed upon the liver, and the spleen, and the gout, and upon the belly, the navel, and the places of the kidneys, and the chest of the loins, because these members do not tolerate scarification upon themselves.
And they are not sought out by them, unless either a connection of blood from a member to a member; just as we place a ventosa upon the nipples in an illness of nosebleed. And we use them to free a member from a cold, viscous windiness in the member; just as we place a ventosa upon the belly and the navel. For it indeed rarefies the member, and warms it, and removes the pain because it dissolved that windiness.
It is also placed upon the kidneys when obstruction or a stone occurs in them. For by its power of attraction, perhaps it opens the obstruction or uproots the stone from its place.
And similarly it does when placed upon the liver and spleen for a troublesome windiness in both of them.
And these cupping glasses are administered empty with only a cut. And sometimes they are administered with fire.
And sometimes they are administered full of lukewarm water in cases of pleurisy; and that is so that the cupping glass be filled and be large, with only warm water, or water in which herbs suitable for it have been boiled.
Form of cupping glass administered with fire.
Let the width of its opening be two open fingers, according to what we have formed: and let its depth be half a palm: and let there be a small hole on its side, in a place approximately in the middle of it, according to the size for a needle to enter it: let it be made of bronze, or brass, with thick, smooth, even, polished edges, so that it does not injure the limb in its placement upon it: and let a transverse rod of bronze or iron be in its center, where the candle with fire is placed.
And now this cupping glass is made large, larger than the one we described, and a little smaller than that, according to the illnesses and the age of the one who uses it.
For the cupping glasses of children and the thin are different from the cupping glasses of men and those with large bodies.
The method of placing this cupping glass with fire upon the limb is to light a wick with fire from flax properly, or a small candle of wax, and place it over the middle of the transverse rod which is in the middle of the cupping glass: so that the fire is kindled approximately at the lower part of the cupping glass, so that the body of the sick person is not burned.
Then it is placed upon the limb, and a finger is placed over the hole that I mentioned, until when we hold the cupping glass, as long as we need it, we remove the finger, and vapor will exit through that hole, and the cupping glass will be released immediately.
Then light the wick according to its way, and repeat it, if you need it.
However, in a cupping glass applied in the illness of pleurisy with water, there is no transverse rod, nor hole: and it is not applied except because it is filled with water, and placed upon the limb only.
And this is its form.
And the larger this cupping glass is, so that it can hold much water, the better it is.
Concerning the suspension of bloodsuckers.
Bloodsuckers are not applied in multiple places, unless in those limbs where the application of cupping is impossible, due to their small size, such as the lip, and the gums, and similar parts. Or on a limb denuded of flesh, such as a finger, and the nose, and similar parts.
And the quality of using them is: that you should take bloodsuckers which are in fresh, clean waters, free from putrid matter.
Then they should be left in fresh water by day and night, until they are hungry, and nothing remains in their bellies. Then the body should be evacuated first with bloodletting and with cupping. Then cleanse the limb of the sick person until it turns red. Then place them upon it.
When, therefore, they are filled, and fall, and suction of the place is possible with cupping, then it is most helpful; and if not, then wash the place with vinegar. Then with much water, and it is rubbed, and squeezed out.
If the flow of blood after the fall of the Sanguisugarum is prolonged, and it is oozing, then pour a linen cloth into cold water, and place it over it, until the oozing is cut off.
If the blood multiplies, then pulverize ground zegi, or gallnuts, or similar astringents upon it, until the blood is cut off.
Or place halves of shelled beans on the area, and let them remain until the beans adhere to the area, for the blood is cut off.
And if a repetition of the Sanguisugarum is necessary, when possible, change them.
If, however, the leeches are prevented from being suspended, then the area is wiped with fresh blood. Or fix a needle in the areas until some blood emerges. Then place them, for when they sense anything of the blood, they immediately adhere.
When therefore you wish them to fall off, pulverize some crushed aloe, or salt, or ashes on them: and they will fall off immediately.
This chapter is also very necessary in the art of medicine, and it is the restoration of fractures and dislocations of accidents in bones.
Know, O children, that the foolish physicians and the common people boast about this chapter, and those who have never examined an ancient book, nor read a letter from it.
And for this reason, this method is private among the sciences in our land. And I have never encountered any good in it at all, and I have not attained that which I have attained from it except because of the length of reading ancient books, and study concerning their understanding, until I extracted the knowledge of it from them.
Then I adhered to experiment and study for the length of my life.
And now I have described to you from it in this chapter everything that contains my knowledge: and upon which my experiment has passed, after I have abbreviated it for you, and freed it from the occupation of elongation, and abbreviated it at the end of the abbreviation, and shown it at the end of the declination; and I have formed in it many forms from the forms of instruments which are administered in it, since it is from the addition of declination, just as I did in the two preceding chapters.
Chapter II.
It is necessary, as we say in the prologue of this chapter, to summarise the discourse and chapters, the understanding of which the craftsman is first required to attain to stand upon their truth: so that you, and those who are ready, may know, or learn this noble art, and others from you.
I say, therefore, that when a fracture, or dislocation, or twisting, or fall happens to someone, then it is necessary, first of all, to hasten to bleed him, and to loosen him, or both simultaneously: if nothing prevents it, such as weakness of strength; or if the one to whom anything of these has happened is a child, or a decrepit old man; or if it is a time of intense heat, or intense cold greatly.
Then let him be content in his food, with cold vegetables, and the flesh of birds, and kids: and forbid wine, and coarse meats, and filling oneself with foods and every food which fills the veins with blood. Until when you are secure from a hot abscess, and do not fear the effusion of matter to the limb: then let the sick man return to his first regimen with which his custom runs.
When therefore the broken bone begins to be restored, then it is necessary that the sick person be fed with nourishing foods, with much, coarse, heavy nourishment, in which there is viscosity: such as foods made from cooked wheat with water, and rice, and heads, and feet, and bellies of cows, and eggs, and fresh fish: and coarse wine, and things similar to them. For with this regimen the coagulation of the fracture happens more quickly and better.
And know that broken bones, when they are in men who are in the first age of old age, and decrepit, cannot be joined and consolidated according to their own nature always, because of the drying out of their limbs: and those that are in them at the end of their lightness are consolidated and joined, like the bones of small children.
However, nature attaches something similar to glue, in which there is thickness, to the broken bone from every side, by which it adheres to and binds it, until they are glued together and bound together, until it comes to the end of its strength and firmness, as it was at first, until nothing prevents it from its operations: and for this reason it is necessary that you put the sick person's nourishment in foods in which there is weight, and viscosity, and thickness, as we have said.
And know that the types of fractures are diverse, according to the diversity of the limbs: for the fracture of the leg is different from the fracture of the skull: and the fracture of the breastbone is different from the fracture of the spine: and similarly all the other limbs are different from each other: and I have come with a recollection of every type of fracture, explained in its chapter, distinct from another. And the types of bone fracture are diversified even within themselves.
Because its fracture is arched, besides which splinters occur in it. And sometimes its fracture occurs along the length of the bone: and its fractures are splintery, that is, splinters, and proceeding additions, as are in a reed when a knife is fitted to it for writing. And not proceeding: and there is a fracture with a wound and disruption in the head: and there is a fracture with a small fissure.
And each type has its own nature, or instrument, in its restoration, according to which its remembrance will come, distinct in its places.
And from what the fracture of the bone is known, there is its twisting and its prominence: and its appearance to the senses, and its sound when you press it with your hand.
Therefore, when there is no apparent twisting in the place, nor a sound upon touching it with your hand when you touch the bone with movement, nor does the sick person experience great pain; then there is no fracture there, but rather, it is possible that there is a twisting or a small fissure.  Therefore, you should not move it with your hand and pressure at all, but rather place upon it the medicines, the remembrance of which comes, after the time that is appropriate to the location; then a bandage is tied tightly.
And know that when a place is bent and split in two, besides the efforts that happen in it, nevertheless each part is moved away from its counterpart; then it is necessary for you to begin your hour for its straightening, making it even before a hot abscess occurs on it.
If however a hot abscess occurs on it, then leave it for several days, until the abscess subsides. Then make it even according to any method possible by gentleness and skill.
And know that its restoration and its making even is easier than a bone, in which efforts occur.
Then bind it according to how its memory comes to you.
If however there are efforts in the bone, then extension of this broken limb, if it is a hand or foot, is necessary from two parts; or with your hand, if the limb is small; or with two ropes, or with a rope and a hand.
And let your position be such that you place the limb over a level spot, according to its natural shape, until when the parts of the broken limb are extended: then try to restore those additions to their places with all your skill, and in any way you can; and be careful according to your strength, that no pain or injury be brought upon the weak by your operation; and try to the best of your ability to fit one of the two bones with its partner according to the best forms.
And it is necessary at that time that you try and touch it with your hand. If therefore you see there anything different, rectify it and make it equal according to the extent of your ability.
And beware of excessive extension and strong compression, as many foolish people do. For often they cause a hot abscess or contraction in the limb by their operation; as we have already seen this from their operations many times.
Then, after the equalization and proper operation, and constriction of that limb, and rest and tranquility, and admonish the sick person about it. And make him beware that he does not move it during the hours of his waking and his sleep, at its turning, and its agitation, and at its excretion, and all its movements with all his strength. And that he beware lest the position of the limb be one that will follow with pain. Because when he feels pain or injury in the disposition of the position of the limb, then it is necessary that he change it to another disposition from which he does not feel pain.
And take care with him that his position be even, straight, so that twisting does not occur in the limb when it is restored.
And the quality of the constriction of the fractured limb is, according to what I relate.
Know that fractured limbs are diversified in their smallness, and their size, and their shape.
Therefore, those of them that are small, such as an arm, and a finger, and a foot, and similar to them, then it is necessary that there be a wrapping of soft, thin cloth. However, those of them that are large, such as the thigh and the leg, it is necessary that there be a wrapping of wide, hard material in them.
Because a broad ligament connects a large limb and binds it from every side with equal constriction, so that a blemish does not enter it.
Then, after your evacuation, begin to apply a suitable liniment to it, on soft lint over the site of the fracture itself. Then begin wrapping the ligament over the fracture site itself with three or four wraps, according to the limb's needs; and tighten your hand slightly on the ligament.
Then proceed with it towards the upper part from the fracture site, and tighten less than was your previous tightening, with which you tightened the fractured site. Then move away from the fracture site with the wrap slightly, and gradually loosen the constriction, until you obtain a large portion from the healthy part.
Then take another bandage, and wrap it again over the fractured site in wraps. Afterwards, move the bandage to the lower part from the fracture. And let your operation be in the tightening of the bandage, and the loosening of it, according to what we said in the first upper bandage.
Then place between the bandages soft wool, or cloth, so that the twisting of the fracture is equalized if there is twisting in it; and if not, do not place anything in it.
Then wrap another bandage over it. Afterwards, place over these bandages evenly-made stars immediately, if there is no swelling in the place, nor a hot abscess.
If however there is swelling or an abscess in it, then place upon it that which will settle that abscess and remove the swelling; and leave it for a few days. Then bind over it the stars.
And let the stars be made from the halves of broad canes, shaved, skilfully shaped; or let them be made of the wood from which sieves are made, which are made from pine, or gerard, that is, palm branches, or calingi; and let the width of every star, according to this form, and this same figure, be [specified].
However, it is necessary that the star placed over the wound itself be somewhat thicker and wider than the other stars; and the length of the star should be according to the size and smallness of the member.
Then bind over the stars with another bandage, according to the first binding, the same. Then tie over it with threads properly, according to what we said about the binding; and it should be that your binding is tighter over the break itself, and the further away from the break it is, the looser the binding.
And it is necessary that the threads be medium in thickness and thinness, and be of soft linen.
For if the threads are thick, as I have seen from the operation of foolish ones who place their threads from twisted linen cords, it is a great error; because the binding falls out of quality with them.
And again, thin threads do not suit: because you will not achieve through the binding with them that which you desire.
And it is not necessary that there be less than a finger between splint and splint.
If the patient is injured by the ends of the splints after the binding in healthy places, then place under them soft tow or dyed wool until nothing is injured from it.
However, when there is a fracture with a wound, and a rupture occurs in the skin, I will come with a reminder of it in the second chapter according to its singularity.
And know that not every fractured limb needs to be bound with splints from the first day. Because when a limb is large, you should not put splints on it unless after five days, or seven, or more, according to your judgment of the safety of preventing a hot abscess.
And this is the method of plasters, by which the ancients restored those applied to fractures and dislocations.
A method of a brief common plaster, restoring fractures, suitable for many complexions, especially women and children, because it is from it that neither heat nor cold prevails.
And it is as follows: take flour dust, which is the flour meal that hangs on the walls of the mill during the movement of the millstone; and make it as it is, except that you sift it with egg white; and make the concoction neither thick nor thin. Then use it.
Another method of plaster, restoring fracture, dislocation, and twisting. Take of almess, laudanum, acacia, enula, and mugath, and juice of all, each 10 drachms; of myrrh and aloes, each 5 drachms; and of alethil 20 drachms.  Grind all these together, and sift them; and mix them with alethil water, or with egg white if the patient's complexion is heated. Then use this plaster. For it is a good compound, restores broken bones quickly, and benefits many people.
Another method of plaster, which also benefits fracture and twisting. Take of mugath, mess, and white marshmallow, of all 10 drachms; of myrrh and aloes, each 5 drachms; of acacia 6 drachms; of Armenian bole 20 drachms. Grind all thoroughly, sift them, and make a paste with water, or egg white; and administer.
A method of plaster for joints and bones separated from their places; and it relieves the pain occurring to them, and the splitting of bone, and the fracture. Take fresh wool and soak it in vinegar and boiled oil; and place it on the affected area.
And in this plaster there is no virtue of restoration, but it is good for calming a hot abscess; and it drives out pains properly.
A method of plaster that restores a fractured bone. Take the leaves of the fig tree and the leaves of the wild poppy; and grind them all and make a plaster from both.
A method of a shortened plaster, administered in the restoration of a broken bone; and when you desire the resolution of the remaining abscess. Take the root of marshmallow, and chamomile, and violet flowers, and herb flour, of each one part: let all be ground, and mixed with wine, if the limb is not inflamed.
If however it is inflamed, then prepare it with the water of moist coriander, or with water, and use it.
A method of another stronger plaster in resolution, than this first one, when a hard abscess occurs in the restoration of the limb. Take the root of marshmallow, and flaxseed, and pomegranate seeds, and melilot, and plantain, and violet flowers, and chamomile, of each one part: let all be ground, and mixed with willow water, or with fresh water, or with wine. All that according to the warmth of the limb and the quiet of its heat.
Hippocrates, however, did not say in his book that anything should be placed on a fractured limb during its restoration except a plaster made from wax and oil; nothing else; and he recounted that it should be of a consistency between thick and thin.
Galen, however, thought that things that dry out heat should be placed on a fractured limb during its restoration, such as myrrh, and aloes, and frankincense, and similar ones to those that we have recounted.
Method of the plaster which is beneficial for injury and pain. Take mugwort, and chickpeas, and cut human hair, or bird feathers, and marshmallow root, and salt in equal parts: grind them, and sift them, and mix them: and make a plaster from it.
The amount of time the bandage should remain, then be removed, is that you should consider, if no pain or itching occurs in the patient, and if the fractured bone is not moved from its place: then do not remove it for many days. But if such itching, or disturbing pain, or swelling occurs in the area, then quickly loosen it, and remove the plaster: and take a soft cloth, or a soft sea sponge, moistened: and immerse it in lukewarm water, and wash the area with it, until the itching subsides, and the pain settles.
But if such itching, or disturbing pain, or swelling occurs in the area, then quickly loosen it, and remove the plaster: and take a soft cloth, or a soft sea sponge, moistened: and immerse it in lukewarm water, and wash the area with it, until the itching subsides, and the pain settles. Then allow the limb to rest for one hour. Then place upon it cut wool, soaked in vinegar and oil, or rose oil: and bind it upon it for one night, until you are sure of the absence of a hot abscess, and the swelling of the limb subsides, and its pain is removed.
Then again apply a gentle bandage and a small plaster; and do not tighten it with your first bandaging, and treat it gently until it heals.
If you see that the abscess, redness, pain, swelling, and all the accompanying symptoms have completely disappeared, and you no longer need a plaster and bandage, then treat it again as you did at first equally.
If nothing of what we have said happens to the limb, then do not loosen it, except after three, or four, or five, or seven days. And when it is left for twenty days, according to what appears to you from the limb's healing, as we have said, until the fracture adheres, and the flesh's coagulation approximates it: then also add more binding than your first complete binding; and also add more strengthening food, according to its previous recollection.
If however you see the fracture site already drying out and thinning more than necessary, then know that nourishment is prevented from reaching it. Therefore, bathe it with lukewarm water every time you loosen it, and let it remain for three days, and ease the bandage slightly.
Through this operation, therefore, nourishment reaches the limb, and it heals quickly.
However, that which foolish restorers do to a fractured limb a second time, when it is not restored at first as it should be, and is restored according to twisting, is an error of their operation, and a great fear: and if it were correct, the ancients would have said it in their books, and would have operated with it.
And I have seen no trace of it anywhere in that at all, and it is better that it not be done.
Concerning the treatment of an accidental injury to the head.
The kinds of fractures are diverse, and its shapes are many: and its causes are distinct.
For there is a fracture that is caused by a blow with a sword; and the blow removes the bone as far as it reaches the siphac, which is under the bone, just as an axe does in wood; and because of that, this type of fracture is called Axialis.
Or the sword cuts a part of the bone, and cuts its surface, and the incision does not penetrate to its utmost limit; and this type of fracture is called Kalaan, that is, a lifting absolutely.
And it is a wound of two fractures, either large or small.
And there is a fracture which is a crushing or abrasion; and its cause is a blow with a stone, or a fall on a stone, or similar things.
And this fracture is also either penetrating, which now approaches the periosteum, which is under the bone, or is on the surface of the bone; and the wound of these two fractures is also either small or large.
And there is a fracture which is hidden in the bone in the subtlety of a hair; and it is a small fissure, and because of that this type of fracture is called Capillaris.
And of these is a fracture, which happens from a fall, or a blow from a stone, and similar things, which cause a layer of bone to enter the interior, and a hollow is formed there; just as it happens with bronze cauldrons, when a blow strikes them, and a part of them enters the interior.
And this happens most often in the heads of moist bones, such as the heads of children.
And for all these types of fractures, separate descriptions are made, and I will come with a recollection of it all in its place.
And we recognize all these types of fractures through examination upon it, and investigation of them with probes, and the removal of the corrupted flesh that is upon them.
However, the capillary type is recognized by this, that it is uncovered on the bone and cleaned, and smeared upon it with ink: for the fracture appears black.
In the treatment of a fracture, first consider the patient's symptoms: then if you see from the symptoms that it signifies manifest danger, such as vomiting, cholera, extension, loss of intellect, loss of voice, fainting, acute fever, protrusion of the eyes, redness of them, and similar symptoms in various conditions, without a doubt it will not be healed; and if you see symptoms that do not alarm you and you hope for recovery, then begin its treatment.
That is, if a wounded person comes to you immediately after being wounded, and it is in the days of winter, then it is necessary to strive for the removal of the bone before the fourteenth day according to all the dispositions.
And if it is in the days of summer, then it is necessary to hasten to remove the bone before the seventh day, before that which is under the bone from the membrane becomes corrupted, and those accidents happen which we have described.
If the fracture of the bone has already reached the membrane touching the brain, and is with fragments and pulling, then it is necessary to cut away the broken and ground portion, as I describe to you.
And it is necessary to shave the head of the wounded person and expose the bone in whatever way possible for you, and according to the shape of the wound and what is gentle upon the patient.
If, during the exposure of the bone, a flow of blood or a hot abscess occurs, then apply to it with what is appropriate. And it is necessary to fill the place with cloths soaked in wine and rose oil, and to allow the wound to rest until the abscess subsides and you are certain of the cessation of bleeding. Then begin the treatment of the bone and its removal.
And that is done according to one of two methods.
One method is to cut the bone with a scalpel of narrow blade; and this is its form.
Then apply another scalpel, slightly wider than the first; and this is its form.
Then apply yet another scalpel, wider still than the second.
And the second method is that you should have a number of different scalpels; some being wider than others, and some shorter than others; and let the edges of their sharpness be the last, and be of iron temper, or steel; and use ease in striking upon the scalpel, so that it does not strike the head and injure it.
However, if the bone is strong, hard, then it is necessary that you perforate around it, before you apply the scalpels, with drills called drills that do not penetrate deeply; and they are not so called unless because they do not pass the limit of the bony flesh to that which is behind it; because the drill has a round point above that which is under its sharp head, similar to an edge, and a small circle prevents it from sinking and passing through the thickness of the bone.
And it befits you to take from these drills a great number, each one fitting the quantity of the bone's thickness, until you have a drill present for every skull; whose sharp point's quantity in length and shortness is according to the quantity of that skull's thickness.
And this is the form of three kinds of drills, or trepands.
The quality of perforating around a fractured bone is: to place the drill on the bone, and turn it with your fingers, until you know that the bone has already been pierced. Then change the drill to another place, and place that which is between every hole the quantity of the thickness of a radius, or approximately that.
Then cut with the knives what is between each hole from the bone: and make it thinner than you can on top of it from the tip of lightness, as we have said, until you remove the bone, either with your hand, or with some other of the instruments that you have prepared for it: such as nippers, and fine pincers.
And it is necessary that you beware with all caution, lest the drill or the knife touch anything of the marrow.
When therefore you have surrounded the bone by piercing, and it has been separated from the marrow, if it has been continuous with it, and you have extracted it, it is necessary that you scrape and level the end of it that remains in the bone with another instrument similar to the knife. However, it should be thinner and more delicate than other knives.
If any small pieces of bone remain, and splinters, then take them easily with the instruments you have. Then treat the wound after that with the bandages and ointments that we have mentioned.
And another method of operation is easy, entirely free from fear: which Galen said, and praised greatly: and this is his statement. First, you must begin to expose the part of the bone in the place where the fracture is more severe and more obvious: until, when you have exposed that part and placed the tip of this lenticular knife there, whose form is this.
And the lenticular part, soft, does not cut anything: and its pointed part running along the two sides of it, as you see: so that the lenticular part rests on the bone, its pointed edge meeting the bone.
Then strike the knife on one side with a small mallet, until you cut the whole bone with ease, as it turns; and be sure, by means of the bandage, that no accident, which you greatly fear, occurs to it.
And if the surgeon were not more foolish than other men, and more ignorant of it, nor were sleeping, then if anything remained attached to the bone from the bandage in certain places, he would cut it away from it with the tip of his lenticular knife, and free it from it with ease. It is freed from it without harm, and without fear.
And if the fracture of the bone does not penetrate to the bandage, and that which is cut away from the bone is its surface, and there remain on it roughnesses and subtle irregularities: then it is necessary to scrape away that roughness and remove those irregularities with the small razors from which you have prepared a variety of sizes, so that it is possible for you to administer from them the most appropriate and straight ones in every suitable place, according to that to which the operation leads you, and the broken bone, and its shape. And it is necessary that you administer, in your reasoning, by which you first scrape the bone, more widely than those razors. Then use after it one more subtle than that.
And it is necessary that you administer, in your reasoning, by which you first scrape the bone, more widely than those razors. Then use after it one more subtle than that. And do not cease to do that according to continuity, until you arrive at administering the thinnest and most subtle of them all.
In each of the remaining small fissures, and subtle fractures, it is necessary to administer care, according to that which leads to its straightening.
And it is a matter not hidden from anyone who has any study in this art, and it stands upon that which we have written and shown in great fractures.
If, however, the flap is detected when you remove the bone: then it is necessary that you take a linen cloth, according to the size of the wound, and immerse it in rose oil, and place it over the wound opening. Then take another cloth, doubled or tripled, and immerse it in wine and rose oil, and place it over the first cloth; and do it as easily as possible over it, so that it is not burdened by this.
Then administer a wide bandage over it; and do not tighten it, unless to the extent that it holds the wound only; and leave it with this treatment for one day, or two days, until you are certain of being free from a hot abscess. Then loosen it, and administer afterward medicines with which superfluous dryness is countered; such as lily roots, and herb flour, and frankincense powder, and aristolochia, and similar to them: and it is that you make a powder from these medicines, which is powdered over the wound as it is dry.
And universally administer in it any medicine whose property is to cleanse, and not to bite. And take care, according to your ability, that the wound in your treatment be clear; neither be there any dirt of ointment, nor any filth.
And take care, according to your ability, that the wound in your treatment be clear; neither be there any dirt of ointment, nor any filth. Nor allow the virus to collect in it at all: for when virus collects upon the membrane of the brain, it corrupts it and makes it putrid, and great evil comes upon the sick person afterward; and this occurs in a suppuration of the head, when the bone is cleansed from it, especially when its treatment is neglected, blackness appears on its surface.
Therefore consider, if the sick person suffers the accidents that we have mentioned, know that it is undoubtedly harmful.
And if blackness does not occur except from the medicine placed upon it, and is in the power of that medicine to cause that blackness, then it is necessary that you take one part of honey, three parts of rose oil, and linen with them. Then place it upon the suppuration; afterward treat it with the kinds of treatment that are suitable until it is healed.
Concerning the restoration of the Nose when it is broken.
Know that only two parts of the nose's upper portion can break simultaneously, or one of them; for it is composed of two bones. Because its lower part is cartilaginous, it does not break, and it suffers only from abrasion, twisting, and crookedness.
If one of the two parts breaks, then it is necessary to insert the little finger into the nostril, and to align that fracture with your index finger and thumb on the outside, until the nose returns to its natural shape; and do this skillfully and with ease. And be careful that your operation does not cause the patient pain.
If the fracture is in the upper part of the nose, and the finger cannot reach it, then it is necessary to align it with the end of a radius, on which a small swelling is present.
If the fracture is in both parts, then do likewise; and hasten its restoration on the first day of the fracture, if possible. And if not, then after the seventh or tenth day, at the quiet of a hot abscess.
Then introduce into the extremity of the nose a strip of linen cloth, if the fracture is in one part; or introduce two strips if the fracture is in two parts; and let the strip have a thickness sufficient to fill the nasal opening.
And some of the ancient restorers said that the strips should be steeped in butter and changed every day. However, that does not seem to me right; rather, the strip should be steeped in egg white, mixed with mill dust. Then leave the strip until the bone is strengthened and the cartilage hardened.
And sometimes a goose feather is introduced into the nose in place of a strip, after a soft cloth has been wrapped around it; and it is done so that it holds the fracture of the nose more strongly and so that the weak person is not hindered from breathing.
And this is not necessary. If you wish, do it; and if you wish, do the strips.
If, while operating on a hot abscess, the nose happens again to be affected, plaster the nose with careton, or with cot infused in rose oil, or a little of diaquilon.
However, if a hot abscess does not occur, then it is necessary to plaster it with sesame flour and powdered frankincense mixed with egg white. Then place soft lint over it, and do not bind the nose with anything at all.
If, however, the bones of the nose fracture or are broken into small pieces, then it is necessary to cut around them, and to extract them using instruments appropriate for them. Then stitch the wound, and treat it with that which causes flesh to grow and consolidates from suitable plasters or ointments.
If a wound occurs between the nostrils, then it is necessary to treat it with dressings, and administer a lead cannula until it heals.
Concerning the restoration of the lower jaw, when it is broken.
When the lower jaw is broken, and its fracture is not with a wound: then see if its fracture is only from the outside, and is not broken in two, and is bent inward: then its knowledge is easy.
Therefore, if its fracture is on the right side, you should insert the index finger of your left hand into the patient's mouth. Similarly, if the fracture is on the left jaw, then insert the index finger of your right hand. And push the curvature of the fracture from within towards the outside with your other hand from the inside of the bone properly, and with it straighten it.
If the fracture of the jaw has already separated into two, then it is necessary to apply an external force from both sides, according to the straightness, until its alignment is possible.
If, however, displacement or breakage has already occurred in the teeth, then bind those which you hope will remain with gold wire, or silver, or silk. Then place a poultice on the fractured jaw. Then place a doubled cloth over it, and place a large, properly made bandage on top of the cloth, or a piece of leather sole of equal length to the jaw.
Then bind it from above, according to how its ligature is prepared for you and its application is appropriate, until it is not broken; and order the sick person to use tranquility and quiet; and give him soft drinks.
If, however, you estimate that something of its shape has already been altered in any way, then hurry and loosen it on the third day. Then rectify what has been altered from it, and plaster it with mill dust, with the white of an egg, or with sesame flour, after you have removed the poultice, and place soft wool over the plaster.
While that plaster remains attached to it, and the arrangement of the bone does not change, leave it, do not loosen it, until it is healed; or tighten the fracture. For this fracture is often tightened in three weeks.
If, however, a hot abscess occurs in the meantime, then administer what we have said many times in its sedation, until that abscess is removed.
And if the fracture is with a wound, consider. If a piece is already separated from the bone, or from the surrounding tissue, then be meticulous in this, so that you remove those pieces of surrounding tissue with whatever is suitable to you in removing them from the instruments.
If however the wound opening is constricted, then widen it with a phlebotome according to the amount of your need.
Then, when you have removed that surrounding tissue, and nothing remains of it, then the wound opening, if it is wide: and if not, place on it from the plasters that are suitable to it, and cause it to heal, until it is healed.
Concerning the restoration of the Forcep, when it breaks.
Indeed, the Forcep most often breaks at the anterior part, on the humeral side, and its fracture occurs according to one of three methods.
Either it breaks and separates into two, besides which some swelling may occur in it: and it is easier to restore it.
Or in such a way that swelling occurs in the bone: and it is more difficult to restore it.
Or in such a way that it is a fracture with a wound.
And the operation in it, when the fracture is without a wound, is to have two assistants present, so that one of them holds the support that follows the fractured Forcep, and the other extends the neck towards the side.
Then adjust the fracture with your fingers, until its shape is as it should be: and there is neither a prominence nor a cavity in it.
If you need more extension, then you must place a sphere made of cloth or wool under the patient's arm; and its size should be according to your need; and extend and lift the Forcep, and contract the sphere with your hand, until you adjust the fracture, as it should be.
If you cannot pull the end of the Forcep outward because it has reached deep inside, then the patient must be placed on their back, and you must place a pillow of medium size under their shoulder, and the assistant must press down on their shoulder until the bone of the Forcep that is deep inside is lifted upwards; and then straighten the fracture and adjust it with your fingers.
If you feel a splinter from the Forcep, and it moves, then you must cut above it and extract the splinter with ease.
If however it is retained in the bone, then make an incision around it with one of the scalpels you have prepared for that purpose, after you have placed under the Forcep an instrument that keeps the sifach: and this is an instrument made of wood or iron. And this is its form.
It resembles a spoon that has no cavity.
And its width should be according to the size of the bone, and its smallness. Its length, however, should also be according to what is possible for you in the operation.
And it should have two ends, as you see: and one end should be wide, and the other narrow.
If however the wound that you have made when you have extracted the bone fragment is wide, and you fear a hot abscess: then bring together the two edges of the wound with sutures.
And if the wound is small, or you fear a hot abscess: then fill the wound with cloths and small cushions, according to the size of the wound's opening.
If a hot abscess should occur, then soak a cloth in rose oil, vinegar, and wine, and place it over it.
A bone fracture, however, when it is without a wound, and without incision, is treated by placing a plaster made from mill flour with egg white upon the bone. And place soft lint over it. Then place a ball under its (the bone's) raised portion, if you need it. Then take a himatema, that is, a wheel which the Saracens hold, which is very long, and let its width be one palm, or about that. Then place a doubled pad over the lint and plaster. Then take a thin board, whose width is of three fingers, and in length likewise. Then wrap it in cloth. Then wrap that cloth with the splint in the place of the alhimemati that falls over the fracture and the location. Then place the alhimemati over the fracture as it revolves, and wrap it over its neck, and under its healthy and under its diseased titillico: and reduce it over the entire part, and as you see that the constriction holds the fracture with a decent constriction: and that is what is not hidden from you, and the whole, so that the splint is not removed from above the broken bone. And for this reason it is necessary that you observe the sick person every day. Therefore, whenever the ligament softens, and you see the splint already being removed, then rectify it and tighten the ligament.
Then place the sick person's sleep on his back, and place a small pillow under his pillow at night, so that with it his support is raised from his side. The fracture of the clavicle is therefore raised by raising the shoulder.
Or bind his arm to his neck, and do not loosen the bandage if it does not happen in a place that is affected by itching or from an abscess, until twelve days.
Then renew the plaster if you see his face towards it. And add to the constriction, and leave him until it is restored and coagulated.
And indeed the fracture of the clavicle is bound and strengthened most in twenty-eight days, and sometimes it happens in some people in a shorter time.
Concerning the restoration of a fractured scapula.
The scapula is rarely fractured, and in its broad area, and only its margins are fractured from it.
Therefore, when a part of it is fractured, and it is fractured in its middle, and that is not recognized except by touch, then, according to the nature of the fracture, attempt its preparation. And reduce it to its natural shape by every means of skill that is possible for you.
Then place on the area flour of a mill with the white of an egg, and soft linen, and place a pad of doubled cloth over it. Then place upon it a broad splint of thin wood, according to the size of the entire scapula, or slightly larger.
If, however, under the splint there is a concavity in any part of the scapula, then equalize that concavity with soft linen, until the splint descends according to equality.
Then bind over it with a long bandage, with suitable constriction, and firmness of the splint, until it is not removed from its place.
And consider the bandage every day. Whenever, therefore, the bandage softens, tighten it, and adjust the splint if it is removed from its place; and let the sick person lie on their healthy side.
And indeed the splint is restored in twenty days, or in twenty-five days.
When therefore this number is completed, then loosen the bandage; and be you in safety. For it is from bones whose connection is not feared, nor their separation.
If however a piece proceeds from the bone, and pierces beneath the skin: then cut over it, and remove it. And do what we said in the fracture of the furcula from the suppuration of a hot abscess, if anything happens from it.
Concerning the restoration of a fractured breast.
The breast sometimes breaks in the middle of itself, and that rarely happens. Its extremities are indeed broken and crushed very often from its accidents.
When its middle is broken, bending downwards, it causes him intense pain, difficulty in breathing, and coughing; and perhaps he vomits blood, and a cavity in the fractured bone becomes apparent, and not hidden from the senses. Its restoration is that the weak man be laid on his back; and a pillow be placed between his shoulder blades.
Then press his shoulders, and grasp the ribs from both sides with your hands; and adjust its alignment, in every way possible and suitable, until the shape of the bone returns, as it should.
Then place a plaster and a bandage on it, and place a thin board of willow, or chalice, or similar light material, upon it, after you have wrapped it in cloth. Then adjust it in tying it over the broken bone so that it does not move; and proceed with the bandage in a circular fashion towards the back several times, and tighten it with a suitable constriction.
Then check the bandage every hour, and whenever it softens, tighten it; and if its need compels you to loosen it due to itching, or corrosion that occurs in the area, or pain, or abscess: then hurry, and loosen it, and remove the plaster, and correct whatever has happened with its method of treatment.
Then replace the plaster, if you see fit: and apply a bandage to it until it heals.
Concerning the restoration of Ribs, when they are broken.
Know that a fracture of the ribs does not occur except in the thick parts which follow the spine, and from their extremities on the anterior part. And attrition does not happen to them unless because they are cartilaginous. And its knowledge is not hidden from the sense in the investigation with fingers.
And its restoration is done so that one equalizes the fracture with fingers according to the possible manner, until the form is equalized, according to what is necessary. Then apply plasters, and bind the fractured bone with splints, if it needs it.
And if the rib fracture is slanting inwards, then severe pain and a stabbing sensation occur in the patient, like the stabbing sensation that occurs in those with pleurisy, because the bone pierces the membrane, and also there is difficulty breathing, and coughing, and the spitting up of much blood; and this is a difficult condition to treat.
And the ancients have already devised many methods for it; and some of them say that one should give the patient foods that produce inflammation and windiness, so that the belly will become inflamed, and expanded, and the fracture will be driven outwards.
We, however, abhor this, lest it become a quick cause for a hot abscess, if it does not already exist. If, however, it has already occurred, then one should add to it.
And some of them said: place a windbag over the affected area, then suck it with force, and this is a similar reasoning. However, it is feared that the windbag will draw superfluities to the affected area, because of the weakened state.
And some of them said: the affected area should be covered with wool that has already been immersed in hot oil; and cushions should be placed between the ribs, until it is filled; so that there is an even bandage when you wrap it around the curvature.
Then the sick person should be treated with the treatment for pleurisy, through food and medicine.
If the strong action of the affliction the patient cannot tolerate, and the mouth stings with a wound caused by a sharp prick, and we fear for the patient, then it is necessary to make an incision over the affected area and expose the fractured rib. Then we should place on it the instrument that preserves the sifac, whose description preceded; and we should cut the bone with ease, and cut it.
Then we should bring together the two edges of the wound, if it is large, with sutures; and we should treat it with plasters until it heals.
If, meanwhile, a hot abscess occurs, then hurry and infuse powders in rose oil, and place it on the affected area; and let the patient be treated with what is suitable for the abscess.
Meanwhile, let him lie on the side on which he sleeps, until he is healed.
Concerning the restoration of the fracture of the spine of the back and neck.
A fracture sometimes occurs in the bones of the neck, and attrition rarely happens to them; and similarly with the vertebrae of the back. Therefore, when this happens to someone, and you wish to know whether it will heal or not, then consider. For if you see his hands already softened, and numb, and dead; and he cannot move them, nor extend them, nor contract them; and when you grasp them with your fingers, and prick them with a needle, he does not feel it, and he does not feel pain in them: then know that it will not heal, and in many cases is mortal.
But if he moves them, and feels the contraction with your fingers and the pricking, then know that the bone of the neck is sound, and that the sick person will be cured with treatment.
If a similar condition occurs in the vertebrae of the back, and you wish to know whether it will also heal or not, then consider his feet: if you see that they are softened, and that what happened to his hands has happened to them; then, when he lies on his back, wind and excrement leave involuntarily; and when he lies on his stomach, excrement leaves involuntarily; and when he lies on his back and wants to urinate, and cannot: then know that it is mortal. Therefore, do not labour in his treatment.
If, however, nothing of that happens to him, the condition is less severe.
And the treatment for what happens from that is to try to soothe the hot abscess, so that you place on the vertebra pounded rose oil alone, or with the yolks of a roasted egg.
Place that upon it several times a day, until when the hot abscess subsides; then place upon the spot one of the strengthening, drying plasters, and bind it with a bandage; and order the sick person to use rest and quiet. Nor should he sleep on the part where he found the pain until he is healed.
If it happens at the attrition of the bone, or something that has already separated from it, then it is necessary to dissect on the skin and remove that. Then bring together the two lips of the wound, if it is large, with sutures. Then treat it with some healing ointment until it is healed.
If, however, the last bone of the alhausos breaks, and is the end of the tail, then it is necessary to insert the thumb of the left hand into the anus, and straighten the broken bone with the other hand, as far as possible, and with a second adjustment.
Then place it on top of it, and remove it; and treat the wound with the previous treatment until it is healed.
On the restoration of the Anchae.
Chapter XI.
The bones of the Anchae rarely break. If they do break, then their fracture is not complete, unless it is a shattering at their extremities; and they split lengthwise and bend inward; and pain and a puncture occur in the place, and the leg that is broken becomes numb.
And its restoration is to extend your hand over it, until you stand over the fracture as its figure is.
If the fracture is only at its extremities, then align that fracture according to what is prepared for you in the alignment, until it resembles its natural shape.
If, however, the fracture is lengthwise, or already bends inward, then have the sick person lie on their stomach, until the restoration of that fracture is prepared for you. When therefore you have aligned it, place a plaster over it; then place a splint of wood or leather over it; and bind it tightly so that you do not fear the displacement of the fracture, nor the removal of the splint.
And align the concavity of those with that which fills it, until the binding takes it according to equality; and command the sick person to sleep on their back, or on their healthy side.
If, however, a hot abscess occurs to him, then cease from its extension and its restoration until the hot abscess subsides; and place upon it that which settles it, according to what has preceded, then return to its restoration; and bind it as is proper.
If, however, it happens in the bone that it is shattered, or broken, remove it.
On the restoration of the fractured arm.
The arm is that which is between the elbow and the head of the shoulder blade.
If therefore it is broken, then its restoration is according to one of two methods.
One of which is: that you take a piece of wood of medium thickness, according to this shape, which follows.
And two bandages are tied at the two ends.
Then it is suspended from a raised place, and the sick person sits upon a seat. Then he should place his broken arm upon the wood, until it reaches the notch, in whose middle the curvature of the wood is attached.
Then suspend something heavy above it, so that the attendant extends it downwards. Then the physician should adjust the fracture with his hands together, until the fracture returns to the proper position.
And another method is that the sick person should lie on their back, and suspend their arm from their neck with a bandage. Then command two attendants, that one of them hold that which is above the fracture with their hands, and that the other hold below it, and let each of them extend to their own side.
And if you wish the extension to be stronger, then bind below the fracture with a bandage, and above it with another bandage, and let each of the two attendants extend to their respective sides.
If therefore the fracture is near the extremity of the humerus, then it is necessary that one bandage be placed beneath the armpit, and another beneath the fracture towards the elbow.
And similarly if the fracture is near the elbow, then it is necessary that a bandage be placed over that place, and over the elbow itself.
Then adjust the fracture with ease without effort, until when the fracture is adjusted as it should be, and a good application is applied, then bind it, if a hot abscess does not occur.
If however a hot abscess occurs, then leave the binding until the seventh day. And place upon it cut wool soaked in vinegar and rose oil, until when the abscess subsides: then bind it; and the manner of binding it is that you place a plaster over the fracture.
Then place a bandage of new cloth over the plaster. Then let the arm be supported by that aid, and let him place his open hand on his shoulder.
And place a cloth, and bind the arm over the support, so that the arm stands in place like the stars; if nothing hinders you from it, nor is anything disturbed on you from the broken bone.
But if you fear that something might be disturbed on you from the broken bone, then use splints: and it is that you place a splint over the fracture itself which is wider and stronger than the other splints. And place between every splint the width of a finger; and the length of the splints be according to the fracture with the addition of three fingers on every side.
Then bind over the splints the bandage which I mentioned at the beginning of the chapter.
And it is that your bandage should be tighter over the place of the fracture. And the more the fracture is extended, the less tight the bandage should be.
If therefore you see the position of the splints and the bandage, as we have said, at the time when you restore the limb immediately, then do it; and if you fear a hot abscess, then leave the bandage and splints until the seventh day, as we have said.
Then consider the ligament for all three days, so that itching or swelling does not occur in the area, or that food is prevented from reaching the limb, due to the disposition of excess fluid from the bandage. Therefore, rectify it all, according to what we have said.
If, however, you are confident that nothing will happen from it, then do not loosen the bandage unless after three days, or more.
And let the patient's sleep be on his back, and his hands on his stomach; and place under his assistance a mattress full of wool evenly.
And consider at all hours of the night or day that the broken limb's form is not loosened or the bandage softened. Therefore, rectify all of it with your skill.
And give the patient food according to the order we have previously described, so that the food is subtle at first, until the mouth begins to draw together; then it is necessary to increase the thickness of his food.
For it is customary for the leg and its support that it draw together in forty days; then therefore it is necessary that it be loosened, and a bath be administered, and it be medicated with ointments which rectify it.
If the fracture is foul, bruised, then do not loosen the bandage and splints from it until fifty days, and until two months.
Concerning the restoration of a fractured arm.
The arm is composed of two bones, which are called two forearm bones.
One of which is small; and it is that which follows the thumb. And the other is large, and it is that which is placed beneath the small one at the lower part.
Perhaps therefore the larger forearm bone is broken alone, or the smaller one; and perhaps they are broken together.
When therefore the smaller forearm bone is broken above, then its restoration is easy, and its healing is easier.
And when the forearm bone is broken below, its fracture is bad, and its healing is difficult.
And worse than that is when the two bones are broken simultaneously.
If therefore the bone that is broken is the smaller forearm bone above, then it is fitting for the physician, in its restoration, to apply a small extension with ease, until he equalizes it.
If however the larger forearm bone is that which is broken: then it is necessary that he apply a much stronger bandage.
And it is necessary that he place the shape of the hand in its restoration, and its extended extension on a cushion. And let the thumb of the hand be higher than all the fingers, and let the lower joint be below all the fingers, or the rest, and the patient sitting square over himself, and let the cushion be before him, or in a straight line with him, in height, so that the patient does not incur fatigue.
Then the attendant should extend the arm from the lower part, either with his hand or with a bandage. And another attendant should extend it from above similarly.
Then the physician should adjust the bone until he restores it to the best shape possible.
If there are fragments in the broken bone, then try to restore every fragment to its place by your skill.
If, however, a separated fragment appears in it, and it pierces the skin, and there is no hope for its restoration for you: then cut over it, and remove it according to the manner which we have stated in the matters which have gone before.
If, however, the fracture is with a wound, I have already made a separate chapter concerning it, therefore take its treatment from there.
If in the beginning of your restoration a hot abscess occurs, then bind a cloth with a cerate made from rose oil and white wax, and let it be medium between thickness and thinness: and bind the cloth over it with a subtle bandage until the abscess subsides: then remove the cerate, and apply a plaster prepared from mill powder with egg white. Then place splints, and let the splint placed over the fracture itself be somewhat wider and stronger.
And know that the number of splints for the arm is six in most cases, whether the fracture be in one or two joints at once.
Then place your bandage over the fracture location more strongly and forcefully, and somewhat more tightly at the upper or lower portions of the fracture: or place a softer bandage slightly less tight, as its description previously stated at the beginning of the chapter.
And let the cloths that envelop the fracture be soft, damp cloths; and let them not be hard, rough. And let the thread with which it is tied be of linen, medium between fine and coarse, as we have described.
And observe the limb and ligament after days. If anything should happen requiring correction, such as itching that occurs in the limb, then it is necessary to embrocate the limb with warm water until the itching ceases, and leave the limb unbandaged until it rests, then reapply the bandage.
If the bandage has now softened, and the bone has already been removed, and similar things to these: then correct it all with your skill, and consider again.
For if nourishment is prevented from reaching the limb, because of the excessive tightness of the bandage, then it is necessary to soften it a little, and leave it for some days, until nourishment flows to it, then bandage it.
If however, nothing of what we have said happens to the patient, then it is not necessary to loosen it, unless after twenty days, or about this many.
Then the patient's hand is to be suspended from his neck. And his neck should be level, and kept by its own strength from violent movements. And make him sleep on his back.
And know that this fracture is restored in thirty days, or in thirty-two days: and perhaps it is restored in twenty-eight days. All that is according to the dispositions of the complexions, and the dispositions of the strength.
Concerning the restoration of fractures of the hand.
Know that fracture of the hand's knuckles and the joints of the fingers rarely occurs. And it does not happen to them unless there is very frequent friction.
Therefore, when a fracture or abrasion of the sole occurs, then it is necessary that the infirm person sit square, and a seat be in front of him, according to equality. Then place his hand upon it outstretched.
Then let the attendant extend the fractured bones, and let the physician adjust them until when they are joined with a good union.
Then it is necessary that he apply a plaster and lint, if a hot abscess does not occur. Then place a bolster over it according to the amount of space, and you have already wrapped it in linen cloth.
If however the fracture is towards the lower part, roughly the sole of the foot, then make a sphere from cloth, and command the sick person to tighten it over their fractured foot, then tie it with a long cloth.
And let the bolster be of leather, in which there is softness, so that the leather is applied to the foot's body, and bind it, as is necessary.
If however the fracture is outward, then it is necessary: that you place a bolster over it, and another bolster from below on the sole; and let the hand be open and straight. Then place a bandage, as the hand is turned, and stretch it between the fingers with a ligature.
If, however, a fracture of any of the finger joints occurs, then if it is the thumb, it should be equalized as is necessary. Then it should be bound with the sole; and if you wish, place a small straight bolster under it, so that the fracture is elevated and does not move.
If however the fracture is in the remaining fingers, such as the middle, and index, or ring, and little finger, then it should be equalized, and bound with the healthy finger that follows it; or all should be bound according to continuity; and this is better. Or place a small bolster on it, as we said about the thumb.
And consider in your treatment, and after the resolution of the hot abscess: and apply with it what is necessary, when anything from it occurs, according to the repetition of its account.
Concerning the restoration of a fractured hip.
The hip bone is frequently broken, and is revealed to the senses because it is turned inward and backward.
And its restoration is done so that the ligament above the fracture is tightened, and another ligament below the fracture. And the sick person should lie on their face.
Then the attendant should extend every ligament on its side according to equality; and this, when the fracture is in the middle of the bone.
If however the fracture is near the root of the hip, then the ligament should be on the side of the crest, so that the extension goes upwards; and another ligament beneath the fracture.
And similarly, if the fracture is near the knee, then the ligament should be near the knee, so that the extension is downwards.
Then the physician should align the bone with both his hands, until he restores it according to the likeness of its natural shape, and the bone is joined with a good union.
Then it is necessary that you apply a plaster and a bandage, if a wound does not happen to the limb. If however a wound does occur in it: then leave it for a few days, until the hot wound subsides, then return to your treatment.
However, its bandage should be like this. It is necessary that you wrap a hard bandage over the fracture, that is, a binding, and double it twice, or thrice, and let some excess remain from it. Then bandage the leg, until the heel reaches the root of the buttocks.
And insert a long thread between the thigh and the leg near the lower part of the knee, and let the ends of the thread come from the upper part of the two parts. Then wrap the excess bandage around the leg and thigh.
Then place splints on the thigh, in the place of the fracture itself, and place one splint over the shin bone.
Then fill the spaces between the leg and thigh with soft cloths, so that the tightness is equalized.
Then begin with a strong bandage, from the middle over the fracture site, with three or four turns. And the further you move away from the fracture site with the bandage, the weaker and softer your binding should be.
Then pull on the two ends of the thread that you inserted between the thigh and the leg. Tie therefore with both ends the three splints that are above. Then proceed with the two ends of the thread to the lower parts, until you reach the ankle. And with both ends, tighten also the ends of the splints on the other side, so that the bandage does not shift from its place.
Then loosen the constriction over it, while it remains, so that no corrosion, or abscess, or swelling, or similar things befall the limb. If anything of that sort should happen. Therefore, hasten with its solution, and correct whatever happened from that, completely, according to what we have said many times.
If, however, there is a piece of bone in the bone that pierces: then it is necessary that you should trim it, if it is possible for you. And if not, split over it, and remove it: and treat it with what was previously mentioned, until it is healed.
And sometimes this fracture of the hip is bound, besides which splints are added to it, as we have said in the case of the arm and the hand.
However, in its restoration, if thus fractured, lameness does not befall the sick person. And if it is restored alone, besides which the other leg is applied to it, then it is necessary that the one whose it is should always limp.
And know that the hip is bound in fifty days, or a little is added, or a little is diminished: all of that is according to the diversity of complexions, and the rest of the dispositions.
Concerning the restoration of a fractured kneecap.
Know that a fractured kneecap rarely occurs, but attrition occurs to it many times.
If, however, a fracture occurs to it, then it is only either a fissure or a hole in its parts. And it is with a wound, and without a wound. And the whole of it stands with feeling.
And its restoration is such that the parts of it that are disrupted are made equal with the fingers, until they are aggregated and joined as much as is possible by means of equalization and ease, and fabrication.
Then place a plaster of sesame flour, or mill flour, with egg white; and place a round piece of wood on it, if you need it; and bind it above with a suitable bandage.
Then consider all the dispositions that we have described in other fractures, such as a hot abscess, and similar things: so that you oppose every accident with that which is appropriate to it, until it is healed.
Concerning the restoration of a fractured leg.
Know that the leg has two bones, one of which is thick, and is called the Crural bone; and the other thin, and is called the Tibial bone.
And both types of fractures happen to the two bones of the arm, and because of that its restoration is done, just as the restoration of the arm is done equally, and the operation is the same.
If both bones are broken at the same time, the leg is turned in all directions.
And if the thinner bone is broken, the leg is turned towards the front.
And if the thicker bone is broken, you find it lower; and it is from those that are not hidden from you.
Then administer extension, and alignment, and the ligature of splints according to that equally.
However, if the fracture of the leg is a foul fracture, having much blood: that there be less extension, and gentler alleviation on your part.
And in the leg indeed there is something from the operation above the arm: and it is, that when you align the splints, and complete all your operation, then take two bandages from pinewood, which is used in the fabrication of roofs that are placed under the boards: and they are made from the blades of palm trees: and choose from those which have small thickness, and neither be from small ones: and let their length be according to the length of the leg from the knee downwards.
Then wrap over each bandage with two wrappings according to its length. And place one part of the leg on one side, and the other on the other side: and let them be from the knee down to the foot.
Then tie the two bandages in three places from the two ends and the middle. For when constriction is prohibited, the leg inclines to the right and left, and stands in good position.
And now indeed let a cradle be administered made of wood according to the length of the leg, and let the leg be placed upon it, so as to preserve it from movement.
And indeed it is most necessary that you do this in a fracture when there is a wound properly with it.
Then consider the leg every day, and strive with the utmost care against an abscess, or swelling, or any other similar condition. If therefore anything of those things happens, then oppose it with what is necessary, until it is healed, if God wills.
Of the fracture of the bones of the Foot and Toes.
A fracture of the heel bone does not truly happen.
However, fractures of the bones of the foot sometimes occur, and fractures of the toes also rarely occur; and they do not occur to them except for abrasion in many dispositions.
If a fracture of the foot bones occurs, and you see those bones rising above each other, then the infirm person should place their foot on prepared ground, as if walking.
Then you stand and place your foot on that which is elevated from those bones; afterward press or tread on it, and straighten it until it returns to its place.
Then place a plaster, and linen over it; and place a small board under the sole of the foot, which has two flat ends.
Then bind it with a suitable bandage, after you have wrapped it with cloths and whatever else it needs.
When therefore three or four days have passed, then loosen the bandage. For you will find the bones straightened, whether they were fractured or dislocated. Therefore, the operation on them is as you see.
If any fingers are broken, then restore them and straighten them according to what I have told you in the restoration of the fingers of the hand. Then place a splint along the length of the finger, and let it be a little wider than it; then place under the foot this board which I have told you, and bind it with a suitable bandage.
If, however, what is broken of the bones is two, or three, or more, then place a splint of its size over each finger, wrapped in linen cloth; and bind the board to the lower part of the foot; and let it stand upon one end of the board outside the sole of the foot, so that it holds with good retention.
And it befits you, lest you forget, to consider all that I have said to you concerning other fractures from accidents that we have discussed, and to apply to every accident what is appropriate.
Concerning the fracture of a woman's vulva, and the os pectinis, and a man's penis.
When a woman's vulva is broken, then make her sit square. Then incline her slightly toward her back, and let her be held back.
Then let the midwife fill her vulva with wool, until it fills it: and let there be formed in the vulva from it like a sphere.
Then let the woman be shaken, and raise her back gradually. For that wool will come out, until it becomes like a sphere before the entrance of the vulva, and the broken opening returns.
Then place a cushion on her back. Therefore, when she wishes to urinate, remove the wool with ease, then let her urinate: and return it according to the manner in which you first introduced it: then let her return to her first cushion.
Let her do that for seven days, or thereabouts, for the opening itself is restored.
And if you wish, take a sheep's bladder, and tie a reed cannula over its opening, and introduce the entire bladder into her vulva. Then blow into the cannula with force, until the bladder inflates within the vulva, for the rupture returns.
Then let it be filled with wool, and let it remain for several days, according to what we have described, until it is healed.
And when the bone of the pubis of a man or a woman breaks, then administer in its restoration, and its equalization, that which we have described in the bone of the hip.
And the rectum is not hidden in these nearby fractures, which rarely occur, especially for someone with some skill or experience.
And understand well this book of mine, because the fracture itself signifies to you in many situations the right path to its restoration and its healing: understand therefore.
In the penis of a man, when it breaks, take the throat of a goose, and insert the penis into it. Then place over it a wrapping of cloth, and let it be wrapped, and let it be left for three days, or thereabouts, and it will heal, if God wills.
Concerning the restoration of a fractured bone when it is with a wound.
It befits him who suffers a fracture with a wound, especially if it is large, such as a hip bone, or a femur, or similar to it, to be prompt, and to immediately bleed him: if the circumstances of bleeding warrant it, as we have previously stated.
If the wound is flowing blood, then it is necessary to promptly cauterize it, using ground zegi, if another is not available.
Then begin restoring the fracture on that same day, and do not postpone it, if no abscess has formed.
If, however, a hot abscess forms, then delay its restoration until the ninth day, until the abscess subsides. And do not approach it on the third and fourth days at all, for you would cause him harm.
If, however, the broken bone is protruding above the skin, then it is necessary to attempt to reduce it and align it with your hands with ease and little extension.
If, however, its extension and alignment with your hands is not prepared, then reduce it with this instrument. And it is an instrument made of iron, whose length is the measure of seven or eight fingers, and its width is according to the size of the wound. And it is necessary for the physician to take from them three or four, according to the quantity needed for the treatment of any type of fracture.
And it should be round, and have a small thickness, so that it does not double under compression upon it during the operation; and it should have a sharp tip with a margin at its ends. And its upper part should be thickened from the middle of it down to the lower part.
And this is its form.
In this operation, its sharp curved end must be placed on the protruding bone end, and push it with it in one direction, until the bone returns and is equalized with a certain equality.
Therefore, try to align the fractured ends together.
If its fractured ends are delicate and do not accept the instrument properly, then it is necessary to cut the end of that bone until the instrument has power over it.
If, however, you cannot completely reduce them with what we have described, then cut it with whatever appropriate cutting instrument we have mentioned, or saw it with one of the saws in any way possible for you.
Then scrape away what remains on the bone of roughness and small pieces.
When, therefore, the bone is reduced, and the infirm person finds intense pain, damaging him, after its reduction, then know that the bone has not returned to its natural position.
Therefore, do that. For you confer great benefit on the infirm person, when your restoration of the bone is completed.
Then soak a cloth in astringent, black wine. And properly if it is in summer. And do not put a bandage on the wound, nor anything containing oil, so that it does not cause putrefaction and corruption within it.
Then administer the splints at the hour of completion of your restoration of the bone. And leave the wound uncovered; so that you cut with scissors a hole in the dressings according to the size of the wound.
And beware with every precaution, lest you bind the wound with the fracture. For often foolish physicians have done this, and have caused to befall their sick patients either death, or corruption, or *zuchem*, that is, pus. And let your bandage be soft, gentle, different from the other bandages of the fractures.
If the wound is bad, or is a large wound, and you fear some bad accidents, which we have recounted, and find pain in a suspended place: then it is not necessary that you place splints over it. And make for them wrappings from hard cloths in place of the splints, and bind it with them.
When however it is after one day, or two days, and you see the wound already beginning to produce pus: then remove from over it the cloth which you placed over it with wine. Then administer bandages and ointments with which it is customary for us to treat wounds, such as tetrapharmacon ointment, and similar ones.
And it is fitting for you to loosen the bandage. And consider the wound every day morning and evening, until it is consolidated and healed.
And it is necessary that the limb be prepared in such a way that pus flows from it downwards with ease.
If many days pass over the wound, and it is not consolidated, nor is pus separated from it: then know that there are small bone splinters there. Therefore it is necessary to probe the wound with probes. However, remove any of those splinters that are separated, and extract them. And those of them that are not separated, and pierce the limb, and cause pain to occur, try to cut them out, and remove them by any means possible to you.
If a wound suffers from ulceration, or ecchymosis, that is, festering, or any other type of corruption and putrefaction: then it is necessary to apply to each of them that which is suitable for it from the treatment, whose explanation preceded in its chapter.
And in that which my discourse should address, and to which you should pay attention when a bone is broken and protrudes from the limb, like the hip bone, and the auxiliary bones, and similar ones from the larger limbs, is that you should not attempt to pull it back; for often death results from it. Rather, leave it until it rots.
For perhaps it will fall out by itself after twenty or thirty days.
Then, therefore, treat the wound, if it seems good to you; and if not, leave it.
Concerning the treatment of a knot in the path of a fracture.
This knot often happens in the course of the healing of a fracture. Especially those that are near the joints; and the shape of the limb is disfigured by it. And perhaps it hinders the limb from its natural function.
Therefore, if the knot is recent, apply to it medicines that have astringent properties, such as aloe, and frankincense, and myrrh, and sarcocolla, and acacia, and similar to them.
So that you may take some of these, or all of them: and mix them with astringent wine, or with egg white, or with vinegar: and place them upon the knot in linen, and bind them tightly over it.
And leave the bandage, and do not loosen it for many days. Then loosen it, and apply another, until the knot is removed.
Or bind over it a lead sheet properly. For lead has the property of removing everything that is feared from the limbs.
However, if the knot has already turned into stone, and is tight, and necessity quickly compels its removal: then split over it from above, and cut the protruding excess; or scrape it with certain razors, until it is removed; and care for it until it is healed.
Concerning the treatment when it is restored, and the limb remains after it subtle, not according to its nature.
When a fractured bone is restored, and the limb after it remains thin, weak: then it is not so except for many causes. Of which one is, the multitude of the loosening of the ligament and its ligature not according to what is proper; or because of the excess of the constriction of the ligaments, until the nourishment is prevented from running to the limb; or because of the multitude of unnecessary embrocation at an improper time; or because of the scarcity of blood in the body of the weak person, and his debility.
And the treatment of that is, to feed the weak person, and to make his body soft, until the blood is multiplied in him. And administer a bath. And introduce joy and gladness upon him.
Then place pitch upon the limb, so that the pitch draws to it much nourishment. And assiduously embrocate it with tepid water, until the nourishment flows, and it returns to its natural form.
Concerning the treatment of broken bones when they are restored crookedly.
When, after the healing of a limb that has already been restored, crookedness, and a protrusion of the fractured bone, or a knot, occurs; and the form of the limb is disfigured thereby, yet the limb is not prevented from its natural function; then one should not accept the opinion of whoever thinks that the limb should be broken again.
And many foolish physicians and bone-setters have already done that in our land.
And this operation is indeed very reprehensible, leading to death, or great fear, so that it is deadly.
But if the limping and the knot are recent, then it is necessary to bathe it with lukewarm water in which softening herbs have been boiled, such as marsh-mallow leaves and its root, and melilot, and similar ones. And a plaster should be made with a softening plaster, such as a well-made diachylon.
Or take the mucilage of marsh-mallow root, and mix it with hen's fat, or sesame oil; and plaster it with it.
Or take fat figs, and grind them with pigeon dung, and similar things called medicines that diminish consolidation.
And sometimes the knot is loosened by diligent, long-standing, gentle friction, which is done with moist hands. And movement of the limb should be administered to every part at all hours.
If, however, twisting has already preceded, and become strong, and turned into stone, and the need has arisen to treat it with iron: then it is necessary that it be cut above it, and the continuity of the bone be loosened, and that which is superfluous from the knot or bone be cut with very small knives; and ease should be administered to it with care and diligence.
Concerning the speech on Dislocation.
Dislocation is the departure of any joints from their place. Therefore it is prevented from its movement, and the shape of the limb is marred. And it causes great pain and severe injuries to the weak.
Therefore, when a dislocation occurs in someone, then one must hasten to restore it; nor should one delay it at all.
For if it is delayed, the place becomes suppurated, and perhaps the reduction of the dislocation with it.
Therefore, it is not appropriate to move or extend it during the time of its suppuration. Because it often causes spasm and painful injuries.
But when that happens, then it is necessary to hasten to phlebotomy of the sick person. Then let it be left until the abscess subsides.
Then the limb should be bathed with warm water and oil. Then it should be reduced with ease.
And every limb should be treated with that whose recollection will come into its place.
I have indeed already ordained the chapters on dislocation, even as it preceded in fracture, from the upper part of the body down to its lower part.
Concerning the treatment of the dislocation of the lower jaw.
The two jaws are rarely dislocated except rarely.
And the dislocation of both occurs according to one of two ways. For either they are removed from their places by a small removal, and softened a little. Or they are dislocated by a complete dislocation, until they soften to the side of the chest, until the sick person's saliva runs, and cannot hold it, nor can he close his mouth, and his tongue is wrapped up with his speech.
When however the dislocation of it is small, then it returns in many dispositions by itself with little difficulty.
If however it is a complete, entire dislocation, then it is necessary that its reduction be administered quickly, and not delayed at all: and it is that the minister hold the sick person's head, and the physician insert the thumb of one of his hands into the root of the dislocated jaw between his mouth, if the dislocation is on one side. Or let him insert two of his thumbs together, if the dislocation is on two sides. And the remaining fingers of his hands be outside, with which he will steady it.
And command the sick person to cleanse his jaws and allow them to move for eating in every direction. And the physician will steady the jaw and push the jaw until it returns to its place.
If its reduction is difficult, especially if both jaws are locked together, then administer vaporization with hot water and oil, until the reduction of both is easy; and do not delay the reduction of both at all, as we have said.
When therefore they return and are steadied, and the sick person's mouth is closed, and they do not soften: then place upon them pads of cloth, with a plaster made of wax and rose oil.
Then it shall be bound with ease with soft bandages.
And let the sick person's sleep be upon his back, and let his head be supported between two pillows, so that he does not move it to the right and left, nor attempt or be forced to chew anything; rather, let his food be of a gentle liquid consistency, until when the pains are removed, and the jaw is set, then let him eat what he wishes, and let it be administered with ease.
Let him not exert himself upon the operation of his mouth in eating and drinking and yawning until the jaw is set and healed.
If the reduction of the two jaws becomes difficult when they are dislocated at some time, and do not return to their places, then fever and constant perspiration often result; and perhaps the sick person's bowels are loosened, and perhaps they vomit pure bile.
Therefore, when you see this, know that it is loss, and often the one to whom this happens dies within ten days.
Concerning the reduction of the dislocation of the collarbone and the extremity of the humerus.
The collarbone is indeed not dislocated from its inner side, because of its continuity with the chest. And it is sometimes dislocated outward, and this is apparent to the senses.
And its restoration is that the infirm person lie on their back and extend their arms. Then, grasp the place firmly with the palm of your hand, for it will return.
Then place a plaster and bandages over it and bind it tightly.
However, its extremities that follow the elbow, and are continuous with it, are not dislocated, except rarely. If, however, it is dislocated on any day, then it is necessary that it be reduced and set in accordance with what we have said and what is prepared for you.
Then place a plaster, bandages, and a binding over it. And command the sick person to adhere to tranquility and rest until healed.
And with this same treatment, the humerus extremity is reduced when it is also separated from its place.
Concerning the reduction of the dislocation of the Humerus.
Know that the Humerus is not dislocated except in three ways.
One of which is that it is dislocated towards the armpit downwards. The second is that it is dislocated towards the chest. And perhaps it is dislocated to the upper part of the Humerus: and that happens rarely.
And it is not dislocated to the rear, because of the scapula. And it is not dislocated to the front, because of the nerves.
And very often it is dislocated and exits downwards towards the tickle: especially in those whose flesh is few. Because it emerges in them quickly, and enters quickly.
In those, however, whose flesh is plentiful, it is the opposite, namely, because it emerges with difficulty, and enters with difficulty.
And perhaps it happens to some men through a blow, or a fall, and the humerus is ulcerated with a hot ulcer, and it is thought because of that, that it is now dislocated.
Therefore, it is necessary that you test it, until you stand on the certainty of it, and then proceed in its treatment.
And dislocation is known when it is towards the lower part, touching the skin: and distinguish between the dislocated humerus and the healthy humerus. For you find a clear difference among them, and you find a concavity in the head of the humerus, and under the skin, touching the head of the humerus, as if it were an egg itself; and the afflicted person cannot bring the hand to their ear, nor move it in all directions.
And similarly, if it is dislocated towards the chest, or upwards, then you find a clear touch, and it is not hidden.
And indeed, a simple reduction of this dislocation is possible when it is recent, or the affected person is a child.
And its reduction is to raise the hand of the attendant upwards. Then place your thumbs under its skin, and raise the joint with strength upwards to its place; and let the attendant raise their hand, and extend it upwards. Then place it lower, for it returns quickly itself.
However, if it does not return through what we have said, and there have been many days since the dislocation occurred, then it is necessary that the affected person bathe in warm water, and that an embrocation be administered which softens and soothes, such as if roots of marshmallow, and fenugreek, and melilot are boiled in water, and administered.
Then the sick person shall lie supine on their back; and a sphere and wool, which shall be equal between softness and firmness, shall be placed under their skin.
Then the physician shall place their heel on the sphere, and lift the head of the shoulder with strength, and pull the sick person's hand downwards.
And if you wish, reduce it according to this method: and it is to be done by having a man present who is taller than the sick person, and standing at the side, and inserting his shoulder under the sick person's armpit; and lifting their armpit upwards, until the sick person is suspended in the air. And another attendant shall pull the sick person's hand downwards towards their abdomen. If however the sick person is light, then it is necessary that something else be suspended with them, so as to weigh them down; for the dislocation returns immediately.
And it is also reduced according to another method: and it is that a long piece of wood is fixed in the ground, whose head is round in shape, like the sleeve of a mortar; which should not be thick, nor thin. Then, a soft cloth is placed under the sick person after being placed on the head of the wood; and the sick person stands along the length of the wood.
Then, the sick person's hand should be extended downwards on one side, and the body extended on the other side with strength; for the joint returns to its place with speed.
If its reduction is difficult through all that we have said, then use this treatment: and it is that you should take a piece of wood whose length is the measure of two arms, and its width the measure of four fingers, and its thickness the measure of two fingers; to which there should be a round head, so that its entry into the depth of the socket is alleviated, according to this shape.
Then, soft cloths are tied to the round head, so that the wood does not injure the sick person.
Then, place the wood under the sick person's socket, so that the hand or arm is extended downwards over the wood; and tie the wood to the support, arm, and hand's extremity.
Then, place the arm on a step of a ladder in width, and extend the hand downwards, and let the rest of the body hang suspended from the other side. The joint immediately enters.
When, therefore, its entry is completed in whatever way is possible, then it is necessary that you place a sphere of equal quantity of wool under the socket. Then place the prepared plaster from the mill's powder with frankincense and egg white over the entire shoulder, as it revolves from above.
Then bind a suitable bandage under the socket, and wrap the bandage over the plaster from above; and tie its hand to its neck, and let it hang, and do not move its hand for seven days.
And it is necessary that little food be given to the sick person until the limb is strengthened, because this is more rapid for its healing.
Then a larger one is placed after seven days, or five, and is exercised with movement. If, therefore, it is strengthened and does not soften, then it is now healed.
If, however, the joint is dislocated repeatedly, due to the moisture that occurs in it, or due to another cause, then it is necessary that a cautery with three openings be administered to it, according to what has been previously stated in the chapter on cautery.
If all this is done, and the ligament loosens after seven days, and the joint does not strengthen, and the plaster and constriction are applied to it repeatedly, and it does not strengthen, and it falls, and it cannot raise itself upwards, then know that the nerves belonging to the head of the humerus are now cut, or stretched, or softened: and know that the joint will never be fixed in its place.
The reduction of dislocations occurring towards the breast and nipple, or towards the back, is performed with pushing and pulling with the hands, until it returns, and the remaining constriction and care are administered to it until it is healed.
If, after healing, heaviness occurs in the limb and slowness in its movement, then let the infirm use the bath repeatedly until that heaviness is lessened and it returns to its original nature.
Concerning the treatment of elbow dislocation.
Know that the elbow joint dislocates with difficulty, and similarly returns with difficulty.  It dislocates in all directions, and especially forward or backward.
And its dislocation is not hidden from you, because it is evident to the eye and to the touch, whatever the configuration of the dislocation. And when you join the dislocated elbow to the sound one, that will be evident to you. For the joint is hollowed out, and cannot double the arm, nor can it touch its own shoulder.
And it is necessary that you hurry and reduce the dislocation promptly, before a hot abscess occurs in it.
For if a hot abscess occurs in it, its reduction becomes difficult, and perhaps it will not be healed at all, especially when it is towards the back. For it is worse than all other types of dislocations, and more painful than them: and often death comes with it.
And the restoration of it, when it is of those that can be reduced, is that his hand should be extended with two hands, and his arm be stretched out, and the physician's hands be above and below the elbow, and he should press the joint with the thumbs of his hands together, or with the root of his palm, until it returns to its place.
Or indeed the dislocation is towards the front: then it is restored thus, that he should double his hand with his hand, until he strikes with the root of his palm the elbow which is dislocated.
If the dislocation does not yield to reduction, then administer a very strong, forceful extension; and it is that two assistants should extend the arm, and two assistants should hold him as well, so that he is not moved during the extension.
Then the arm is to be revolved in every direction after a long doubled cloth, or a wide bandage, has been wrapped around his hand.
And when the physician touches the joint with his hand, let him anoint it with oil, so that it may be of those things which aid in the lubrication of the joint with ease. Then he should drive the joint with a forceful impulse until it returns.
And after its reduction, a plaster containing astringency and desiccation with egg white should be placed upon it, and bound with a suitable bandage. And let the arm be suspended from the sick person's neck, and leave it for a few days.
Then it should be released. If therefore the joint is firmly fixed in its place, then release the bandage from it, and leave it.
And if you see the joint not being properly bound, then apply the plaster and bandage again, and leave it for a few days, until it is bound. Then release it.
If, however, after the reduction of the joint, heaviness occurs, and the condition is in motion, then administer moistening in bathing, and gentle friction and compression until it is lined, or place on the joint a fattened ram's buttock, that is, an iliac. Then bandage it, and leave it over it by day and by night. Then remove it, and introduce it into a bath. When therefore it sweats, then rub the joint with moderate friction. Then repeat over it with aleliati once, and twice, and thrice with the entrance into the bath, until it is soothed.
And if you wish, place upon it a moist, warmed cow dung with butter, and wrap over it.
Do that several times. For it is soothed, and returns to its proper condition.
Concerning the treatment of the dislocation of Almahassem.
The joint between the arm and hand, the Mahassem, is often dislocated.
And the reduction of its dislocation is easy. In contrast to other joints. However, speed is necessary in reducing its dislocation at the time it is dislocated, before the site becomes suppurated, or a hot abscess occurs in it.
And the reduction of its dislocation is that you place the weak hand's Mahassem on a table, and the assistant extends his hand, and the physician places his palm over the prominence of the joint, and pushes it until it returns.
However, it is necessary to consider if the palm has already receded towards the hand's stomach; then let the weak person place the back of his hand on the table at the time of extension and reduction; and if the dislocation is proceeding towards the back of the hand, then let his hand's position be interiorly on the table, that is, the inside part of his hand be placed on the table, so that the physician's hand falls on the very prominence of the joint.
If therefore it returns immediately, it is good; and if not, then bind it with a soothing plaster for the abscess, and leave it, and do not repeat it.
For if it does not tolerate it, nor can you achieve its reduction after days have passed, but the joint remains according to its twisting, and does not harm the sick person in any way other than that the hand becomes soft and cannot grasp anything, then know that the nerves are severed, or frayed.
Therefore there is no remedy for it, except to be cauterized near its location. And perhaps it does not contribute anything.
When therefore the Almahassem does not return, then put upon it the plaster, which we have narrated. Then let it be cauterized, and let it be left for five days; afterward let it be released and left, and let the hand be exercised.
However, if its movement is deprived, and something serious happens to it, then gently treat it with warm water, and friction several times, until it is soothed.
Concerning the treatment of the dislocation of the Fingers.
When a finger is dislocated from its place in any direction, or a finger is dislocated toward the back of the palm or the front of it, then extend the finger and push the dislocation with your thumbs until it returns.
Then support the head of the finger, and suspend it towards the part to which it is dislocated, and leave it for two days.
Then suspend it, and extend it, until it is straightened on that day.
When therefore it is night, bind it according to the description itself: and do not cease to loosen it in the day: and exercise it with motion: and bind it at night.
Do that for several days, until it is strong.
And similarly do with it, if it is dislocated to the palm of the hand: and bind it to the part itself, and perform your first operation upon it, until it is healed.
And similarly do with it when it is dislocated to the other parts.
Concerning the treatment of the dislocation of the spinal column.
When it happens to someone that the spinal column, or the neck, has a complete dislocation, or many vertebrae are removed from their places: then there is no cure in it, because death is imminent for the sick person.
And a sign of this is that the excretion of the sick person emerges without their will, and they cannot hold it: and often some of his limbs are softened, or his two legs, or his two arms, or one of them; or one vertebra is removed from its place.
For often it is removed, for often their removal occurs in four directions.
Therefore, that which is removed backwards is called a hump.
However, its treatment is that you should then consider, if the hump occurs from childhood: then there is no treatment for it, nor is there any healing from it at all.
However, in that which occurs from an accident, or a blow, or similar things to these, the ancients have already described methods of treatment in lengthy speech. Of which much does not return with profit.
I, however, have already abbreviated it, of which little excuses from much of it, from my closeness to the intention: and by my exposition in which I have explained it, and formed its instrument in a different way from that in which they showed it and explained it.
Therefore, I say that in a hump which occurs on the front part, there is no skill, nor healing from it.
And similarly in that which is made on both sides also.
And it is not treated from them, unless that which occurs on the back properly, with what I relate: and it is, that the sick man should be extended on his face on a level platform near a wall: and wet straw should be spread beneath him, so that his chest is not harmed.
Then a straight piece of wood, fixed in a hole in the ground, at the end of the platform, about the level of his head: and another piece of wood about the level of his feet at the other end of the platform: and let the attendant hold the wood, and let it not be firmly fixed in the hole. And another attendant hold the other.
Then wrap a soft, firm bandage around the head of the sick person, and under his armpits: and extend the end of the bandage to the wood which is by his head: and tie it to it.
Then tighten another bandage above his armpits, and above his knees, and at his ankles. Then gather all the bandages together, and tie them to the other piece of wood which is by his feet.
Then let every attendant extend the bandage to the side of the wood, and let the two pieces of wood not be moved from the places where they are fixed: but let them not be firmly secured, as we said.
And the physician should place his palms on the vertebra with force, until it returns to its place; or place a board on it. Then he ties his feet to the board, until it returns to its place.
If, however, it does not return through this treatment, then take a board whose length is approximately three arms' length. And hollow out in the wall, of which we said that it is near the sick person, a place for the end of the board to enter. Then place the middle of the board on the vertebra. And let the physician place his feet on the other end. And tie it well, until the vertebra is constricted, and returns to its place.
Then, if you wish, work with a lathe that is wrapped with your hand: and it is, that you fix into the ground near the head of the sick person at the furthest end of the platform two pieces of wood, whose length is that of one arm; and near his head at the furthest end of the platform two pieces of wood.
And let the length between each piece of wood be one palm; and now a hole has been made in each place, through which the lathe runs; and let all the wood be firmly fixed in the ground so that it does not move at all.
And let a round piece of wood be inserted; and the lathe is in which the ligament revolves in the two holes of the two pieces of wood.
And at its end is a hole, in which the wood is fixed, whose length is a palm along with that which revolves; and in the other two pieces of wood is similarly that of it.
Then tighten the ligaments that you have tied around the chest of the sick person on the lathe that is near his head; and the ligaments that you have tied around his legs on the lathe that is near his feet.
Then let a servant stand by each lathe, who shall turn his hand with the rope, with which the lathe revolves; and let the physician adjust the Spondyle, according to what we have said.
This is the form of the lathe, which follows.
Then, after the Spondyle has returned and the place is adjusted, it is necessary that you apply a drying plaster with egg white. Then linen. Then place a small board over the plaster, whose width is three fingers, or approximately that. And its length the quantity that takes the place of the Hump, and over the healthy part of the Spondyle.
Then bind it with the bandage we mentioned. And let the sick person use delicate nourishment until they are healed.
If something of prominence remains in the place at the end of the healing, then it is necessary that medicines that soften and soothe be administered, with the administration of the board that we described for a long time. And now a lead plate is administered to it.
And sometimes a prominence occurs in the final part of the spine of the back; and it is thought to be a dislocation, and that is the bone that is now prominent. Therefore, it is not appropriate that a presumption be made for it with this medicine; for perhaps it will cause death.
Concerning the treatment of a dislocated shoulder.
Know that the articulation of the shoulder, and the articulation of the humerus, does not happen, except for dislocation alone; nor does it happen to them what happens to the other joints from a small displacement and concavity.
And indeed the shoulder joint is dislocated according to four parts. That is, because it is dislocated forward, and backward.
And it is most dislocated inwards; and it is little dislocated forwards, and backwards.
And the treatment of its dislocation inwards is: because when you join the healthy leg of the weak one with the weak one, it is longer; and his knee is more prominent than that of the healthy one, and the weak one cannot bend his foot at the groin; and there is a place which follows the groin, suppurating with a hot abscess, because the head of the thigh has already reached there.
And the sign of him who has experienced a dislocation outwards is that his symptoms are the opposite of these symptoms.
And the sign of him who has experienced a dislocation forward is that he stretches the healthy leg to its fullest extent; however, he does not bend it without pain which is in the knee; and if he attempts to walk, he cannot step forward over it; and his urine is retained, and his groin suppurates, and in walking his foot is on the heel.
And the sign of him who has experienced a dislocation backward is that he does not extend his knee, nor can he bend it before bending his groin; and his leg is also shorter than the other; and the groin is softened, and the head of the thigh is at the place of the ilium.
The reduction of these types of dislocation, however, is that you must then consider if the dislocation is old, which has already become established in the sufferer. Then if you administer its reduction, and it remains in its position, then there is no cure for it at all. Therefore, it is not appropriate to make a complete presumption about it.
However, in the case of someone whose dislocation is recent, and is of one of the four types of dislocation, then hasten to this, so that you can grasp the joint, and extend it inwardly and outwardly, and move it right and left; for perhaps it will return, and will not require any further treatment.
If, however, it does not return in this way, then it is necessary to prepare a strong assistant, and have him extend the leg from the lower part, either with his hands or with a bandage tied above the leg above the knee, and another assistant extend his hand from above, so that he places his hands under the person's toes. Then he should tie with a soft bandage over the root of the thigh, and hold the other end of the bandage.
And let the extension be either from the front of the groin to the part of the crotch, or from the back to the part of the back.
And let the extension of all of them be at one time, until the sick person is raised with their body from the ground, and remains hanging.
And this type of extension is a common type of the four types.
If therefore the dislocation returns with what we have said, it is good; and if not, then it is necessary for every type that I will say about its own cure.
In the reduction of it indeed, when the dislocation is inward, it is necessary that the sick person be laid on their healthy side. Then let a bandage be placed over the root of the thigh, in that which is between the head of the thigh, and the place which is under the groin. Then extend the bandage upwards from the groin to the higher part of the body, to the part of the fork.
Then let another strong attendant take his arms, and lessen the thick place of the sick person's thigh, and extend it outward with a violent extension. For now it returns to its place.
And this type is easier than the other types of treatment, by which this limb is reduced.
However, if it resists you and does not obey you in entering with this type of treatment at all: then it is necessary that the two feet of the sick person be bound together with a strong, gentle bandage, over the two heels and over the two knees; and the length of each [bandage] from its partner should be the quantity of four fingers; and the sick leg should be extended by more than the other by the quantity of two fingers.
Then let the sick person be suspended over a piece of wood that is in the house; and its length from the ground should be the quantity of two arms.
Then command a strong young man to secure the head of the thigh; and let another young man be suspended with the sick person; and let another young man, securing the thigh with strength, drive it, for the joint returns to its place with speed.
However, in its own return, when the dislocation is to the outside, it is necessary that the sick person lie on a platform, according to what we have described in the case of a hunchback. And a bandage should be tied around his sick leg and over his chest.
Then two pieces of wood should be placed, one at his feet, and the other at his head. Then let a piece of wood be placed added in the middle of the platform, firmly fixed; upon which let moist cloths be wrapped, so that it does not harm the sick person; and let the wood be between his thighs, so that it is not pulled downwards during the extension.
Then let each attendant pull towards their side, and the physician adjust the reduction with his hand.
If therefore it yields to the return, it will be good.
And if not, place it upon the board itself, and press it, as we have said concerning the curvature, equally. However, it is necessary that the sick person lie on their healthy side.
And when the dislocation is towards the front, then it is necessary that the leg of the sick person be stretched quickly: and it is according to this same account upon a platform: and let the physician place the palm of his right hand upon the groin of the sick person. Then he constricts it with the other hand, and with that constriction places it extended downwards to the part of the knee.
And if the dislocation is towards the back, then it is not necessary that the sick person be extended downwards and be raised from the ground; rather, it is necessary that he be placed upon a hard thing, as is necessary, as is also done if his hip is dislocated outwards, according to that which we said about his lying upon his two hips: and it is upon his face, and the ligaments extended, according to what we said recently.
And it is necessary that compression be administered with a board also upon the place to which the joint emerges, when the reduction is completed according to what is necessary.
And the sign of its return is not hidden from you: and it is, that you extend the two legs of the sick person; and when you see them equal, and the sick person tightens his leg and expands it without excuse: then know that the limb is now returned, as it should be; then join the two hips, and place a plaster, and bind with a bandage, that is, a roller: so that the hip does not move to any parts; and let the sick person adhere to rest for three or four days.
Then loosen the bandage and the plaster, and compare the leg with the other; then if you see them equal in condition, then know that the dislocation is now firm; therefore release the sick person to walk.
And if you see any softening, then return and plaster it, and bind it according to your first binding; and leave it also for three days.
Then loosen it and make him/her slow in walking on both legs for several days, until it is strengthened well.
Concerning the dislocation of the knee.
The knee is dislocated in three ways. It is dislocated outwards, inwards, and downwards, namely backwards.
And it is not dislocated forwards.
And a sign of its dislocation is that you should instruct the sick person to apply their leg to their thigh. If however it does not adhere to the thigh: then know that the knee is dislocated.
And the restoration of all the ways of its dislocation is that you make the sick person sit upright, so that if he can, he extends his leg over it, and you adhere your back to his face, and place his foot between your feet.
Then make him adhere his knee with your palms, and straighten them between your fingers over his knee. Then apply with your palm the two sides of his knee with strength. And another attendant should extend his leg until the knee returns to its place.
And the sign of its return is that the leg adheres to the thigh with gentleness, not with hardship.
Then plaster it, and make the leg adhere to the thigh. Then bind them together with a bandage for three days, or four. Then loosen them.
And let the infirm person not use walking for some days, until healed.
If however its reduction is refused to you, then administer a strong extension with bandages, whose account preceded in the treatment of a dislocation, until it returns.
Concerning the treatment of dislocation of the heel.
The heel sometimes is moved by a small displacement, and sometimes is dislocated according to its full extent. And its dislocation occurs either towards the inside or towards the outside.
And the sign of its dislocation is that you see the heel swollen, protruding towards the side to which it is dislocated.
The treatment of its displacement is easy through returning it: and it is that it be gently extended with the hands, and brought to its place, until it returns.
However, in treating it when it is dislocated completely, it is necessary to have the sick person sit upright, and a strong assistant hold them firmly from the back of their spine, in the middle of it.
Then, take the foot from above with your right hand, and with your left hand from below the foot at the ankle joint.
Then pull the foot towards you with your right hand. Then with the left hand, twice.
Then extend with the left hand, and push the foot's chest with the right hand towards the leg without effort.
Do that twice, as we have said.
Then push the foot's chest towards the leg for the third time, and you pull the heel.
If therefore it returns in one time, or in two according to this manner, and you see the foot made even, it is good: and if not, then repeat the operation upon it, because it returns.
If however its reduction is prohibited to you with that which we have said: then cause the sick person to lie on his back on the ground, and fix a very firm peg in the ground, so that it falls between his thighs: and you have now wrapped a cloth around him, so that he does not injure the sick person.
Then let the attendant take his thigh; afterwards let the attendant extend the foot, either with his hands, or with a bandage which binds on the foot's ankle. Then let all the attendants extend against the extension of their counterpart; and let the peg stand between the sick person's two thighs, holding him, so that his body is not pulled downwards at the extension.
Then the physician shall correct the dislocation with his hands, and another attendant shall hold the healthy leg downwards. For the dislocation returns with speed.
Therefore, when the dislocation returns, and its return is declared to you as health, then apply a plaster and lint, and bind it firmly with bandages, and tie the foot with a bandage to the leg.
And it is necessary that you beware or fear the nerves that are above the posterior heel, so that the bandage is not too tight on them and injures them.
Then leave it for two days, or three. If the ligament softens, bind it again; then loosen it on the third or fourth day; and prohibit the sick person from walking for forty days. If, however, he attempts to walk before that period, there is no security that the dislocation will not resolve on him, and become corrupted, and not receive cure afterward.
If a hot abscess occurs to him, then it is necessary that you administer to it the treatment described earlier in our account elsewhere, and a poultice, until it is removed.
Concerning the dislocation of the toes of the foot, and its treatment.
It is necessary that what is dislocated of them be set back in place with a little extension, without effort; and indeed this is not difficult, but rather easy.
However, if the dislocation is in some nodes of the back of the foot, then it is necessary that the sick person place their foot on a level place, or on a board; and it stands as if walking.
Then you stand, and place your foot on that which protrudes from those joints. Then press it with your foot with force, until it returns, and you see it now set in place, and no protrusion appears in the location.
Then place under the sole of his foot a board that encompasses the entire foot, having two ends. Then bind it with a suitable bandage for three days. Then loosen it, and allow him to rest from walking for many days, until it is strengthened and secured from the reduction.
Concerning the types of dislocations with wound or fracture.
When something of that sort occurs, and you attempt its treatment and restoration, often death results.  Therefore, one should not undertake such treatment unless one is experienced in the art, compassionate, pious, slow, not bold, nor presumptuous; and should use at the outset only medications that soothe hot abscesses, and leave the infirm to divine judgment. Unless you see, or hope for, salvation from destruction with the easing of the illness, and in which something appears hopeful. Therefore, attempt its reduction immediately at the beginning of the matter, before a hot abscess occurs.
If, therefore, the limb returns as we wish, then administer a regimen that soothes the abscess, and treat the wound with whatever drying ointments are suitable for it.
If, however, the dislocation is with a fracture, and separate bone protrusions occur, then attempt to remove them, and do in that case what we have said regarding simple illnesses from what has preceded in their locations.
And beware, according to your ability, and guard yourself from entering the path of fear, according to what my instruction has preceded for you.
For that is better for you before your Creator, and more enduring for your glory, and more salutary for your body among those in your time.
