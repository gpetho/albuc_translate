The sixth chapter on the treatment of what falls into the ear.	CHAPTER six. On the treatment of things that fall into the ear.	0.85357344
Everything that falls into the ear is one of four types: either a mineral stone or something like stone, such as iron and glass; or a plant seed, such as chickpeas and kernels, and so on; or a flowing thing, such as water and vinegar, and so on; or an animal.	All that falls into the ear comes under four categories: mineral stone, or what resembles stone, such as iron or glass; vegetable grain such as pea or date-stone or the like; or liquid such as water or vinegar; or animal.	0.9190389
When a pebble or something like a pebble, which does not grow in the ear, falls into the ear, face the ear towards the sun. If you see the pebble, drop in it a bit of violet oil or candle wax, then try to remove it by moving the head or by sneezing with hellebore, blocking the nostrils when the sneeze comes, after placing a ring of rags or wool around the ear and pulling the ear upwards; often it comes out with this treatment.	When a stone or something of that sort that does not grow gets into the ear, turn the ear toward the sun. If you see the stone, pour upon it a little oil of violets or sesame; then try to get it out by moving the head or by inducing sneezing with ptarmica and keeping the nose closed at the onset of sneezing, having first made round the ear a circle of pieces of cloth or wool and drawn the ear upwards. This treatment will usually bring it out.	0.9084202
If it doesn't come out, then try to remove it with the gentle instrument which is pictured here:	But if it does not come out, try to get it out with a fine pair of tweezers shaped thus.	0.6186779
If it comes out with the husk, fine, otherwise try to extract it with a smooth, blunt hook with little curvature.	If it comes out with the tweezers, good. But if not, try to extract it with a fine blunt hook slightly curved.	0.8488884
If it doesn't come out with that, then make a tube of copper and insert the end of the tube gently into the ear hole. And seal around the tube with pitch softened with oil so that the air has no path except through the tube. Then suck it out with your breath strongly and often it comes out with this.	And if this does not bring it out, make a bronze tube and introduce the end of the tube well into the meatus of the ear and fill in round with wax softened with oil so that there may be no outlet save through the tube; then suck it out with all your breath; it will often come out with this.	0.90334815
If it doesn't come out with what we described, then take a small amount of gum arabic or processed gum, which is used for catching birds. Place it at the tip of the probe after wrapping tightly around it some cotton. Then insert it gently into the ear hole after drying the ear from moisture.	But if it does not come out with these means we have described, take turpentine resin or bird-lime, a very little; twist some compact cotton wool on the end of a probe and put this on the tip; then introduce it gently into the ear after you have dried out all the moisture from the ear.	0.77751505
If it doesn't come out with all that we described, then proceed to incision before a hot swelling occurs or it becomes tense.	But if your treatment so far is unavailing, then be quick and incise before an abscess or spasm supervene.	0.6643535
The method of incision is to first phlebotomize the patient in the cephalic vein and draw blood according to his strength. Then sit the patient before you and turn his ear upwards and make a small incision at the base of the ear near its lobe in the lower part of it. And the incision should be crescent-shaped until you reach the stone. Then extract it with whatever instruments you can.	Now this is the way to incise: first, the patient's cephalic vein should be cut and blood drawn, in proportion to his strength; then seat the patient in front of you and turn his ear upwards; make a small incision at the lobule of the ear in the depression there (the incision should be crescent-shaped) until you reach the stone; then extract it with whatever instrument you may.	0.88181823
Then stitch the incision immediately quickly and treat it until it heals.	Immediately afterwards sew up the incision and dress it till healed.	0.7893628
But if the thing that has fallen into the ear is one of the grains that swell and expand, try to extract it with what we mentioned.	If the object that falls into the ear is one of those grains that grow or swell, then try to extract it by the means already mentioned.	0.80898494
If it doesn't come out, then take a thin, delicate scalpel like this: And try with it to break up that type of grain fallen in the ear.	If it does not respond to your efforts to get it out, take a fine narrow scalpel like this and with it attempt to cut out whatever kind of grain has entered the ear.	0.76352686
And you only do that if you are certain that that grain has been moistened by the earâ€™s vapor until it becomes many small pieces.	You should not do this except when you are sure that this grain has become moist by reason of the vapours of the ear, so that you may cut up the grain into several small pieces.	0.7567104
Then you extract it with the blind hook, or with soft date fibers, or by sucking, as we mentioned. For that makes its extraction easy.	Then you may extract them with a blunt hook or fine-headed tweezers, or by suction, as we have mentioned; for their extraction will be easy.	0.87524974
As for water that has entered the ear, the patient should first use sneezing with hellebore. And he should have filled his ear with some worn cotton while lying down on that ear in which the water is.	As for water getting into the ear, the patient should first employ sneezing excited by ptarmica, his ear having been plugged with a piece of teased-out cotton; he should lie upon that ear in which the water is; and if it so come out, well and good.	0.8003736
If it comes out with that, fine; otherwise, take many pebbles the length of fingers, thin and smooth. Warm them a little with fire. And the patient inserts one of them into the opening of his ear. And he hops on one foot on that side.	But if not, take a number of small stones about a finger's length, thin and smooth, and warm them a little in the fire; and have the patient put one of them into the meatus of the ear and let him hop on that one foot on that side; and, with another stone, tap upon the one put into the ear; he should keep this up with stone after stone till all the water has come out.	0.82764566
The water may also come out by taking one papyrus reed or feather. And insert one end of it into the ear. And set fire to the other end until most of it burns. Then repeat with another feather, doing this several times until all the water comes out.	Sometimes the water is extracted by taking a reed or quill and introducing one end into the ear; then the other end is set alight till the greater part of it is burnt; then repeat time after time with more quills till all the water is got out.	0.82279825
Or you can draw it out with the tube in the way that was described with the pebble.	Or else suck it out with a cannula as described for a stone.	0.7857832
As for removing an animal that has entered the ear, observe: if it is small-bodied like a flea or similar, treat it with what I mentioned in the section.	As for the extraction of a creature getting into the ear, look to see if it is small of body, such as a flea or the like, in which case treat by those means mentioned in the section.	0.78073156
But if its body is large, perceptible to the senses, try to extract it with date fibers and hooks. Its case is easier than anything that gets stuck in the ear.	But if it has a large body, conspicuous to the touch, try to get it out with tweezers and hooks; for of all things that stick in the ear this is the easiest to extract.	0.84884715
As for removing worms that have developed in the ear, if you treated it with what we mentioned in the section on ear drops and your treatment was not successful, then you should look into the ear in the sun, and if any worms appear to you, extract them with date fibers or soft hooks.	As for the extraction of a worm generated in the ear, when you have unavailingly treated it by those methods mentioned in the section in the treatise on instillations, you will need to examine the ear in the sunlight; and if you can see any worms, extract with tweezers or fine hooks.	0.8436073
If none appear to you, then take a tube; this is its form: Narrow at the bottom and wide at the top. And insert the thin end into the ear as much as the patient can bear. Then suck with it strongly.	But if you cannot see any, then take a cannula of this form narrow in its lower part, broad above; and introduce the narrow part into the ear as far as the patient can bear it; then make strong suction through it, repeatedly, till all the worms are extracted.	0.8002678
If it doesn't come out, seal around the tube with wax as I mentioned to you regarding the stone.	But if they do not come out in response to your treatment, plug all round the cannula with wax as bidden in treating for a stone.	0.67572105
If it doesn't come out with what we mentioned, use the ear drops that I mentioned. The ancients have tried it in killing worms. And you will find that in the article on ear drops.	If nothing will bring them out, employ the instillations which I mentioned as having been tried by the Ancients for killing worms; you will find that in the treatise on instillations.	0.80447924
As you see, you make it from silver or copper, narrow at the bottom, with a small hole in it, and wide at the top.	The instillation of oils or drugs should be done with an instrument like this, as you will see; you make it of silver or bronze, narrow at its lower end, with a small perforation, and wide at its upper part.	0.76435935
And if you wish, the nozzle that is inside the tube can be made of well-wrought copper. And if you wish, you take a probe and wrap cotton around its end tightly, then you put the oil or juice or whatever you want of these medications into the tube while it is in the ear, then you insert the probe with the cotton from above and squeeze it with your hand with a moderate squeeze until the oil is pushed into the ear canal and the patient feels it entering.	If you wish, you may make the obturator which goes in the cannula of strong bronze; or, if you like, take a probe and wrap cotton wool tightly round its tip; then pour into the cannula oil, juices, or whatever of these remedies you want, with the cannula in the ear. Then introduce the probe with cotton wool on it and press moderately until the oil is ejected into the meatus and the patient feels it enter.	0.88189584
And let what you pour into the ear be slightly warmed by the fire. And beware that the thing that is instilled in it not be very cold or very hot, because the ear cannot tolerate that.	Let that which you put into the ear first be slightly warmed at the fire; and be careful that it be neither very hot nor very cold, for the ear is not suited to bear that.	0.9095499
