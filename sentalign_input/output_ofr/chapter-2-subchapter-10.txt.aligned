Exinach is a fat that is generated in the tissues of the upper eyelids, and this happens more to children than to any other people, and it greatly bothers their eyes, and rheum comes to them in the mornings, and they cannot look at the light of the sun because tears hurry to their eyes; and because of this they constantly lie on their faces, and sleep like that, and their eyelids under their eyebrows are moist, which the swelling and appearance have covered with the exinach that appears in the eye. And when you press the place with your fingers and feel the exinach between them.	Hydatid is fat which arises in the folds of the upper lid. It is a disease chiefly occurring in children, irritating their eyes, giving them morning catarrh; they are unable to look full into the light of the sun, since they get an immediate secretion of tears. And for that reason you will find them lying always on their faces, and they also sleep on their faces; and the eyelids below the eyebrows are moist and covered with swellings, while the hydatid stands out prominently; and when you press upon the place with your finger you can feel the fat beneath it.	0.86636794
