and it is easy for boys to recover from them until they reach fourteen years of age, and it is difficult in old men, and as for young men, it is intermediate between that, and the one whose stones are larger, his treatment is easier, and the small ones are the opposite of that,	The cure of boys under the age of fourteen years is easy; but the treatment of old people is difficult; and that of young men midway between the two. And the larger the stone the easier the cure; with a small stone the cure is otherwise.	0.8676
Then you take the lancet, which is this image: And you incise between the anus and the testicles, not in the middle, but to the side of the left buttock, and the incision should be on the stone itself, with your finger in the anus, and you press it outwards, obliquely, so that the incision is wide from the outside and narrow from the inside, just enough for the stone to come out, not bigger, for perhaps the finger that is in the anus presses the stone at the incision, so it comes out without difficulty.	Then do you take a lancet like this and make your incision in the space between the anus and the testicles, not in the mid-line but on the side of the left buttock; and cut down upon the calculus itself, keeping your finger in the anus and pressing it outwards. The incision should be oblique, wide externally and narrowing inwards down to dimensions allowing the exit of the stone, not larger. Now you may press with the finger that is in the anus upon the stone as you make the incision, and it comes out without difficulty.	0.9153969
And know that some stones have angles and edges, so their exit is difficult for that reason, and some are smooth, resembling acorns, and rounded, so their exit is easy.	You should know that sometimes there are stones which have angles and edges, on which account their extraction is difficult. Some are smooth like acorns and rounded, and these come out easily.	0.8644077
So what has angles and edges, you increase the incision a little, and if it does not come out like this, then you should contrive against it, either by grasping it with a tight forceps, the tip of which is like a file, so that it grips the stone and it does not escape from it, or by inserting a fine instrument with a hooked tip under it.	But in those cases where the stone is rough and angular you should slightly increase the incision. Then if it still will not come out you must then resort to a deviceâ€” namely to catch hold of it with strong forceps having an extremity like a rasp, to get a tight hold of it so it shall not slip out; or else introduce beneath it a narrow instrument with a crooked end.	0.824002
If you cannot manage it, then widen the incision a little, and if some blood overcomes you, stop it with alum.	And if you then cannot get the stone out, widen the incision slightly; and if there is any bleeding stanch it with vitriol.	0.7366868
If there is more than one, then first push the large one to the mouth of the bladder, then incise on it, then push the small one after that, and likewise, you do if there are more than two.	If there should be a number of stones first push the largest of them into the neck of the bladder, then cut down upon it; then push a smaller one down after it; and do the same if there be more than two.	0.856967
If it is very large, then it is ignorance to make a large incision on it, because it exposes the patient to one of two things: either he dies, or he has constant dribbling of urine, because the place does not heal at all, but try to push it until it comes out, or contrive to break it with hooks until you bring it out in pieces.	But if the stone be very large it is foolish to make a great incision down upon it; for the result is that the patient either dies or has a chronic urinary fistula because the place will not heal at all. Try rather to manipulate it so that it protrudes; or else attempt to break it up with the forceps so that you can extract it piecemeal.	0.76981276
So when you finish your work, pack the wound with frankincense, aloe, and costus, and tighten it, and put over it rags soaked in oil and syrup or rose oil and cold water to soothe the hot swelling, then the patient lies on his back, and do not loosen the bandage until the third day, and when it is loosened, wash the area with plenty of water and oil, then treat it with the palm ointment and the basilicon ointment until it heals.	And when you have completed the operation pack the wound with frankincense and aloes and dragon's blood, and bind it up and apply a pad soaked in olive oil and wine or oil of roses and cold water, to reduce the swelling. The patient should lie flat on his back and the bindings should not be undone before the third day; and when they are undone foment the place with plenty of oil and water. Then dress it with Palm ointment and basilicon ointment until it heals.	0.9050323
If an excessive hot swelling and erosion or the like occurs in the wound, such as blood clotting in the bladder and urine being prevented from it, and this is known by the exit of blood with the urine, then insert your finger in the wound and remove that blood, for if it remains, it leads to corruption and putrefaction of the bladder.	If an increasing and cankerous abscess occur in the wound, or anything similar such as clotting of blood within the bladder, with stoppage of the urine (which would be signified by the urine being accompanied by blood) pass your finger into the wound and remove the blood; for if it lies in it it will lead to sepsis and necrosis of the bladder.	0.8607669
Then wash the wound with vinegar, water, and salt, and address each type with its corresponding treatment until it heals.	Then wash out the wound with vinegar and water and salt, and apply whatever treatment is suitable for the case until it heals.	0.9148921
It is necessary during all treatment times to tie the thighs and bring them together to stabilize the medicines that are placed on the area.	Also at all times during treatment his hips should be bound and kept together so that the medicaments applied to the place may not be disturbed.	0.7741503
If the stone is small and it goes into the urethra and gets stuck in it, and urine is prevented from exiting, then treat it with what I am describing before it reaches the incision, for I have often dispensed with the incision with this treatment, and I have tried it, which is that you take a branched instrument of steel, this is its form:	Now if the calculus be small and be impacted in the opening of the urinary passage, preventing the exit of the urine, treat it with the means I am about to describe before you go on to make your incision, for often I have found this treatment suffice without incision; I have experience of this. You take a drill of the finest steel, of this shape.	0.8355312
Triangular-tipped, sharp, and embedded in a stick.	It should be triangular at the point and sharp, with a wooden handle.	0.5632923
Then you take a thread and tie the penis with it below the stone so that it does not return to the bladder.	Then take a thread and with it bind the penis beneath the calculus to prevent the stone from returning to the bladder.	0.90673643
Then you gently insert the forked instrument into the urethra until the fork reaches the stone itself, and you turn the fork with your hand on the stone little by little while you intend to pierce it until you penetrate it from the other side, then the urine will flow immediately.	Then introduce the iron of the drill gently into the meatus until the drill reaches the stone itself, and then very very gently revolve the drill upon the stone with your hand, and try to perforate it, till you pierce it through to the other side. Then the urine will at once be released.	0.8761623
Then you squeeze your hand over what remains of the stone from outside the penis, for it will crumble and come out with the urine, and the patient will recover.	Then, with your hand outside the penis, squeeze the remains of the stone, and they will crumble and be washed out by the urine and the patient will be cured.	0.8932356
If this treatment is not feasible for you due to an obstacle preventing you from doing so, then tie a thread below the stone and another thread above the stone, then cut on the stone in the penis itself between the two ties, then remove it, then untie the tie and clean the clotted blood that has formed in the wound.	But if this treatment is not possible for you on account of some impediment, then tie a thread beneath the stone and another above; then make an incision down upon the stone in the penis itself between the two ligatures, extract it, then undo the ligature and clean away the blood that has clotted in the wound.	0.9230031
It is necessary to tie the thread below the stone so that it does not return to the bladder, and the other tie from above so that when the thread is loosened after the removal of the stone, the skin returns to its place and covers the wound.	The purpose of the ligature beneath the stone is lest it return to the bladder; and the purpose of the one above it is that when you loosen the ligature after removing the stone the skin may fall back into place so as to cover the wound.	0.82066464
Therefore, it is advisable for you, if you tie the upper thread, to lift the skin upwards so that it returns when you are finished and covers the wound as we have said.	On this account, when you tie the upper ligature, you will have to raise the skin so that when you have finished operating it may go back and cover the wound as we have said.	0.77685523
