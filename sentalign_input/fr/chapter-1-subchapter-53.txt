Of the corns that come on the feet
Many times it happens that on the upper side of the feet a disease arises which is called "clos" according to our understanding, and it is a large callous thing that hurts the foot. And the cautery for this disease is in two ways. These are cautery with fire, and cautery with hot water. Fire cautery is when you heat a pointed cautery like a quill pen, made of good iron to the measure that it can surround the callus on all sides, with subtle edges; then place it very hot on the callus, and turn your hand all around the callus until it comes to the root of the callus; and leave it like this for three days until it starts to discharge pus; then make a plaster of wild mallows ground with salt, and leave the plaster on all night, and the callus will fall and be uprooted from its roots. Then treat the area with an ointment that generates flesh until it is healed.
And if they are on the upper part of the body, and this often happens on hands and feet, then it is necessary to administer hot water cautery; and it is in this way: take a tube of brass or iron, or a quill pen, and place it on the callus and the wart, which is called porrelz verrues; place the tube so that it surrounds it all around, then put a little hot water in it, and hold your hand well, and press your hand while turning so that the edge of the tube reaches the root of the callus, and the hot water can find a deep path to the root; and the patient should endure the biting of the hot water for an hour; then leave it like this, and it will uproot itself completely with all its roots. Do this one after another until you have uprooted all those on the body, then treat them with ointments that generate flesh.
